   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course if it is taken as either a larger lecture or as a really small seminar. We had an awkward number of students that was too small to be a good lecture course but too large to be good for a seminar.",
    "Span 300 is a seminar through which you read Don Quijote in its entirety along with supporting literature. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is super interesting and you get to read one of the great novels of all time with a professor who is passionate about the topic and knows a lot about the book.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. You read Don Quixote over the course of a semester. In DS, they read it over two weeks. It allows you to actually get something out of the text. It improved my literary analysis.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! You will love Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria. If you want to get a better understanding of why the Quixote is the best book ever, TAKE THIS CLASS! He is so awesome and also occasionally tells stories from his life which is amazing. Do it!!!",
    "I absolutely loved this class! As a STEM major, I expected to feel a tad out of my depths, given that both graduate and undergraduate students take the course; however, that was not the case. Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is extremely entertaining, and if you go to office hours you will find him to be rather friendly as well. He truly is an expert on the Quijote (as well as on life in general) and only wishes to share his appreciation with his students. As an undergraduate you had to do two 5 minute presentations, two 8-10 page papers, and a few minor assignments. Some weeks were more reading heavy than others, but in general I would say the course load was reasonable especially given how rewarding the class was. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone!",
    "Take if you like Don Quixote.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 300 for anyone remotely interested in the Quijote. The reading is not as heavy as it may seem, and DQ is such a marvelous piece of literature that everyone should be familiar with.",
    "If you are interested in this course but skeptical about it, I would say just take it. Don Quixote is a masterpiece and this was the best way to read it."
