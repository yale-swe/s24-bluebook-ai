    "This was an AMAZING class. A must take for any student. The class asks fundamental questions about the human condition considering the work of ancient philosophers alongside empirical studies. I gained a lot of insight about myself and the world, and certainly walked away excited to ask more questions.",
    "If you're thinking about taking it, take it.",
    "Sure, the only philosophy course that I took at Yale --- gave me an excellent overview of philosophy, I will most definitely continue to read other works in philosophy.",
    "Interesting blend of psych and phil, but sometimes they could have meshed better. Not too much work though",
    "This is definitely a class that you come out with a smile every time. The lectures are amazingly well organized, and the professor is so engaging and clear. The professor also made sure that the workload would be fun and not overly burdensome. I never thought I could enjoy philosophy, but obviously I was wrong. I absolutely loved this class. You'll be missing out on so much if you don't take this class.",
    "I would recommend it as a class that provides some interesting philosophical questions, informed by some psychological findings. I would not recommend the class if you are interested in learning in depth about any particular philosophical or psychological phenomena.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. I knew nothing about philosophy coming in, and I felt that this class was a great introduction. I'm a psychology major, so I enjoyed the overlap between philosophy and psychology that Professor Gendler presented. The readings are interesting and the work is manageable. Professor Gendler sets up the grading to work to your advantage--her main priority is for you to learn something and engage with the material, so she sets up the class in a manner in which it's almost impossible to stress about grades. Professor Gendler is excellent--my favorite professor I've had at Yale so far. She is a kind, helpful, understanding, intelligent, and entertaining woman. I would highly, highly recommend this class to anyone.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!This is one of those classes that every Yalie should take. I think Tamar did such a phenomenal job with it last year as a seminar that they opened it up for the first time this year to be a lecture course, in order to satisfy demand.The materials is fascinating, relevant, and well put-together. The professor, though, is what really rounds it out: Tamar is probably the most organized and reasonable teacher out there, and her lectures were always engaging. Also, in her office hours, she is an incredibly warm, welcoming, presence who is always eager to help students learn.Work load is reasonable, with very very clear expectations that you will learn to love and ask, \"Why do the rest of my professors not do this too?\"",
    "Amazing intro philosophy course. broad survey of a lot of amazing topics and philosophical works, and very cool the way that psychology research is intertwined. really phenomenal. DO TAKE IT.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I hate philosophy typically (am an econ major) but this course was the best I've taken at Yale. Gendler is awesome. You won't be disappointed!",
    "Yes, it's a great introductory philosophy course and Professor Gendler is very passionate about the material.",
    "This is a neat class, a kind of applied philosophy. Not really a gut, since you do need to develop a decent reading of Plato, Epictetus, Mill, Rawls, Nozick, and a few other thinkers. Not a hard class either, since you can largely get away with doing your favorite subset of the readings and focusing on those. That said, many of the readings are really excellent, and you can draw much real-life inspiration from them.",
    "Great class! I took this class with a lot of psychology background and no philosophy experience. It was a great introduction to philosophy, and the review of psych\/cogsci was not too repetitive of things I already knew. Not a small amount of work, with weekly exercises, two papers, and a final, but also not too hard.",
    "Looks at ancient philosophical questions and connects them to modern cognitive science. Definitely take it if you want something fun and interesting, but beware--some of the readings can get dry.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. Gave a broad, but effective overview of most important figures in philosophy. Definitely would recommend. Reading is relatively light, papers are short and weekly assignments are manageable.",
    "such a cool class.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would not recommend this to a philosophy or cog sci major - its just too watered down. If interested in the subject matter, but don't plan on majoring in anything close to philosophy then I guess you could take it. You might just be better off reading the material (which is itself pretty good) on your own time.",
    "The class was really good at tying together so many different disciplines in a very cohesive way. As I was studying for the final, I could see just how much I had learned and it all came together and it was glorious. The class was very accessible to understand as someone who had never taken a philosophy, psychology, or cog sci course of any kind, although there were some concepts or nuances of concepts that I know went over my head. There was so much writing, but that complaint is probably just related to my preference for numbers and problem sets! Tamar Gendler is very knowledgeable and the course is very organized; take it if you can.",
    "Really loved this class - Professor Gendler clearly knows her stuff and she is doing really interesting research on the topic!",
    "YES!!! A must take. One of the best lecture courses I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "YES! This was a great experience during freshman year. Although Professor Gender covers the works in a fairly superficial manner, it is still a great humanities base. Highly recommended!",
    "Take it because it's very organized and Gendler is a good lecturer. Yes, it is an easy class but I wouldn't call it a gut since the material is actually useful and interesting. I felt like it should have been harder because it would have pushed me more to try my best and walk away with a lot of philosophy and cog sci under my belt.",
    "This is a great class. Very interesting, not too much work. Take it",
    "Philosophy and Science of Human Nature is an intriguing, interdisciplinary course that encompasses philosophy, behavioral economics, psychology, and political philosophy. It is made for students of all philosophical and cognitive science backgrounds. The material will constantly keep you engaged and excited for lecture.",
    "BEST CLASS AT YALE! TAKE IT!!!Particularly if you care about big questions in life like how to be happy and flourish, how to be moral, how society should be structured.Tamar makes everything so accessible!",
    "Yes, this class is a true gem. Hopefully it will be offered in the future so others can take advantage of it!",
    "Great introduction to philosophy, relates philosophy to cog sci in a very interesting way. Favorite class at yale so far. Lecturers are interesting and Prof. Gendler is always very well-prepared. Consistent workload but not too much overall. Readings not long and assignments get interesting.",
    "Take this class, it's a real joy to have a professor like Tamar Gendler who clearly cares so much about and puts so much thought and energy into her teaching. It's a nice combination of and introduction to both philosophy and Cog Sci, so even if it's not a subject you're particularly interested in, it's all incredibly useful and interesting information. It's one of those classes that ties together things you're learning or doing in other aspects of your life, so it feels like a very applicable kind of learning.",
    "Yes, if you want an easy but solid introduction to philosophy and how that relates to modern day psychology and cognitive science. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is very interested in philosophy or has done DS.",
    "DEFINITELY! You won't regret it.",
    "Take it! Unless you are a philosophy major or have taken DS. Then you'll probably be bored and frustrated.",
    "This class used to be called Life Lessons. It definitely continues to live up to its former name - I took away a practical lesson to apply to my life from every class. I would definitely recommend this course, either as an easy introduction to most philosophical theory, or as a nice interdisciplinary one. The grading is fairly easy - three short essays of under 2000 words each - the reading isn't bad at all, and the final exam is based on a study guide posted almost a full week before the exam is due to take place. DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY!",
    "If you are a Freshman this is an excellent course. If you take it later in college about a third or half will be repetitive if you've done any psych or ethics, but the stuff you read about moral cognition, moral heuristics, etc, is REALLY interesting. I'd recommend it on that basis alone.",
    "Take this class if you want an introduction to either philosophy or cognitive science. It's very student friendly.",
    "SUCH A GOOD CLASS. Take it.",
    "This course was very well taught, but it attempted to touch upon to diverse an assortment of fields to leave the student with any worthwhile knowledge of the material. If the student is taking this class because they love to hear the names of important concepts and people, and a handful of their major ideas, then this is a class designed with him in mind.",
    "General theme of the course: Broad overview, not indepth enough.Although this class is listed as both a philosophy and cognitive science class, I really found the \"cog sci\" part of the course lacking. We do read and briefly discuss several interesting psych studies and cog sci studies that use fMRI and legit science, but we never go in depth in them. In fact, we NEVER talked about them once in section.I would recommend this class to students with hesitation. By no means was it absolutely horrible, but I feel like there are many better classes you could choose from (even if you're just looking for a \"easy\" class). Furthermore, I had a HORRIBLE time during section. Many students were major \"section---\" that made the class really unpleasant.The lecture itself are fine. They're interesting enough. Personally I feel like Prof. Gendler speaks in a very roundabout manner, which makes it slightly annoying.The readings are also not the best depending on the day. However, I feel that the readings will be adjusted for future years.",
    "If you are interested in learning about how to live your best possible life, take this class, but be aware it will take discipline to really get anything out of it.",
    "Take the course. It is great how much this course and other cog sci courses can open up your mind to understanding human behavior in ways that make scary sense and can actually be applied to daily life.",
    "Recommend, but with reservations. This course is the most broad of surveys, which carries with it the caveats of superficiality but also the benefit of contemporary applications for the philosophical elements.Lots of readings, but interesting and manageable. Also weekly assignments, each taking an hour or two at most.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this class. It ended up be pretty laid back, because the professor is very kind and somewhat lenient. Gendler's a wonderful professor, engaging in her lectures. The final review packet gives you the exact questions on the final, which was pretty easy. The material covered in class, I thought, was interesting in the beginning of class but by the time we got to Trolley Problems and spent forever discussing all the different variations I couldn't help but feel a little bored. I guess I thought the material would have more of a cogsci\/psych feel than philosophy. The material was also just spread so thin - which can be good (less reading) or bad (don't feel you have a firm grasp over it). It's an okay class, but if I could do this semester over again I don't know if I would spend a credit on this one.",
    "Excellent class, not too work heavy, but you must keep up with the material. A bit of overlap with some intro psych or cogsci classes, but the considerable philosophy content of the course makes it worth it.",
    "It's a great course, suitable for those who have no philosophy background. It covers various issues--from the composition of soul to moral philosophy to political philosophy, while combining those with psychologic&empirical findings--and this is a good starting point if you are interested in philosophy or psychology. Professor Gendler is amazing (you probably can't find any professor who is just as nice, dedicated and caring about students), and so was the TA Justin Khoo. I loved this course. Take it. Take it, really.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in an entry level CogSci or Philosophy program. The lectures are pretty good, the material is very interesting, and the courseload is not bad at all. Professor Gendler is very conscious of student's concerns, and it will definitely be one of your favorite classes.",
    "Take it! Will make you think differently about yourself and what it means to take an interdisciplinary approach to learning...",
    "I would summarize it as my favorite class, and compel anyone who asks to take it. Professor Gendler is fantastic. There is endless work to be done, but you can also get away with doing very little (i.e. not the reading). It's perfect for Yale students of all interests.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS YOU WILL EVER TAKE AT YALE. It's amazing - Tamar Gendler is an incredible professor - her lectures are engaging, she makes the material fun (although the material is already fun), and she's very helpful at office hours so make sure you stop by there at least once or twice. It's SO interesting to read old philosophers' ideas and then see what modern research in psychology and cognitive science is doing to possiblyprove them right or wrong. If you are at all interested in psych, cog sci, philosophy, or life in general, or even if you're not, I HIGHLY recommend this class. I promise you won't regret taking it. The final was pretty easy and the reading is so interesting that I promise you'll want to do it even when it's long.",
    "If you're looking for a broad survey course to introduce you to philosophy, but worry that philosophy might be impractical, this is the course for you. You'll get a taste of the classic authors while seeing how they connect to modern-day thinking and research.",
    "This course provides a great breath of philosophical knowledge and psychological history that can prove useful in future pursuits of cognitive science and philosophy.I wholeheartedly recommend this course to all interested students with the caveat that if you're already well versed in both philosophy and psychology, this class may be too easy for you.",
    "Best class at Yale.",
    "Yes!",
    "It's an interesting Cog Sci class, that could be good if you are interested in the more psychological side of philosophy. All the readings can be found in other classes (like MoFoPo and Intro to PoliPhil) but this can be helpful if you're looking for re-enforcement of concepts you've discussed before.",
    "It's an introductory philosophy class. Take it to see if you are interested in the subject at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the human experience, be it from a philosophical perspective or a more science-based, cognitive science angle.",
    "Philosophy and Science of Human Nature was my favorite course this semester - the readings taught me so much about myself and about the way humans function, and the lectures were enjoyable and never a bore. Tamar Gendler is a wonderful woman and I learned so much from her and from her sophisticated teaching style. I'd absolutely recommend this course!",
    "If you want to graduate from Yale while having taken at least one philosophy course, this is a great choice! I'm glad I did.",
    "This class is great! Take it!",
    "PHIL 181 is not only a class on the Western philosophical and psychological tradition, but also a class on how to teach a perfect class. Dr. Gendler is one of the greatest instructors I've had in my life, almost to a fault, as she gives students ample chances, guidance, and warnings with respect to their assignments. The class is, in many ways, a synthesis of Directed Studies and Intro Psych, with a little behavioral economics mixed in. It has allowed me to truly immerse myself in and appreciate the Western tradition without too intense a time commitment. I highly, highly recommend this class for all students.",
    "If you've taken more than a basic course in philosophy, the philosophy coursework will probably be boring, but if you're interested in how philosophy can relate to relevant scientific research, this is a great class to take.",
    "I thought the premise of this course was fantastic--an interdisciplinary approach to philosophy, imbued with knowledge from contemporary work in psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience. This was a great way for someone like me, who isn't a hardcore philosophy person, to get exposure to some of the major philosophers.The structure of the class was also great--three units, and several topics within each, usually introducing the philosopher first, and then complementing those readings with modern ones. The workload was pretty fair with weekly assignments, two papers (with a choice of when to submit them) and a straightforward final exam.There's a lot of reading though...taking this as a fifth class, I simply couldn't handle all of it. And lectures sometimes fell a bit...well, flat, despite the overall great premise behind this class. Professor Gendler is incredibly organized though and clearly, incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject but don't have much experience in it (especially philosophy). I think the philosophy majors\/former DS'ers found the philosophy parts really easy. Having said that, the papers are NOT EASY. The TF's (at least mine) are really thorough, picky and tough graders for the papers. The directed exercises, on the other hand, are fun and not overly hard to get a good grade on. A great class, overall. Gendler is as good, caring, and interesting professor as any out there.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a basic outline of ethics and political philosophy. Some of the psychology readings are dense but the philosophy readings are very rewarding. Gendlerdefinitely wants everyone to get an a, so grading is very light. Make sure you shop around for a good TA!",
    "This class is terrific and probably my favorite class at Yale so far. If you like philosophy and psych\/cog sci and haven't taken any courses in those areas yet, this will be great. Professor Gendler is a great lecturer, who is very entertaining. I would suggest looking at this course on open Yale courses to see how she is. I was familiar with some of the material in the course, particularly in the political philosophy part, although I hadn't read the actual writings of, say, Kant, Mills, Rawls, and Nozick. The class was not a lot of work, and lectures tended to go over the readings. Still, the class covered a considerable amount of material, and I feel that I got a lot out of the class.",
    "Very interesting course that covers a wide range of material. Not too much reading or anything. If you (for the most part) do the readings, attend class, and go to section, you'll do well. Tamar Gendler is intelligent and engaging. Her lectures are always quite interesting. One of the best courses I took my freshman year. Definitely recommended.",
    "It was a very good but very basic overview of philosophy with some cogsci woven in. I'd recommend it if you want to touch on these topics, but if youve taken intro cogsci or intro psych plus any basic philosophy class, you've probably covered all of this.",
    "Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature is a well-organized overview of the \"big ideas\" of philosophy and how they connect to contemporary psychology and cognitive science. I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is looking to gain knowledge in how to think about human beings, society, and personal happiness. If you're looking for an in-depth class, this is not it. It doesn't require much work at all and is easy to glide by without doing much of the reading, though if you do the reading it will add much to your education.",
    "The class was good, but I felt it was somewhat disorganized when it came to what material the professor wanted to present or focus on, since it was her first time teaching the course. Reading isn't too heavy, and the assignments are straightforward.",
    "This course provides a wonderful introduction to western philosophy while pairing the material with pertinent texts from modern philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. I would highly recommend it to other students because of its engaging subject matter (which I think is applicable in many fields and should be part of any student's body of knowledge), the creativity of assignments, and its wonderful lectures.",
    "This is a great class. Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! The readings are amazing and will really challenge the way that you think about information across disciplines. While the lectures can sometimes repeat most of the readings, and occasionally the readings are long, Professor Gendler is receptive to feedback and I'm sure these problems will be fixed in successive courses.",
    "A fabulous course that introduces the basics of cog sci, philosophy, and psychology as a cohesive unit. Professor Gendler puts a tremendous amount into this course, and it really shows. A must take!",
    "Really easy class with little work. The readings are interesting and Gendler is really great, but the lectures can be boring because she talks slowly.",
    "Fantastic course. Great intro to philosophy but not too elementary for someone with previous experience. Gentler is amazing-so clear, articulate, well organized and responsive. Shop it!",
    "Good class that was too ambitious but a class that I ultimately learnt a lot (as a person with no philosophy background) DS-ers in the class, stop laughing us. We all got to start some where.",
    "If you are looking to do philosophy in a one off, this is probably the way to go, but if you are interested in greater nuance, you're better served by a more topical course.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to any student!",
    "This class is a good introduction to philosophy with many connections to how it applies to the real world (through psychology\/cognitive science). If you're interested in the subject, take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY 100% TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the best class I have taken so far at Yale.Someone described it as \"an intellectual goody-bag\" and that is the perfect way to describe it. You read philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and all of the readings relate to each other. You'll read Plato's Republic and then compare it with a psych study published in 2008; it's unreal. It's an excellent introduction to philosophy if you have never taken any before, but even a senior philosophy major will enjoy it because you study some of the most famous ancient philosophers in the context of contemporary cog sci and psych.Lectures are really fun to go to, section is not bad at all (mine was pretty fun). The workload is really manageable; you have an exercise per week and have to write 2 out of 3 papers and take a final exam (which is actually fun to study for because the readings are amazing).PROFESSOR GENDLER IS A GODDESS. Take the class, and do yourself a favor and do the readings. You really will get so much out of it if you do. INCREDIBLE.",
    "Waste of time unless you're a freshman who has never taken a philosophy course before.I made the mistake of taking it as a junior and was bored to death. I had taken Kagan's Ethics and MoFoPo but decided to hop in anyway because I thought that the Cog Sci part of the course would make it interesting and different enough to be worthwhile. Totally wrong though. While some of the Cog Sci readings were interesting, don't take it if you're turned off by the idea of sitting through yet another section discussing \"what is utilitarianism?\"Also, Prof. Gendler puts you through weekly mini-assignments that make it feel like you're taking a high school course again. Just frustrating.",
    "definitely! im planning on reading the rest of some of the assigned books (beyond what was assigned) on my own time. i learned things relevant to a large range of disciplines",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Really interesting, minimal work",
    "A class that convinced me that I made the right decision by choosing to come to Yale even though I knew that I wanted to study engineering. It's fun, engaging and can even serve as a self-help course due to the nature of the texts covered. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone and especially to science majors that have to be careful with how they choose their humanities course since they won't get to take that many of them.",
    "I would gladly recommend this class to any student. The work is extremely manageable and actually pertains to the class. The essays are also very doable, and the section is useful and entertaining.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. This was my favorite class this semester, and probably my favorite class that I've taken so far. The things you learn in this class, particularly in the human flourishing section of the class, are applicable to your own life (this class used to be taught as a seminar called \"Life Lessons\"). All the topics we discussed really get you thinking, and I often found myself in discussions about the topics we were learning with friends who weren't taking this class. I would recommend this class to everyone. Tamar Gendler is the best professor I've had at Yale--she's super funny and nice and a really good lecturer. She really cares about us learning and has structured this class so that learning is the focus, not grades.",
    "Philosophy 181 was a good overview of some of the themes of Western Philosophy, but the way in which it was taught could be greatly improved. I'm not sure I would recommend it. The material is very interesting if you can see through all the obfuscation caused by over simplification, but I was often very frustrated by the patronizing way in which the material was taught.",
    "Professor Gendler is the most dedicated professor I've ever met in terms of caring about students' needs. For a large lecture class like this, she really does a fantastic job, along with the lovely TFs, to create engaging environment for every student. if you are interested in the material of this class and is not looking for a class that you only need to write a final paper, I will highly recommend this class.However, there are things that you should be aware of:1. TFs are not born the same. I guess it is true for many humanity courses that different TFs have different taste and grading preferences. For this class, almost all your grades were on your TF's hand.2. Assignments, exams are all easy - by which I mean almost everyone who is serious about this class get 100% or close. Therefore, the only distinguishing factor for this class became the two 1000-word essays. If you are not good at writing a philosophy essay or never took a philosophy class before like me, be aware that there are many philosophy majors taking this class - this fact affects your essay grades and hence your overall course grade.",
    "Great intro to philosophy!! Probably too simple if you have already know a fair amount about philosophy or have taken a course in philosophy. Truly an introductory course, but a great one!",
    "Highly recommended. esp if you have no philosophy background. this is a great survey course.",
    "A fun lecture course that makes for a good intro to philosophy. Also fun to take if you are going to be a cog sci, poli sci, ep&e, or econ major. The work load isn't too hard, and the material is fascinating.",
    "It was incredible. I've never taken a philosophy course before, and it was a great introduction to philosophy, which I now realize that I love. The structure of the class, \"dead guys on tuesdays, cog sci on thursdays\" made everything that we were learning seem to connect to each other in some way. I found that studying for the final even was one of the most fulfilling parts of my academic semester.",
    "This course is a great opportunity for students to learn about both ancient philosophical works and current psychological studies. The work load is not challenging and as a result, students are able to further pursue topics which they find particularly interesting. However, in order to succeed in the course, it is important for students (especially those who do not have much experience with other philosophy courses) to dedicate time to the course's two papers and final exam by consulting TF's and Professor Gendler during office hours, regularly attending section, etc. Because the work load is not burdensome, it is easy for students to put off readings, etc., which impacts their ability to fully engage with the material.",
    "I would strongly, strongly recommend this course to everybody. No matter what major\/interests you have. This is really an introductory course intended for people who no background in philosophy or cognitive science. After taking the course you really do feel learning a lot from it. Prof. Gendler is without question THE BEST professor I have had (or will ever have perhaps!) at Yale. She is so nice and responsible, and her teaching style were so lively, effective, and engaging.Take it!!",
    "An excellent class that I would recommend to anyone. Don't be afraid if you don't know the first thing about philosophy--you'll be brought up to speed. If you already know a ton of philosophy you should look at the reading list (my guess is that you'll be familiar with the majority of the philosophical readings). But no matter what, this class will give you the opportunity to think about philosophy from some new and interesting perspectives. I also think this is a great course for a philosophy newbie because it doesn't seem hopelessly abstract--it grounds some of philosophy's great ideas in reality. I think the course makes some really fascinating connections between philosophy and other fields, and I found myself thinking about the course material outside of class. Also, the course is structured so that you put a moderate amount of work into it but you still get a LOT out of it. Highly recommended.",
    "This class is a great intro to both philosophy and psychology. Gendler is a great lecturer and is really clear--the lecture slides are also online. The only problem is there are a lot of small assignments that are hard to keep track of, which is kind of a pain. but as long as you keep track of them, the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "Highly recommended. You are cheating yourself if you do not take this class!",
    "I wouldn't recommend because sections can get kinda douchy, but if people are really into the subject, then it's a great way to get more in touch with the material",
    "This course was amazing. It brings a really interesting perspective to the issues discussed. Professor Gendler is a wonderful professor.",
    "GREAT course. I loved the first half - the second half was a little less about cogsci and the brain (which is what I found most interesting) and more about moral philosophy, which it turns out I don't like that much. Either way though, the class was great - take it if you want an easy to understand introduction to both philosophy and cog sci!",
    "This course was really interesting, and the workload was completely doable. Lectures were always engaging; Professor Gendler is an amazing lecturer and her powerpoint presentations were humorous as well. One weakness, though: my section was dominated by a few students, and I found it difficult\/uncomfortable to participate in class. I think if I had enjoyed and participated my section more, I would have gained more from the course.",
    "take the class if only for the readings--they are absolutely fascinating",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are at all interested in philosophy, it was amazing."
