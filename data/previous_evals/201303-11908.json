    "Definitely.",
    "This class is a must if you are interested in graphic design. Just don't put off the work--you will embarrass yourself during critique.",
    "Type I is a fantastic class, and I'd absolutely recommend it. All of the assignments are very challenging and very fun, and they really pushed me to think carefully. Projects range from the \"traditional\" (ie typesetting for books) to the more interpretive (ie posters for various purposes). Dealing with type is definitely difficult and requires a lot of creativity and revision, so the crits and Alice's advice were always extremely welcome and appreciated.Alice was a fantastic professor -- so kind and so willing to help. She often stayed after class to talk with us, or would offer to review assignments over email. Crits with her were extremely productive rather than critical, and she always had great, concrete advice on how to improve our work. Our TA was also great, and he offered a lot of extremely helpful advice as well.The course is definitely a lot of work in that it requires many revisions. But I always looked forward to working on Type, as it is very enjoyable and extremely rewarding.",
    "Great if you want to learn about the different typefaces you use every day and the fundamental of typeface design. You will not look at type the same again. Not recommended if you are looking for a more hands on or experimental art course.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone interested in graphic design.",
    "Typography I was a fantastic course, taught by a fantastic professor and TA. We had a number of very interesting projects that made me think of typography and design in a different way. We learned about typefaces - different typefaces, their anatomy, styles and families, and the historical associations of each - and that introduction will be an invaluable foundation for everything else I'll do in the future in terms of design. I also learned to appreciate graphic design and book design as craft, and developed an appreciation for material and the physicality of the page and book. Definitely take this course if you're interested in graphic design; take it even if you're not!",
    "Very good class, but don't take if you're not into graphic design and typography because you need to put in a fair amount of work. if you're not passionate about it, it would be pretty dull."
