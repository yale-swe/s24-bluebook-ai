   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot about music and the history of music in a relatively short time. Perfect for someone like me who came in knowing virtually nothing about the subject, though as with so many survey classes, it remains to be seen what I'll remember and what I'll lose. The class's biggest downside was the professor's thinking we students would uniformly enjoy listening to pop music, as when he added an unsyllabused assignment on \"Call Me Maybe,\" which is annoying if you happen to agree with Plato (and you really should, the point is so obvious) that excessive listening to stupid, immoral music will shape your soul to be stupider and more immoral.",
    "Yes it's great.",
    "yes",
    "If you don't like history, you will not like this class. It's almost entirely music history. I went into it thinking I would gain a greater appreciation for music (since the course is called LISTENING to music), but I came out of the class so happy because it was over.",
    "This class teaches you about the western canon of classical music. It is a terrific class, one that really could be a required course at Yale college. It is made up ofmostly non-music majors who at one time played an instrument or listened to classical music. Great class, a pleasure to do the homework, and I guarantee you'll have bought a surprising amount of classical music on iTunes by the end of this course. Definitely take this.",
    "Do not expect this course to be easy if you have very limited musical experience. Doing well in this class often depends on how much musical experience you've had or how quickly you can pick it up. For example, the class very quickly skims over basic music terminology in about a week's time, and the professor uses these terms repeatedly for the rest of the course. For musicians and those who have a lot of experience playing music, words like major, minor, diminished, augmented, tonic, dominant, syncopation, arpeggio, and tremolo come naturally. For everyone else, be ready to study terms like these enough so that they become natural.",
    "Great course with a great professor. A little rough at first if you don't know much about music, but if you put in the effort, it should be a relatively easy course that will definitely give you a greater appreciation of music.",
    "Take it! You learn a ton and appreciate classical music!",
    "A good class even if you don't have any prior experience in music. I looked forward to going to lecture. Definitely take this class at some point during your time at Yale.",
    "Great course to take! Professor Wright gives very interesting lectures through the major periods of music, and most of class is spent listening to the music. Definitely was a highlight of my semester, and has made me appreciate music a lot more. Take it! Just make sure to keep up with the listening exercises and readings, which aren't much at all.",
    "Not too much work. The professor is good but kind of loony. Grading is 25% listening exercises (very easy), 15% midterm exam, 20% final exam, 10% YSO concert review, 15% final paper and 15% section attendance\/class participation. Only negative evaluation is that my TA, some hag called Esther, was a total beeee and probably still is. Looks like a troll and talks like one too.",
    "It's a very nice introduction to music history and basic listening comprehension. Although I wish it had been a little more thorough at times, it's still a very fun and easy class to be in, and I gained a lot from it.",
    "Great class for beginners - this is really useful information in life and it gives you enough knowledge to talk about music intelligibly at some point in the future. Plus the homework of literally listening to music is great.",
    "Do it. It was enlightening and I enjoyed this class very much. I didn't have a musical background before taking this class, and this class was a bit of a history of Western Music starting at the Middle Ages. If you keep up with the course work in a timely fashion, this class should be no trouble at all. The tests (mid-term and final) are fair and relatively easy if you do the work and put a little effort into the class. Lectures can be hard to pay attention to at times, but that's true for most classes. Overall, it's a good class and looking back, I'm very glad that I took it.",
    "I learned SO much in this course about music and everything, and it's great! You explore such amazing composers and learn to draw on things in common among them. I truly think that this is a course that every yalie should take before graduating.But this is actually a challenging course, you have to work in this course. I studied the most out of any final exams for the music final. If you get behind in this class you will not do well.",
    "This class is a good introductory music course and a good summary of Western musical canon. It's probably best to come into the class with at least a basic knowledge of the subject, but you're never required to read music. Professor Wright is knowledgeable and approachable, although he sometimes goes off on tangents in lectures and, more importantly, during the final exam. The class is not as easy as it sounds, but it's not incredibly challenging either. If you like music and want to have a basic knowledge of composers, then this is a good class to take.",
    "This class allows you to become familiar and appreciate opera and orchestral music through the years. There is not a lot of work required, but testing and papers are not easily graded. I just really enjoyed starting my day listening to music, and often listening to guests play the pieces! One cool assignment: reviewing a YSO concert.",
    "The workload for this class is manageable, especially if you have a prior background in music. If you don't, success in the class is certainly achievable, but will require a serious amount of work. As someone without musical training, the class greatly helped expand my knowledge.",
    "An overview of music history combined with tidbits of other related topics, such as the history of the piano and why music makes us feel the way we do. Professor Wright is an adorable old teacher and very clearly enthusiastic about what he teaches. Being a musician, I took the class hoping to learn some music history (which I did), but probably took the class too lightly; while I could keep up with all the listening portions of the class, I fell behind on reading and related work (like vocabulary and random facts), which ended up hurting my grade in the end. Definitely recommend if you want to just get a big picture view of how music has developed over the ages, but don't ignore it. It's easy to lose points on the larger portions of the grade (like the paper, midterm, and final) if you're not careful. If you want a more intensive treatment of music history, you can always take MUSI 130a and 131b.",
    "A great review of western music history and style.Even if you have played an instrument and can read music, that will help you little as chances are, you still have a very limited knowledge of music history and most things unrelated to the instrument you play.It's not too much work, it's interesting so the work will not even feel like work, so basically just take it. Lecture is wonderful.A couple of extra thoughts:- The paper can be confusing but just ask whoever is grading yours about what they are expecting.- The exams focus a lot on listening, which you can only develop by practicing, not by studying (take this from someone who studied a lot, knew a lot, but still had trouble in the listening section of the exam.)",
    "Not as easy as everyone thinks. I have no music background, but was surrounded by kids from YSO and didn't do as well as a result.",
    "This is a good class if you want to learn about classical music. As someone who knew literally nothing about classical music (or music of any kind, really), I actually found it quite challenging. (This is not in terms of the amount of work, just my ability to do things well.) Lot's of people in the class sing or play an instrument, and some already know a fair amount about the subject and are are taking it for fun. I took it credit-D, and I'm glad I did so, because I could just learn without stressing, and this is not a class to stress out about.",
    "This course will familiarize a student with the major themes, composers, and features of Western music.",
    "For anyone who does not know a lot about music and wants to acquire the ability to appreciate Classical music, this is the best course offered at yale.",
    "Take it if you're even mildly interested in music - it gives a nice overview of both history and listening to music. Be prepared to cram quite a lot of information for the final, though the questions are very fair. If you don't have a music background, it might be a good idea to stay on top of your work throughout the semester. Don't skip lectures all the time because some of the material that isn't in the book appears on the final. But you'll be fine just reading the book, too.",
    "Take it if you're willing to sit down and memorize a bunch of terms and facts. It is guaranteed to give you good cocktail party talking points, and you'll develop a real appreciation for some genres of music you maybedon't know much about. I feel like I'll remember a lot of what I learned. But I did feel like the assessments were kind of high-school style--reading a colorful textbook, making notecards, doing fill-in-the-blanks on tests, writing a ridiculously short paper that was supposed to answer a four-page prompt. These aspects of the class were a little frustrating but didn't take away from the fact that you listen to some of the most important music in recent history and, more importantly, learn how to listen to music in the future with a more knowing ear.",
    "Recommend!",
    "Overview of music history with a focus on learning and identifying music forms, styles, genres, and composers. Good foundation for appreciating performances. Straight forward information, but you have to put the work in to get the grade you want.",
    "This course is interesting, but not very easy. Don't take this if you're looking for a class without work. This class is difficult to follow at times and Professor Wright's teaching style is slightly scatted, especially when papers are assigned.",
    "This class is so much fun! I would definitely recommend it. It's a combination of music history and very light music theory. It's mostly just about learning to appreciate music. Take it!",
    "Prof. Wright is awesome, and the class is very interesting. Basically no work at all. Take it! Even if you play an instrument, you'll end up learning a lot about music that you never learned before.",
    "Take this class! I went in having played an instrument in high school but with no formal training in music theory and I learned much more than I thought I would. Professor Wright is awesome and the lectures are wonderful; I looked forward to going every time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too much work but do the work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned well and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get so much out of it. I have much more of an appreciation for classical music now and get so much more out of music in general.",
    "Listening to Music was overall a good experience. Regardless of your level of musical experience, you should have no problem keeping up! There are lots of little assignments, so nothing will make or break your grade. Thelistening exercises don't take long to do, the tests are not too bad either (he gives you a study guide which, while really long, reflects pretty much exactly what you need to know for the test), the YSO concert and review are pretty fun, and the paper isn't too bad either. It's not a gut - you do have to put in time and work - but it's overall pretty enjoyable and relaxed compared to other classes, and it really helps you understand and appreciate music and music history.",
    "Great Class! Definitely not a gut, so don't be fooled. However, work was never overwhelming; TA's were helpful, and you leave feeling you've gained a lot intellectually.",
    "Harder than I thought itd be. You need to go to lecture.",
    "This is a greatclass if you want to learn how to appreciate classical music. I have always been sort of into classical music, but now I can't get enough of it, and it is only because of this class. I didn't know anything about music theory coming in to the class, and that didn't put me at a disadvantage at all. The class is pretty easy if you do all of the work (short quizzes every week) and the midterm and final are very straightforward if you are willing to do the somewhat substantial studying they require. This is a class that is fun and rewarding if you are willing to put in a decent amount of work, and you will feel like a much more refined and educated person after taking it. Plus Professor Wright is great and very approachable!",
    "Not as much of a gut as you may think. If you're just looking for an easy throwaway class, look elsewhere.",
    "A lot of work not a gut. Start the final essay as soon as you can.A very good introduction to classical music for someone with no background in it at all. It taught me to listen understand and appreciate it. The class didn't go into a lot of detail about differentiating between periods until the final it might be better to spread the out throughout the course. It was a lot of work but good.",
    "This a great, fun class.",
    "Wonderful class. I will not listen to music the same way again, and many names that I had heard before - Bach, Brahms, Berlioz, Beethoven - are now familiar stories and tunes.Not too much work, listen to great music, enjoy a great class.",
    "Take it. It's a good fifth class and very interesting.",
    "If you have no prior music background but are interested in getting an introduction to musical elements and styles (meter, form, genre, etc.) and a survey of a few important composers, pieces, and genres of Western music, then this course is for you. The first couple lectures introduce the basics of music (rhythm, meter, pitch, different instrument groups, etc.), but then the rest of the course is basically a survey of Western music history. There is heavy emphasis on a few key composers (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven) and on a handful of topics and genres that Craig Wright really likes (such as opera). The lectures are mostly fun and entertaining, and Craig Wright is an excellent lecturer. He blends lecture, audio clips, and live performances in each lecture. But his PowerPoints are really disorganized and sometimes hard to follow. Be aware that he changed the content and syllabus of the class from the original version on Open Yale Courses in an attempt to increase attendance at lectures. This past semester (Fall 2012) he basically made up the topics\/content for each week as he went, so it was a little disjointed. Workload is manageable, and light on most weeks: you do a handful of listening exercises each week (they take less than hour total each week), mandatory section, a midterm, a term paper, and a final.",
    "Yes I would recommend! I feel like I learned a lot, not just about what to listen for in classical music, but also about the history of music. Not as much of a gut class as it's generally thought to be. Class was really fun, we listened to music (of course) and analyzed it in class, Professor Wright often brought in musicians to perform for us, and even performed himself sometimes!",
    "MUSI 112 was a TERRIBLE course. It's not even worth its status as a \"gut\". Maybe I'm just really bad at taking guts, but it was not enjoyable in anyway. The book is not worth $120 dollars, and the online portion of the class is incredibly clunky. You will probably spend more time logging in\/out and dealing with bugs in it than actually learning. Professor Wright, though well intentioned, is incredibly paranoid about making students show up to his classes that he wastes time in lecture showing pointless things in a course that already tries to cover so much in so little time, as well as withholding lecture slides or info that he goes over far too quickly in lecture--all as a way to \"encourage\" students to attend lecture.Honestly, take another, more stimulating gut if thats what you're lookingfor.",
    "You should come in with some knowledge of music, or you'll be a bit hard pressed. A chill course which you don't always have to go to lecture for, but lectures are fun listening to good music. NOT A GUT. You have to work for the listening exercises and to prepare for the midterm, which was much easier than the final. At the end, I still didn't really know what I was talking about when analyzing pieces.",
    "Interesting course that gives a good overview of music history. The course had less to do with music cognition than I had expected, except for the final paper.",
    "A decent class. Not a pure gut (it's actually a fair amount of work once everything is factored in), but nothing is graded too difficultly. Worth CR\/Ding if you have no music background--a lot of established musicians take this class.",
    "The curve was surprisingly tough. I thought I earned an A, but the curve pushed me to an A-",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. Fascinating subject material and lecture was always a pleasant experience. A wonderful way to learn about the Western musical tradition (so important!). All of the grading is very straightforward and as long as you're mildly interested in music theory\/history, the work is actually very enjoyable.",
    "I would highly recommend MUSI 112 (Listening to Music) to other students with limited music backgrounds. The course begins with a development of the fundamentals of music (rhythm, pitch, etc.) before proceeding to a broad survey of music history starting with medieval music and concluding with modernist and postmodernist music. Along the way, Professor Wright introduces students to ways of listening to music, including discussions of how a symphony orchestra works (and attendance at and review of a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert) and music cognition in the brain (the topic of this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s term paper). As you can see, this course is a very broad overview of music and is designed (with its low workload) to reach as many students as possible in order to instill music appreciation in Yale undergraduates. The course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements consisted of (roughly) weekly listening exercises, a midterm examination, a final examination, an orchestra review, a term paper, and section attendance and participation. During weeks without a major assignment, the course was pure entertainment, listening to great classical music during class time and answering a few questions about the music for homework. Even on weeks with written assignments, the course is not too bad as the written assignments can be fun. Lectures, for the most part, were enjoyable. Although they were often unorganized because of lousy PowerPoints, most of the knowledge you need to gain from the class comes from actually listening to the music. As someone who began the class with essentially zero music background or knowledge, I feel much better educated and more well-rounded as a result of taking this class and I now understand and appreciate classical music. I am grateful to Craig Wright for this and his commitment to teaching excellence.",
    "Beware: this is not a true \"gut\" course. You have to do a significant amount of textbook reading. This class is not about modern music at all, only about what the layman would call \"classical\" music (baroque, romantic, etc.) I would only recommend this class to enthusiasts about old music."
