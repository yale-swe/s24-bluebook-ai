    "Take it if you like to sing.",
    "I think that voice lessons are valuable to any singer. It's always good to take care of your instrument and try to understand more about how it functions. It's also a nice way to get a credit in a way that is fun and pretty relaxed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend voice lessons for credit. I learned a lot in a short amount of time and have noticed gains in volume even after just a semester. Emily Workman is a wonderful voice teacher and I have had a great experience learning from her.",
    "Voice lessons for credit are a great way to casually work on vocal technique in the classical rep through the year. I recommend this as a good 5th or 6th class if you want to maintain your vocal development through the academic year and need an excuse to get yourself to practice and keep singing!",
    "Extremely low course load and requirements, get some advice on your singing.",
    "It's free voice lessons. Not much else to say. Take it if you wanna get better at singing and hope you get a good teacher"
