   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "A strong conceptual understanding of Pop Art, and a much greater capacity for visual analysis.",
    "This course offers a broad introduction to pop art history ad theory as evidenced by about eight artists. The course goes in-depth on each artist. Prof. Zeidler makes frequent use of slide comparisons, and illustrates the usefulness of this technique when looking at art.",
    "I learned how to really formally analyze works of art, and how to better use visual evidence to strengthen an argument. Rather than more contextually-oriented art history professors that I have had in the past, Professor Zeidler is extremely formalist, and in his course I really honed my formal analysis skills and became more conscious of formal elements in works of art.",
    "I learned about the principal artists of the 60s.",
    "Gained an understanding of major figures in pop art as well as the ability to interpret works based upon form and limited biographical context of artists.",
    "Formal analysis skills. Familiarity with the philosophies and techniques of the most important pop artists.",
    "I learned how to look closely at art objects and develop an argument from just visual analysis. Professor Zeidler's formalism is an amazing skill to take with me as an art historian. The complete freedom we had with the final project was a helpful exercise in creating an argument and carving out an area of interest, which made it very exciting. It's easy to do research on a topic you love."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - Incredible contact time with the very bright mind of Sebastian Zeidler. - fascinating topic - museum visits Weaknesses: - i wish the readings were integrated more fully into the class. could we perhaps discuss them more? maybe we could have some questions about them? - I wish we had written a small paper at some point in the course, so we could have had feedback on our writing \/ better understanding of Professor Zeidler's expectations.",
    "It was great to focus on a single artist each week, and to have in-depth discussions on just a few of the artist's works. The final paper was also a really enjoyable experience, as Prof. Zeidler makes sure that your thesis has enough substance to deserve a 12+ page paper.",
    "The subject matter of the class which artists were included and which works we looked at was great. We started with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, two artists who are usually left out of the narrative of Pop, to provide an important foundation for the rest of the course. I also liked how we focused on one artist per week, so we could really dig deeply into their work and process; this is why seminars are so great. Learning from Professor Zeidler's formalist approach was really rewarding as well. As for weaknesses, I think Professor Zeidler could have been more open to the responses of the students in the class, and could have been generally more invested in us as individuals. It often seemed like he had one answer in mind, and was reluctant to take other viewpoints into account. Members of the class greatly enjoyed hearing each other's analyses, but I don't think Professor Zeidler really closely listened unless he agreed with them. I also don't think he really felt invested in the students in the course, or took any initiative to get to know us. Usually seminars give students and professors the opportunity to get to know one another better, but many of us weren't sure Professor Zeidler really knew who we were even by the end of the semester.",
    "The field trips were an exciting aspect to the course that added valuable perspective and kept the class interesting. I think that having a more discussion-based approach to the class would have kept the longer class hours more interesting - sometimes, it felt a little like a lecture, and with such a small class size I think there could have been a really interesting peer-based discussion.",
    "Strengths: high level visual analysis, productive discussions of images, masterful selection of the most important images Weaknesses: felt like a lecture in a seminar classroom at times, wish we had more opportunities to write and receive feedback in addition to the big final paper",
    "The depth of material rather than breadth is the biggest strength of this course. I loved focusing on only one artist each week and digging through the themes and questions of his (all male artists!) work. This is Professor Zeidler's strength, making all kinds of inferences and amazing arguments from just looking at a work of art. The emphasis on looking at artworks made it easy to participate in discussion, an effective atmosphere for learning. Secondary texts supplemented the art, and not the other way around - a prioritization that I appreciated in an art history course. I think the course lost steam towards the end, during final presentations and field trips. It was hard to feel engaged with the art during that time. The field trip to the MoMA in the middle of a school day was also a lot to ask of us, especially without paying for our train tickets. I know the art history department provides funding for transportation for other class field trips, so I don't think it was fair that it wasn't available to us. Finally, I wish there was more diversity among the artists we studied."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I enjoyed it.",
    "Yes! This course was a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this class, simply because the material is interesting and Zeidler is clearly brilliant, despite the fact that you will not get out of this seminar what you get out of many others a connection to a professor and a chance to share your ideas in an environment where the professor is clearly interested in your thoughts. I learned a lot by simply absorbing what Ziedler saw in works of art, which no doubt expanded my art historical vocabulary and ability to visually analyze works; some of the things he was able to draw out of the works was incredible. I also learned a lot from my classmates, even when Zeidler didn't seem to agree with what they were saying.",
    "Overall I enjoyed this class! Taking a lecture class with Professor Zeidler before taking one of his seminars is probably a good idea though - he has a unique way of presenting and analyzing works that takes some practice to figure out. Definitely learned a lot about Pop Art and the major artists of the time.",
    "Yes, but with the caveat that the student should really enjoy pure visual analysis. The course is most appropriate for art history students or students with a strong interest in formal analysis.",
    "Yes. Great syllabus, great artists, great art, a brilliant professor, and not too much work (only class participation and one final paper). You simply must take an art history class with Zeidler before you leave."
