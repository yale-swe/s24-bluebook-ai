   "comments": [
    "I became much more familiar with the historical development of Christianity and Christian practices. This course helped me navigate the best ways to think about religious development in the context of complicated, inconsistent history.",
    "The name of the course is slightly misleading; the focus of the course is neither on Jesus or Muhammad, but rather the time period after the Resurrection of Christ to the rise of the prophet Muhammad, almost as bookends to the main material in the course. The focus was on the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman empire and the different developments that take place.",
    "I learned SO much about ancient Christianity. I did not know about all the cultural crossover and influence of other religions and the wars between pagans, Jews and other religious sects with Christianity and against orthodoxy. It was all extremely interesting.",
    "I gained a better appreciation for the roots of Christianity and its struggle to cement itself as a \"religious power\" in the world.",
    "A nuanced understanding of early Christianity, and basic engagement with the principles of the field of comparative religion",
    "I learned a lot about early church history and philosophy, which is nice in that it helps inform how different communities stand today. There were also a lot of generalized historical lessons, like the use of typology and cultural memory.",
    "This course give me a lot of insight into early Christianity, particularly regarding diversity of beliefs and ideas across space and time.",
    "I developed critical insight skills in the context of reading, comparing, discussing, and analyzing historical texts. Through in-depth study of primary and secondary sources, I obtained a heightened ability to research historical topics.",
    "An understanding of ancient early christianity and early judaism, and early islam, the philosophical\/theological debates of the time, and the important figures of the time. I developed skills in critically analyzing primary sources and in thinking about how religions are similar\/different.",
    "I learned how to read (biblical) primary sources with severe bias and interpret them for their historical value. I learned an incredible amount about Early Christianity and its relevance to the Christian and non-Christian communities. This course was fantastic for learning about a specific subject and how to be a good historian."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were really great, and I enjoyed every single one. The texts were dealt with very well, and I think the course was tangible to people from all kinds of religious backgrounds. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Best parts of the course were the visit to Dura Europos artifacts in YUAG and the class about worship (second to last one). Incense was burned, bread was given, and chants were playing in the background of the lecture. That type of multi-sensory learning is really cool and having that every class would have created a more immersive environment.",
    "The class material was very engaging to people who were interested in the history of religion. Professor Davis is incredible beyond words in making the material accessible and promoting a very welcoming environment.",
    "Strength: Well organized. Great lectures. Super strong teaching team. Weakness: Preparation for the final could have been much stronger. I think I speak for everyone in the class when I say we would have appreciated a study guide of some sort.",
    "The strengths include: Professor Davis, the outstanding Teaching Fellows, and the thematic development of the course. The outline of the lectures was created in a methodical, appropriate way; I never felt \"lost\" in understanding the direction of the course.",
    "Excellent lectures, truly engaging sections, nuanced discussions, appropriate reading level.",
    "Sections were helpful, but a lot of the material (primary sources especially) that we dealt with was confusing and unclear. I wish we had gone over certain aspects of the trinitarian or christological conflicts more. That said, both the professor and the TA's were really engaging.",
    "Excellent professor and TAs. You develope a strong basis for the roots of and the growth of Christianity and Islam.",
    "The course is very well set up for student learning, I cant say that I have any problems with it.",
    "The instruction of this course was extraordinary, both by Professor Davis and by my TF, Stephanie Machabee. The selection of reading materials was apt in terms of breadth and depth and I felt that I developed a great deal of knowledge about early Christianity. I did wish this course included more on early Islam, rather than the brief overview we had.",
    "I loved the course! I think my only suggestion would be to highlight continuity in the different lecture topics more. Sometimes it felt like we were learning about some seemingly-unconnected movements, eras, or topic. It would be helpful to have some thematic clarity through out, and to connect each different lecture with broader themes so it feels more like everything is fitting together.",
    "I thought the course was very strong. Lectures and readings were very interesting and relevant. Sections improved once we focused on close readings and answering the guiding questions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course. It will frame your knowledge of religious history, and it's an era that most people usually do not get a chance to learn about. No one will teach it better than Prof. Davis either. It's incredibly engaging, and the readings are great!",
    "Grading is tough and material is interesting.",
    "If you are remotely interested in the topic of the spread of Christianity\/development of religious practices, YES. It is so incredible and the teaching is just so engaging. The work load also is not that heavy at all and very manageable.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would definitely recommend a course taught by Professor Davis to other students. He was fantastic. Very passionate, hilarious, well-prepared, and definitely one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. However, this course was quite a lot of work. It was very reading dense, and the writing assignments are graded toughly, so to perform well in the class, you have to be willing to put in the work.",
    "Even though I am not a religious studies major, I would definitely recommend this course to students who are curious about the origins of Christianity and its relation to other competing religions.",
    "Would certainly recommend. I felt very engaged with the material and glad to be a part of the class. Gave me an interesting background in a religious tradition not my own.",
    "I think I would recommend this course, so long as someone is really interested in church history. If someone is looking for more of a survey-level course on Christianity this might not be the best one.",
    "I would recommend this course. Its very interesting, well-taught, and the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Yes! If the student happens to be interested in any sort of historical analyses, regardless of content, this course is great!",
    "Absolutely. I went in knowing nothing about religious history, and came out with a deep understanding of ancient christianity and judaism. I loved professor Davis - he is a really great lecturer, very approachable, and makes each class interesting. I never skipped lecture because it was so fun! The class is not difficult, however it does challenge you to think deeply about religious themes in new ways. I thought this was the perfect introduction to religious studies if you've never taken a class about Christianity before, and the class was definitely not too bogged down in hard readings\/really long readings.",
    "Yes, it was a fantastic introduction to religious studies with many great readings and amazing teachers.",
    "100% take it.",
    "I absolutely would. The course material is very interesting and often just side note in other history classes. Professor Davis is also a fantastic instructor."
