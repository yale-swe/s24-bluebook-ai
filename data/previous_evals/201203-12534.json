   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking American studies if you're interested in the Lit major or enjoy literature courses in general. It felt less geared towards American Studies than it did towards literature.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone, as a non-English major I enjoyed this class and found the reading spectacular!",
    "Take Engl 282 for the reading list and for Caleb Smith's gentle but clever lecture style. Actually, take it just to hear Smith talk about Faulkner's south.Don't take it to hear ground-breaking ideas or to come away from a strange mix of texts with any conception of their greater relationship to one another.",
    "Good books, mostly. Good lectures, mostly. Generally the bad lectures match up with the bad books; you'll know them when you read them.",
    "This class was pretty good. Most of the lectures were not inspiring, but some were very interesting. There are a bunch of good books and many other interesting readings on the syllabus; I just wish there had been some more cohesion or deeper discussion of the texts. A lot of the syllabus is pretty standard high school fare, so make sure you haven't already read everything. Not a lot of work. Fairly good grounding in this chunk of American literature. Smith is good and well worth getting to know.",
    "This class is a good survey of modern american lit, with a heavy focus on the \"color-line\" and the problem of race relations in America after the Civil War. Caleb Smith is great, and even though some of the readings are boring, he always lectures on them well.",
    "Pretty straightforward lit class.",
    "American Lit is a good course that a lot of English majors take. That being said, it's more of an American studiescourse that tries to cover a lot of movement in American literature. Sometimes the course felt really disorganized and sometimes the lectures were not at all informative, but other times the lectures had great insights and made really interesting connections to works read earlier in the semester. Hardly any work - two short papers, a mid term and a final.",
    "Don't take this class.Professor Smith's lectures during shopping period were so good and the reading list looked so enticing that I couldn't help but take it.Pretty soon after our schedules were locked, however, the quality decreased sharply. When reading Riis and James, Professor Smith admitted to not having a thesis and instead just traced the plot progression over the course of the novels.While he was very intelligent when answering questions at the end of the lecture, shwowing his understanding of the literary works, his approach to the bulk of the lectures seemed haphazard and unproductive.I consistently walked out of that class dissatisfied and now really dislike American Literature.",
    "This is a pretty standard english lecture course. The material is really great and it's well organized, you get to read some great american classics and also read some literary texts that are helpful in giving context to the works. Caleb Smith is an awesome lecturer- listening to him read great American literature in his southern accent is truly one of the highlights of the course (jk there are lots of highlights like Henry James and Faulkner! but Caleb's accent was definitely a plus). Lectures are well organized and it's clear that Caleb has thought a lot about the course.",
    "AMST 282 is a literature course covering readings from the Civil War to the early 20th century, tracing themes ranging from race to realism through a ~60 year time period. I would be hesitant to recommend it to another student unless they had a particular interest in this sort of class, but it wasn't totally impossible for those of us without a background in literature. All in all, I can definitely think of more painful ways to get the American Studies literature credit, so take it if you'relooking to complete that or think the syllabus is interesting. This was the first year it was taught, so I'm sure that some of the issues will be addressed the next time around.",
    "A light but solid lecture that will ground you in American literature of the period. Usually interesting, not terribly rigorous.",
    "Take it, especially if you need the American Lit requirement for the AmStud major. Listening to Smith is just really enjoyable - he's one of the professors that is just so clearly a genius and it's awesome to experience. Hopefully some of the reading list will change (How the Other Half Lives is getting old, Miss Lonelyhearts kind of sucked and The Autobipgraphy of Alice B. Toklas didn't really fit into the themes of the course) but the class was consistently interesting and not too hard. Two papers (4-6 and 6-8 pages), a midterm, and a open-book final. Go for it.",
    "I took this class looking to expand my knowledge of the American literary canon. It definitely did this in some respects, introducing me to Twain, Faulkner, and others. However, this class definitely has a focus on minority writers--something that I think is good, but something that students should be aware of. Reconstruction and its problems played a big role in our course. If this topic interests you, then definitely take the class. A manageable workload with a great structure (2 papers + a very straight-forward midterm and final). Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Pretty good lecture course with good readings",
    "A good-enough introductory survey to the literature it covers, though the lectures aren't often super substantive. Professor Smith is charming and engaging, and the readings are good, but it won't blow your mind.",
    "This course is a fantastic. I learned a lot about different authors and literary movements. Its strengths include the depth of material that Professor Smith goes into during lecture as well as the diverse syllabus, ranging from Faulkner to Du Bois. It was my first American literature course at Yale and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The readings were fantastic and provided me with works I would have never read otherwise.",
    "Decent course. Pretty low stress, because the midterm and final are made to be very manageable, and the essays are not very long.",
    "American Studies 282 gives you a good sense of the literature at that time",
    "ENGL 282 has a *great* reading list, and the lectures never failed to disappoint; Smith certainly has a way with words and ideas. Wholeheartedly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American literature of this period, and especially to those interested in a sociocultural\/historical approach to literary analysis. A lot of the syllabus is based around \"the problem of the color line\" and the far-reaching ramifications of the Civil War and the 13th Amendment; Mark Twain, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, the Harlem Renaissance, and William Faulkner are all prominently featured and discussed in racial context. Caleb Smith is a fun, affable, engaging, and eloquent lecturer. He says a lot and doesn't always \"signpost,\" so be ready for that. And I think going forward he'll iron out some of the stranger bumps in the syllabus. (European architectural manifestos? No Hemingway or Fitzgerald?) I could see this becoming not just a good but a great class.",
    "Be very careful of the TA you select as that will entirely your influence your grade and subsequent enjoyment of the class. Professor Smith is awesome, and the lectures are always informative.",
    "This was a pretty good course! Good material, good lectures ... It depends heavily on who you have for section though.",
    "This is a great course to take, especially if you are interested in experiencing a variety of types of American literature. For the most part, each work on the syllabus leads into the next one in a way that illuminates both works. The lectures are always fun and will teach you things you could never have figured out for yourself.",
    "This class was great. I had never taken an English\/Literature class before, and this far surpassed my expectations. Prof. Smith is a great lecturer, and the works on the syllabus were (mostly) a pleasure to read. He made them accessible even to someone with very little understanding of literary theory. Section was great too, awesome discussion. I took the class just because I needed to for my major, but it was worth it anyway. Take this class!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. I feel like the class had strengths that I now recognize, but in the moment I was frustrated and disappointed by the lectures-- which covered too much ground and without the kind of depth I craved. Yes, this was a survey course and had an intention for breadth. But reading the entirety of Stein's Autobiography was one indicator that the course's reading list could have been shortened to accomodate more depth.",
    "This is a historical and literary overview of trends in American literature from the Civil War to the mid-20th century. It was an exceptional course, and I'd recommend it to anyone who cares at all about books, and who wants to be taught about some of the greatest works of American literature by an incredible professor.",
    "Take it! I read books like A Portrait of a Lady and the Sound and the Fury that I'd always felt like I should read but never had, and enjoyed them so much. Also re-read works like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Yellow Wallpaper that were okay when I read them in high school and appreciated them a whole lot more this time. Likely largely because they were accompanied with the lectures of Caleb Smith, who is fantastic. Lecture is great. Section is okay. The readings are great. The papers are okay. The exams are great.",
    "Generally a good course. A good introduction to Civil War themes and literary modernism. A heavier focus is placed on the English component of this course than the American Studies perspective. Lectures are close-readings, which can get a little tiresome, but the great selection of readings for the course makes up for it. Caleb Smith is a good speaker and makes some interesting arguments. Recommended for English majors and students interested in a critical, argumentative exploration of American literature.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to an English major as a somewhat different way to look at the field, as well as to anyone interested in gaining a broad understanding of American literature.",
    "ENGL 282 is a survey of American literature that covers different regions, writers, and eras. History majors would likely enjoy this course. Be prepared to read 40-200 pages per week in addition to supplementary readings.",
    "American Lit was a bit of a mixed bag. Professor Smith is a decent lecturer, but he's not quite on Professor Warner's level, for those who are taking this class as a follow-up to English 280. He did provide some very interesting insights, especially when we were studying the Modernist poets and Faulkner, but he also sometimes talks at length about one topic without seeming to say anything substantial. The readings were quite diverse and often fairly long, but they were all important for establishing a solid background in American literature.",
    "Yes! Absolutely! An amazing syllabus and wonderful lectures by a passionate professor. The evaluations are not meant to trick you, but rather just to show that you read the material. The papers are interesting and open ended, allowing you to explore whatever topic you choose. Great addition to the English department.",
    "I would not recommend it. I can't really explain it, but the class just felt sort of muddled. Maybe it was because this was just the first time Professor Smith taught it. Check the syllabus first.",
    "Bad course- don't let shopping period fool you. Caleb Smith stops being good at his job after he stops caring about impressing students.",
    "Lecture course in American lit from the period between the Civil War and WWII, with an emphasis on B-list but arguably important texts.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in the period of American history at the turn of the 20th century, especially concerning race relations. We read classic pieces of American literature as well as some lesser known works that are nonetheless great and provide a critical lens into what we are studying. The course is really well designed and, above all, Professor Smith is an great professor and his lectures are wonderful. Homework consists of a lot of reading, but other than that there is just a midterm and final (which are pretty easy\/straightforward if you follow readings and lecture) and two essays. Section discussions are important if you want to solidify your understanding of the readings and especially when the essays roll around, so make sure you get a really good TA.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course. While Smith is an engaging lecturer and you will read interesting works, the section is a dread and it in no way complimented the course. The first couple of weeks are interesting with Huck Finn and everything but then it goes down hill from there. The midterm and final are straight forward and pretty easy but they are tough graders on the papers. If I thought my writing improved in this course I would tell you to take it, but that wasn't so. If I thought the discussions in section were valuable I would tell you to take it, but that wasn't so either. If you decide to take it, shop around for a TA you like that knows how to field discussion away from section assholes, because that will be necessary for this course."
