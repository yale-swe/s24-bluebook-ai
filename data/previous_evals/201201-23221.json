   "comments": [
    "I would say it was a really good class, sometimes too much reading and too much focus on writing the final paper, but I really learned to write a better research paper, and Professor Chauncey is fantastic.",
    "Amazing professor, amazing reading list. Take it to learn the craft of writing history in a difficult area of social history.",
    "Take this class only if you plan on doing all of the readings and actively engaging in class discussion.",
    "This was a really wonderful class. Everyone in it had taken George Chauncey's lecture class, so the best part of this class wasn't learning new information--though you certainly will--but was, instead, learning to think, write, and discuss like a historian of sexuality. The structure of the class works really well, particularly because Chauncey capped it at 15, so discussions were, overwhelmingly, very good. The workload is pretty standard for a junior history seminar, and both Chauncey and the TF worked closely with us to make sure our final paper topics were things we were very excited about.",
    "A very standard history seminar that elegantly explores some of the most difficult problems one encounters in writing a history paper of 15-20 pages. Professor Chauncey is legendary at Yale for a reason, and his reputations is well paired with his intelligent and friendly demeanor. I particularly enjoyed the careful attention paid to the particular problems of writing gay and lesbian histories, as opposed to other forms of history writing. Stay ahead of working on the paper--the deadline will creep up on you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you're willing to put in the time to do the readings, you will get so much out of it. If you just want an intro to gay history, it would perhaps be better to take the lecture course, but if you are looking to truly engage with the historiography, this is the class for you. If, during the lecture course, you found yourself wanting to write all of the essays Professor Chauncey suggested as potential topics, this is also definitely the class for you!",
    "If you're a WGSS\/American Studies\/History major and have the chance to take this class, I highly recommend it! If you're interested in critically engaging with questions of gay\/lesbian history and historiography, I'd also highly recommend it. This is not Chauncey's lecture class--the sequel. It's a history seminar, and you really need to like \"thinking history.\"Professor Chauncey is someone who cares about his students and their work perhaps more so than any other professor I've had. He and the teaching fellow not only invited us to meet with them at multiple points over the semester to discuss our work but also really wanted us to. Prof. Chauncey places a large emphasis on writing, which I really appreciated.I consider myself to be a pretty strong writer, and I had also taken a junior history seminar the semester before, and I still gained a tremendous amount from the focus on writing (and writing queer history, specifically)--in both looking at how scholars structure their arguments and conduct research, and how we, as emerging scholars of queer history, might begin to build our own arguments.Take it, take it, take it if you can!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who enjoyed Professor Chauncey's lecture course and wants to learn how to DO gay history. This course will help you develop a critical eye in reading history, and the skills to do research and craft a paper. The paper-writing process was broken down into steps and really well-supported by Chauncey and our TA. Discussions depend on the other students in the class; there will likely be some measure of pretentious and empty academic jargon thrown around, but the course is worth putting up with that. Really, take any chance you have to learn from and get to know Chauncey.",
    "This seminar offers an intensive study in the methods of conducting queer historical research. Its focus is not on providing a broad narrative of gay and lesbian history, but rather on understanding how we write queer history. It is important to have taken Chauncey's lecture course beforehand, so that every student in the seminar has a common understanding of gay and lesbian history to draw from.During each class we would look at a specific piece of gay and lesbian history, or sometimes a type of historiographical approach, and analyze a set of readings to see the way they used their evidence to construct their arguments. Overall, a great class! Highly recommended.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Take it if you liked Chauncey's lecture course!"
