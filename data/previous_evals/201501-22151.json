   "comments": [
    "Please take this class! Even (especially!) if you don't know anything about the French Renaissance, you'll get so, so much out of every discussion. Professor Duval is the most intelligent, articulate, and kind professor you'll have at Yale. He is one of the few instructors I've encountered who can effectively lead a class towards an interesting, complex reading of a text. You won't just hear students make vague, unrelated remarks Prof. Duval can shape any student statement into an incisive comment. You'll be reading canonical texts, some impenetrable, and some enchanting.",
    "This class is straightforward and very good. Take it if you want to feel like a scholar. My written French got a lot better, and I learned a lot about the literature of the French Renaissance. Duval is also an outstanding teacher. He is demanding and he makes those demands clear and reasonable, which allows his students to grow and learn a lot.",
    "A great introduction to literature of the French Renaissance. Readings are low in volume, but can be tricky at first since they are in Middle French. There is a good amount of writing needed for this class and a final exam, so be warned! However, it was a very rewarding class and I am glad I took it.",
    "This is a lovely survey of the French Renaissance, taught by a great master of the field. If you speak French and have yet to take a class with Duval, do it: there is no better and more caring teacher in the department. (He also speaks the better and more beautiful French than all the other French professors.)The syllabus is fantastic, the structure--four short essays and a final--surprisingly effective. Professor Duval's leadership is consistently excellent. The course would benefit by offering the opportunity to revise essays, as well as perhaps allowing the use of secondary literature on at least one of the essays. But really this is a pretty straightfoward, get-what-you-pay-for kind of deal. It requires and rewards careful reading and writing, but it's worth the effort--which honestly is a small price to pay for Duval's office hours.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in French literature and also looking for a serious academic challenge. This course will improve your French reading and writing, and also literary skill and insight in general. A fantastic course."
