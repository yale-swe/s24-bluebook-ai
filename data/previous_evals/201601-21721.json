   "comments": [
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and this is coming from an econ major. I strongly encourage any curious soul to take this class -- it will broaden your mind tremendously. The professor is fantastic -- Professor Deming will push you to think critically and intelligently. While this may seem uncomfortable at first, he is doing it for your own development. The reading is a lot, but manageable. The readings are also incredible, especially when you dig into them together in class! If you think you've read Moby-Dick, you haven't until you've taken this class. Emerson too, for that matter. Take the dive and enjoy the open sea!",
    "This is overall a pretty enjoyable class with a syllabus that you should read but probably haven't. The amount of reading for each class is eminently reasonable (40-50 pages\/class) and the two papers (a 5-7pp midterm and a 12-15pp final) are also very manageable. Professor Deming knows a ton about these authors and does a good job mixing giving us information vs. us discussing the texts and coming to our own conclusions.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning about these three authors, or if you just want to look at interested writing in general and learn about how good writing is done",
    "You will get nothing out of this class if you aren't willing to sink your teeth into the material. The readings are profound and compelling, so be prepared to think deeply about each and every reading. My life is forever changed for having read Moby-Dick with a group. And of course Deming is incredible. Take this if you want to stretch your mind, and also be pushed by one of the sharpest and most pedagogically instructive minds in the English department.",
    "Emerson, Hawthorne, and Melville is a class that should not be missed. Professor Deming is extremely helpful in helping you engage with the texts. The syllabus gets better every week.",
    "Take this even if you think you don't like the authors on the syllabus (as I did). I ended up loving most of the readings, Emerson and Melville especially. Things slow down a bit with Hawthorne but even he has his charm. A good-sized class on classic American lit with Deming as guide--so ideal!! Take: to have some fun \/ to fulfill the American lit requirement for majors \/ to read Moby Dick (because its so good and when else will you read it).",
    "Such an incredible class. The reading list was amazing and the level of discourse in the seminar was higher than in any other course that I have ever taken. Professor Deming is extraordinary.",
    "This class was hands down the best I've taken at Yale. The texts are phenomenal, especially Moby-Dick. Professor Deming is a brilliant seminar leader. He lets the students for the most part carry the discussion, but interjects just the right amount, and always in a way that both shows his palpable love of the writers at hand and offers invaluable direction to the existing conversation. He is one of the few professors I've had in a literature class who addressed the subject of writing well not just what to write about, but how to go about wrangling it into a good paper. This class made me want to drop everything else to do the reading, and then impatient for the class meeting times so we could talk about it. I'm an English major and I think I'd been feeling a little jaded about the whole thing the past few semesters. This class reminded me why I love literature.",
    "Deming is great, and very perceptive about what people are trying to say even if they don't know it themselves. He is interested in nonverbal reactions to literature, like laughs or groans. I learned some stuff from class seminars, but because he is so interested in what students have to say, I didn't really learn as much as I hoped to. The best moments were when Deming spoke his premeditated thoughts, which was only for about 5 minutes each class. I'd be more interested in a lecture with him. The papers get you to really think and learn things, so I would say I learned while writing and while he spoke in seminar. Not a workshop, so don't expect to improve your writing.",
    "A great class in which you read some of the most important and influential authors in American history. Professor Deming was a phenomenal course leader. There is never too much reading-- in fact, I actually finished all of the reading assigned. The reading is also all discussed-- there is never a feeling of \"oh, why did we even bother reading that?\" It was my first official English class at university, so I had a few concerns: 'will this be too subjective?' being number one. Ultimately, though, I felt that there were no conversations spent waisting time or addressing the same point over and over. There are only two papers, with the obligation to come up with a reading response and questions once throughout the semester. A great class, not too much work, and useful work when there is, and a great professor."
