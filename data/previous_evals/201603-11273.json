   "comments": [
    "I gained a great deal of experience taking a medical device project from concept to initial functional prototype in this course, meanwhile increasing my comfort level with machining, concept selection and comparison techniques, and working with a small team for an extended period of time. The lecture portion of the course also exposed me to a large variety of different sub-fields within the medical device community, which is helpful when thinking about careers and just where I want to fit into that bigger picture.",
    "I improved my ability to work with other students and with clients on projects.",
    "I did not have any previous experience in medical device design (or really any type of design), so I was able to learn how to get my hands dirty and actually have a tangible product by the end of the semester. In addition, this class taught me how to work in groups in this sort of context. If you don't hold each other accountable, you can find yourselves getting a little behind, so make sure you make your expectations clear as a group. Above all, I was incredibly proud of myself and of my classmates when the course ended and we saw how far we'd come from listening to the doctor presentations incredulously and wondering how we could possibly come up with solutions to the problems they had proposed.",
    "There is so much that I learned in this course that I don't even know where to begin. As a biomedical engineering senior, this course satisfied one of my deepest academic desires at Yale, which was to design a medical device in a team setting. I learned the design process of understanding a real clinician problem, searching up existing patents, generating concepts, choosing a concept, developing it into a functioning prototype, and validating it by talking to medical providers. a I also learned a lot about a specific medical topic by reading a lot on it and talking with a lot of different healthcare providers. Additionally, I learned how to work closely in a team setting (the four of us nearly saw each other daily it seems) and how to write good reports and present well. I also really appreciated the variety of speakers we had during class. It was refreshing to not be lectured at and to be responsible for memorizing abstract content for a test; instead, we got to see how medical devices were designed and implemented on a very practical level. Also, a side point: Once, Professor Zinter asked our team how much we liked our project by asking if it would be something we do rather than other homework. No matter what project, I would absolutely say that this class was my favorite class even before I did any work for it or chose a project and that it will always be my favorite class at Yale because of everything it is. I would rather take this class five times any day than take another class at Yale.",
    "This was a wonderful, hands-on course that taught me a lot about the design process. I learned that careful design decisions must be made based on the desires of the client and the desired outcome that your team is working towards. I think this is a great class for juniors and seniors because it builds upon skills you have obtained (CAD, electronics, machining, etc.) and puts them into perspective in a real-world application.",
    "EVERYtHING I learned at yale I learned here. Okay. Thats an exaggeration, but could be true. There is a ton of growth and a ton of application of knowledge. I learned and successful implemented a design process and various forms of communication (written, oral, presentation). I now know a ton about ECMO and ventilators and am more interested in medical technologies than I was before.",
    "I learned so much while taking this course. The guest lecture series gave students first class insight on how to navigate the world of start ups, making a medical device, and other jobs related to medical devices that one can go into. Additionally, I learned things about the design process and improved skills of rapid prototyping, machining and working in a group.",
    "I learned the big picture of how Medical Devices go from an idea to a product used in the market place. I learned about developing and evaluating ideas, researching prior patents, making prototypes, getting funding, running clinical trials, working with the FDA, filing patents, etc... This was all in lecture and from a wide variety of guest speakers. With the project I worked on myself, I learned about taking ideas from a client (the Doctor from Yale-New Haven) and working to make sure our product actually met the needs of the client. There was a lot of back and forth and different ideas, and we changed our design continuously based on feedback and results. I learned about giving an engaging product demonstration!",
    "I learned\/improved upon a variety of technical skills -- including CAD, electronic circuit design, website design, machining, and Raspberry Pi coding -- as well as learned other facets of medical device design, including healthcare, patenting, the FDA, and medical device users such as hospitals and practitioners. The knowledge we gain in this class is truly widespread, and you definitely get out what you put in to the class.",
    "I learned so much -- I could go on and on forever. From how to work in a multidiscplinary team with clinician clients to how to break down assignments into bits and pieces to having fun and taking pride and ownership in a project. I also learned a lot about practicing medicine, and various stages of the medical device development and implementation.",
    "I've come away from this class with more than I have from any other class at Yale - technical, conceptual, and life skills!",
    "An unparalleled experience in design and innovation. An incredibly in depth understanding of my project and it's tangentially related topics: otolaryngology, electronics, optics, coding, and medical devices. Additionally, incredible resources were made available to us as individuals involved in all phases of medical devices: design, funding, innovation, sales, development, testing, etc. I learned more problem solving skills in this course than in the rest of my courses at Yale.",
    "How to apply technical knowledge learned in other courses towards medicine & medical devices.",
    "I learned many technical skills throughout the course of medical device design, including how to design a medical device and how to generate a prototype.",
    "I learned SO MUCH in this course. As a non-engineer, I was able to design and build a medical device while working with a team of physicians. It really does not get cooler than that. I went from having zero engineering skills to learning how to design 3D models to print, utilize many of the tools in the CEID, and understand much more about electronics and mechanics. On top of the technical skills I gained, I also learned a tremendous amount about the medical device field itself, from the design process through FDA regulation and to market because of the wide variety of guest lecturers. My favorite classes were our field trip to the OR at YNHH and our surgical skills lab at the CEID, when we were able to try out some awesome devices and test our laparoscopic surgical skills. I had a great amount of help along the way from the teaching staff as well.",
    "Learned a lot more about the design process and got some good insight into what it's like working in the different aspects of industry. Learned about what goes into making a medical device and got lots of chances to apply that to our projects. Developed design, experimental, and fabricating skills working on our projects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was by far the best I have taken at Yale, so it's hard to find areas to improve. Obviously, it is a very large workload, but most of that is a necessity I believe to get the right kind of product in the end. That said, one thing I do think could have been improved was the balance and number of assignments. In the beginning of the semester, we were churning out a great number of written and oral assignments, all of which went into our design process in the end, however, for the first month or month and a half, I felt like the writing was getting in the way of us actually doing the engineering necessary on our project. When we'd have a progress report due, usually my first thought was \"well, our progress since the last report has been writing this report.\" I think that the course could maybe be a bit more balanced in terms of its timeline so that the actual design and prototyping work could be spread out over more of the semester rather than being crammed into the second half. On the diagram Joe used multiple times where he showed the class' trajectory as going from concrete, to theoretical, back to concrete, we probably could have benefited from a more lopsided triangle, where the first half is shorter than the second.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot, you make friends, you (maybe) have a startup\/research project for the future Weaknesses: The workload is very high, and a lot of that comes from writing, not just working on the project.",
    "This class is AMAZING. I had the opportunity to develop working relationships with doctors at Yale New Haven hospital and take advantage of everything it has to offer. Every mentor or person my group and I contacted took time out of their busy schedule to meet with us and took us seriously throughout the entire process. In addition, our class got to tour the operating room (insane) and benefit from the wisdom of a bevy of in class speakers. In addition, because the majority of the work is done outside of class, the amount of time you put in to your project will be directly reflected in your final product. I really see no weaknesses with the course, other than the fact that it's incredibly competitive to get in.",
    "Strengths of this course are: (1) Because everyone knows it is a high workload, people who take it are prepared to devote a lot of time to it. Also, as a project rather than a paper\/problem set, it is extremely refreshing and never feels like real work that just 'needs to get done.' People are extremely motivated in this course to do well for the sake of the project, not the grade. (2) I love that it is a team-based project where you get to work really closely with others from other major\/engineering disciplines. Everyone brings different skills to the table and you get to bond with your teammates a lot. (3) I also appreciated getting to work closely with a physician mentor. Even in times where we didn't know where our solution was going, we knew this was a real clinician need and that something could be done about it. (4) The instructors are SO AWESOME and DEDICATED. I really was amazed by how they made a point to go to all of the student meetings with physicians on and off campus for all five teams, and met with each team individually each week. (5) I thought the instructors did a great job creating the teams to have a good balance of skills and personalities. (6) I appreciated that all assignments were never busy work and were only real work that advanced our projects. Weaknesses: This is hard to think of. (1) I wish this class could be open to more students (such as some of my biomedical engineering senior friends who also wanted to take this class but didn't get in), but I understand why 20 students is ideal. Could we have this class in both the fall and the spring? (2) There were a lot of presentations and papers in the beginning half of the course, such that sometimes my team felt that we were spending more time on assignments thinking about the concept than actually working on the concept itself. (3) I think it's important to ask students to think carefully about whether they want to design a hardware device OR software platform when they are ranking projects. I appreciated the software solution we ended up designing, but did miss doing hardware\/prototyping stuff, which I expected to do more of when signing up for this course. (4) Some speakers can be hit or miss, but I'm not sure if you can do much about this.",
    "The major weakness of this course is that it is a lot of work near the end of the semester and can take away from the time you are putting towards your other classes. That said, however, it is the most fulfilling class I have ever taken, and I was excited to put every minute I could into the project. This course gives you the opportunity to delve deeply into a real clinical problem, while learning a lot about the medical device industry along the way. The class had great guest lecturers and field trips that helped put all the work we were doing into perspective.",
    "Strength: Great amount of professor\/teaching staff interaction. Great interest in students by professor\/teaching staff. Teachers ask you questions and you tell them the answers. Lectures cover all aspects of the medical field. You learn about making, regulating, and selling medical devices. Weaknesses: None.",
    "The strength of the course is the atmosphere that the class provides. Legitimately everyone wants to be there and everyone is willing and able to do work. However, some of the assignments got in the way of actual designing and prototyping. It seems like the class is very slow to start but picks up very quickly at the end. This work could be better distributed throughout the semester. Additionally, the professors could do a better job helping to facilitate the team dynamic.",
    "I found my team had difficulty, especially in the beginning of the semester, with balancing work for our project and for the written assignments. I think we would have done better if we had been able to just work on the project more, but we tended to get a little more stuck on the writing. The writing assignments seem helpful overall, but I think we would have done better with fewer of them and with them being a little shorter. At the same time, they were graded fairly lightly, but we might have gotten a little more out of them with more harder grading. But maybe not, I just think it would have been better if the class pushed us more to actually work on the project in the beginning instead of just these assignments.",
    "This class was amazing!!! So many strengths -- we learn in depth about a clinical problem that is of interest to us, we make extensive use of the CEID, which has so much to offer to Yale students, we are given a lot of freedom to make creative design solutions, we are stretched to the limits of our academic willpower (which can feel overwhelming but is beyond rewarding), and we are advised by some truly brilliant instructors and teaching fellows. One suggestion is that I do wish that we started prototyping\/building our devices earlier in the semester. Our instructors followed a pretty organized timeline, which is great, but I think we could have started building much earlier and been less overwhelmed with work at the very end.",
    "Strengths: Super involved teaching staff, amazing guest lecturers, novel and humanitarian projects, great resources, fun activities, fair and helpful assignments, super helpful physician and staff meetings, class and team pride and relationships. Weaknesses: Very few. My only suggestion is to have a guest lecturer come in and speak about using novel medical devices in practice.",
    "The structure, opportunities, and teaching stuff in this class are unlinke any other class anywhere.",
    "Strengths: Incredible introduction to real world problems, overwhelmingly engaging\/stimulating, innovative, wonderful teaching\/support staff, thoroughly developed and well planned. Weaknesses: Perhaps this is a weakness of the BME major, but this course should be offered to BME majors only, or at least engineering majors only. It is an incredible design course that non-STEM majors took for granted.",
    "This course is a ton of work but by far the best course I've ever take in my life. Joseph Zinter is a genius and an outstanding professor. He supports students and guides them so well throughout the semester. He has also put together a staff of physicians and TAs that are so supportive and the best in their field.",
    "As a senior, this is the best course I have taken at Yale. I cannot speak highly enough about it. The teaching staff was incredible (the most hands-on I have ever met), the course topic was interesting, the projects were fascinating, and the students in the class were inspiring. While guest lectures were interesting, the hands-on days were always more so. My favorite classes were our field trip to the OR at YNHH and our surgical skills lab at the CEID. To integrate more hands-on experiences, it may be interesting to visit a manufacturing plant to see devices being created, for instance. The class is a lot of work, but it is worth it. The one thing I would stress is that non-engineers should absolutely physically build (not just design) a portion of their team's device. Engineers of course tend to do the heavy-lifting with things like CAD, etc., but deciding to jump in and build something on my own (rather than in a group) that would play a real role in the final prototype made the last portion of the class infinitely more rewarding and a better learning experience for me. Dr. Zinter encouraged us to make sure everyone was building, but I personally found that that was very important! All in all, a great experience!",
    "The only improvement I could think of is making dedicated lab time to work on the projects since class time is so often taken up by guest lectures. MENG 185 does this pretty well, and since its so difficult to get everybody together outside of class, it would make it much easier to work on our projects."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students--it was an extremely rewarding experience. That said, one should make sure that they are a good fit for it before signing on ... it's an enormous amount of work at the end of the semester (expect to spend whole weekends doing nothing but this course) and one needs to be willing to commit to that. Moreover, I think that it is extremely beneficial to come in to this course with prior knowledge of some relevant field. While that may not be necessary, every member of the team needs to contribute a huge amount of work, so it is helpful if you can really provide expertise in either mechanical design\/CAD, fabrication, biology\/BME, or computer science. That said, some people my year taking the course didn't have any experience coming in (though not on my team) and it seemed to work out, however, just know that a lot will be asked of you, so its helpful to have an area where you can make a large contribution without requiring any hand-holding.",
    "I would recommend 404 only to students who are willing to make this course the focus of their semester. For those students, this course may be life changing; otherwise, it will likely not go so well. Also, be aware that this course has more writing than many WR credits.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get in to this class, DEFINITELY take it! There is nothing like it in all of Yale, and I can confidently say that it's been my favorite class in my undergraduate career. If the workload is not daunting to you, don't let it stop you--it's 100% worth it!",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES. Take it for sure if you can get into it. This is absolutely my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. Everyone in it is so committed to do well on the project and not for the grade, and the instructors are so amazingly dedicated to this class. The projects we work on meet real clinician needs. Yes, the workload is high so you should arrange time in your schedule or just be extra motivated. It also never feels like work in the same way a paper\/problem set feels like work, and I think students put in the time because they genuinely want to, not because they have to. I also loved the team experience.",
    "Absolutely. This is probably the most rewarding class you will take at Yale. It gives you the opportunity to engage with a real clinical problem and see the process through from abstract ideation to a final, tangible prototype. While it is a lot of work at the end of the semester, you will want to put in that time to make sure the project reaches its full potential. The professors and TAs are wonderful people who put in a lot of time to make sure your team succeeds.",
    "HELL YES. But it's also a question of would I recommend you to this course. To that I might say no. It's not for everyone.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any engineering student and any student who likes making things. This class was my first engineering project at Yale and has confirmed everything I wanted to do with my life. Additionally, the amount of skills you learn in this class on the fly are abundant, and the best part is you don't have to do it alone. You learn so much from others while working in groups which is another added bonus to the course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can and it sounds interesting to you! It is capped (20 students this semester), so you stand your best chance of getting in if you try to enroll both junior and senior years. As a design class, the emphasis is on upperclassmen. It can be a ton of work, but it really is up to you. The project is entirely your teams, so if you work more in the beginning of the semester on the project, then it won't be so killer towards the end. That said, it seemed like most project teams ended up taking it easier early on and then taking it to crunch time at the end, anyway! You really have a lot of independence with your project. Definitely a class to experience if you can!",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES!!! This was the most rewarding and intense class I have taken at Yale, but it was so worth it in the end. I actually went through 404 withdrawal after the class ended, which really doesn't happen with other classes. The class is what you make of it, so if you decide to put a lot of time and effort into your project and build a great device (as everyone did), then yes it will have amounted to a HUGE commitment to this one class alone, but you'll get a ton out of it. Everyone in your group also tends to get pretty close because you spend so much time together.",
    "Absolutely. I would say pick other courses carefully though, not because this class is on paper a lot of work (the assignments are totally manageable as a team), but rather because the more you dig into it, the more you get out of it: and THAT can become a lot as you get more and more invested in your project and begin to take pride in and ownership of it.",
    "Yes yes yes. Take if you can commit. You will not regret.",
    "YES!!! This course is by far my favorite at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it!! You put what you learn to practice in a whole new way",
    "Take this class! It doesn't matter what your major is, this course is phenomenal. You will design your own medical device and have a working prototype at the end of 16 weeks which is an amazing accomplishment.",
    "As a senior, this is by far the best course I have taken at Yale. It is incredible, and I could not recommend it enough. If you are able to get in, TAKE IT. Do not let the workload or not being an engineer scare you off - the teaching staff is there to help you along the way, and I have never met a more dedicated, hands-on set of instructors! I knew basically nothing about engineering at the start of the semester but learned so much along the way without feeling stressed. We also learned from an impressive line-up of guest lecturers in the field, had a field trip to the OR, and practiced surgical skills ourselves in the CEID. If you are at all interested in healthcare, medical devices, or even just learning a new set of skills (for a non-engineer), you must take this. There was not one time in the entire semester that I did not look forward to going to class. It never felt like work because it was fun, even though we put in long hours, especially around finals time. Just be ready to spend a large amount of time in the CEID during reading period and in the beginning of finals, but it's worth it. At the end of 15 weeks, I was able to hold a medical device that I helped design a build with really cool technology that could actually help physicians in their practice. That's amazing! Plus, the physician teams are awesome, and it's an honor to work with them.",
    "I'd recommend this course to other students only if they are extremely dedicated to spending a lot of time working on their projects. It's a great course if you're really interested in spending hours working on your project, and the instructors are all really invested in helping you succeed. I had a lot of fun with the class but I also spent more time on this class than all my other classes put together this semester. It's a learning experience, and I really loved doing something concrete with all the engineering things we learn here. The assignments were all pretty necessary but they can take a long time - there's a surprising amount of writing in this class."
