    "I definitely recommend PLSH 140. In a really small class setting, you have the opportunity to improve your Polish language, writing, and reading skills while delving into a topic that that the class picks out at the beginning of the term. This year we focussed on the Polish immigrant experience. Pani Illakowicz is an incredible Professor, who provides interesting reading and media assignments that really help you appreciate Polish culture. Plus, she is always connected the Polish-related event in New Haven, if you want to go beyond the class setting. Overall, kind Professor and non-stressful learning environment."
