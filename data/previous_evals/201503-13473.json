    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Marlyse is an extremely knowledgeable teaching assistant, and is responsive to student concerns. She was the best, most prepared TA I have yet had at Yale, and could easily teach a version of this course.",
    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Personable, accessible and enthusiastic about the subject matter. Marlyse was interested in making class fun for all of us. She was present and engaged. Her peer or near-peer approach was appropriate for the set of students electing to take this course. When unsure of something, Marlyse was willing to do additional research and get back to us.",
    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Marlyse was overall an organized TA who really knew the course material well and made herself available to students when needed. Despite living far from campus and having other obligations, she made time for the students and was flexible in her scheduling to meet the students' needs. I thought she was a little set in her ways and sometimes it was hard for students to voice their opinions or ideas and feel like there was space for those to be heard. In that respect, sometimes I felt like we were being lectured at a little too much and their was little room for discussion. I think she could improve her teaching by giving more time for questions and discussion among the students and spending a little less time talking and informing the students. In addition, sometimes I felt like when she wasn't sure the answer to a question asked by a student, her response gave off an air that such knowledge was not really important or that because she didn't know the answer it wasn't important. Despite this, I appreciated her guidance and knowledge and would recommend the class to others if she was the teaching assistant in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Great class. However a little nervous about the final and what material will be on it",
    "Understanding the concepts of dendrology is extremely important for anyone interested in the environment and or forestry.",
    "I felt like there were a few too many field trips and they really slowed towards the end of the semester. I think we could have all used a couple more lectures on the slide material (which we were ultimately responsible for on the final). The readings were too dense to read outside of class without discussions\/lectures with the instructors.",
    "In terms of field trips (Q's 8-10) I really appreciated how field-oriented the class was. Within a schedule involving many lectures and classroom-based learning, this class was exactly what I needed to remind me of how much learning can be done outside and why the field of ecology is so interesting to me. I felt I learned an incredible amount about class material, tree identification, as well as important habitats and habitat structure within CT through this course. All of these were learned to a higher degree than would have been via memorization in a classroom. Spending all classes doing hands-on learning was very important to me and I would strongly suggest a continuation of this approach as much as possible in the future. However, I think that it does mean that some of the textbook and lecture material regarding taxonomy and natural history of trees and ecological communities in the area is not learned as well. Because these concepts are more up to the students to learn on their own time, for me, at least, it was difficult to make the time to study and internalize these on my own when there was no time or place to discuss the material with other students. I wish there had been some optional classes in addition to the regular weekly meeting to go over the material that was not covered in the field. I would hope such opportunities would be available for future students. In terms of the instructor (Q's 11-13) I did not feel like I really had time to get to know her and so it was hard to become familiar with her teaching style. I felt like the TA took on much of the teaching in the class. It was clear that Professor Camp is very knowledgeable about forest ecology and I wish there had been more of an opportunity to absorb that. Similar to the TA, I felt like she was a little set in her ways and had an agenda to accomplish which sometimes got in the way of my learning and curiosity."

    "Prep for the final",
    "none",
    "As I said above, less field trips and a few more lectures, interspersed.",
    "The course takes a \"flipped classroom\" approach in the sense that there are a series of lectures that are asked about on the final exam but are never actually discussed in class. It's not really flipped, however, because not only are lectures not reviewed but none of the material covered in these lectures is discussed at any point during the semester. This makes studying for the final exam extremely challenging. A few of the late semester field trips should be replaced with more traditional in-class lectures.",
    "It was difficult to determine which reading to do when. Break the reading list into week-by-week assignments and reinforce with class discussion (while in the field or while traveling to the field) or weekly single question quizzes (even verbal quizzes that don't really matter).",
    "I think finding a way to continue to go into the field as much as possible while still communicating the information in the lectures and allowing more opportunities for student discussion would help this course. Personally, I would have benefited from a little more time to ourselves in the woods to look at things and test our knowledge or to really know a plant and not feel like we had a strict agenda we had to follow."

    "One of the best things about this class is the mix of students that choose to take it - including MF, SOM, Architecture, College, etc.",
    "This course is important to me because it has allowed me to become familiar with a wide variety of habitats in Connecticut and by extrapolation northern hardwood forests in the Eastern United States. It also allowed me to see how species of tree and shrub here fit into the bigger picture of the vegetation of the world, and how they interact with each other. Finally, it allowed me to spend time outside observing the world and paying close attention to small details that I may not have noticed without this course. I feel this class was a good lesson in observation that will be helpful in any career I choose down the road, especially one that is related to ecology or conservation."
