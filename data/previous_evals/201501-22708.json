   "comments": [
    "Don't take it. Turned me off to science, and a complete waste of time",
    "Don't take it-- the paper is a pain, and it is just something that irritates you every Friday afternoon.",
    "As everyone probably knows, this is the last year of PSE. I'll admit I've done my fair share of complaining about the class, but when I look back, I realize that PSE is love, PSE is life. I will be getting PSE tattooed on my neck to honor the greatest course that ever was. Long live PSE!",
    "I'd recommend providing they eliminate the discussion section element.",
    "Just don't do this to yourself, just an annoying class\/waste of time.",
    "I should have listened to other people and never taken PSE. Absolute waste of my time and my credit. Nothing good came out of this class.",
    "Do not take unless you know for 100% that you are staying to do research this summer.",
    "No, I think there are slightly more specialized classes that would serve the purpose just as well.",
    "It's a shame that PSE will not be continued next year - I really looked forward to the lectures every Friday.",
    "For future PSE students (I hope there are some!) this won't be too relevant, because the course will probably have been altered substantially. In general PSE is a good class - most of the lectures are interesting, the section is fun, and it's not too much work. I advise you to start on your research paper early if you can - I wrote about 60% of it during reading week and finals period, which was not a smart idea. I also would not recommend this class if you're only interested in one science, and hate all of the others. Physics students who don't think biology is a real science, for example, might not like PSE. I'm mostly interested in biology, but I like most other scientific disciplines too, and I thought it was fun to be exposed to some totally different topics - my favorite lecture, for example, was about the direction of magma flow beneath the Earth's crust. PSE is also a great place to meet people - you're tossed into a section with a whole bunch of other sciencey freshmen, and friendships follow naturally. The professors are also excited to be there, and make themselves really accessible - I organized a dinner with my section leaders at the end of first semester, and if I hadn't been dying of finals I probably would have done that second semester as well. In general, while PSE gets a bad rap sometimes, it was a good fit for me, and I hope they bring it back!",
    "Good survey course for students interested in science, but the lectures are sometimes beyond the technical understanding of students and the psets can be unnecessarily tedious. Not the greatest course at Yale, but I have no regrets about taking it. Discussion section is often fun. The final paper is a huge undertaking, so budget your time in advance and try to get it done before reading week\/finals.",
    "A great course and sad to see it go. It provides a good broad understanding of science and engineering and the research pursued. I would recommend it for people who are unsure of what major they are interested in, or are willing to learn a very broad category of SE majors."
