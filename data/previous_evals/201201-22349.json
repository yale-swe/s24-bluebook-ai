    "Incredible opportunity to delve into the field of modern-day evolutionary medicine. Key-note speakers are foremost front-men of the field and speak about their theories\/studies freely.",
    "Topics are introduced through journal articles eachweek. You read the articles and discuss in class. People will say this course is not a lot of work, and perhaps it isn't compared to courses based heavily on in-class exams and lectures, but it is definitely what you make of it-- the more time you invest into reading the papers and asking questions, the more you will learn. Take it if you want support with applying for summer research positions and funding.",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of reading. You read several (usually dense) papers a week, with a new topic each week. It's not enough to read; you have to come prepared to discuss. The class will likely push you out of your comfort zone. Because of the small size, you get to be pretty close with the other students. Prof. Stearns comes off as intimidating, but is actually a wonderful resource. Also, the summer research component (you can go literally anywhere in the world) is something you can't get from any other class. You won't regret taking this class.",
    "Take this if you can! It's really a great seminar, with a very relaxed teaching style. Evo thinking in medicine is the next big thinking, and if you are pre-med, it is fantastic. The teachers are awesome, and know so so much. You will learn a lot from the papers, even if you think that over the semester, you haven't learned anything. This kind of thinking is really not there in medicine, and so you will really be at the cutting edge of knowledge. Sometimes, the class is frustrating bc you have no clue what's happening, and you seem to have a lot of questions about the principles even behind the papers. But, over time you get way more comfortable with reading scientific papers and know how to write a research proposal. Also, they help you develop summer projects abroad in labs, which is really awesome. Very low workload - meets once a week actually - and you have dinner with these invited professors too once in a while. In all, probably the best science seminar at Yale, even if it might seem really frustrating at times.",
    "This is a pretty cool class. Most of the papers have been interesting, and there have been a couple papers that were so awesome I had to tell my suitemates about them. Sometimes it's hard to get the class discussion going, but sometimes we can have really good discussions. And it's not a ridiculous amount of work or anything.",
    "Highly recommend."
