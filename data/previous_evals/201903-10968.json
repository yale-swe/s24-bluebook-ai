   "comments": [
    "I learned to not worry as much about the content of my writing and to relax. I learned how to write more directly (much easier when Verlyn taught me to stop overthinking so much). I got to read a ton of awesome prose by my classmates and other writers too.",
    "learned how to write more clearly and to appreciate the art of writing. feel like my relationship to writing has completely transformed and I am an infinitely better writer than I was in august.",
    "I learned to write more clearly, and I pushed myself to try more and more imaginative forms of nonfiction writing.",
    "I became an infinitely better writer and communicator. I gained a community of fellow-writers, and became much more confident in my self-expression.",
    "I learned how to be a better writer by striving for complete awareness over the sentences Im writing.",
    "So much! I learned to notice whats around me, to throw out old\/bad writing advice from my past, to focus on detail and rhythm, to write clean\/crisp prose, to read with an eye for craft and composition. This class is invaluable.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this workshop. I learned how to break down my writing to the sentence level, and think about rhythm and structure in innovative ways.",
    "In this course I learned to pay more attention to my prose and the way that I feel about it. I was really struck by the way that, by the end of the course, I felt more free in my writing.",
    "This class taught me more about how to write than any other I have ever taken. I am a much more confident writer from taking this course and feel liberated from certain academic grammar rules. I also hadn't thought that much about the rhythm of sentences and learning about that has also helped my writing.",
    "I thought about writing in a new way. I became a stronger writer, a more confident writer, and a more enthusiastic writer too. I'm proud of what I accomplished in this class and so grateful for the experience.",
    "Wonderful class for working on writing at the sentence level. All about improving style and coherence and making one's writing understandable.",
    "My writing improved SO much during this course. I was able to focus on the smallest aspect of writing and clean up my messy prose. It also changed my concept of what is worth writing ABOUT, and it inspired me to explore nonfiction further."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lots of writing and freedom. Great feedback and line edits that really helped me improve my writing. Weaknesses: It would be nice to have the opportunity to revise pieces as part of the class -- Verlyn offered to review those as well, but because it wasn't a part of the class, I was much less motivated to write revisions.",
    "great assignments. verlyn is the absolute best teacher and gives great feedback.",
    "I think this course is practically perfect in its structure. You write two pages on whatever you want each week, and you are encouraged to experiment with many different forms and styles. It's great practice, and I found myself really motivated each week to write a better piece than the last.",
    "This is a wonderful course. The level of work throughout is perfect. Verlyn is a thoughtful and perceptive reader, and he's great at teaching you how to say what you want to say well. The only think I might change is that I'd have liked a final project of some sort... a slightly longer piece perhaps, so that we'd have a chance to explore revision!",
    "Professor Klinkenborgs knowledge, kindness, accessibility, and exceptional teaching skills are the courses strengths.",
    "Everything about this course is great. I love the simplicity of itits minimal like the sentences we learn to write. We write two pages each week, and its a wonderful chance to practice writing over and over again.",
    "I liked how the workshop was always structured the same way: we read and discussed a piece of short creative nonfiction, then discussed our own writing. I really was able to understand by the end of the workshop where I struggled as a writer.",
    "Strengths: Verlyn is caring, committed, and his attention to detail and growth over time are spectacular. I also appreciated the consistency of the class format: discuss readings, discuss bad sentences, discuss workshop pieces. Weaknesses: Sometimes our comments about classmates writing felt a bit too surface-level, and awkwardly set up in an awkwardly anonymized third-person way, where we talked about the writers almost as if they werent in the room. Without being able to read the piece in advance (as most other workshops allow for), it was difficult to give feedback on the fly and sometimes I felt uncomfortable by the quick passes we made over pieces that deserved more time. Setting some norms for workshopping goals from the get-go might be helpful in future classes.",
    "The format of writing two pages each week worked well. Verlyn was also incredibly helpful in office hours having one-on-one time to talk about assignments really helped me improve.",
    "It was a fantastic course. I looked forward to coming to class every week. No weaknesses.",
    "I think this class is almost perfect. If anything, I would have loved to talk to Verlyn even more about my writing, and I went to his office hours every week. That's a bit unrealistic though, as he's plenty busy.",
    "Strength was the feedback Professor Klinkenborg gave us on each piece we wrote. More diverse readings would helpful on the reading side of the course.",
    "The only weakness is really the reading list. I talked about this with many students, and we all agreed that the diversity could be improved. Not just for race or gender identity, but with writing style as well. But the class WILL improve your writing. 100% guarantee. We read everyone's samples every week, and I truly believe every single one of us has improved in clarity, emotional impact, and just plain beauty of our writing."

   "comments": [
    "Take it! The class is fun, engaging, and will improve your writing. It's so pleasant to take a class that I don't have to stress about but that I still learn a lot from.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY. best class i've taken at yale and verlyn is the most wonderful teacher you will ever have.",
    "Absolutely. You'll have to think about writing in a completely new way, and you'll gain lots of practice in constructing beautiful and inventive sentences. It boosted my confidence as a writer more than any other class I've taken.",
    "If you can take this class, you should. And if you do, go to office hours! I'm always skeptical when people say that a class changed their lives, but in this case it's true. I feel infinitely more able to express myself as a writer and a person. Verlyn is a wonderful teacher. He'll read your work carefully, and he'll give you feedback that is useful, perceptive, and kind. The class was always a bright spot in my week. I don't think a single one went by without lots of gems of writing wisdom, and some raucous laughter.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn to write excellent prose by learning to perfect his or her sentences.",
    "Yes!! This course is everything you need to know about writing. It will change the way you look at all your academic writing, and youll have fun taking it, too. Be aware, though, that this is a classic you get out of it what you put into it type course. If you decide to take it, go all in. Spend lots of time on your pieces, participate in class, and go to office hours. It will make all the difference.",
    "Absolutely! Verlyn has a way of getting you to see writing as a magical act, where you come to the page with myriad possibilities each time. I think it's a really good workshop to take whether or not you want to be a writer. It renews your ability to see language as something genuinely exciting (in an academic, professional, or creative context).",
    "I would recommend Genre to another student with two significant asterisks. The first is that both the classroom and the syllabus are fairly white. The second is that Verlyns teaching style may encourage you to sound more like him rather than more like you. I didnt feel like we read a diverse range of styles; rather, a series of writers who accomplished a similar tone that Verlyn values. To be fair, I thought that all the writers on our syllabus were impressive and their writing techniques powerful. I just think the quietly meditative, elliptical voice that we learned to imitate isn't conducive to everyone's writing voice. And it shouldnt have to be.",
    "I would recommend this class Verlyn is a wonderful and supportive teacher and everyone's writing improved so much throughout the course of the semester.",
    "Absolutely! Everyone would benefit immensely from taking this course. It changed the way you think about your writing. Its a great opportunity.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm so glad I was able to engage with writing in a new context. It has made me more excited about writing in general. Verlyn is such a great professor and just a nice guy to talk to.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend this course to a student wanting a creative writing class that isn't strict about subject.",
    "YES. If you care about writing, want to be a better writer, or just receive some damn good feedback and lots of one-on-one time with a professional writer, you should take this course."
