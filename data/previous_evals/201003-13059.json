   "comments": [
    "This class is pretty interesting. It's not the most exciting class you will ever take, but it is a requirement for the philosophy major. I would recommend this class to prospective philosophy majors because I think it is a good class to take as a freshman or sophomore. In other words, if you are considering the major, take the class. I would not recommend this class to people who are not interested in the major. There are definitely better philosophy classes out there for someone who just likes philosophy but has no plans to seriously pursue it. Also, the grading in this class is very hard. I don't think Bobzien is even teaching it next year, so this may be completely irrelevant, but she is a serious grade deflator. It's not too hard to get a B, but I don't think more than a couple kids get A's. If there is a new professor, then the grading will probably be easier. Overall, this class is pretty average--not great, not terrible. Shop it and you can get a feel for the professor and the way lectures will be throughout the semester.",
    "If you're interested in philosophy, this is a good starting point.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for the major. You may think it will be a good starting course or that Plato and Aristotle are fascinating, all of which is true, but overall it is not worth it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR",
    "Most students were in the course as intended philosophy majors. If you did not take DS, this is a nice opportunity to read Plato and Aristotle (Plato in particular was so much fun reading). Although the course is a bit dry, it is also very helpful in understanding the ancient philosophers and learning about the logical structure of a philosophy argument.",
    "not really.. but you have to for the major. The material is awesome but prof bobzien is dry, very dry. The essay questions are hard and tricky, the grading is extremely hard and in general i feel that because i was not enagaged in lecture i stopped carring for the class as much as i would like to..",
    "Only take it for the major.",
    "The material is very interesting, but professor Bobzien is not. Take the class if you have to, but try to take it with someone else if possible. Not a ton of work, but the few things you do turn in are graded harshly. The reading is manageable.",
    "Work load isn't heavy -- three papers (3-5, 5-10, 10-15); the reading isn't heavy but can sometimes be tedious and\/or boring. Prof. Bobzien is a charming and brilliant individual, although some found her lectures dull. Overall, I probably would not recommend it unless you are extremely interested in Ancient Philosophy.",
    "Terrible course. The only reason to go to class is to get the lecture notes. Listening to Prof. Bobzein intently and interestedly is quite a feat few can pull off. Take it only if you are unfortunate enough to be a non-DS Philosophy major. On the other hand, there is virtually no work at all. A tiny bit of reading and a few short papers comprise the entirety of this class. If you're incredibly interested in what can be taken most accurately to be Socrates's argument in one particular translation of the Republic, and whether it actually is valid, then maybe you would be interested in bits of this course. But I doubt it.",
    "Although it was a good class overall, Iwouldn't really recommend it. I took this class to have the foundation of Plato and Aristotle for further philosophy courses. (I don't need it for my major.) In that respect, I do not regret that I took the course, as I now have a basic familiarity with what they said, although I am still far behind DSers. I would not recommend this course just for fun. The subject matter is only interesting insofar as you think that it will be useful for other classes, and it is not really inherently enjoyable. Professor Bobzien, while a great professor and a brilliant (but dry) lecturer, is an extremely hard grader and sometimes the grading seemed arbitrary. Because of this, make sure that there is a good TF before you take the class or you will be frustrated the whole semester. The reading is not overwhelming, nor are the papers.",
    "I'm a junior philosophy major who was required to take this class. If you're a philosophy major, you certainly won't find this the most interesting lecture you're taking. Go to section and pay attention then to figure out what you need to know. My advice for majors is to take this class earlier rather than later once you're decided on the philosophy major. The more you know about philosophy, and the more you've studied various \"big topics\" in philosophy in depth, the less interesting you will find this class. So get it over with. If you're not big into philosophy and you're just looking for a fun, not-too-difficult class on some interesting issues in philosophy, I would hands-down recommend taking introduction to early modern philosophy in the spring instead. You'll study Descartes, John Locke (his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, not political works), Leibniz, David Hume, Berkeley, and Kant, who are all fascinating. Their arguments are much more sophisticated and interesting than just about anything you'll find in Plato or Aristotle.",
    "In depth introduction to the ancient philosophers. Lays a solid foundation for people beginning philosophy and for those without much background in the ancient philosophers. Be prepared to put in a lot of careful work for the papers.",
    "Yes, very good introduction to the world of philosophy and learning how to talk about it all.",
    "Students who wish to take a solid introductory course to ancient Greek philosophy should take Phil 125 01. Be forewarned though, you will be reading the occasionally dense passage and listening to the (occasionally) dull lecture but the information gleaned is worth it even if you are not particularly interested in philosophy. It\u0092s a good course to take if you just want a relatively easy workload and an insightful class.",
    "Ancient Philosophy teaches you to identify and critically evaluate every assumption and logical step in an argument. Doing so will help you be a more rigorous reader and debater.",
    "If you are taking this class, you are taking it because you have to. If you don't have to, then only take this if you want to do a class on ancient Greek literature, not if you want to take a class on philosophy."
