   "comments": [
    "This class covers the Cold War in Latin America, focusing on Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua in the first part and then moving to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, the recent violence in Colombia, and Evo Morales and indigenismo in Bolivia. Students are exposed to information that is hard to find elsewhere at Yale and is incredibly valuable. I almost wish that this class was a lecture in that I think that a lot more people should be exposed to these topics, but it is a truly great experience to have it as a seminar and to be able to process the information through classroom discussion, led by the brilliant Gil Joseph. Work includes the readings (not too much but significant), leading discussion once with a partner, writinga journal responding to the weekly material for the first part of class, and a 20 pg final paper.",
    "Absolutely. Take this. Latin America is so important and has such a rich history. This course gives a totally different perspective on the Cold War andon these revolutions (than offered by the U.S.\/Grand Strategy), as it favors looking on-the-ground and more from the LA point of view (Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia (counter-), Bolivia, and esp. Nicaragua). Plus, revolution and Cold War are just exciting to study. The syllabus (which is full of interesting readings, news articles, exciting films) gives way to comparative analysis that reinforces themes and regional trends, but definitely allows you to understand the countries on their own terms.",
    "If you're interested in Latin America, however remotely, take this course. The readings are fascinating, the Professor knows and loves what he teaches, and you get to learn about how important Latin America is becoming for the world.",
    "HIST 372J was a fine course. Professor Joseph is an incredibly nice guy and smart. I enjoyed the Nicaragua case the most, partly because it was really the only country we were able to spend several weeks on. Discussion was good and the final paper was fun if you pick a topic you're interested in. However, I really hated the \"journal.\" It's pretty much the worst. Don't do it as a journal: just write it like a first draft of a paper right before the deadline.",
    "This is such a great class. Take it if you can! Professor Joseph is a great professor, incredibly committed to his students. The subject matter is really interesting, the course moves at a great pace, and all the assignments feel relevant. I highly recommend it, it's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This has been one of the most exciting and interesting classes I have ever taken, and I feel so fortunate to have spent a semester thinking about these issues with Professor Joseph. If you are at all interested in Latin America or Revolution you should take it.",
    "Overall a very enjoyable class and a good introduction to the politics of Latin America in the 20th century, but sometimes I had the feeling that we were jumping around a little too much between countries. It would have been nicer to stick with maybe 3 of them and learn about each in a little more depth.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar that serves as a great introduction into Latin America during a very hot period in its history, ironically during the Cold War.",
    "If you can, take this course. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Joseph is amazing and the course material and subject matter is great.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It was my final writing credit but I got very into the material. A great in depth view of Latin American revolutions. Professor Joseph is a walking history book who seems to know about everything through first hand experience. I only wish we had had more time to investigate each revolution more. The readings were a lot some weeks, but they were very interesting as a whole. Professor Joseph is one of the most genuine people I know and it shows in his course.",
    "YES!! If you get in, take it! It's a stunning course that teaches you so much. I have developed a new, and I think lifelong passion, for this time and area because of this class. I learned so much. And I can not say enough about Professor Joseph. He makes this class. I have never had a professor care more about his students and go out of his way to get to know them. His support, kindness, and generally wonderful nature are one of a kind. Plus he assembles an amazing group of kids for the class, with diverse interests and backgrounds that I was learn so lucky to learn from."
