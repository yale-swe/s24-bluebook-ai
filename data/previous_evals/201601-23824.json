    "Math 822 introduces some of the connections between topology and group theory. The first half of the course focuses more on topology and extensions, while the second have dives into hyperbolic geometry. The pace of the course is good, and Sam is an excellent lecturer who makes the material interesting and approachable. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
