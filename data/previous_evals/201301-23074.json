    "Yes I would! I loved this class. Take it, take it!",
    "English 013 wasn't what I expected it to be about - it focused more on forms of electronic communication versus non-electronic, so I think the alternate title, \"Communication and Intimacy, Unplugged,\" would be more appropriate. There are occasional screenings which may take up a lot of time, but they're worth going to - you get to watch a great movie and eat delicious food. Also, there are journal entries and a few papers. However, the readings are a little overwhelming - there are just so many. I personally didn't do all of them (or remotely close to all of them, if I must confess...), but I think doing more of them would make the class more rewarding. You also may visit the Beinecke Library and the Yale University Art Gallery - both are really cool and enlightening visits. Unfortunately, I missed the class lunch at a restaurant, but that may be something to look forward to as well at the end of the semester.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. You will learn a lot about topics that are relevant to your daily life, and get to explore different topics in both creative and analytical ways.",
    "It was fun, and if you like talking about this stuff, take this course. It's not very hard and the people who are in it with you will probably be cool, at least a few of them. If you don't like discussion or doing readings, don't take it, because without doing these things, you could still pass the class but it would be incredibly boring.",
    "I originally signed up for this class because I needed a writing credit and I didn't get into the ENGL121 class that I wanted, but I actually really enjoyed this class. Definitely take it if you enjoy discussing technology's impact on our world and our communcation. However, I can't promise you the same awesome experience I had because the feeling of this class is largely determined by who is in the class, so I hope that if you decide to take this class and get it, you are an awesome person.",
    "Yes, take it if the topic interests you and if you have the time to do the readings.",
    "i definitely recommend it. not an overwhelming course, but certainly manageable if it is of interest to students. really great topic.",
    "It's a great course! Definitely take it!",
    "Definitely! This is a fantastic class. It is definitely worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend! Just beware that this will probably be a full seminar.",
    "If you want a course that examines the ways in which people communicate now and used to communicate and the reasons why people communicate(d) in those ways, take this course. I recommend this course. We watched a bunch of great films and got to write about them if we wanted to. The books are good too. The topics are interesting and relevant. I frequently questioned my own communication practices during this course, and it has made a lasting impact on me.",
    "The class delves into an interesting and relevant issue - technology and social networking. It makes you think about it in a way maybe you hadn't before. Although sometimes dry at times, the discussions could get very deep and enlightening. the texts are also interesting. Definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely!! Take it!!!",
    "Truly fun, interesting, and interactive course. Class revolves around group discussion of read or viewed materials and can be very free flowing and exciting. Prof. Campbell is a wonderful teacher and the course itself reflects her excellent judgment in literature and films. If you like English and are interested in human forms of communication. You really should take this class."
