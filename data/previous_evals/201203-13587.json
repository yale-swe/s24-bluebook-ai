    "I think Susan's theory is that learning is best done by trying but I struggled to apply the concepts welearned from the reading and in class to our individual cases. I think more discussion of the cases in the casebook in class would've been helpful. It was a lot to digest and a foreign subject for natural scientists and having Susan's support in breaking down how the analysis is performed would've been very valuable. That said, I did not try to go see Susan outside of class as she suggested, so that might've helped had I done so.",
    "Prof. Clark was available for lengthy discussion outside of class and really invests herself into getting to know her students' backgrounds and goals with respect to the class material and their FES experience in general. Her dedication to her students is unusual and refreshing based on my time at FES thus far.The textbooks were very clearly written and helpful in grasping the policy sciences framework.",
    "Very useful in identifying policy problems",
    "The teacher is very cagey when trying to explain the concepts. Sometimes, when you ask her a question,she won't answer and just smiles instead. In the beginning, I thought the smile meant I had the right answer. I learned later that it meant that she was amused by my attempt at understanding the material. There are a lot of readings. Some are useful, some are not. The most useful things are the Policy Sciences handbook, readings that use the policy sciences to analyze a specific case, and then trying to apply the policy sciences to a case of personal interest.",
    "Q12. The course is very specific and goes deep into studying a method for approaching environmental problems.",
    "The material of this class is essential. The teaching was unlike anything I've ever seen before, and consequently, was strangely de-centering. The disparity between the value of the material, and the strangeness of the teaching in the classroom dominates the character of the class."

    "The lectures were not always helpful.",
    "The connection between the book and the class lectures was limited. Class lectures were unstructured and very difficult to follow.",
    "Lecture Power points were often extremely reduddant.",
    "Should be more organised",
    "The teacher needs to try to explain things. When a student asks her a question about a concept, she needs to provide the answer.",
    "The reading assignments were sometimes difficult to tie with the concept studied.",
    "I would like the classroom to discuss the readings more. It respects a student to deal with the readings in class. otherwise, students are left wondering why they spent so much time reading, and how the reading fits into the material. especially in a class like this where the connections are not always obvious. The case book could be used better to explain concepts. this material is best understood in practice. since there is a limited degree to which we can be in 'practice' in one semester, in the classroom, the casebook seems like a logical choice for exploring concepts in practice.Also, communication in the classroom between the students and the instructor seemed disconnected. It felt like the instructor was often trying to explain the importance of the material, when the students already agreed the material was important, and were just trying to understand what the material was.",
    "Reading materials and especially class time could be better organised.More direct and continuous feedback from instructor, especially regarding course journals, would be helpful.Course could spend less time 'selling' the policy sciences and more time e.g. on discussing and demonstrating their use."

I also thought we spent a lot of time on the instructors various decision seminars instead of the material. The knowledge\/skills met my expectations in terms of its value, but I would have liked to have a community in the classroom where we could discuss the material in more detail.",

VERY frustrating, but I think that was just one person and not true for the other groups.",
    "The advantages of the group work in this course was the ability to talk to other students about what theywere learning. There were no disadvantages.",

This would save a lot of time when trying to write the final presentation and paper.",

    "Take the course, and put a lot of energy into the readings and the journaling. Be ready for a very unconventional, and perhaps frustrating classroom experience.",
    "The course is ultimately very helpful and rewarding, but it will not seem like it for the longest time. Be prepared for a lot of confusion and wondering what's going on and questioning what on earth you're doing. Class sometimes felt a bit like therapy - confusing, unclear, and painful for the brain, but ultimately with a purpose, even if not immediately apparent. Trust that it will be helpful in the end."
