   "comments": [
    "Basic microeconomics. I would not recommend it since I felt that it was irrelevant to our degree program.",
    "Crash course in Microeconomics. I'm curious why Micro was chosen as the prereq instead of Macro, but that has nothing to do with Mike.",
    "Complete waste of time. Do not take unless the course is significantly reworked or taught by another professor.",
    "It is one of the few intermediate economics courses that is not PhD level nor for undergraduates. I would recommend it to students who are comfortable with economics as well as math. Both the professor and the teaching fellow communicated explanations with fractions and mathematics, when we, as social science students, wanted to be able to grasp the qualitative explanation first, then apply the quantitative.",
    "It seemed like a good introduction to mainstream microeconomic thought but also seemed pretty uncritical of the bases of that thought. I'm not sure why the IR course has a compulsory micro class but not a compulsory macro class - maybe it would be better to make the compulsory class a mixture of microand macro, aimed at generalist IR students.",
    "Good primer for those with little or no coursework in micro.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "INRL 781 is an IR core course for Jackson Institute students. It attempts to provide students with a basic understanding of economic principles. It covers topics such as supply\/demand, social welfare, monopolies, and the labor market.I would recommend this course for students who have a strong economics background. I would not recommend it for anybody else. You will not learn much, and you will find yourself very frustrated very regularly.The Jackson Institute is still trying to find its stride for the core curriculum; hopefully this course will be modified or be made optional.",
    "Intermediate general economics class. Definitely helps to have a really good grasp of the fundamentals of economics as well as being comfortable with math.",
    "I would summarize it as a course that would appeal to a graduate level microeconomics course. However, I would not recommend it to anyone who has little background in microeconomics at an undergraduate level.",
    "I would recommend this course for all students who want a basic understanding of micro-economics.",
    "This course introduced microeconomics well, according to the book.",
    "I think it's a good class if you already have a solid Econ background and want a refresher. Mike is great, but the material covered in class is fast-paced, so that would be a caveat for someone with very limited Econ knowledge.",
    "No. This class seemed to be better suited as an economics class in the economics department than an international relations class.",
    "The information is very important to understand but the course in its current form is lacking."

   "comments": [
    "I did not feel like I gained much.",
    "I don't plan to go into econ, so this was more helpful from the perspective of general knowledge than professional applicability.",
    "It really had no relations to my discipline or profession. A complete waste.",
    "I have decided to invest more of my time in economics after the inspiring uses of economics shown during example problems and also the professor's amazing array of economical applications in business.",
    "I feel I learned little microeconomics as a result of this course.",
    "This course provided me with some awareness of the basic principles of economics. Clearly though, for anybody going into public policy, they will need a lot more instruction on economics than what this course offers.",
    "Introduced me to some economics I was not familiar with before and deepened my knowledge of some economics I had cursory knowledge of. Would have been interesting to have had some more development examples.",
    "I have a much better understanding of economics than I previously did. I will walk away from it with the ability to think in economic terms about problems, overall.",
    "Economics is useful for EVERYONE doing public policy or international relations. It must be taught. How is the question.",
    "Got me interested in economics but did not give me the tools to adequately prepare me for higher level courses in the Econ department so I now feel somewhat at a loss for how to proceed with this discipline.",
    "It helped me to understand economic principles, but less application."
