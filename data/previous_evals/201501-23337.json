    "It is an excellent course in its structure and opportunities to learn from experts.",
    "Strengths: overall really great course, great in-depth discussion about various aspects of heart disease and stroke, including a variety of other interesting topics such as nutrition, sleep disorders, physical activity. Many distinguished guest speakers too! The few written assignments and presentation throughout the semester were helpful in better understanding the concepts. Weaknesses: I wish there were a couple of group activities throughout the semester, or practice with actually conducting a heart disease-related research project. The final project basically consists of designing your own research project, so it would have been helpful to have more practice in that regard.",
    "Very good course to learn about updates on prevention strategy, treatment and research related to cardiovascular disease and stroke",
    "The lectures are the best part. They are interactive and not just the professor reciting the slides. She'll put up figures, and based on our readings for that week, we discuss the figures and the challenges in presenting HD&S data. Very interesting, she had me engaged in almost every lecture!!! The guest lectures were all really good too, they all had great lecturing skills and kept students similarly engaged.",
    "Eh it was alright. Not very awe-inspiring but I learned a few things. I would have appreciated more of a biological background of CVD discussed in the class but I understand it's more epi and study design focussed. Some of the guest lecturers were REALLY good though like the physician who talked about the clinical side of CVD.",
    "strengths: instructor is amazing, very good guest lecturers, class topics, some students really talked about their experiences as clinicians weaknesses: not all the students in the class were very engaged, a little too focused on research, all of our readings were papers, which got boring after a while. I would have liked to discuss something besides cohorts. I'm not too sure I'll remember much from this course, I don't feel like I learned anything concrete",
    "This is a wonderful course! I enjoyed every minute of this class and it challenged me to think critically about disease trends and study designs. Dr.Lichtman is a wonderful lecturer and the opportunity to hear guest lecturers with specific interests was very insightful and engaging.",
    "Strengths: Lectures involve class discussions, engaging lectures, simple slides Weakness: Some guest speakers weren't as engaging",
    "I really enjoyed the all of the discussion in this class. I feel that we got a good idea of what is happening in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Judy's great! Super helpful and a very engaging professor.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is so knowledgeable and passionate about heart disease and stroke, she really makes you feel excited to learn about the subject. She is really friendly, accommodating, and always willing to help her students better understand concepts.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Have her expertise in the field and willing to share her knowledge with students.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is a great professor and lecturer. I really enjoyed how interactive this class was! The only weaknesses were the timeliness of feedback and the quality of the feedback given on assignments...but the focus for the course was not really on the quality of the work, rather the learning process and the challenges involved in quantifying some of these data.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Fun and funny lady who is passionate about the material and her students. Great speaker and lecture.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0strengths: really cared about the students, really got us engaged, asked us questions to keep us engaged and thinking and talking, met individually with students to provide help, never hesitated to give us time weaknesses: choose better readings, something besides papers, and focus on things outside of research methods",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr.Lichtman is a phenomenal professor. Her knowledge of the heart disease and stroke field is unparalleled and it was truly a privilege to be in her class. She challenges her students to think critically about the literature and provides helpful feedback on all assignments. She is the type of professor that I imagined having at YSPH but rarely found.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0This course is incredibly great. Judy is the most impressive prof I have ever met",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Strength: very open and encouraging, love the way she carries out lectures (discussion\/seminar style incorporated into ppt lectures) Weakness: feedback time with grading is a little slow"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about risk factors and impact of cardiovascular diseases on individuals and the population as a whole.",
    "If you are at all interested in learning more about heart disease and stroke, or anything related, this is a great course! Lots of reading and writing, but well worth it.",
    "Great course to consider if anyone wants to learn more about research in the cardiovascular and stroke filed. I would recommend to another students",
    "A great class with not too much work involved - you'll get a lot out of it if you have a medical background or are interested in HD&S. Probably one of my favorite courses at YSPH so far!",
    "It's a low level of work commitment which is nice but don't expect to get a WHOLE lot out of it. You might be better off taking the Nutrition & Chronic Disease course (if it's still as good as when Dr. Mayne taught it) which covers a lot of what is discussed in this course but in more detail and in better relation to overall health and nutrition.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "great course, learned some interesting stuff, made connections, but not sure how much I'll remember\/take with. But I would still recommend because the professor is amazing",
    "I would totally recommend this course! It requires some writing, but no tests. Also, the lectures are very engaging and Dr. Lichtman always welcomes discussions\/thoughts on concepts at hand",
    "I think it is definitely a good class to take, especially if you're interested in chronic disease."
