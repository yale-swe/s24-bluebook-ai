    "An interesting study of recent developments in China's civil society. Not as much discussion as other courses I've taken, but the readings are good and Professor Davis is very familiar with the field, and virtually anyone in it.",
    "The course was interesting and a broad overview to how civil society works in China. This is one of the only courses in the social sciences on China and really fascinating! The readings could be dense and discussions favored people who knew a lot about China (this is not a class for someone who doesn't know much about China), but it was really interesting.",
    "Great course. Fascinating readings. Listening to Professor Davis's personal experiences is reason enough to feel like I've learned something from the course, but unlike some professors, this doesn't dominate the course themes by any means. Definitely take the seminar, it's also great for writing the senior essay. Lots of reading.",
    "East Asian Studies 410 is a very rigorous course that takes an in-depth look at Civil Society in China. The course material is very interesting, but the course itself can be somewhat difficult. I would recommend it to students with a strong interest in China and\/or sociology.",
    "Yes yes yes! I learned more in this class than any other class I took at Yale. If you have any interest in China, you must take a course with Professor Davis. Not only has she been doing research in China for 30 years, but she also cares deeply about teaching. She goes out of her way to pick articles that from a variety of topics anddisciplines. After taking this course, I feel like I have an excellent grasp of what civil society looks like today in China. The workload was a lot, but definitely doable. The articles are for the most part primary sociology texts from the last few years, and thus you are reading cutting-edge research. In the course of reading them, you should learn not only about China, but about the discipline of sociology. This course had a language section, which was an excellent opportunity to keep up my Chinese, while also synthesizing the sometimes difficult class material. Everything about the course was amazing."
