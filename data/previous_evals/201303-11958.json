    "I loved this class. It's a great mix of art, art history, and modern art critique--all of which I found really interesting. Every week a new assignment would be due, a new visual history would be explored, and something mindblowing would be revealed.Well, I found it mindblowing at least. The concept of cultural appropriation made me more aware of injustice in real life. The idea that making fun of people is okay in some situations and not in others, and the subtle distinction there. The idea that art cannot be defined--that you cannot say what art is supposed to do--because you don't want to restrain all the possibilities that art can be. Art just is. The idea of viewing a piece of art as an idea through which technique is merely the medium. The idea that making art is being in touch with your humanity. The idea that art works on several levels as it's transmitted from creator to artist. This course made me realize exactly how much I love art in all its complexity.Dushko is great. He makes amazingly insightful comments that get to the soul of a piece, he's sarcastic and funny. He doesn't try to be better or more knowledgeable than us; like any great teacher, he makes us his equals. He also has a really interesting life story and makes great social commentary on the world, social issues, and Yale itself.If any of this connects with you, definitely take it. Since it's a freshman seminar, you'll also make a lot of close friends.",
    "It is an incredible are class espescially for someone who has no background in art.Yes, because it is enlightening and helps one to appreciate what really goes into artwork.",
    "A lot of the learning rests on your shoulders. Art 004 has changed the way I look at flat objects. However, I think that I could have got a lot more out of the course if I had done more research or reading about the instruction materials.",
    "Would recommend; an art class focusing on the meaning, construction, and communication involved in 2d art and less on technical skill",
    "It's an exploration into that weird space between literature and art, and your experience will largely depend on your classmates because reviewing their (and your ) work is a main part of the course."
