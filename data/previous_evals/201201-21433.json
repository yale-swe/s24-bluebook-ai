   "comments": [
    "Super interesting subject matter. Class discussion was often frustrating, though, and a bit unfocused. I expect this will be better next time around, and frankly if you've never studied anything like this before its worth it.",
    "A fantastic, but high-level class investigating imperialism in the Middle East. You definitely need a previous background in Middle Eastern history, but I highly recommend this course.",
    "GLBL 362 is an excellent course on the history of imperialism in the Middle East. The readings are really wonderful, covering a wide range of both theoretical and historical material. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "if this is your thing - insurgency, state building, etc. if you're less poli sci minded like me, I would look elsewhere. great in focusing on Maghreb though, so few yale MMES classes do that!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to students interested in a multifaceted approach to the complex and relevant questions of state-building and insurgency in the greater Middle East.So long as no clear answers or political objectives are expected, this is truly a rewarding course.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in the material. It is a good introduction to this subject in all its dimensions, from history to contemporary.",
    "There were some moments whenI really hated this class (mostly when discussions in class got hijacked by a few people and taken in a direction I really wasn't interested in) but it probably changed the way I think about the world and the Middle East more than every class I have taken at Yale except postcolonial theory. So... take it I guess?"
