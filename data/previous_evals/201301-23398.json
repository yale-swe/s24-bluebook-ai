   "comments": [
    "Not as easy as it looks... actually was a lot of work.",
    "Yes, this course covered the very basics of every aspect of vascular biology. The lectures are excellent. But you need to take difficult tests.",
    "If you're actively researching vasculature in some capacity, then the course is invaluable. If not, other course are likely a better use of time.",
    "This course covers current topics in vascular biology, and therefore I would recommend it to anyone that is planning on conducting research in this topic. The information provided is an excellent resource for anyone looking for answers in the field.",
    "I would recommend it, but would give the student fair warning that it is a bit disjointed. It's a good overview, but without the cohesion between lectures, it doesnt have the full impact it could.",
    "Most of the lectures could be learned by reading key journal articles. Therefore, in order to be more useful, it should introduce more basic concepts and have a textbook rather than papers. Also, the midterm and final are entirely too long and broad. There should be weekly questions rather than 2 massive exams upon which your complete grade is based. Attendance was not taken. This is not fair for those who showed up to class as many students did not on a weekly basis. Since the exams did not necessarily need you to be present in the lecture, this needs to be addressed.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in cardiology"

   "comments": [
    "The information reinforces what I already knew.",
    "Very much.",
    "I think it will prove very useful in my research.",
    "The examinations and the lecture notes provided me with an introduction to the types of experiments currently conducted in vascular biology, and will be useful to my future research.",
    "Weekly lectures covered too much material in a short time. For example, one cannot understand all the pathways of EC dysfunction in one lecture, so this was not retained knowledge. Should be treated more like a physiology class with a medical textbook for reference.",
    "The course was good but I think it would be a great idea if there was a paper reading\/ discussion section as the second lecture meeting where we could discuss some of the key themes and talk about the results of the papers in more detail.",
    "It was very comprehensive. I felt like a learned a lot from it."
