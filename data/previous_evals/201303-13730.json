    "RPE is a fantastic professor who cares deeply about the subject matter of the course and about students. I really appreciated his interest and enthusiasm, and particularly his admiration for colleagues who produced really strong work. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn from someone who is currently deeply involved in developing evidence and policy.",
    "I love the material, but lectures are a bit boring. I suggest making it more interactive. Also, maybe having more checkpoints for the systematic review would be helpful, and evaluating partners as workload was unevenly distributed in a couple of groups that I am aware of. Presentations also seem to have been graded rather strictly.",
    "not many strengths. regret taking the course, did not learn much. lectures were helpful and some were interesting. end project of writing systematic review was good for understanding a maternal child specific topic, but a relative waste of time. would have been much better if the instructor incorporated a final project that reflected everything taught in the powerpoints. for example, a team based project in which we evaluated a public health strategy related to maternal child nutrition would have helped us learn a lot",
    "Great course. Very interesting and applicable material. The systemmatic review was complicated but helpful.",
    "strengths are the professor's knowledge of the subject, and weekly assignments to understand content more.weaknesses are professor always ran over time, and group work was always at the end of class, making it rushed. class was very didactic and not engaging. maybe group work first would help this.",
    "The course has good intentions, but I can honestly say that I didn't learn much at all. The systematic review was almost pointless- if you want a course on writing a systematic review, then create a course that specifically revolves around that. I was expecting to come out with a great deal of knowledge on Maternal and Child health nutrition, but I didn't learn much outside of what Google could have taught me.",
    "I liked this course a lot, and appreciated insights provided by the instructor. The set-up of the course is good, with room for students to explore an area of interest in the systematic review, while integrating information learned throughout the semester.",
    "1. Have more time for discussion\/ questions during class time.2. Not going over class time would be great.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the course and was able to engage with what was learnt. I felt like at the end of the class I understand how to conduct a systematic review and walked away with a research skill I didn't previously have.The class was a bit didactic in the way it was structured with lectures in the beginning and group work at the end. I think having the group work in the beginning might be helpful in engaging the class and getting everyone to think about the topic and then learn more from the lecture."

    "I would recommend the course to other students who were interested in learning more on Maternal and Child Nutrition because it not only went over very interesting and important topics in the field, but also helped students learn research skills through conducting and presenting a systematic review."
