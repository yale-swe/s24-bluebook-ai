   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in myth and mythography. It was a great chance to read authors that I would not have likely encountered otherwise.",
    "I would describe it as a very good introduction to the important texts in the mythographic tradition, valuable for anyone interested in the artistic and philosophical appropriations of myth, medieval to modern.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class. It gives you a sound overview over the most important mythographers and their treatment of myth and allegory while being a lot of fun at the same time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other graduate students studying medieval or renaissance literature, particularly those interested in the complex relationship between these periods and classical antiquity. The course covered a broad range of topics beyond mythography that would prove invaluable to students interested in such topics as diverse as literary theory and art history.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, since the material presented in class is very useful not only for those who study medieval literature, but also for everybody interested in myths or in the relationship between poetry, theology and philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other graduate students. It was a great experience to be in it. In summary, it offers an overview of how mythography became a part of medieval culture, the strategies that medieval writers used to make sense\/christianize the myths and how then the myths entered later Renaissance culture. It focuses on allegory and on medieval literary theory too. We read fundamental authors such as Fulgentius, Isidore of Seville, Pierre Bersuire, the Third Vatican Mythographer, but also Boccaccio, Petrarch... It was really a course that every person interested in medieval studies should take in their career."

    "This course opened me up to a new way of thinking about myth's presence within Italian literature. It encouraged my curiosity in the subject and was a great way to develop a base knowledge on myth over a wide range of time.",
    "This course has proved invaluable for my studies and will certainly have a lasting impact on my dissertation and future areas of research.",
    "This class was very helpful for my coursework and also for my research in general, since it covered texts and authors of great interest to me.",
    "This course helped me become a better Medievalist. I will always be very thankful to Prof. Lummus for introducing me to Boccaccio's Genealogiae, and moreover for giving me a deep understanding of Medieval Literary Theory as a whole and of the role of Mythography in it."
