   "comments": [
    "I really loved this class. Maritime history is inherently fascinating, and it is an interesting lens through which to view antebellum America. Professor Norwood is witty, fun, and engaging. A substantial amount of reading but the paper workload wasn't too bad--a couple (very) short papers and a 12-15 page research paper.",
    "I would heavily endorse HIST 115J as a class any student should take. It's interesting content taught by a young and insightful professor in a field that really has no other courses devoted to it at Yale. The workload is manageable, especially for a seminar, and the papers are fun to write and fun to research. Take this class.",
    "A class about America's history as seen from the water, with special emphasis on the legal implications of frontier expansion thought the continent.",
    "Overall a great class. I'm glad I took it and would recommend it to another student. However, be wary if you're looking for a straight maritime or naval history course, as this is definitely not that. There's a huge emphasis on slavery that I think the course would do well to cut back on--at times it was hard to see how reading things like a Uncle Tom's Cabin and other slave narratives fit into the maritime theme of the course. Obviously these readings were interesting and enjoyable but at times I found the reading responses hard because I didn't immediately understand how these themes contributed to the course as a whole. That said, I'm incredibly glad I took the class and definitely learned quite a bit about the Atlantic world."
