    "So many cool political theories",
    "As a Poli Sci major, my knowledge of statistics is pretty weak. I appreciated the incorporation of data in order to understand democratization and felt that this enhanced my level of comfort with reading about stats.",
    "I learned all about the process of democratization and read key texts in the subject.",
    "As my first political science class, I developed an understanding of fundamental practices in comparative politics. The readings and class discussions simulateously provided historical context and explanations for the research on the subject matter.",
    "I found this course to be a great political science class focusing on government structure and the theory that explains them. I refined analytical skills, research, writing, and discussing.",
    "Very little. Very cursory view of ideas of democratization. The only things I really felt I learned in depth were the cases of most interest to the professor: Venezuela and Russia. Otherwise, the readings and class discussion did little to elevate my understanding of this topic.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about different political systems from different countries around the world that I didn't even know I lacked. I also learned about the very important study of democratization, which will change the way I read the news and look at the development of countries outside of the United States.",
    "I developed knowledge of many political science theories of democratization and learned how to apply them to real-world examples in the past and present. I gained a much deeper understanding of other political systems in the world and of the idea of democracy. This course also challenged many of my basic assumptions about the world and about which countries are and are not democratic.",
    "Knowledge of democratization and more poli-Sci exposure."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great progression of topics. Too much focus on trivia.",
    "I thought some of the reading was dry at times, but the material was overall very interesting.",
    "Great readings. However, it would have been nice to have a more comprehensive presentation of the different theories of democratization given by the professor (i.e. a survey of the literature), instead of only learning about a few theories through the readings.",
    "Strengths: well-organized; thorough readings; class discussions were lively; teacher was excellent Weaknesses: some readings felt unnecessary and the summaries were overkill",
    "I felt that there wasn't always enough class time to fully discuss the material.",
    "good variety of theory and real world applications",
    "Class time should not be spent on presentations it is a waste. The readings might have been more interesting had we engaged with them deeper. But when the majority of the class is spent reiterating them, it is a massive waste of everyones time. Additionally, the reading responses were pretty useless as they were just another way to summarize. For all for all of the summaries, we rarely discussed intricacies of the reading, points of contention, etc. Also the professor constantly interrupted the presentations and at times it felt more like a lecture than a seminar. I have very little to say positively.",
    "Strengths: The course was organized very well, and there was a clear and logical flow to information and topics. It covered many extremely interesting, current, and relevant topics that have given me a much greater understanding of the world today. Class discussion was always insightful and included debate on the merits and problems of different readings. Weaknesses: The presentations, while important in providing understanding of the readings, often took up too much time so there was not enough time for actual class discussion. I felt like I had a lot to say, but often did not have the opportunity because we ran out of time.",
    "Positives -amazing breadth -varied and difficult readings -students were deeply engaged Negatives -participation was at times difficult\/students would raise their hand for a long time and never get a chance to engage -some readings were so dense that little was gained -grades could be more transparent with a rubric given before work is assigned"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, democratization is such a pertinent topic! The class is great.",
    "Going into this course, I didn't know very much about democratization. I feel confident that I understand different regimes in different contexts, why they are the way they are, and how various institutions impact the success of democracies. This is a great class to take if you are at all interested in democracy. The readings can be dry at time but the material is important and they are discussed in class in depth.",
    "Certainly recommend it! Professor Svolik provides amazing explanations, and the course was by far my favorite to attend! Definitely recommend it if you can get a spot!",
    "This is a great course for those interested in comparative politics. The class operates from both historical and contemporary perspectives.",
    "Yes, it is a more challenging political science course, but if you're up for it, highly recommend.",
    "I'm glad I took this course, but I would clarify for any interested students that this is entirely an empirical course analyzing correlations between various factors and a country's democratization. At times this can get dry if you're used to a philosophical approach, but the course did become more interesting as it progressed.",
    "If you want a class where you read papers and summarize them in a reading response then spend the class listening to someone present the summary of a work you already had to write a summary about while the professor interrupts and goes on tangents, but where little meaningful dialogue occurs: go for it. The readings were not bad, you should still learn some and the work wasn't challenging so much as time consuming. Easily one of the worst courses in the political science department if you are someone who enjoys the seminar style done well. Not bad I guess if you really just need a seminar but prefer a lecture style.",
    "Yes. Extremely engaging and important topic.",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much about the world we live in today and different political systems that I had never been exposed to. I learned both complicated political science theory, and how to apply it to real-world case studies. I found the readings, topics chosen, and class discussions extremely interesting. I enjoyed the course and feel that I learned a lot, too.",
    "A good venue to geek out with like-minded people who are passionate about poli-Sci and regime change"
