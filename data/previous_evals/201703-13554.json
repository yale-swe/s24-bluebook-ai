    "- The ability to notice poor mathematical reasoning - a history of the evolution of math - strong intuition - an ability to decode problems and find the underlying math",
    "Cursory-decent understanding of several math topics. Developed moderate ability to understand and approach complex math issues.",
    "I learned how math concepts are used in examining and solving environmental problems.",
    "This class helped me recall calculus that I had covered in undergraduate courses, and some new material in linear algebra and ODE.",
    "This course taught calculus including derivatives, integrals, linear algebra, and differential equations along with other math skills necessary for graduate level courses. I also learned basic R coding skills. This class prepared me for other quantitative courses and gave a great background into how and why we do math the way we do.",
    "Aside from the math, a little bit of R.",
    "I gained a solid foundation in mathematics",
    "Review of a number of upper-level math concepts from undergrad continuing on to subject matter I had not had before, including differential equations. Also gained an understanding of computer programming for mathematical\/modeling applications through R question. Finally, made connections between economic\/ecological models and the underlying math.",
    "Improved intuition for mathematical problem recognition and solving in areas involving introductory to intermediate calculus, improved confidence in deciphering basic mathematical models\/equations, developed understanding of rationale for some mathematical applications to real-life environmental problems. Introduction to the use of R software.",
    "This class was the hardest class that I took last semester and was also the class that I learned the most from. I came into the course with very little math proficiency and was able to come out of the class feeling much more confident about mathematical concepts.",
    "An ability to approach mathematical analyses in papers critically. A basic understanding of calculus, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and constrained optimization. An introduction to R, and an understanding of how software can assist with math.",
    "I learned how to look at the world from a mathematical analysis lens. I learned how to apply many mathematical concepts to practical situations.",
    "lots of really difficult math",
    "Fleshed out a lot of my math skills and contextualized modeling as a tool.",
    "Linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, and things like calculating eigenvalues, convexity\/concavity, two ways to calculate linear regression (one using linear algebra, one using calculus), isoclines, using R, applying math to the real world (the whole course is word problems)",
    "I felt like I became more comfortable with problem-solving tools, including sorting through information and determining relevancy, determining what the question is actually asking, and learning some of the underlying principles of mathematical modeling, statistics, and calculus."

   "comments": [
    "I learned far more than I expected to in the course.",
    "The skills were strongly aligned. I hoped for more probability, but understood that it had to be cut for time.",
    "Moderately meet expectations.",
    "They matched my expectations. It was very informative to get to work on real world applied math problems.",
    "We skipped probability and statistics, which I found frustrating because I had chosen the course in part because these topics were included.",
    "This course aligned with my expectations. It was very difficult, but prepared me for future courses at FES.",
    "It was exactly in line with my expectations",
    "Aligned very closely. I expected a review of calculus and linear algebra and introduction to differential equations, all with emphasis on connections to environmental\/ecological\/economic issues.",
    "The learning objectives were very attractive, and my expectations were met to a large degree.",
    "My expectations aligned very well with this course.",
    "Very well. I had not taken a math class since calculus in high school (8 years ago). I am now confident that I can at least know how to approach understanding math problems, and have ideas for what questions to ask. I took this class to help prepare me with future classes that will be somewhat math intensive, and I think that I am well prepared.",
    "Well.",
    "Did not align",
    "Pretty much what I expected. I think Eli was expecting us to pick up concepts faster than we actually did.",
    "It was deeper and more interesting than I expected.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned well with my expectations when the semester began.",
    "It was great, except I wish there was more instruction on how to use R."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked being able to grade my own homeworks because I learned a lot from them. I think the online videos could be improved, and I would liked to have seen more work in R.",
    "Strengths: - real world application. Teaches you how to read a \"word problem\" out in the world! - Weaknesses - unclear early in the semester how quickly the material would move. I thought I would be fine without a calculus background, but the class got tough quickly in late September.",
    "The class was too broad in scope, it might be more feasible and beneficial to trim down the topics and focus on a fewer areas with more practical and applied examples.",
    "The course works to give context to math and share practical uses of seemingly theoretical concepts.",
    "I wish the course didn't dedicate two full class periods to the book club. This seemed like poor use of class time. It was also a bit frustrating that the lectures were often overly simplistic, and covered material I already knew and could follow easily. The problem sets would then be much more challenging, and there was an unspoken expectation that students would effectively attend a second lecture through office hours to cover the material needed to solve the problems on assignments. I wish Eli began classes with the expectation that students had read the assigned chapters beforehand, and progressed more rapidly into the more challenging material in lecture. The structure of grading for problem sets was also a bit strange. Solving problems alone but using the short-hand solutions would result in half credit for questions, while essentially getting the answers in office hours could result in full credit, which doesn't seem like quite the right incentive structure.",
    "Strengths: - Great insight into how and why we do math the way we do - Very applicable examples and problem sets - Learned some R coding which is helpful for other courses - Prepared me for future courses Weaknesses: - Class time offered little time to do examples making problem sets and R problems very difficult to tackle - Book was time consuming and not useful enough to warrant taking valuable time out of learning the math itself",
    "I wish there had been more instruction in R. I felt lost a lot of the time with that component of the class. However, overall a very well constructed class. Homework problems could be confusing - Eli clearly had a vision of what he wanted you to say but it could be difficult to tell what he was after. He is a great lecturer overall, and pretty good at explaining difficult concepts. Reading the book E didn't seem necessary, especially the second half. Maybe instead of \"book club\" we could have done more R lessons. Overall it's an ambitious course and one worth taking.",
    "A strength is the great lectures and the fact that we learn a lot about a lot of different subjects. A weakness is that sometimes we didn't go very deep into a subject and only skimmed it",
    "There could be an opportunity to offer a more advanced version of the course for students with a greater math background. If there was one thing I would have changed to improve my own experience in the class, it would have been to spend less time on the material from the first half of the class that I knew better (particularly calculus) and spend more time digging into the material that was newer to my (particularly differential equations). However, I think the material fit the \"bell curve\" of student math backgrounds very well.",
    "Great academic learning objectives.",
    "It would have been nice to have weekly problem sets that addressed fewer topic areas per problem set. It would have been helpful for me to have a few extra practice questions relating to each topic per problem set. I appreciated the amount of information that we covered and was happy to have briefly touched on all of the material covered though, at times, we did move very quickly. I understand that is the nature of this type of survey course however.",
    "Generally very good lectures. Very good homework, very thoughtfully written exams. Professor and TF were available to answer questions. Really, the weaknesses are due to limited time. I could have used more time on ODEs and constrained optimization. I did not enjoy reading or discussing e, although I appreciate it's importance to the course.",
    "I liked the course as it was, overall. The Canvas site could be improved. It was poorly organized with resources all over the place in various folders and with hyperlinks in random hard to find places.",
    "So much jammed into one semester. Not only learning the mathematical concepts, but then learning how to solve challenging problems, and then learning how to identify real life situations that can be captured by the newly learned concepts, and then learning how to be able to write an equation that represents a solution to real-life issue, and then learning how to solve using computer programming skills. To fully get what you want out of this class, I think you need to either come in with college level calculus or split the class in two - or have more class time with TA session. A flipped class would be beneficial. Working out problems with TA was very useful, but only one hour a weak was insufficient.",
    "Fast paced, which was expected. Lots of support from Eli and TF, which was really crucial to me.",
    "Strengths of the course are its creativity, its level of interesting material, the fact that I felt it really improved my math skills, it was challenging, but I really learned a lot. Weakness is that for those who need more basic help it can feel like class time is a little advanced, and there are not a ton of office hours to turn to for help. Some of the homeworks (cough differential equations cough) were quite tough, and I felt that they could have benefited from more preparation in class ahead of time. Stability analysis on a number line needs a little more explanation too.",
    "Strength- AMES covers a lot of ground really well. Moving through parts of several semesters worth of college math is not easy to do and I was surprised at how much we were able to cover. Weaknesses- The pacing of the course was not always great. The time spent laying the foundations was valuable but it left some of the more difficult concepts life differential equations feeling rushed.",
    "Overall, I liked the class and the space created for asking questions and \"playing\" with math problem. I think clarity and attention to detail with writing on the board would have helped (labeling accesses, and accuracy)."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Make sure you visit office hours early in the semester if you're starting to get confused!",
    "If you're looking for a math overview of several topics, this is a good class. If you're looking for more in-depth\/focused math learning, this might not be your best option.",
    "Stay on top of the problem sets and take the time to try and figure out the concepts you are using to solve the problems.",
    "If you have already taken calculus but are rusty, you will be better served by reviewing the material yourself over the summer than taking this class.",
    "Take advantage of office hours! I cannot emphasize enough how much I learned going to them. Go through the problem sets once on your own to ensure you know how to do things for the midterm and final yourself and then work in groups. They will be much less frustrating as a team! If you want to go on to do any higher level math or modeling classes, this is the foundation you need to be successful or at least to not go crazy trying to figure it out on the fly.",
    "If you have taken really any college math, as I had, you should probably skip this course as it is more introductory than I had anticipated.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if someone is interested in improving math skills, to take other economics or environmental modeling courses",
    "If you have studies many of the topics in this course previously, consider finding a more in-depth course in topic areas of interest, such as linear algebra or differential equations.",
    "A great consideration if intending to improve data analysis\/quantitative skillset and a necessity if intending to pursue later math-based courses, but the course is intense, and involves a steep learning curve that will require significant commitment\/perseverance if the student's last interaction with math was basic or not recent.",
    "If you do not come from a strong math background, this course will be challenging and time consuming but is a great overview of the core concepts of applied math.",
    "This class is difficult but worthwhile. It made me a better student in my statistics class, and I expect it to help me in other future classes.",
    "You get what you put into this class!",
    "Be ready to struggle a lot. This felt more like theoretical math despite its name. Applied math is not a foundations course. It is high level math for people interested in econometrics and taking \"nature as capital.\" This goes beyond what you've seen in a calculus I class. If you are struggling a lot - really think about why you're taking it an how it applies to your interests before add\/drop period ends.",
    "Be ready to put in a lot of work.",
    "Seek help early and often, try not to miss class, and know you'll need to do a lot of self-teaching on your own to get through the homework. Form study groups and get help from peers. Don't forget to look for help in the materials that are posted online.",
    "AMES was one of the more valuable classes I have taken at FES. It covers a lot of ground in a single semester and can be challenging at times but working with classmates makes it much more manageable.",
    "Don't be afraid to ask questions."
