    "Roundtable seminar: the presentation of ongoing research.",
    "I would reccommend this course to students committed to the academic life of graduate school, in particular to those in more advanced years of the PhD programmer. It offers a unique space in which to air work in progresss and enriched my understanding of a topic on which I had worked for some years.",
    "A colloquium where graduate students come to share and reflect on their work. Wonderful, helpful. Will be great to have a reprise in two years.",
    "Yes I would totally recommend this class to a fellow student, if he\/she was advanced enough in his\/her studies. This class was great, but it required a very strong basic knowledge of the Middle Ages to benefit from it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, since the material presented in class is very useful not only for those who study medieval literature, but also for everybody interested in myths or in the relationship between poetry, theology, and philosophy."

   "comments": [
    "The course was helpful in that it gave me an arena to workshop a conference paper.",
    "My presentation topic was somethng that had become somewhat stale. The input of my coursemates and my professor revived an old topic and shaped it into something new and exciting. In addition to the session spent on my own work, I learnt about the research interests of my colleagues, vital for building a network of graduate students, as well as taking from them techniques of presentation and delivery.",
    "Allowed me to work on my own, and helped me when I least expected it (who knew Anglo-Saxon poetry could help stimulate the ideas of a historian! who knew Dante would help me reflect on my project! Fantastically helpful.)",
    "This course allowed me to develop an idea that I hope will become the core of my dissertation. I believe that this course will be fundamental in my academic development.",
    "This course gave me some insights and helpful ideas for the development of my dissertation and research in general.",
    "This class was veryhelpful for my coursework and also for my research in general, since it covered texts and authors of great interest to me."
