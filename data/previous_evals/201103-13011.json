    "Here's the scoop. The readings for this class are incredibly fun. There is a lot to read, but you will enjoy every second. Also, Victor Bers is one of the nicest, cutest old men out there. BUT, with that said, the lectures are boring and incredibly disorganized, and the expectations for the papers and exams are NOT clear. You will most likely get a B in the course, even if you work your butt off.If you enjoy Greek Lit, definitely take it. If not, it's a big mistake.",
    "If you're considering it, you probably have to take it. There isn't really much time to look at anything in depth, so be sure to ask questions of you have them.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, it's probably because you are required to do so. I would not recommend taking this course if you are not a classics or classical civ major. If you are, however, please know that it is not that painful, especially if you stay on top of the readings and essays.",
    "No.",
    "I would not recommend this class with this teacher. period."
