    "The p-sets do not appear to be long, but the questions are much, much harder than high school homework problems. Work with others and start the p-sets as soon as you get them.",
    "I wish I didn't have to take this class, but I needed it for pre-med.",
    "take it if you have to. to make this course a little better, take it with peng.if you've had calculus experience prior to college, i would skip over 112 and take 115 if possible. 112 is the devil.i did not have prior calculus experience so i needed to start off at 112.",
    "Overall, this is a great calculus class. However, it is much more challenging than AP calculus, so do not go into it, thinking that this is an easy class.",
    "I would summarizeMath 115 a pretty high intensity and faced paced version of what I believe is AP Calculus BC that many people in High School. However, I would say that generally, it is not very well taught and that if they are not naturally gifted with math, they should be prepared to see a lot of extra help or have to do a lot of learning on their own. I would also say that if this course is not required for their major that they should not take it, since they are other, better QR classes available.",
    "Math 115 is a good course if you have already taken calculus bc in high school or are looking for a challenging math course. Teaches the basics of calculus- focusin on integration and applications.",
    "Take it if you want to learn more math. Make sure to spend time on your own internalizing the concepts, practicing the applications of them. It's a greatly enjoyable course, very rewarding, and one that's kind to those who put in the effort and interest. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend taking Math 115. The lecture is not the greatest, but it is a very doable and interesting course material wise ,and with the improvements the program is planing to make to the course, I think it should be a pretty decent class.",
    "It's okay if it's needed. Not the best class but not the worst. Just a basic math class."
