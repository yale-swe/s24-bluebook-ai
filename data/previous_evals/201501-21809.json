    "well organized class; especially I liked the oral project. it was fun and good to wrap up the class. sure! i'd love to recommend this class to other students!",

    "Keep up with your work, and you'll learn lots. Brace yourself for copious repetition, though.",
    "YES. YES. YES. Take this class! Chinese was hands down my FAVORITE class my freshman year and it's definitely manageable. 2nd semester was more malleable and laid back. I had SO much fun, and the memories you make in class are priceless. That said, you do have to put effort into the class - this means a lot of memorization of characters, oral skits, etc. Your Chinese will improve immensely."
