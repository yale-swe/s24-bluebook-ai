    "Take this course if you want to learn more about how to approach drawing, not necessarily how to actually draw. Art 114 differs hugely by professor and Prof. Galloway is exploring how to perceive and interpret objects than drawing technique. Generally an enjoyable course, but be prepared to do 3-4 hours of art a week, every week. Midterms and finals are both portfolios of your past work (plus 2 final projects).",
    "Good class. Be prepared to put in time and effort...it's not easy.",
    "Very basic introduction to types of drawing, such as contour versus gesture drawing. Take this class if you have never drawn before, but if you have some experience, try to get into a higher level class for a larger scope of learning.",
    "This class will both make you better at art and better able to understand how art is made -- not so much an exact representation as an expression of your subject. You learn a lot so its a bit of work but well worth it in the end.",
    "I highly recommend this class to fellow student especially if they have the chance to work with Mr. Galloway.",
    "Art 114 is a dope humanities credit. But you actually have to put in a few hours of work a week and can be stressful at times. But Munrow Galloway is great. Each section is unique and we cover completely different topics. Some things this section does that are notable: Index card project Gesture \/ Contour drawing with charcoal then get to use pencil : value then finally pen : texture You do some perspective drawing Then get into some cubism And finish off with Sumi ink There is a final project where you get to do anything that you found fun during the semester and really allows you to get creative. If you at all like drawing \/ have an artistic bone - take 114. It's a great outlet during a stressful semester.",
    "I would highly encourage you to take Basic Drawing with Munro (the TA, Jae Na, was excellent as well). Homework is completely manageable and often enjoyable. Class is productive and usually fairly relaxing."
