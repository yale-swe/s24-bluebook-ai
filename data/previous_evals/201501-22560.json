    "This was a great E and M class. If you're interested in physics \/ pre-med, then take it!",
    "If you have any background in calculus, I would just take the 180\/181 sequence. Trying to apply physics to biology\/pre-med just made class more complicated. If you like math at all, just go for the normal physics class. Some sections of this course are interesting, but as someone who's not even premed, it felt quite unnecessary.",
    "One of the worst classes Ive taken at Yale. It makes me sad to say that because Demers really tries her hardest to make it good. But alas, she fails. Class time is just not used efficiently and part of this is due to the fact that the class is in the TEAL classroom and so much time is allocated to peer-peer discussion. Demers will take 20-30 minutes to slowly explain some interesting but tangential and simple concept, e.g. how a microwave works. This is fine but it doesnt feel like I have a solid E+M foundational understanding, rather a bunch of specific situations that I can explain on an exam through regurgitation. The exams are really easy, but that means theyre easy for everyone (ludicrously high averages), so theres not that much room for error if you want to get an A. The psets of which there are few are also ludicrously easy, almost insultingly so. The class really wants for a textbook unlike 170, the course notes arent a great fit for the material thats covered. Its sad to say this but I work as a high school subject tutor and Ive actually learned more E+M from my student's high school physics textbook than I have from Demers lectures or Mochries notes. At the end of the day, if you want to go through the motions to get a painless A\/A- (i.e. most premeds) you can take this class but if you actually expect to get some sort of knowledge base from your tuition money you are a fool to take PHYS 171. I give it a B-, but its the Yale gentlemans B- for effort, nothing more. Do not take.",
    "If you're pre-med and need physics, take it.",
    "If Sarah Demers is teaching, definitely take the course. She makes the material engaging and exciting in a way I never thought physics could be.",
    "Take this. Do not take 181. You will get an A if you try a little. you will probably get an A- if you don't try. The best part is, you will feel free to work with anybody and share knowledge with anybody, and that is what makes the class function well.",
    "MUCH better than 170. Psets and tests are easier, and Sarah is much more likeable than Simon.",
    "A pretty bad course - stay away. Ended up spending most of the time watching MIT lectures or other youtube videos to learn the material. Lectures were hard to follow due to being poorly organized and motivated; the only other resource are horribly written module notes since there's no textbook. Would definitely take 181 if given a second chance.",
    "If the classroom style remains the same, expect to have difficulty keeping up with lecture and following the material. The exams and psets though are very doable.",
    "Meh. It'd be nice if there were an actual reason this was held in the TEAL room... I understand that it has potential to be a great teaching space, but it is definitely not utilized in this respect. Bluntly, it is currently a traditional lecture in a non-traditional classroom with frequent technical difficulties and side-chatter that makes focusing on relevant course material frustrating and sometimes impossible. We maybe had 3 activities throughout the course of the semester that utilized the round-table setup and 1 clicker question used to determine our participation grade. Piazza unfortunately was a shitshow, as were sections with certain TAs. Professor Demers was a great engaging lecturer though - I would highly recommend this class once it irons out its logistics.",
    "Great course! Easier than PHYS 170 and a lot of the topics are really interesting. And Professor Demers is awesome.",
    "Hell no. It's a bad class, straight up. Take it if you want the A. Not if you want to learn Physics.",
    "Physics 171 was a standard second semester physics lecture. It's billed as \"University Physics FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES\" -- this, it certainly was not. If you know anything about 170 (the fall component), 170 goes to great lengths to make you feel that biology cares about physics. The spring semester 171 doesn't really pretend to care about that. Granted, it's probably tough to make magnetism relevant to biology, but there are definitely some other ways it could be incorporated. But apart from my complaint about the faux-bio relevance of the course, I thought it was pretty good. Professor Demers is amusing and good, and the problem sets and midterms \/ final are easy. If you are looking for a physics course to fulfill premed requirements, this is a good way to go.",
    "Going into this class I expected not to like it, given my experience with 170; however, I found that this was a much more approachable Physics Course than 170. The concepts have a clear tie to rational physics and all of the assignments were incredibly fair. I wouldn't take this class if I didn't have to, but having taken it was pretty good. There is significantly less work than in 170 and the homework assignments were easy to complete without consulting a TA. My main criticism was that things felt a bit disorganized at times and it would have been nice to have more practice problems going into exams.",
    "Take it if you must, it's not a big deal, but brace yourself for uncomfortable table discussions and not understanding things during lecture.",
    "You're going to take it if it's required. If it's not required, avoid it like the plague.",
    "The class is tediously boring if you have previous experience with electricity and magnetism, but definitely not hard. Having class in the TEAL classroom makes it really hard to pay attention and not just watch all of \"Particle Fever\" on Netflix. I'd say this class beats out 181\/201 if you just want to get physics over with for med school, since the workload seems much more reasonable (a pset a week, plus exams). There's no curve, but instead a hard cutoff at 93 to get a straight A.",
    "Great for premed. It is generally easy and not a hard workload. I'm not sure how much will be relevant to the MCAT though...",
    "I mean, take it if you need to. I imagine that someone in it for the physics would be taking a different course. But it wasn't bad.",
    "Good course, preferable over 181. However could be better organized and the fact that we didn't get practice exams left students in a bit of a panic when preparing for the midterms.",
    "I'm not sure how 180 is, but I did feel like I learned some useful things about the world around me in PHYS 171. We talk about real world situations and you get a lot of support. They don't make as big of a deal out of life science connections as in the first semester, but it's still there, microscopes, etc. The TEAL classroom is also a neat place to learn.",
    "Take it! Unless you've already taken E&M which might make the course pretty dull and slow. Otherwise, you'll get to learn E&M with a super fun professor! The problem sets are potentially challenging, but the exams take the easiest questions from the problem sets. If you can do the problems from the homework then you are set for the exams!!",
    "It's an easy course if you like to push yourself to learn. The material isn't exactly relevant (when will you ever need to know how a microwave works?) but it's interesting.",
    "This course affords a nice introduction (emphasis on introduction) to physics. If only yale offered a course in between this level and 181, that would be perfect. I felt towards the end of the course that disappointingly we didn't learn as much as I would have like due to the low level of physics background of many students. Also, overcrowding was an issue. There was a table (poor souls) that squeezed up to 14 people around one of those TEAL classroom tables!! Often left an unsatisfactory of explanations for physics that I would've like to delve more deeply into.",
    "This class prepared me very well for the physics section on the MCAT. It might have been more challenging for students who had never seen any physics before, but I found it quite fair (I took physics in high school). The TEAL classroom took a little getting used to, but otherwise I truly enjoyed and looked forward to this class each week! Fair psets, great course notes by Mochrie, and Sarah Demers is probably one of my favorite professors at Yale!",
    "Yes, if you need the class for some reason.",
    "PHYS 171 is like the more attractive cousin of PHYS 170 in that the material is more straightforward and the problem sets don't make you cry. There is a good overlap between the problem sets, quizzes, and tests and Professor Demers taught the course at good pace. This course doesn't focus as much on the biological applications of physics like 170 does, but that doesn't mean you can't find the biological relevance you've always dreamed of on your own. Overall a solid course with a manageable workload (child's play compared to 170).",
    "A required class for premeds, there's no getting around it (unless you actually like taking physics, in which case you'd be taking another class). Sarah does not curve, so keep that in mind. The policy on exchanging your final's grade for your midterms' grades is a lifesaver.",
    "Totally bearable physics intro class for a non-physics\/engineering major. Wasn't too hardexams were straight forward. PSETs reinforced class materials and never impossible to do. Definitely recommend",
    "PHYS 170\/171 turn out to be a poor detour for a humanities major like me who's (a) interested in physics but (b) afraid of the math involved. Unless you have both a strong background in biology and chemistry *and* an interest in approaching physics from those angles, just take PHYS 180\/181.",
    "This is definitely the best E&M course to take. It is not too difficult, Prof. Demers is great, her exams are extremely fair, and the course material is more interesting than 170.",
    "You gotta take this course for the premedicine life, but it's pretty doable. Lots of fun with relatively straightforward exams and material. Sarah is a great teacher, and it's been a great experience.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to, but if you have it with Sarah Demers, you're probably going to be fine. The material is much more concept heavy than math heavy compared to 170, which is a good or bad thing depending on the type of student you are. Prof. Demers really expects you to have the concepts down, and if you do, then doing well in the class is easy--the quizzes, homework, and exams all match up in a pretty sensible way. Keep in mind, though, that your grade is not curved, so you really need to know your stuff.",
    "Take it if you're premed.",
    "Second term of intro physics. Really interesting and fun compared to the first semester.",
    "Much better than 170. The material is presented in a more understandable fashion, and the quizzes are easy and a good way to stay in-tune with the material.",
    "Fun and informative!",
    "Take it if you need to, but if you don't please don't.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. It went over many fundamental concepts in physics and did so in a way that made it impossible not to grow in and learn physics better.",
    "The material covered was good, but it was not covered in as much depth as I would have wanted. Overall, I enjoyed this class and would recommend it. For those serious about improving at physics, the first semester of this course seems as rigorous as 180\/181, but the second semester did not.",
    "Fair course. Take if you're premed or interested in E&M. Problem sets are do-able on your own. Exams and quizzes are very fair and are similar to the problem sets. Not an excessive workload. Very easy course if you have an AP Physics background.",
    "Apparently better than 181 and significantly easier to understand than 170. Professor Demers is a lovely woman, and you'll come out of the semester having learned a lot.",
    "If you have to take a 2nd semester of physics definitely take 171. The workload is much easier than 170. The class isn't curved, but the tests are very straightforward.",
    "This class is pretty easy and quite chill. I would recommend it to any pre-med. In order to do well in this class you must make sure you have good notes and are paying attention in lecture because her quizzes are based on lecture concepts (no calculations). The midterm 2 was harder than midterm 1, but if you study the lecture notes well and go over the hw problems you should be fine. The material itself was also quite interesting. I liked especially the last lecture when we talked about how the universe was expanding.",
    "The class maintained most of the structure of PHYS 170, which was effective. It was helpful when we worked through problems in class, and it would be good to add a few more, such as with clickers, to work through as table groups. It would be nice to have had more consistency in some areas, such as having problem sets due on the same day every week. Some of the first few lectures were difficult to understand, or weren't organized, but by the end they were well-taught and broke down concepts in a way that was easier to understand.",
    "This course is a continuation of the PHYS 170 with a stronger focus on real-world application of physics principles than simply understanding formulas. The class pushes for students to understand the conceptual questions that are behind formulas so that one can walk away from the course with a much deeper understanding of all the physics principles learned.",
    "Take this course. It is one of the best at Yale in my opinion. The material was manageable and it was well-taught.",
    "Very reasonable problem sets and exams. Quizzes are also straightforward if you pay attention in class.",
    "I thought that this course was a lot more straightforward and less labor-intensive than physics 170. Also Sarah is great!",
    "Take it over 181 if you are a pre-med; it is much easier. And you actually do learn relevant concepts in E&M\/circuits and interesting conceptual things. There isn't a curve but it's much easier than PHYS 170 so don't worry.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major or pre-med. If you're truly interested in physics take one of the upper level courses.",
    "Interesting class. Instead of a textbook, we got Professor Mochrie's notes from a book he was working on. Although we followed the topic of each \"chapter,\" Professor Demers' lectures didn't really match with his notes. Given this, you definitely needed to attend class and get a handle on the concepts, not necessarily the math behind them. As usual, TEAL classroom was good and bad. Great for hearing the professor\/seeing the board, but bad in that if she switched boards and you weren't done writing, you couldn't really catch up. Also the circular tables allowed a lot of non-class related talking which made it difficult to focus at times. All in all a solid course.",
    "Phys 171 was an overall solid course. Professor Demurs does a pretty good job of explaining the material in lecture and providing us with real life applications of what we're learning, and the quizzes and problem sets do a good job of keeping you in check and making sure you're understanding the material. (Note: Definitely make sure you look over your lecture notes for the quizzes and your problem sets for the exams!) Overall, I would say this is a fair course.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the class if you don't have to take it, especially if Sarah Demers isn't teaching it. It is a fair amount of work and the material isn't easy if physics isn't your thing- and if it is you would probably be taking a different class. That being said, it isn't too bad as far as prereqs go.",
    "I recommend it! It taught Physics in a way I felt was relevant to life outside the classroom. I would make sure to form a study group, however, so that you can go over concepts with other students as you are taking the course, as this is extremely helpful",
    "It is a very easy physics course. Doesn't teach you much, but it earns you an easy A. Lectures were not very good, but p-sets are helpful for understanding the material.",
    "Easy class but very disorganized and lacks depth! Almost no biological applications. TEAL is terrible.",
    "It is a good class with a minimal amount of work. If you can, try to take it with Professor Demers because she's awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 171!",
    "PHYS171 is structured quite similarly to 170 but is has a much lighter workload. You don't really need to spend more than 10 minutes studying for the quiz each week, and the problem sets range in time commitment from maybe 2 hours to less than 1 hour. Whereas 170 has you stretching your brain to apply concepts to more difficult situations than you originally learned, 171 will typically test you at the level you were taught. The exams are very fair and not any harder than the quizzes or psets. Do yourself a favor, though, and make sure you go to class every time! While usually very easy, the quizzes often test examples from class that you may not be able to fully explain if you haven't thought about them before. And missing a quiz can really kill your grade unnecessarily.",
    "PHYS 171 was really interesting and well taught. Professor Demers was phenomenal clear in her instruction, dedicated to the course, and with a refreshing sense of humor. Couldn't have asked for a better physics professor. The workload was fair. Overall, a great continuation from PHYS 170.",
    "A great class that introduces you to electricity, magnetism, and the like. Not too fast paced but definitely keep your head in the game or else you'll fall behind faster than you realize!",
    "Take it if you want an easy alternative to PHYS 181. This class will not challenge you, but it will allow you to get a better grasp of the basics. The Psets are pretty easy, and the exams are basically different versions of the psets. You learn about questions like \"why do fridge magnets work\" and \"why is the universe expanding\". If you don't know the answer to these questions you should take this class.",
    "Take if you need to -- not a horrible experience!",
    "Only take it if you have to or if you're really into physics.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 171.",
    "PHYS 171 is far and away better than the 180-181 sequence. Sarah is an incredible science teacher for those who might otherwise find science inaccessible. Do it if you need to take physics and this will satisfy the requirement.",
    "A very straightforward physics class for students who aren't very excited about physics. Lectures with Professor Demers are relatively enjoyable, and I feel like I learned a good amount (though it wasn't very bio-based, as was advertised). The work is very manageable, and exams were really easy, only asking questions that were extensively covered in previous classes\/quizzes\/homework. Take this class if it fulfills your physics requirement - though if you're actually interested in delving deeply into the topic, you might want to take a higher level.",
    "Great way to learn physics for a non-physics Science Major",
    "This class unlike PHYS 170 is very similar to a standard electricity and magnetism physics class. Professor Demers is awesome, so that is one good reason to take the class. Also, the curve is pretty nice. I would recommend this cass to another student.",
    "Phys 171 is a great course for those with little physics background. I would recommend someone who is not the best at math or with little physics knowledge to take it.",
    "PHYS 171 is an excellent physics course that discusses some interesting material, but it can be a little difficult and hard to grasp. The material presented is relevant in many different fields of science, so you should definitely take it if you are a science major.",
    "It is much easier than first semester, but tests and such are harder to prepare for. If you want a less rigorous physics class then take it.",
    "If you're taking this, probably required. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would!"
