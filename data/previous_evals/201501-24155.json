   "comments": [
    "It is a great course to take if you are interested in understanding Stata and programming. I did not know that Stata was that helpful! It is also a great course to learn about conducting statistical research. I did my research assignment from scratch, including the collection of primary data and Justin was very supportive of that. I highly appreciated it.",
    "If you want to master Stata this is your course.",
    "I am confident in recommending this class for students who want to use stata at their work or research after graduation.",
    "If you consider working as an RA or are interested in research, then this is the most useful class you could take. not hard and not easy, requires the right amount of work.",
    "Yes- if interested in Stata and data analysis.",
    "Great introduction to stata that will be very helpful in any future research or RA work.",
    "Yes Teach you how to use stata",
    "If you have a research question, data, and a knowledge of analytical techniques this is an incredible opportunity to learn how to apply Stata. If you have one semester of statistics under your belt, it is an imposing task to step up to the plate that will broaden your appreciation of academic research.",
    "Yes for those who want to learn about advanced skills with STATA.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend it to any student who wants to work with structured data or has a quantitative project in mind. I would not recommend it as a simple continuation of GLBL 802 for those who want to brush up on the concepts of statistics. This course is very much a practicum and should be viewed more a lab than a lecture.",
    "GLBL 543 teaches how to manage and work with data using the statistical software Stata. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who is interested in data analysis professionally or academically."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very useful for my research methods and increased my knowledge and proficiency in Stata while conducting research in development economics.",
    "This course really opened up my eyes to conducting statistical research. I have never really did my own statistical research before and thus this is very helpful in further understanding a subject that I was not familiar with. I can be more critical when reading research papers and also when given a research assignment.",
    "This course gives you an outstanding preparation for a research career in academia and beyond.",
    "I would not have been able to write my thesis without this course.",
    "It helped me master and apply many techniques in stata.",
    "Taught me how to use stata to analyze data",
    "I learned the structure of academic research papers for more than I had understood perviously. I learned so many potential pitfalls of poor analysis that have made me a far more literate consumer of quantitative research.",
    "Help me know a lot about STATA.",
    "I am interested in quantitative analysis in both an academic and professional sense, so this course absolutely helped me toward that end. I definitely learned a lot about Stata and I hope to use what I have learned in my future endeavors."
