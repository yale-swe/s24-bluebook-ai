    "I would highly recommend for anyone interested in Latin literature or history, who is willing to put in the work.",
    "Roman Civil Wars was different from any other Latin class I have taken because it was based around a subject instead of an author. While most classes involve reading many works by one author, this class touched on many authors, with many styles, which was an interesting change. It was cool to look at different people's approaches to the same topic, and what might influence the differences. Professor Peirano is also one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "I'd recommend anything Professor Peirano teaches, because she works hard to make sure her students are engaged, and reads their writing closely. The subject matter was great for me but possibly not for everyone (i.e., make sure you like Lucan)."
