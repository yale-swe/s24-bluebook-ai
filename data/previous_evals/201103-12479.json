   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. I came into Yale having a love of math and this class has successfully snuffed it out. I no longer have any wish to pursue math classes and I do not wish that distaste on my peers.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. Datta is a terrible professor and if you do have him, don't bother coming to class.",
    "This class will teach you calculus, but you will likely be very bored in the process. The class is taught by mostly grad students, so the quality of instructors is not very high. Instead, class is boring and at times more confusing than necessary. The tests can be slightly difficult, but you'll do fine in the class if you've been exposed to calculus in high school.",
    "Yes.",
    "If its a prereq or a major requirement take it. Otherwise its up to you, the class isn't bad if you decide to actually show up to class and do all of the work for it.",
    "I would say it is very difficult and even though you may put in a lot of time studying the material you really need to be good at math to be successful in this course.",
    "It's not such a good class if you really want to learn math. Most of the time you have to read the chapters by yourself and you don't get much help from attending classes.",
    "The BC part of BC calculus, but harder",
    "Good course.",
    "I would not recommend this class at all. I did not enjoy it.",
    "Take if you need it, but don't take it just to get a QR credit unless you really like math. The amount of info. you need to learn is manageable, but you will need to become proficient in solving challenging problems. My professor was Swarnendu Datta; he mostly went through proofs and wrote out example problems from the book in class, but he also gave us problems representative of those on the exams, which was extremely helpful. You don't need to understand the proofs to succeed in the class, but you will have to be familiar with all the different types of problems you may encounter. Makesure you use the book; examples and explanations at the beginnings of the chapter sections can be very helpful, both for psets and exams.I found out too late that it makes a huge difference when you check you psets over with someone else. I would recommend trying the problem solving sessions (I never got to go...wish someone had told me about them sooner!), but checking them over with others is also useful. I found it very helpful for exams to go through the sections in the book and write down the key formulas and concepts, to memorize those, and to do as many practice problems as possible (including the practice exams).If you have to take it, take it. If not, get your QR credit elsewhere unless you really like math. The course plows through the material, with classes consisting of proofs that you don't need to understand to succeed and example problems taken from the book, regular psets, and two midterms and one final. The material is manageable if you don't get lost in all the proofs and if you concentrate on what you need to solve problems. Prof. Datta was approachable and overall a pretty good teacher. Before taking the class, I looked up which of the instructors were professors, not TA's, and I think Datta was the only one. It is clear that he has experience as a teacher, which is nice, and his method is pretty good. The subject is naturally dry, but you'll be fine if you can pick out the techniques and formulas necessary to solve problems.**There are problem sets every week, but they are shorts, and there are no other assignments. The p-sets do not prepare you well for the exams, but the exams are most of your grade.",
    "Take Math 115 if you have to for a requirement. Although the material is generally not too difficult, it is often difficult to understand the grad students teaching the class. I shopped a few of the classes and Datta is one of the better teachers. What is actually really helpful is the problem solving sessions because the teacher explains the concepts in a way which is easier to grasp.",
    "This was an excellent course and the professor was amazing as long as you were willing to put in the extra effort of ensuring that you understood the material(by asking question and attending office hours). He also provided great support in preparation for exams. The only complaint would be that it was early in the morning and as expected individuals would be tired.",
    "Math 115 is a class that requires diligent studying and persistence, especially for those who aren't completely proficient in integral calculus. This is a class that not only teaches you how to do math problems, but it also teaches you how to think critically, to proactively implement the tools and formulas you need to use. I would certainly recommend this class to other students if this kind of growth is what they're looking for.",
    "Only for students who have very little experience with BC but some foundation with AB calculus.",
    "I would say it is a very difficult class that forces you to learn from the textbook quite often. Hopefully you already understand calculus.",
    "I would not recommend Math 115 to another student. As someone who enjoyed and did well in BC calculus in high school, I found this course extremely frustrating and confusing."
