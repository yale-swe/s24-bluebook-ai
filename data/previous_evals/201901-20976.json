    "The only real strength of the course that I can think of is the potential it could have if better organized and taught. The weaknesses of this course were unfortunately all that we as student really got to interface with. This class was poorly structured, disconnected, had an unreasonable workload all piled into the end of the semester, had no clear expectations or grading until the midterm exam (which was very late in the semester), and was just a generally frustrating course which even our teaching fellows did not understand."

    "Absolutely not. Please, if you have the chance, do not take a course with Mark Brandon unless you have an incredibly high level of patience for having work surprisingly dropped on you related to things you have not even covered in class. You will generally not understand what is happening in the lectures, the homework assignments will look nothing like what you think you've covered, and you will just be highly frustrated for the duration of the course. Save yourself the trouble and find another class to take. I was really excited about the potential of this course, the subject matter seemed really interesting, but it was just a gigantic let down. Mark assigned us two homework assignments (which we got him to reduce to just one), a final project (related to a subject which we did not cover until the VERY LAST day of the class), and a take home final exam all within the last week of classes through reading period. Not only does this show poor planning and use of the rest of the class (we had only had 2 homework assignments to that point), but it shows a complete disregard for his students.",
    "Yes, especially one who is interested in the material. I can see, however, that it could be quite cumbersome to one who does not share a passion for the subject."
