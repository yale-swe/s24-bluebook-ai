    "This course is definitely much harder than L1, and you really do need to pay attention and do the work or else your grade will suffer. However, the work load is never too bad and it gives you a great understanding of the language.",
    "A lot of vocab, grammar, and random incomprehensible passages of literature.",
    "Basic beginners Spanish class. All of the different sections have the same syllabus and grading schemes, so there's not any tangible difference between them. But, if you can, take Luzmaria. She's absolutely wonderful.",
    "A good class, not too challenging. Continuation of L1...rewarding at the end of the semester as you feel that you have a good grasp of the language by the end of it."
