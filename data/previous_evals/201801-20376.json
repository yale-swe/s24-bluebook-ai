    "Very basic MIG and stick welding techniques\/how to use tools in the shop\/",

    "It's pretty loose in terms of structure. Basically you show up, talk and work, and then do work on your own. This is a strength and a weakness. It means you have all the time you need to get your stuff done, but it also means you have to be accountable for yourself which is definitely a challenge to some people.",
    "There are no weaknesses, just strengths in how you can go at your own pace, ask questions, and take your time to learn the material. Brent is great, understanding, and knows what it's like to be a student and what pressures we have going on in the background.",
    "Strengths: great that we"

    "YES YES YES absolutely take this course. Brent is incredible, the work is like nothing you've ever done or will ever do. Take this class if you have the time for it!",
    "Take it its great",
    "YES",
    "Definitely take this course if you need something to busy your mind from other work. The challenges are as hard as you make them because in the end it's about expressing who you are.",
    "Yes definitely. The more work you put into the class the more you'll get out of it. Go to the iron pour",
    "Fantastic course, would definitely recommend. If you've ever wanted to learn A Skill at Yale University TM (crazy, right?), you'll be trained in welding and in the metal shop by week 2 so that you have the entire semester to hone those skills in your own projects. There's not a ton of structure to this course but that's a good thing - the learning and the process happen mostly in the time you put in on your own, in your designs and in the shop. Brent and the TAs are all great folks and incredibly skilled at what they do, you should take the opportunity to pick their brains and ask questions if you have them.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. As a student, you're taught a skill that you might not have the chance to learn anywhere else, and Brent and the TAs were all great instructors."
