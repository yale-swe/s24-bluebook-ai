    "This is a spectacular course. Alark Saxena is a fabulous discussion leader, and very insightful. The structure of the course was great. The first half was a lot of academic background material, and we had lecture\/seminar discussion much of the time. The second half of the course were student led discussions on various topics that applied the theoretical work from the first half of the course. Every one of the student presentations was excellent, which reflects how highly engaged all of the students were in the course. There were also guest lecturers most weeks, and they were all very interesting and provided additional perspectives on the issues in the course.",
    "Though there were no field trips, the presentations by such a wide array of practitioners, professionals and persons for Academia made this component unnecessary.",
    "Overall very good course and great discussions. Some guest speakers were a bit lacking. Too many readings with overlap that did not always fit together and were dense - place to improve the course is with the readings. Final presentations were rushed, spreading them out and allowing an addition 3 minutes would be better. A debate format for an assignment would be good and this is a comment for may of my classes as this is something lacking at FES and would require criticisms from students on theory or practices to propose alternatives or argue their view rather than just critiques."

    "The in-class dialogue. The encouragement from the professor to hear many many different views. The ability of the professor to quickly analyze what was said, relate it to theory, current practical international and national experiences while balancing views with the offering of a different perspective. Excellent!!!",

   "comments": [
    "The volume of reading in the first half of the course was a little too heavy - more that one could effectively do with a normal course load.",
    "No more weakly responses of so so so many papers. perhaps a response to one paper if it must be a weekly Friday response. I would have liked to see the theory be more deeply discussed and well understood by all class participants before moving forward.",
    "Number 1 concern with the course = not enough time for discussion. Discussion was by far the richest part of the course and there was never enough time. Ideal breakdown would be 1.5 hours lecture, 1.5 hours discussion. Too many readings - I only did the ones that were labeled \"mandatory.\" Optional readings I could not get to. Need more time on the theory and more a more explicit connection between theory and the case studies. Sometime I felt like the link there was missing. Would be interesting to get more U.S. examples, as there are many vulnerable\/at-risk communities here where resilience is a challenge. Rather than writing a memo, it would be helpful to assign a first draft of the paper. If the memo needs to stay, it would be good to assign a better structure. I had never written anything like it before and felt a bit lost. But really I think the memo could be scrapped in place of a draft; it'd have been helpful to get Alark's feedback and would have been useful for pacing throughout the semester.",
    "The discussion forum gets too cluttered I feel and we may need more time to respond.",
    "I think this was part of the point, but sometimes it felt like we were just swimming in the conceptual material and I wasn't sure what we were supposed to take away.",
    "readings and assignments. reading responses took a lot of time but could have been varied from week to week such as more memos or other variations."
