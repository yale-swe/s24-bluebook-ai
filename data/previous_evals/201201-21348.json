   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student if he or she is looking for a class that explores a new and different topic.",
    "Absolutely. This is a truly unique course that explores a fascinating subject. The guest speakers are all really interesting, the workload is manageable, and Prof. Wright is an excellent teacher and moderator. He goes out of his way to learn every student's name at the beginning of the course and continues to have email \"sidebars\" with everyone.",
    "A gut... You won't really learn anything about writing, although it was very interesting to learn about figures like Da Vinci and Newton.",
    "This class is great, even if you're not interested in music--which I was not. It's a comprehensive survey of famous geniuses throughout history, analyzing them from the perspective of what made them geniuses. In addition, through this discussion, the class digs at the question, What is genius? If this sounds even the least bit interesting to you--whether from the perspective of psychology or history or literature or some other artistic or scientific pursuit--I highly recommend this class. The professor is wonderful, the subject is brilliant; this is one of those \"only at Yale\" classes.",
    "This class was much more work than I expected, with multiple papers. This class is good for those who don't want in-class tests (though there are three quizzes on the readings).",
    "Interesting class and interesting material and one of the easier writing credits. Grading is unfortunately pretty tough for the ease of the class and I don't necessarily feel smarter or like a better writer for taking the class, but I did enjoy it.",
    "This is an EXCELLENT class! It is so interesting to learn about all the major geniuses. I learned a lot about each one -- things I never expected to be true of geniuses!There is a fair amount of reading at the beginning of the semester, but the workload dies down around spring break or soon after. There are two quizzes and several papers, but they are not long.",
    "It's a very interesting course. I took it originally to fulfill both a WR and a requirement for my major, but found myself thoroughly engaged in the class despite the fact that the subject matter of the course diverged for my core areas of interest.",
    "Yes! It's a fantastic way to get a writing credit without having to take an intro english class. The material is fascinating and changes the way you think about intelligence and genius.",
    "much work at the beginning but it gets better.",
    "My favorite class all year! Would definitely recommend it! You learn a lot of interesting things about some extremely fascinating people, and in the process learn about how you could approach your life as well. The class seminar setting is also very encouraging and welcoming, but not such a heavy workload that you feel overwhelmed. The readings for the most part are also pretty interesting. And you get some great guest speakers.",
    "an almost philosophical approach to the concept of genius based on class discussions based on readings and the opinions of guest lecturers.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes, it's interesting and fun, and you get to learn about lots of other disciplines and to see some very extraordinary people at work.",
    "Maybe after a few years, once Wright has established the class and lectures.",
    "Anyone with a strong interest in musical and artistic geniuses should definitely consider this course. Other students should consider this course a divergent and enjoyable alternative to other writing courses."
