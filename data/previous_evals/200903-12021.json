   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it. Know that it's going to be a LONG final paper and a LOT of reading every week, so when you look at balancing your course load keep that in mind. But I would definitely tell another student to take the class. You'll think in new ways, and it's very applicable to everyday life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if Prof. Barnaby is teaching it. The materials are manageable yet interesting.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 321 to any second or third year English, history of art, art, film studies, theater studies, or humanities majors. It is a fun and interesting class that definitely applies to your life (in fact, it might apply a little too much since I can't stop thinking about it!).",
    "A really great class. A great collection of books and films set partnered with criticism. There is a lot (sometimes very dense) secondary material. It sets a very particular way of looking at the material which is fascinating, but perhaps limiting at times. Prof. Barnaby is a great discussion leader and keeps the class small so there can actually be productive discussions. Get ready to participate.",
    "A class with a great reading list approached from a perspective steeped in dense and tedious theory. Take it if it's your cup of tea.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course - whether or not you're a literature major!",
    "Visual Culture is an amazing class, and I highly recommend it if Professor Barnaby teaches it again next year. The theoretical framework for the class is Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle. Each week we read novels, plays, and watch films that address issues of visual culture in light of critical texts and Debord's idea of spectacle. The syllabus is wonderful -- we read critical material by Deleuze, W.J.T Mitchell, Benjamin, and the literary works include A Room with a View, Yasmina Reza's \"Art,\" and Rushdie's Midnight's Children. We watched films including Fight Club, Memento, and Lost in Translation. Everything that we read was incredibly interesting and Professor Barnaby pairs the critical work with the literature with such care. The class offers a very unique lens with which to read these texts. There is a lot of reading, but only if you read everything will you truly appreciate how rich the connections between the critical and literary works are.The class is an embodiment of interdisciplinary studies, bringing together art history, sociology, urban studies, literary and film theory. Definitely take this class -- it is one of the best I have taken at Yale, and Professor Barnaby is brilliant and wonderfully kind! The class is intellectually rigorous but not in an abstract way -- it is rare and unique in that it works to connect theory to the everyday. It challenges us to think about how visual culture affects the way we live our lives.",
    "Visual Culture is an interesting class based on the Guy Debord's treatise Society of the Spectacle. The material is all very fascinating - so fascinating that we often weren't able to get through all of it. Some of the theory was particularly tricky and hard to grasp, but luckily it didn't impede your general understanding of the class, although trudging through the theory often took up time we could have been looking at the literature and films. Professor Barnaby is very enthusiastic and encouraging. I found the class very worth while. Even though I fundamentally disagree with Debord's theory, it was interesting seeing how he viewed modern society."
