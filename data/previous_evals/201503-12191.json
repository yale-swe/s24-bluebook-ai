    "TAKE IT. JUST DO IT. BEST CLASS EVER.",
    "Take this class if you can get in! The workload is pretty late most of the semester (although the final paper is pretty long at 15-20 pages). Gitlin is a fantastic prof who knows so much interesting information about Yale history. You'll be coming back to your suitemates every week after class and sharing cool stories about Yale. As a bonus, Sam Chauncey sits in on the class. Sam was a senior Yale admin through the 60s and 70s and has amazing stories about the decision to make Yale coed, removal of quotas, etc. Can't recommend enough. If you want to take this class and aren't a senior, shop it. If you don't get in this year, make sure Professor G puts you on his list and you'll get in next year.",
    "If you want a fun, chill credit, do it! You'll know a lot more about Yale at the end. But don't take it if you want to learn about the hard parts of Yale.",
    "Like all great history classes, you don't leave feeling like you know all about the topic, but you finally have some sort of outline of what there is to know in the first place. Yale and America made me realize what a deep and fascinating history this place has! It's not really about Yale so much as about America through the lens of Yale. Take it if you have the space. Particularly recommended for senior history majors taking their victory lap.",
    "Amazing class. Take it if you can get in. Professor Gitlin is amazing.",
    "Take this course. You will learn so much. Whether you are a history major or not, there are things you cover that will forever change the way you understand America, and come to have a profound respect for alma mater. You won't regret shopping it.",
    "You can get away with not doing the readings for this class, but you really should. Everything is fun and enriching, especially for anyone with pride for Yale.",
    "Really fun class! I would recommend for people who really want to learn about the more pop culture aspects of Yale's history although the paper and projects do allow for more self guided study of other aspects of Yale history.",
    "Jay Gitlin is a Yale treasure, a landmark in an institution of landmarks. He's genuine, caring, kind, hilarious, and knowledgeable. Yale needs more professors who care like that. The class is great. You should take it. My one piece of advice would be this: Like any seminar, start working on your paper early. Not because it will be a struggle to finish (they are regardless of how early you start), but because you'll find yourself actually wanting to learn more about your topic. This class isn't like others. You aren't writing some ridiculously lengthy paper on obscure, historical economic reforms in another country. You're writing on Mother Yale. Whether you love her, hate her, or find yourself somewhere in-between, writing about Yale makes the paper so much more personal. There's something special about that. You'll have class in Davenport, but you'll also go to the YDN for class, Woodbridge Hall, and maybe even the Grove Street Cemetery. Not only that, Sam Chauncey (a living legend) helps co-teach the class. If you don't know who he is, google him. The class is a must-take for a variety of reasons. If you get frustrated with disorganization, I'd recommend you just get over it and take it anyway (you'll have to get over it sometime in your life, you might as well start with a cool undergraduate class).",
    "Yale and America is an interesting and fun seminar that presents information about Yale and its connection with history of the United States. I would definitely recommend this class - plus Professor Gitlin is an engaging professor.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale! I learned so much about the history of Yale and how Yale's history and alumni intertwine with American history. I also feel much more connected to the Yale Spirit. Professor Gitlin is great and has so many great stories! The only substantial work you have to do is some group projects and your final paper. So if you get in, you should definitely take it!"
