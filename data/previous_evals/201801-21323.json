    "HUM 300 goes through many classic speeches in the Western canon, giving you insights into the development of oratory as a concept and practice. At the same time, there is a practical element as students have to give speeches or introductions, giving you opportunities to refine your own speaking abilities.",
    "I worked on my public speaking skills, but more than anything, I learned a lot about what's going on in the world right now and what bigger trends they tie into. Lecture every day was also so so fascinating!",
    "A great course for learning not only about the theory and practice of oratory, but also about presentation in political\/professional life",
    "Not only did I hone my public speaking and speech writing skills, I also learned to connect classical concepts into one unified theory of statecraft. The abstraction skills and thoughtfulness I gained will remain invaluable way beyond my time at Yale.",
    "Through this course, I developed an understanding of the history of oratory, beginning with classical rhetorical principles from the age of Cicero and ending with early modern rhetoric and American rhetoric. Through studying the art of both speech writing and delivery, I was able to contextualize the way in which political moments shape language and rhetoric, and hone my own speech writing craft.",
    "Further speaking practice, but not as much as I had expected - could do with more speaking exercises"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "If this course has any weaknesses, it's that the midterm requires some pretty involved studying, and that there could be more public speaking opportunities.",
    "I wish there was more public speaking. The activity where we were given a current events topic and had only three minutes to prepare was a great exercise. I also enjoyed the other short exercises.",
    "Oratory and Statecraft had only strengths. First and foremost, Professor Hill. His wisdom was both practical and current. He artfully related concepts found in ancient classical works to eternal truths and current events. Second, course topics and structures. The seminar struck a perfect balance between breadth and depth. As it covered a time from Thudydides to Trump, the course discussions never felt shallow. At all times the insights were boundless.",
    "This course drew strength from the breadth and depth of the material covered and Professor Hills fascinating commentary. His knowledge, analysis, and personal experiences made for rich discussions, which were also peppered with insight and advice about the real world. Professor Hill was straightforward about his expectations and provided candid feedback; however, there was not as much transparency about the actual grading of assignments (i.e. the speeches themselves).",
    "\"News of the day\" discussions were usually interesting, but not very connected with course content. Felt that course content was squeezed out of latter part of semester as student speaking slots (disproportionately put later) piled up."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great way to learn a skill that isn't really taught in other parts of the Yale curriculum.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to anyone, from any major!",
    "Amazing and chill course for seniors with an amazing professor",
    "Absolutely take this if you can get in. Super low workload, Hill is so knowledgeable and kind, and feedback from classmates is super helpful. Perfect senior spring class.",
    "A good but hyped-up class. It's very low-stakes and unless you are already looking for a *very* chill class, you will not get as much out of this as you may want to--there is no incentive to do the readings, only three opportunities to give speeches, and during many meetings you will talk more about the news of the day rather than the speech\/speaker on the syllabus. When we did talk about the speech\/speaker, we rarely went into specifics or looked at techniques the used for writing or delivering the speech. Also, when you give in-class speeches, you will get feedback from only the other students, not Professor Hill himself. Having said that, I enjoyed the class; just think twice about taking it if it's going to be your first and only opportunity to practice public speaking\/speechwriting at Yale.",
    "Wonderful senior spring course. The lectures are interesting, light but insightful takes on the classics. The oratory is useful for every aspect of life",
    "If you get in, you would be a fool not to take this seminar. Oratory--especially as taught by Professor Hill--should be a core component of every liberal arts education.",
    "Every senior should take this class, regardless of major or future professional interests. Public speaking and speech writing is a skill that every Yale student should develop or hone before entering the real world. Furthermore, the readings were fascinating and the accompanying lectures were scintillating.",
    "This is a good senior year course with not much work. The content isn't life-changing, but you will learn about classical oratory in a way you probably won't get anywhere else at Yale unless you're a humanities or EP&E major. You'll get to practice speaking and get clear feedback, but only a few times in the semester."
