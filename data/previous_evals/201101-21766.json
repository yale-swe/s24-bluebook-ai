   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you have a legitimate interest in or curiosity about Economic History.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend this course. Great qualitative-based economics class.",
    "Do not take this course unless you are looking for an easy class with basically no work. But beware, grading on the midterm (and likely the final) was very, very harsh. I felt like I knew the material inside and out, backwards and forwards, and still got a B.",
    "Pretty solid class, interesting -- lectures are like long stories, but it is very important to make it to lecture and section every time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're an econ major. Not too hard.",
    "Quite an interesting class that makes you learn economic currents you never knew was underlying US history. It had a lot of writing and tests while most classes only have one or the other.",
    "Econ 182 is actually a very good class. I learned a lot this semester and enjoyed how different it was from other Econ classes here. It's not as quantitative and the history taught with it makes the course so intriguing. I would definitely recommend this course as a breather after Intermediate Micro (or it'd be great to take with it, since it's a fairly easy class). The professor who taught it is a Visiting Professor who won't be here next year, but she was extremely straight-forward with what she expected out of us. All that was tested was always either s aid in class or written on the board. She also handed out study guides with questions to get us thinking before the exams. Those were very helpful. I really liked the Great Debates paper where we had to pick a controversy in American Economic History and analyze and choose a side.Overall, take this course to give yourself a break from all the algebra-heavy economics classes. You won't regret it.",
    "I think it's a nice, refreshing change of pace from either History or Econ. I'd recommend it.",
    "Good overview of America's economic history. We only learn up until the Great Depression (which apparently is common for American Econ classes) so that was kind of disappointing. But overall the material was fairly interesting. Lecture was not the greatest. Professor Miller is quite knowledgeable, but the lectures got pretty tedious after a while. The work load for this class wasn't bad at all and the limited amount of readings definitely are not necessary if you attend class on a regular basis. Overall, I'd recommend it.",
    "Absolutely! Great general background knowledge that is useful for anybody interested in American history or industry.",
    "American economic history is such an interesting topic to deal with it, which made it all the more shocking to see how terrible this class was. It had almost no history, and the economics was less complex than an AP class. However, that didn't make it easy to do well. It was so tempting to never go to class or do any of the work that it turned out to more of a challenge than many classes I've taken.",
    "Good cursory course of American history.",
    "I would not recommend it. Deceptive class, you think it is easy, but then it is actually quite a pain.",
    "Great overview of how history ties in with econ. Take the class and do the work - especially when it comes to going to class. There are many assignments but don't assume the class is easy from the difficulty of the assignments. Would take the class again!",
    "The class itself isn't AWFUL, but the professor and her format make it somewhat annoying. There are a bunch of assignments and there are no notes online.",
    "Economic history papers in general suck. I really enjoyed the lectures but the out of class work is miserable. If you can handle that, though, take the course.",
    "If you are looking for an extremely easy fifth class, I would suggest this. Otherwise, there are other classes worth your time.",
    "Good survey of economic history. Material is interesting and assignments are reasonable.",
    "if you like economic history, then it's a straightforward class to take and good. make sure to pay attention to little details about format and structure of the class and you'll be fine. directions are key here, which is kind of cool because it forces you to be an honest student",
    "This class is a survey of american econ. history with special attention given this year at least to the history before the civil war. While it does cover more contemporary stuff, it spends very little time on those issues .",
    "Great subject for history and economics buffs (also, judging from the physical increase in interest in class when the banking system was discussed, it might be a good class for Yale's many prospective I-bankers)",
    "This class goes over American Economic history from American Indian times to the Great Depression. It was an interesting topic, although the economics involved are very limited (just supply and demand curve shifts and consumer surplus calculations). Mostly its just memorizing facts and figures about different aspects of economic history.",
    "This class is good for an Econ and History double major, but otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it. The class is deceptively easy - the lectures were really simple but the tests had difficult concepts. I came away with a new perspective on American history (through an economic lens), but I don't think it's worth it. Prof. Miller was a visiting professor though, so there will probably be another professor next year.",
    "I would recommend the class, it is interesting and gives another part of the story of US history that you learn in AP US History. Work load is not that much, you just have to go to class as she writes everything on the blackboard and that is the only way to get the information.",
    "A comprehensive look at American Economic History and the study of American Economic history. I would recommend it because the material is very interesting.",
    "You will learn a decent amount of economic history, and it is all very interesting, but I wouldn't suggest taking it with Melinda Miller.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, especially if you are looking for an easy econ credit.",
    "Interesting subject matter, especially if you are an ECON major. Really allows you to piece together some of the concepts you learn in other classes with what goes on in the real world. However, I would make sure you have a tried and true professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was very interesting and not very much work.",
    "Great overview of American History with some economics thrown in there. Yes, definately take it. My favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "pointless course",
    "If you can take any other course and fulfill whatever requirement you are trying to, do it. Unless the professor changes the lecture style or the school finds a new professor, find a different course to take. The subject matter is very interesting, but the course was somehow terrible.",
    "This was an excellent introduction to economic history in both methods and topics.",
    "Yes easy econ credit",
    "Yes, interesting curriculum and straight forward.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn about American history from an economic point of view",
    "I would not recommend it. If you are either a history or an econ major, there are many better courses out there."
