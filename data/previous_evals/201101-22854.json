   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in learning more about the field of material culture and talk about the connections between consumption patterns and identity.",
    "Take it!",
    "great course to approach history and the world around us in a way that is new revealing and insightful... professor Yokota and this course come highly recommended!",
    "The title pretty much sums it up: ethnicity and material culture. We looked at ways in which consumption patterns reflected the cultural memory surrounding race and how individuals constructed their own racial identity or how they thought about others'. We read historical texts, theoretical texts, personal essays, ethnographies, and everything in between. Because this isn't a veritable \"field\" it is interesting to see the ways in which people think about the connection between race and material culture in their particular studies. This makes our work inherently interdisciplinary.",
    "This seminar opens you up to questions about consumption as it relates to ethnicity and race. It prompts you to ask questions about the mundane things you do in your every day life and the greater meaning behind them. I took the course with Professor Yokota, so if this is offered again with a different professor, make sure to check it out first!",
    "It's an absolutely fantastic class with an amazing professor that you should without a doubt take if you have thechance. You will grow so much as a student of these subjects and really come out of the class feeling stronger in your abilities to discuss these fun and interesting yet complex topics."
