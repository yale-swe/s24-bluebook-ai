This case enabled me to look into the type of government interventions that could be implemented to solve, for example, liquidity difficulties at financial institutions. The YPFS will have great impact in the way we deal with future crises, and this directed studies was a great way to participate in it, and contribute to the much-needed research on macroprudential financial regulation that still needs to be done."
