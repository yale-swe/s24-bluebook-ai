    "If you took 260, take 261-- it's the same math requirement, so why not? If you didn't take 260, I'd say not. The leap in what's expected may be too great, unless you felt bored in 200 and have multivariable under your belt.You really explore some interesting topics in this class and touch on the derivations of and thought behind modern physics.A later, thorough understanding of modern physics would actually be difficult without taking this class.",
    "I recommend this course if you are a physics major. It really allows you to sink your teeth into the more advanced math.",
    "261 is the continuation of 260, so you probably already know what is going on pretty much.",
    "I'd be a bit hesitant, don't expect to learn things that are very rigorous.",
    "Physics 261 is definitely the best intro physics course for people who are more interested in advanced topics like quantum and GR. The workload is not bad at all, and there are only 2 tests during the semester. The tests are pretty fair, but it is difficult to know what one should study and focus on. Baltay is a good professor, and a great character to have. In general, it's a pretty good intro physics class, and worth taking over 181 or 201. Class is sometimes boring, but in the end you learn about a topics much more in depth than you would in most other freshman courses.",
    "really good class. if you've had a really strong background in hs physics, it's not too bad although if there are still things you're really shaky on take 200 because this is fast-paced.part 2 of a good year of Baltay physics.",
    "This is an absolutely miserable course. If you read the course description or go to the physics department session on \"deciding which physics course to take,\" you'll get the idea that this course is intended for students far beyond the AP Physics C level. I think that is almost word for word how the course was described in the physics department sessions: physics 200\/201 for at phys C level and phys 260\/261 for those students far beyond it. That is absolutely incorrect.The first semester of this course was taught at a level below that of my Physics C course in high school. We used a wonderful textbook but never more than scraped the surface on topics. In the fall semester, we covered the Lagrangian and *Special relativity. The lagrangian was covered only to the extent of single variable problems. Any high school student, given the Lagrangian formulation, could solve such a problem. Special relativity was also covered at a very basic, simplistic level. The professor claimed to do 4-vectors, but really only briefly covered the idea in class and then never actuallyrequired the students to apply the concepts on problem sets. The professor did, however, throw a special relativity problem onto the fall final that was best solved using four-vectors (though it was not absolutely necessary to solve it that way).On that same midterm, he asked you to apply the velocity addition formula to 0.8c + 0.9c. That counted for 1\/8 of the final, so it was 1\/16 of the course. Truly impressive.Otherwise, the tests in the fall term (and the spring midterm as well) were less difficult than my high school examinations, had fewer problems, and a greater amount of time given to take the exam. Anyone with a decent AP Physics C preparation could probably have skipped every fall lecture and still earned an A in the class.I don't know why I chose to continue this course this semester. It was an absolutely horrible decision. Concepts were again covered at a mediocre level (though the electrodynamics book is also very good). Baltay claims to derive formulas and concepts but does it only at a very simplistic, non-rigorous level. General relativity, for example, was *examined* without covariant and contravariant formulations.The book used for quantum mechanics was written 18 years ago and has numerous mistakes in it. Baltay spent an entire day's lecture covering n,l,m_l, and m_s quantum numbers. Thanks for the trip in time back to middle school.There were kids in this class who had never before done calculus based physics. How can a student be far above an AP Physics C level without having done calculus-based physics?!Other than the lagrangian, the only new mechanics that I learned was the application of vector calculus, as I had never before really used the del operator.This course is an embarrassment to Yale, and it has made me absolutely abhor attending physics class. Anyone with a decent physics preparation should go straight to one of the Phys 400 level courses here.Anyone who has never had physics before would probably do fine in this course.Baltay asked students to redo one of his fake derivations on the spring final exam. How wonderful. The spring term does not test problem-solving based physics. It tests students on their ability to regurgitate many different formulas in a thoughtless manner. If I wanted to spend my time memorizing simple things and wasting my time with students who've had almost no physics preparation, I would have gone to community college or majored in biology. I sure shouldn't be paying ~$5,000 ($25,000 per term divided amongst five classes, for those with little math preparation who are considering this course) for such a worthless set of lectures.This class has made me consider changing majors (away from physics). If the other physics classes at Yale are anything like this, then I most certainly should.",
    "This is a good course with lots of interesting material not normally learned in an introductory physics course. The professor is very good, the homework is not too bad, and the tests are reasonable. A relatively strong math or physics background is recommended, but anyone who really loves learning about physics will like this course.",
    "My feeling is this course is for a non-physics major. It walks you through the maths without really telling you what's going on in the physics. He is not scientifically rigorous about his proofs and always jumps from one step to the other. You might be able to learn it well if you are motivated enough to read supplemental materials outside of class. But overall I didn't have a good grasp of any topic he covered this term. In the end I was simply trying to remember formulas, which is really sad for a physics student.",
    "This class is a very good intro to physics. If you know multivariable calculus, have a strong background in physics and are planning to major in physics, I would consider skipping the course. I found it to be easier than most non-science majors rumored it to be. Also, Math 230 is COMPLETELY superfluous for this course. You are much better off taking a multivariable course or Diff Eq.",
    "I found this class enjoyable, although for me it was quite a bit harder than 260. This might be because I had basically no E&M background, thought, so that might not be true for you. General relativity was a blast, though. If you liked 260 and did well in it, I'd recommend continuing in 261.",
    "This is a good course for anyone with a strong interest in the more theoretical side of physics and who is comfortable occasionally venturing outside of their comfort zone.",
    "Overview of most of Newtonian Mechanics, E&M, Quantum Mechanics, Special and some General Relativity. Good fundamental intro course, but difficult.",
    "This class is really good. Prof. Baltay is a great teacher, and the stuff he teaches is generally pretty interesting. The relativistic electrodynamics and general relativity stuff is particularly interesting, and the unique way Prof. Baltay does it is interesting and understandable. Some stuff we learn in class is very difficult and complicated, but the tests are fair and won't ask about the super-hard things that we cover in class. You should definitely take this course (but I guess you already did take Phys 260).",
    "It's a great exposure to a lot of topics that are way too advanced for freshmen. So while you'll understand very little of what's going on, it's really cool to get a glimpse of quantum mechanics and general relativity. If you took 260, there's no reason not to take this.",
    "Physics 261 was a great class; I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed and did well in 260. That being said, it was very challenging in unimaginable ways \u0096 without Physics C background, I struggled through the rest of E&M before an easy interlude of quantum mechanics(the book is simple) before we return to speaking math for the last month straight. The end products of our derivations were awesome, but I definitely didn\u0092t understand each step of the way, especially when partial differential equations and tensors got involved (more things I didn\u0092t have background in). That being said, Baltay is an amazing lecturer, who peppers his clear explanations with his unique brand of humor. The problem sets and midterm were very fair, though the final was pretty hard. Good luck!",
    "Harder than 260 in terms of the material presented, but also more interesting. If you're taking this than you probably already took 260 (probably wouldn't recommend it if you didn't do the first term), and this will definitely go beyond the scope of what you covered in high school. Definitely go to class (especially for the general relativity stuff) and try to appreciate the general concepts rather than getting bogged down in all the technicalities of the mathematics.",
    "Physics 261 was one of the most academically enriching courses I have taken in my life; however, it is not for the mathematically faint hearted. The course follows a perfect progression. Dr. Baltay begins the year wrapping up E&M and moves on to electromagnetic waves. He then uses that concept to enter the realm of quantum mechanics, which he explains in mathematically advanced, yet fascinating detail (yes, you do learn Schrodinger Equations!). From there, he enters his discussion of General Relativity by first deriving the covariant formulation of electromagnetism. And finally, you end the year with an unadulterated depiction of General Relativity. The midterm and final are hard, but fair if you study (although you might be put off by some of the outspoken geniuses in your class). I highly recommend this course and Dr. Baltay.",
    "If you took PHYS 260 and didn't do terribly, you should definitely continue on to this class. Be forewarned that 261 is a few notches harder than 260, both because you won't have seen much of the material before (e.g. quantum mechanics, general relativity), and also because everything is taught at a much faster pace.",
    "Overall, PHYS260\/261 is a very rigorous introduction to physics - take it only if you're seriously considering the physics major. Professor Baltay is great, although the lecture notes are sometimes too high level and riddled in mistakes to be sensical. This second semester was pretty grueling in terms of trying to grasp concepts in general relativity and quantum mechanics, and there really isn't a textbook, so you have to try to understand whatever is taught in class. The material is quite neat and fascinating, but very difficult.",
    "This course is what you'd expect from Physics 260; just be aware that general relativity is quite difficult.",
    "We covered too much material too fast. It was frustrating to not have a textbook for general relativity.",
    "I really like Baltay's approach to the material which begins with traditional E+M, then goes into a light treatment of quantum mechanics and then circles back using relativity to derive E+M and finally hitting general relativity. Professor Baltay did a good job transitioning between topics and motivating the new with the old. I think an introductory physics course should expose students to a broad body of material which is what this course did. I am not going to be a physics major, but I would recommend this course even to someone whohas to take physics as a requirement. The problem sets and exams were not too difficult and the workload was generally moderate. There are only two midterms which makes it easier to study in a concentrated fashion.",
    "take it. take it. take it.",
    "This is a natural, if difficult, follow up to physics 260. If you haven't taken 260, don't take this. Be aware that it does get more difficult at the end.",
    "Good variety of material; fair tests and problem sets. I like the format of having two lectures and one optional problem session per week. General relativity, E&M, quantum mechanics. Professor Baltay is a very clear, organized, and knowledgeable lecturer. His presentation of the material is very effective and helpful and he was able to pace the course appropriately.",
    "I would recommend it to students wishing to quickly get a basis of physics that can easily be used start branching out in physics",
    "If you have at least AP Physics (mechanics and E&M) and some multivariable calculus background you are technically prepared for this class, but it's not easy. Professor Baltay is really good though, so if you're willing to put in some effort to understand if it gets difficult this class is definitely worth taking. Just one problem set each week of varying difficulty, a midterm and a final.",
    "Yes.",
    "There are different phases of the class, some were really hard, some were more easily managed. Very interesting material, but alot of work at times. I went to the tutor quite a bit for this class. I took physics C in high school, but thought this was substantially harder. Still, it's pretty rewarding, you get to learn some really interesting stuff.",
    "The electrodynamics part of the semester is much harder than the first semester's material, as one might guess from the beginning of electrodynamics from the first semester. After that it mostly gets easier, but then becomes extremely difficult during the last couple weeks. I don't know if taking this course is really worth taking over 201, considering the general relativity is hard and isn't given much class time. The introductory quantum mechanics and the electrodynamics (though maybe tougher than necessary) are good though.",
    "I would highly recommend Physics 261. It is an awesome course that teaches advanced physics topics in a clear and concise manner. Professor Baltay is legendary and was a pleasure to learn from. While the material can sometimes get quite convoluted, the psets and exams are quite reasonable. Again, this is a course that I would highly recommend for all who are interested in learning cool concepts in physics. Nerd."
