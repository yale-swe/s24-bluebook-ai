   "comments": [
    "Yes, I already have.",
    "Great class.",
    "This is an excellent seminar to take as it discusses fundamental theories and questions underlying the historic and geographic narrative of development. It discusses the vastness of the discipline as it interacts with other sciences and the specifics of the technologies, politics, societal issues and the everyday concerned with geography.",
    "I would recommend this course without reservation. I would summarize it as an interdisciplinary thematic examination of the relation and overlap between history and geography.",
    "Yes, absolutely. There's something here for almost anyone. I'd certainly recommend it for someone at my stage (second year history PhD) - it's a great chance to think about new ideas from a variety of disciplines and parts of the world before throwing oneself into orals work.",
    "I would recommend this course to any history student interested incorporating spatial aspects into their research, because of the strong methodological focus."

   "comments": [
    "It has expanded a definition and understanding of geography that is far greater than the applications associated with it. It has raised greater interest in the relationship of the discipline in the politics of state and the everyday. This course has helped me to identify a framework for developing my thesis question.",
    "I took a great deal from this course. I fully expect to use the perspectives and insights gained and appreciated over the course of the semester on subjects ranging from maps to GIS to spatial theory to environmental determinism in my future work. A valuable and unique offering. All historians should have some similar training to appreciate space like they already appreciate time.",
    "It's perhaps a little too soon to say. It didn't so much deepen knowledge of my discipline as much as provide new ways of looking at and processing that knowledge, and thinking of new ways to ask questions. That might be the foundation of my dissertation project, or it might be a diffuse contribute that informs my dissertation research more quietly.",
    "This course contributed significantly to the development of my prospectus, by adding a spatial focus to my research."
