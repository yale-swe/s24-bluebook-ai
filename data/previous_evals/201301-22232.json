    "superb teacher with amazing insight. shop his section and you'll see! highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend English 125 to another student--but only if you enjoy reading AND writing about poetry, or think you might. You'll be doing a lot of close reading, which is really gratifying, but if that's not your thing, you might want to steer clear. It's really not too much reading for an intro English course, especially compared to something like American lit. English majors: don't panic, it's really not bad. Everyone: take it with Minnis, he's incredibly nice and helpful, and really chill.",
    "I absolutely loved this course! The readings were incredible, moving, and provided good fodder for discussion. Professor Minnis did a wonderful job with the course, and I am very proud of some of the work I did this semester. A good base course for the English major, though it would be valuable for anyone, provided you are willing to do quite a bit of writing.",
    "English 125 is a fun course if you're interested in the four poets. It is a fair amount of reading, especially for The Canterbury Tales and The Faerie Queene, which are in Middle English and fairly dense. However, class discussion is fun, and you can write your papers on basically anything that interests you. Professor Minnis is a lot of fun and good at keeping the discussion going, so I'd definitely recommend taking it with him.",
    "YES! I am not a English major, and although I found this may be intimidating at first, it turned out to be a really great experience. Take it this class if you want to learn how to read older English poetry and write poetic analysis.",
    "Yes, but only for students who are genuinely interested in great poetry. All four poets (Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne) are fantastic, and you are expected to understand, appreciate, and derive multiple layers of meaning from their works. This should be very fun for those who like poetry.",
    "If you're interested in the material take the course! Yet its definitely a bit of a nerd fest sometimes so if you're excited for that its a fun course to take!",
    "Yes. It was a great class about wonderful writers. It will develop your appreciation for otherwise difficult texts.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the English 125 course. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne are all incredible poets and the opportunity to analyze the nuances of the poetry of each is one that should not be passed up. I have very little to say in regardto the weaknesses of the course--each poet has very important insights that help build the foundations for a budding English major. However, that being said, if you are not a huge fan of medieval literature or do not intend to be an English major, ENGL125 may not be the most ideal course choice. If you are, then absolutely no regrets. Professor Minnis is an excellent professor: insightful, very approachable and extremely willing to help students. Whenever I had a draft for a paper, Professor Minnis was more than happy to look through it and give me thorough constructive feedback on how to improve as a writer. I had a great semester in ENGL125 and I have no doubt that this was due largely to Professor Minnis's guidance and input.",
    "Take this class!! I loved it."
