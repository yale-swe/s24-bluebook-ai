    "A study of a series of fictional novels that address the Caribbean diaspora on multiple levels. From the Dominican Republic to England to Haiti - the class tackles a multiplicity of books that explain the position of Caribbean diasporic people in the United States, England, and in their home countries. Race, sexuality, ethnicity, culture, memory, gender, and migration are all interwoven themes that produce some of the most inspiring discussions I have had at Yale. The presentation requires some time and close reading of the text, use of outside materials, and attention to your peers' posts. The weekly posts are about 1-2 pages, but you will find it hard to limit yourself as you become amazed by the reading. The selected works are ALL engaging and very enjoyable to read. A standard 20-page final paper. Professor Carby is AMAZING! She is a definite must-take-a-class-with-her Professor as she is brilliant and will never cease to inspire you at every class.",
    "You read a set of Carribean Literature and write weekly reading responses (3 pages) on them. It's a small seminar.",
    "Yes take this class if you love to read good novels every week. Be prepared for the weekly reading responses. They can sneak up on you.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This is an absolutely amazing class that I am afraid might be looked over by too many students who would greatly benefit from and contribute to the course. The books were wonderfully chosen, and I learned about Caribbean history as well as literary styles through the novels we read. Perhaps the most influential class I have taken so far. The workload is sooo manageable. And Professor Carby is one of the best professors that Yale has to offer. You will NOT be disappointed at all. Very easy going, but you get so much out of it. And I think the name doesn't do it justice at all. It should have a much more exciting title. Best. Class. Ever."
