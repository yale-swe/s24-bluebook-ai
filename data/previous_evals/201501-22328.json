    "The course was a great introduction to art history and an interesting subject matter. Professor James is awesome and really exposed me to knew insights about the African American experience in America from the 1960s to the 2000s. I thought that the midterm and final were a bit too difficult, given that we had to recall more than 250 paintings with dates, artist name, and work title, and compare them to each other. I think that more questions like the essay questions which allowed us to reflect on the works we had seen and craft an interesting and compelling argument would have been better. I loved the paper we wrote, which allowed us to dig deeper into one aspect of the course that we found interesting. Overall, amazing class and I definitely will recommend this to another student.",
    "Lots of work but all worth it. Learned so much about African American history as well. By far the best art history course I've taken, especially with Danielle as TA. Highly recommended",
    "If you're interested in the subject, take the course. You Will learn a lot!",
    "The exams are overwhelming in the number of IDs, but aside from that I loved the class.",
    "The class covers many different artists and styles. It is thought provoking and engaging and political. If you're interested in AfAm studies and\/or art, this taking is definitely worth taking.",
    "Solid class, a bit disorganized but posed important questions about African American identity in the context of art history. You get to see a lot a lot a lot of amazing works in this class which might be worth taking it Credit\/D. Not too much work.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student, even for those who are not history of art majors. This is art everyone should be familiar with, very relevant and current.",
    "A lot of work, very heavy image memorization that was a little unreasonable at times.",
    "YES YES YES. This is an amazing course and I've learned so much from my time in it. This was my first art history course ever, and while it's totally doable having no experience in art history coming into the course, it definitely helps if you've taken one I think. Do not underestimate the workload of the course though. I took it as a 5th class, but the work became quite a lot for the class at times. 2 weekly lectures, a weekly section, 2 papers, 2 exams and a presentation. I guess I just didn't know that art history exams usually require you to memorize the artist, title and date of hundreds of works of art.... But honestly, I loved doing the work for this course. This topic is so fascinating and really relevant to our times. It's really cool going on the field trip to the museum, because you feel like you're going to a museum in such a different way. Plus section every week is basically going to the print room at the YUAG and looking at AMAZING works by people you study in class, and just talking about them. So chill and really fun. This class has changed the way I think visually, and I think that's an experience everyone should have. Whether it's through this class or another art\/art history class, do it! This class has been fantastic in every way possible.",
    "Great class about something you wouldn't learn about otherwise - definitely take it while you're at Yale!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The material is very important and a lot of it is too absent from many accounts of our history. It would be interesting, and important for any student I think, not only art historians."
