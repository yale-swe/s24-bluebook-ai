    "yes, it is a good chance to make good music with talented people if you don't want to join the yso or other organizations",
    "An excellent way to get to know other undergraduate musicians and play great music.",
    "Absolutely great if you like chamber music.",
    "MUS 221 is a wonderful class that Yale offers for musicians looking for more organized chamber performance opportunities. Also a great way to meet and get to know other dedicated musicians.",
    "This is a great class if you can get into it. You have to audition, but if you get in, the class is actually a lot of fun without too much work (beyond practicing and coaching).",
    "This chamber music class is an excellent way to meet new friends and study with great music professors! Definitely take this course. As long as you stay on top of your progress, you will have a very fun and rewarding experience.",
    "Fine class, get to play chamber music for credit.",
    "I definitely recommend Music 221. It's basically like a super fun extracurricular activity except you get half a credit for it. The coaches are really good.",
    "Chamber music with other talented musicians for credit. What else do you want?",
    "It is a great course to take if you are a serious undergraduate musician at yale.",
    "Its the most social class I will ever take at Yale- it hardly feels like a class when you get to know your coaches, play great music, and enjoy constructive criticism from your peers. This course has been an integral part of my experience at Yale because of the friendships I formed through it, and if you enjoy your instrument and want to be more involved in Yale's classical musician community I would HIGHLY recommend it."
