   "comments": [
    "More of a survey of imperialism\/colonialism in the middle east vs. state-building or insurgency but that's clear from the syllabus. Puts the current situation in the middle east in much greater context but doesn't answer any questions moving forward.",
    "Eh. I did't particularly like it because 1) it spent far too much time on colonial history and not nearly enough on contemporary insurgency\/counterinsurgency and state building issues, and 2) the seminar felt more like a super disorganized lecture because Prof. Wyrtzen invariably ends up talking the whole time about any one of a million possible tangents.",
    "A course covering imperialism and insurgency in the middle east from the Ottomans to the Present.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class, you will learn a lot. Professor Wrytzen is a fantastic teacher who creates an environment that's perfect for intellectual discussion. The readings are very interesting and manageable and the exams are easy if you've been paying attention and doing the readings. During one of the weeks, we were able to debate a group of students from the American University in Cairo via live video conference and it was amazing. If you have any interest in the Middle East, this is a must take!",
    "Absolutely. Fascinating class, engaging readings, fantastic lectures. Do the reading and the seminar will teach you an amazing amount about the Arab world, and allow you to engage with the region in a much more sensitive, knowledgeable, and productive manner.",
    "For me, Imperialism and Insurgency in the Middle East gave me a thorough understanding of the tumultuous events happening in the Middle East throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. It is an important subject and the class does a great job at reviewing the historical and the current. Be prepared for a lot of reading and many classmates with an intense interest in the subject.",
    "This class has incredible potential. The topic and supporting readings are incredibly interesting, and Wyrtzen is really well read and passionate about his work. Unfortunately, the seminar style allowed the course to be dominated by a very select few students who felt comfortable speaking at length even though they had an embarrassingly basic understanding of the history or concepts at hand. I would recommend the class for anyone with a strong interest but would caution them that the other students in the class really make the experience."
