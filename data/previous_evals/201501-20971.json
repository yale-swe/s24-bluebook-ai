   "comments": [
    "I will recommend ENAS 642 01 to another student. The course is relevant and important. The professor teaches well and the test are fair.",
    "We are provided with a foundation in chemical reaction engineering - at first, these seem extraneous to the overall course objective, but then we tie back some concepts later on with chemical reaction engineering processes, which was a very nice trajectory. The stepwise discussion of different small-scale, mechanistic aspects of water and wastewater treatment processes was excellent. This added nicely to the practical, process-based teaching I had from my undergraduate studies at another institution. This is a required course for environmental engineers, but I would recommend to students even if it wasn't because of the professor's excellence and the overall utility of the course content in environmental engineering.",
    "Provided a knowledgeable overview regarding various environmental applicable processes. I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in environmental engineering as it provides a great introductory overview.",
    "Helpful for membrane and chemical engineering reactor work. Would recommend for those goals."
