    "I would recommend this course to another student--definitely has changed my way of thinking in ways that aren't immediately evident but manifest randomly in conversation. If you have no background in philosophical readings, don't let that deter you. You will still be able to take this course like I did--just be sure that you are willing to put in extra time, because I was a little surprised by just how much prior reading\/work other students in the course had done.",
    "Really excellent course. Brilliant reading list, and interesting study of the overlap of Eastern European dissent and Existentialism. Marci Shore is AWESOME.",
    "Don't take",
    "Existentialism, then Marxism, then post Marxism, then post Stalinism. Amazing unique perspective journey through the intellectual history of Europe over the past 200 years.",
    "Take it! Syllabus will let you read thinkers you may already have familiarity with; it will also introduce you to new Eastern European thinkers you've probably never read. Best academic decision I made this year.",
    "Interesting material, although it is dense and takes a lot of time to get through. I would recommend this class if you've had a long-standing interest in existentialism, eastern European thought, philosophy, etc. As a casual humanities class, this is probably not what you would be looking for."
