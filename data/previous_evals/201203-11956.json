    "It's a lot of work but i would recommend it because the teaching was great and i learned a lot.",
    "Take French 121 with Mme. Skorupa.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you haven't taken French in a long while, but are slightly better than the average student at remembering what you did in French class in high school.It's basically a review of high school french.",
    "I would recommend it. if you want to work on your grammar, take it!",
    "I would recommend it. It's a basic French language course. I feel like my French improved a fair amount, and it was a fairly fun class.",
    "I definitely recommend French 121 01. Although it is fast-paced, you are constantly submerged in the French language. The class is spoken entirely in French, so active participation is key for understanding what is going on. Each class has a general theme for grammar\/writing skills, based around either the French In Action movie, another movie, or short poem\/story.",
    "A really wonderful course. The first time since elementary school that I really enjoyed learning a foreign language. Manageable workload, reasonable grading. Take it with Skorupa if possible, she's one of the best professors I've had.",
    "You definitely need a background in French. You can't jump into it, but if you are comfortable then it is a good class to take.",
    "Yes!"
