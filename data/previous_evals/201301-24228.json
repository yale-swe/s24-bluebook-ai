    "I felt that the readings of this course was very ambitious for the professor to assign. While I initially had read the readings assigned in the beginning, I felt worn out by the middle of the semester since there was so much to cover. The readings were very long and covered way too much material without being very succinct. For example, an entire manual was assigned that consisted of over 100 pages. With the policy briefs, there were good examples of what the professor desired. However, the professor did not really provide resources for us to use to find data minus the Global Health Heat Index. I think it would have been nice to have specific websites or journals that the professor found to be helpful. While he made attempts to steer the students in the right direction, he overwhelmed the students with excess. I feel that having a handful of options would have helped motivate the students to use the ones of good quality and feel less overwhelmed.",

   "comments": [
    "This course had a lot of potential to be great. However, sometimes class time was not fulfilling. It was hard to stay engaged in so many Skype presentations. Also, some of the group work could have been organized better. I didn't think I learned much from the group work besides the one case study regarding ARV distribution in a country. Otherwise it felt like a rush to put something together to present in class that wasn't all that great and that no one was really paying attention to anyhow.",
    "the class is too long. it should be shortened",
    "I enjoyed this class very much. I did not have a good background in Global Health Issues, and now I feel very well versed and knowledgable. Guest speakers were very helpful to see. The policy briefs were extremely useful to build skills of writing concisely and using data to make an argument. When doing group presentations they may benefit from the groups being smaller.",
    "The course has a lot of potential and I feel that many associate global health with the principles of public health. As a result, I think a global health course is paramount in the public health curriculum and should be a strong class. This course successfully utilized the professor's knowledge of the topic. He is deeply connected with experts in the field and did a wonderful job reaching out to them to guest lecture. I found their insight to be priceless and brought a lot of new ideas to the classroom.The format of the class stimulates good discussion. The professor likes to cold call students and asks for their insight on specific topics. Although the professor asks for the students' opinion, it seems that he is looking for a specific answer. This in turn impedes the students willing to share since the students are not quite sure how to react if the answer does not match that of the professor. As a result, many times I felt that students were hesitant to respond. I would suggest that the professor welcome all answers and uplift\/motivate the students to keep on thinking. While an answer may not match his thoughts, he can help lead the students to his ideas in a positive way.",
    "The strengths of the course were the interesting speakers that Professor Skolnik brought in from many organization. Additionally, I enjoyed the policy briefs as a practical and manageable way to learn about global health issues. The readings for each week amounted to several hundred pages, and after the first couple weeks it was difficult to attempt to cover all readings. Instead, it would have been helpful to have 3-4 articles to focus on thoroughly reading. Finally, it would be helpful to have class periods shortened and not during dinner time if that option is available.",
    "Great Course! If you want to be in global health or know anything about it, this is definitely a fundamental course to take.",
    "Great course. Proabably the best I've taken at Yale up until now.",
    "Very good course in starting to understand the complexities of global health issues. Richard Skolnik is a practitioner and I loved the practical emphasis of this course. It differs from the theoretical courses that are offered and was a good fit for my style of learning. The assignments are assignments that I can see myself working on when I graduate. The only challenging part was properly understanding what Professor Skolnik wanted in his assignments. I tried to follow his template as closely as possible, but I'm still not sure if I got it right. Also, on a weekly basis, there was a lot of readings. While these are great reference materials, it is not possible to manage all the readings on top of all the other demands of being a grad student.",
    "Overall, this was an excellent course. Although we weren't able to go into great detail about any single topic, we did get a broad overview of the critical issues in global health. My favorite aspect of the course was the full-group discussions, because Professor Skolnik's teaching style keeps students engaged and on their toes. Some of the guest speakers were excellent (Keith Hansen, Gina Lagomarsino), while others were a bit weaker.The group presentations were generally not as beneficial because of the quick in-class preparation. Perhaps in future years, students could work in groups outside of class to prepare one or two presentations. I think that the additional prep time would increase the quality and relevance of the presentations.I thought that the policy memo exercises were very useful (great practice for the real world). I do wish that we had done three distinct types of memos instead of only two, though. For example, perhaps one of the memos could be written for a different audience, like a multilateral organization or the head of an NGO.",
    "Good discussion style course with lots of opportunity to speak in class",
    "The course was a great way to get a foundation in global health. There were too many readings assigned to practically read every week. Learning to write policy briefs was very valuable.",
    "This is a good course in global health policy and politics. I don't know that is the best option as a foundation course for the global health concentration, since its focus is very heavily in policy. However, it is a good course if you want to continue to work in policy -- Professor Skolnik tells a story about global health policy that would be hard to find from any other professor.The policy briefs are great assignments that I learned a lot from. I wish I could have had more flexibility about what to write about -- for example pick three of these areas: health systems, environmental health, infectious diseases (or neglected tropical diseases even), maternal and child health, mental health, etc. so that each student could focus it more based on their concentration and interests. Also, I just think environmental health is a really important global health topic that often gets overlooked.I would prefer that the in-class structure of the course change a bit. I thought it was really beneficial to have a long list of readings, and then 1-3 highlighted readings that were particularly important. I would do less group presentations (no more than 2 I'd say), and more partner or small group assignments if you want to switch up the activities from lecture.In general, I think the scope of the course -- if it will stay the foundation course for the global health concentration -- should expand and look to the future -- environmental issues, chronic disease, mental health, public private partnerships, etc. instead of staying so focused on the past (maternal and child health, exclusively low and middle income, etc.)",

    "Must take course at YSPH",
    "This course is excellent and it provides a great foundation for global health.Strengths:The course instructor is very knowledgeableContent and readingGuest speakersWeaknesses:Discussions would be helpful if people did their readings (grade for participation)Group sessions are sometimes not helpful",
    "This is a phenomenal course for anyone looking to get a firm grounding in global health. Professor Sknolnik is phenomenally knowledgeable about the full-range of critical issues and teaches you not only the core takeaways you MUST know to be global health professional, but also the more interesting and useful, more nuanced understandings of the issues that will help you advance even further in your career.",
    "The instructor and the guest lecturers were simply excellent. The overall quality of the material was great and really covered most of the critical topics that need to be addressed in a course like this. I feel I learned a lot through this class.",
    "Excellent introduction to global health and probably a must-take for students entering the field.Team exercises could be given more time and guidance to make them more valubale.",
    "Strengths: in class discussions can be very engaging. The topics are also very interesting.Weaknesses: I did not like the guest Skype lecturers. Many people do, but I found them very difficult to pay attention to. I understand the appeal of having experts teach us; making these Skype sessions more interactive and discussion based may make it more worthwhile.The list of readings is unreasonable. Limiting the list to the best overviews of the topics would make the readings more feasible to get through.",
    "this course is great to have a board and overall understanding about the most critical issues facing public health.It provides insight into not only a single disease\/health care issue but also the policy context behind it.It will be great if the names\/titles famous people\/ website\/books\/ articles mentioned in class can be compile into a file for each topic.It will be great if there are more horizontal and vertical comparison between countries.eg. a b c countries are similar in several aspects but a country has a unique feature in this respect therefore leads to abc results.this will help to give a deeper impression for each country.",
    "This course was a great overview of global health topics. While the policy briefs were frustrating at times, it is nice to know how to actually write one. I still need some extra practice on them. The class time was horrible; it was too long and too late. I enjoyed the sessions where we have case studies and group presentations. I also enjoyed some of our guest speakers. The readings were quite lengthy."

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Skolnik has a great wealth of knowledge and I believe really cares about students. He does, however, come across extremely harsh at times. It seems to make students less engaged and for me, personally, decreases my motivation to try harder. He seems to basically only ever have negative feedback for us, whether individually or as a group. Although he offers to go over our work with us, he has already made me feel so incompetent that I'd rather just take the poorer grade then open myself up to more negative feedback and criticism. I appreciate that he goes out of his way to meet with students, but at this point I'm not sure how many of them would want to set up a meeting.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He was enthusiastic, but he likes to call on people. This is not grade school. Also he has favorites in the class.",

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is a very cordial man who tries to relate to his students in many ways. Whether it be through cultural means or by talking about his past experience, Professor Skolnik likes to build a relationship. While this is a factor in his approach to relate to the students, he can sometimes come off as abrasive to students. While he encourages students to share their information, the professor likes to dominate the conversation and in turn limits the students' opportunity to discuss. I noticed some students were timid toward the professor since they were unsure how to react to his personality.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik was a charismatic and knowledgeable professor, and therefore I found class to be an interesting experience. He was also responsive and prompt with feedback.",

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is an excellent teacher and mentor. He is clearly extremely knowledgeable about current issues and trends in global health. On the rare occasion when he didn't have an immediate answer to a student question, he went out of his way to seek out information through his vast network. He is quite engaged with the global health community and is also very willing to use his connections to benefit he students, either by bringing in guest speakers or by setting up conversations between students and global health professors. I found him to be a particularly devoted teacher.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is great at stimulating discussion in the class but is kind of intimidating. He cold calls on people which isn't the best way to know what they're thinking or to assess how much they know because most people are too nervous to say something articulate. It would be much better to develop a system where everyone speaks freely and openly rather than pointing at someone, calling them out in front of the class. Granted, without it some people may not speak, but there could be other ways around this.He is very attentive to student questions and genuinely cares about student development. He is knowledgable in his field and serves a great role as instructor.",

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik clearly has depth and breadth of experience in the field of global health and he is an immensely valuable resource for YSPH and Yale. He cares a lot about students and provides very helpful feedback on the assignments.The cold call discussion style is ok, but I think at times he asks impossible questions with no right answers that feel like their only achievement is to make students feel small. Many of us just are not going to know the specifics of global health topics in the way he does or he expects, and I'm not sure the cold call discussion format advances our knowledge. I am so interested in Professor Soklnik's experiences and stories, and he tells them very well. I hate to see time that could be spent on that wasted on asking us questions we certainly cannot answer. I hope there is a more positive format the course could take in future years.",

He doesn't just bring a wealth of knowledge and practice, but he is also incredibly interested in the professional development of his students. Unlike other very theoretical courses at Yale, this course provide the student with the experience to engage in real issues and people working on the ground with them. It is a must for global public health practitioners.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Is the most organized, knowledgeable, engaging, clear, and compelling instructor I've had at Yale. Full-stop. He's also incredibly generous with his time, in terms of giving professional advice and following up on substantive questions. He demands both a command of the basic facts as well as critical thinking though, so if you are looking to just \"get by\" this is not a course for you!But I strongly urge everyone whose interested in international affairs to take this course, including folks NOT in the public health program.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Although sometimes he came off as abrassive for some students, it was clear that he did it because he cared very much and wanted his students to be involved. Overall, he did a great job and served as a great mentor for many of us.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Prof. Skolnik is obviously very knowledgeable and has had a remarkable career in global health. However, his arrogant demeanor is very off-putting. His constant need to commend his own career and tout his connections is tiresome. Letting them speak for themselves would be sufficient. Anecdotes from the field were very interesting and appreciated.The thing that made me feel most uncomfortable in this class was Prof. Skolnik's clear affection for international students, to the extent that it alienated other students. This comes across as favoritism and his mid-class exchanges with particular students really left a sour taste in my mouth.",

One of the flaws I see in YSPH, is that we do not have enough lecturers that have experience in industry. He is also very open and willing to talk to students."
