    "If you are willing to put in the work to actually soak in the numerous practices that you will be doing for homework every night, then you will get a lot out of this class. Keep in mind that there is a lot of busy work, but it's good for solidifying your grip on the rules. Potentially a really beneficial class but you have to put in the work",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class because it reviews grammar concepts that are important to speaking the language well. The classwork is easy enough to manage and the class is challenging without being overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I was very afraid to take an L5 Spanish because I didn't think my skills were up to par. If you don't feel competent in another L5 class, this class is definitely for you. I felt that I learned a lot, but I was still able to handle the difficulty and workload.",
    "This course is very thorough and good for learning grammar, but not particularly interesting or helpful for conversational speaking (although it creates a solid foundation from which conversational comfort can be achieved through practice). The majority of the course, both in the classroom or on homework assignments, is centered around grammar exercises (fill in the blank, complete that sentence, etc.). This course could do with a lot more conversational practice. I would recommend this course for someone who is planning to take more Spanish classes; however, those planning to take one L5 course can easily choose a more interesting course.",
    "It's an intensive course-it's not easy. However, if you're into Spanish and are able to understand and speak it to some degree, you'll be fine."
