    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student if and only if he or she possesses unrelenting, supreme ninja focus. This class meets once a week for an extended period of time and is BORING!",
    "If you need a seminar and do not want to talk too much in class this is not a horrible choice. It was a struggle sometimes to sit through class for an hour and fifty minutes while Sethi basically just talks at you. He barely uses slides. He might ask a question you have no idea how to answer now and then. The topics are pretty interesting though.",
    "Yes, a relatively easy PoliSci credit in which you'll learn some cool things about real life cases",
    "I would recommend this class. It is very interesting.",
    "If you are interested in the syllabus and class readings this is a good class. However, I would not recommend it to students who want class discussion and many interactions. It is not a discussion-based seminar.",
    "If the subject matter interests you, take the class but it can get on your nerves. Also, the work creeps up on you at the end. It's fairly easy throughout the semester, the readings aren't needed but you should work hard for the final project."
