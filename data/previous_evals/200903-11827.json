    "Econ 488 is interesting for about the first 3 classes. You have to complete your own econ experiment and everyone runs experiments and presents them after the first few classes. Some are good and fun to participate in. Most are boring or stupid. The professor requires weekend meetings for the project. Also, there are very unclear guidelines for the course...so it's sometimes difficult to know what the professor wants.",
    "Good Econ Seminar. Nice to see more practical demonstrations of the econ theory we learn in other classes. Lots of freedom for your experiment and paper.",
    "Take it. Fantastic seminar.",
    "Great intro to how to think about questions.",
    "Yes, yes, yes.",
    "There is a lot of work at times... When you have to create your experiment and write your final paper. That's really it.",
    "Experimental Economics is an examination of recent experiments in economics (and their relevance to the study) and a chance to perform your own. It does that very well, but it's not much aside from that. I'm marking this course as \"Very Good,\" but really make sure you know what you're getting in to. This isn't a class in the typical sense.",
    "It is a great hands-on course in conducting economics experiments. If that sounds interesting, take it.",
    "it is a good class, and an interesting topic,but be warned that it is a LOT of work. There are effectively two final papers, not one as indicated in the syllabus, and the Professor encourages you to put in a LOT of effort into the experiment."
