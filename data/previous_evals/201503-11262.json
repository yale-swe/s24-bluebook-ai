    "Anthropological Approaches to Capitalism is a fantastic class for anyone who wants to have a thought-provoking, multi-faceted, realistic conversation about the way economies shape human behavior and the way human behavior shapes economies. You'll establish a foundation in some of the \"classics\" of capitalistic theory (smith, marx, etc.) but read them in a refreshingly critical way (thanks to the analytical tools of Anthropology). The ethnographies you read in class are fascinating and touch on a lot of current social issues, and the final project is a cool, different way to do a final essay (you do actual ethnographic research, which I found refreshing during a season when I was mostly writing boring research papers and taking tests). Professor Rogers puts together an amazing syllabus and is a great resource if you're interested in this subject, and you'll get to know lots of cool sophomores in your class. I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Overall, this course looks at how Capitalism affects daily life from an anthropological perspective. Very good for understanding certain aspects of life that are taken for granted. would recommend.",
    "A must take course to compliment any study of economics, identity studies, or social science in general. About more than critiquing capitalism, it is concerned with understanding how people are enact capitalism and how capitalism changes how people see themselves.",
    "I would recommend ANTH 346. It's a cool class because it makes you think really differently about many aspects of our lives. It's one of the only classes where it's not looked down upon to question capitalism and its effects. I definitely learned a lot. Take it!",
    "A good class but the stress of the final \"group\" essay was almost enough to make me regret taking it. Basically, it's 1-2 hours of reading per week, which isn't a lot at all. The in-class discussions were interesting, but the class tended to be very homogenous in their interests and thoughts. Dr. Rogers could have taken more of the lead in discussion. The final project is a \"group essay\" which is as stressful as it sounds. It is inevitable that one person will have to take the lead on the project, which is frustrating during finals period. You have to worry about not only your part being good, but also making sure your ideas are consistent with the others'-- the worst part is that the others probably are not thinking about this. Meeting with the group to put the paper together is pretty inconvenient and definitely the last thing anyone wants to do when they have 5 other tests\/papers to worry about. The rough draft definitely should not have been graded-- our grade definitely did not reflect my part of the paper. Overall, I was proud of the final paper but had to put too much effort in getting it to where it was at the end compared to my group members.",
    "If you want to spend a semester reading, thinking, and talking about capitalism, take this class! What's nice about this class is that it doesn't just challenge totalizing 'rational' views of capitalism (of the kind one learns in economics) as naturally arising out of human 'self-interest' (there's a great reading in the class that deconstructs the notion of 'interest' itself), it also challenges traditional leftist\/Marxist characterizations of capitalism as some kind of singular malevolent entity, forcing you to think more deeply about how capitalism works, its many inconsistencies, and the many actors that take part in shaping the heterogeneous nature of capitalism (which can provide us more insight into how to challenge\/reshape it, if you're into that sort of thing!) Prof. Rogers is a great instructor who's really understanding and always makes sure to step in at the right moments to explain more complicated concepts and relate the week's readings to the broader picture. The group project can be annoying and stressful when it comes to writing the paper, but one still gets a lot out of doing an ethnography and conducting the interviews.",
    "Really enjoyable and interesting class - Professor Rogers is so kind and interesting. This is the only sophomore-only seminar, so take it while you have the chance (if you manage to get in.)",
    "Yes I would if they are interesting in learning about capitalism and how it affects your daily life. It was eye-opening and has gotten me very interested in studying the topics we discussed further!",
    "This course is absolutely wonderful especially as a sophomore seminar. I'd definitely recommend taking it if you're interested in learning about labor and capitalist theory from an anthropological perspective. The reading list is fascinating and varied, and probably what I enjoyed most about the course. We began with Marx, Weber, Smith, and Harvey; took on theories of gendered labor, globalization, capitalist time, space, and productivity; read three book-length ethnographic pieces; and ended with ethnographies of Wall Street and finance capital. ANTH 346 also gives you a slice of research technique and introduces you to ethnography as a method of analyzing\/engaging with the world. Professor Rogers is a really attentive and patient discussion leader, though I thought he could have been a bit more hands-on in directing the conversation. Overall, a fantastic, thoughtfully-executed seminar.",
    "Anthropological Approaches to Capitalism is great! Its one of only a few Sophomore seminars, which are a great way to access seminar-style teaching, and get to know your class. I'd highly recommend this to anyone, no matter your initial feelings about capitalism - Doug Rogers is a scholar of alternatives to capitalism, but conducts the class such that all view are valid. Reading is manageable, midterm is somewhat tricky, and final project is interesting! With the final project, you'll write a paper with 2-4 other students. It's well taught and not too stressful, but don't take this class if you'll have a ton of other final papers!",
    "Through this class I was able to objectively explore my existence in a capitalistic system, and I know am more aware of the influence that it has on my every day life. Thankful that it was not as energy-focused as in the past.The readings were never toooo long and the discussion was great. The midterm essay was manageable; you have complete freedom over the final project, which could beankful that it was not as energy-focused as in the past.",
    "Very chill class with an interesting project that applies theory to lives in New Haven"
