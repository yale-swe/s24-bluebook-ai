    "Yes, I'd recommend",
    "Absolutely take this course. If you're even remotely interested in literature, it would be a true pity to graduate without having taken this course. If you're not sure if you're interested in literature, it would be a true pity to graduate without having taken this course. The literature you read is brilliant and varied, the size of the class is perfect, the pace is perfect, the grading is extremely generous (can rewrite essays and so on), and Professor Grigoryan and the lectures are undoubtedly brilliant. At the very least, shop it. And then take it.",
    "If you want to read some of the great works of 19th century Russia and to see how they tie together and build upon a central tradition, this is a great place to do it. Prof. Grigoryan is great and knowledgeable; she focused a little more on background and context than on close reading and themes during lecture than I would have liked, but class was always enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have the chance.",
    "Reading about a book every two weeks or short stories. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a writing credit.",
    "Russian 250 the best course I have taken at Yale. Every lecture is dazzling. Even if you think that you don't like Russian literature, this course will give you an entirely new perspective, enabling you to gain a deep appreciation for the philosophical and artistic merit of some of Russia's greatest works of fiction. The course will also vastly improve your analytical and writing skills.",
    "One of the most enjoyable classes I've taken during my time at Yale. Regardless of your level of familiarity with literature, this class is amazing. First it gives you the opportunity to read some incredible books and stories, and then Prof. Grigoryan gives lectures that add so much to your understanding and appreciation of the works. It may seem weird to take a literature class that is mostly small lecture style but honestly you get so much more out of hearing an expert talk passionately about the books than other students say what they think things might mean, although that's what section is for! Overall just a fantastic class and if you think you might at all enjoy reading some great Russian texts, I could not recommend it more highly."
