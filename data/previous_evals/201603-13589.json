    "This course taught me how to think differently about the international community and its cooperation. I went into this class a pessimist about the UN and about different institutions surrounding global governance, but having Professor Sergeyev tell his stories and show us videos and have had a previous connection to this idea of \"global governance.\" I learned how to think critically and from a global perspective rather than from a western\/american perspective.",
    "Through this course I developed a more nuanced understanding of not only the United Nations but also different mechanisms of global governance from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Critically analyzing the role of intergovernmental organizations in dictating global politics, and the setbacks to the UN in serving as a world government."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were the professor and my classmates. We had some graduate students who had amazing experiences and they were willing to share and help the class learn. Professor Sergeyev is a great professor - he brought experience and knowledge to the table, and he literally brought other scholars to a few round table discussions so we could delve deeper into some topics.",
    "Strengths are that Professor Sergeyev is incredibly knowledgeable about so many world issues, and allows students to tailor the course to their specific interests among the many topics of global governance. Weaknesses are that when no one does the reading it turns into a lecture instead of class discussion, which is much less engaging than when everyone is talking."

   "comments": [
    "I am not sure if I would recommend this course - it was more of a lecture than a seminar, assignments were very vague, we had very few group debates or lasting discussions.... but Professor Sergeyev is a very interesting person and we were lucky to learn from him.",
    "Yes yes yes take this course. It was my favorite course of the semester and I looked forward to it every week.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is considering a career in international relations, aid and development, or is interested in international relations theory.",
    "Yes, especially if you have a specific interest in a topic of world governance. Otherwise it's a good overview, but the class becomes much more interesting if you can view many topics from the lens of one more specific issue."
