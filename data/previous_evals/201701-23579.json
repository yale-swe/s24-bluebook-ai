    "I found this course to be a comprehensive synthesis of research in the fields of sociolinguistics, language policy, and language politics. The instructor applied careful analytical thinking to dissect and distill complicated and amorphous questions into tractable research questions. This is an important course in a as-yet burgeoning field at the intersection of several disciplines. I definitely learned a lot about the state of the discipline, ways in which to think about the analysis of language in political and policy spheres, as well as, a means of organizing the various facets of a complicated sociological ecology in a way that leads to concrete, empirically-addressable questions."

   "comments": [
    "This was a very well-designed course that organized a chaotic smattering of literature into a digestible and well-thought-out framework. The pace was excellent and the readings, well chosen. The means of instruction and the set-up of the class was very conducive to learning. I would say that the only (minor) weakness was related to the choice of regional units in the last few class meetings. While I understand that this was likely a reflection of the structure of the discipline, those few units seemed a bit jarring when compared to the fluidity of the rest of the content."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If the student has any interest in language as it applies to society, politics, and public policy, this is the course to take. Considering how comparative politics is often mired in methodological and substantive hurdles, it is refreshing to find such a pointed and cogent analysis of a particular theme in this subfield."
