This evolving characteristic of the discussions and the up to date information in this field made the class an extraordinary learning experience.",

    "I think the course should go deeper into the theories behind the different policy ideas we discussed. I felt at times it was just a barrage of ideas and I had no framework through which to evaluate them.",
    "Perhaps it would strengthen the team work sessions if some guidelines and requirements were developed for this activity.",
    "The professor was at times a bit repetitive and strayed from the main topics presented in the syallabus.",
    "The course was still pretty basic and I would have preferred it to be a little more rigorous. The professor and students both were pretty laid back and I think the course suffered as a result.",
    "This course would greatly benefit from weekly assignments or reading responses. It would also be helpful if the lectures were more structured and used slides to guide the lectures. It was hard staying motivated with the readings without any assignments throughout the semester.",
    "The lectures lack structure and there is no clear indication what the central aspects of the lecture are. This is unfortunate since the instructor's explanations are generally very interesting.",
    "The group project needs to be more defined. I feel that we lost a lot of time at the beginning but not having a clear definition of what was expected."

    "I took this course because of three reasons. First, it was taught by a Law school professor and Yale Law school is a great school and great opportunity for forestry students to have this type of joint courses. Second, because it was the last time it was offered as it was and next semester the syllabus is going to change so I wanted to take it before it was too late. Third, green energy in the US is certainly a salient issue to know in order to be able to understand the trends of innovation in the country and its influence to other commercial partners.",
    "Sounded very interesting.",
    "Wanted to fill in gaps of knowledge.",
    "I am interested in renewable energy and this was a good primer on the policy options.",
    "Interested in energy and there are not that many energy courses offered.",
    "This course helped give an overview of green energy policy. I wanted to get a foundation in this topic in general so that I would be able to help businesses incorporate renewable energy into their practices.",
    "Interest",
    "As a supplement for more technical energy classes",
    "Get a better understanding of US energy policy."

One suggestion would be to develop a guideline for the group assignments to better materialize the products of the discussions.",

Start the group project early as this makes it more fun and you'll learn more from it. The ending paper is a good chance to review what you learned in the course.",
