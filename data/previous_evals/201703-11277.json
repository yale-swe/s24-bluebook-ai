    "I learned about the various representations that extraterrestrial life has had in mainstream (and fringe) cultures, both American and international, throughout history.",
    "Cultural history of conceptions of outer space and extraterrestrial life forms from antiquity to the 20th century. Critical reading and thinking skills, practice discussing historical themes, and critical analysis skills.",
    "Analyzing historical data to see how the concept of extraterrestrials evolved and affected mankind through the ages",
    "I gained some fascinating knowledge regarding the early origins of current-day representations of aliens. It was very fun and interesting!"

   "comments": [
    "A huge weakness of this course is the professor's inability to be organized. Lectures were often uploaded online, then changed after the class occurred. Furthermore, he changed the slides for at least 4 lectures five days before our final exam, which I felt was unjust to students who had already started studying. It was my expectation that what was said in class or discussion section was what was fair game for the exam. It does not seem right to me that he changed the slides before our final exam, after already uploading a previous version. In the future, I would suggest that the professor not change his slides after he's uploaded them once. The TA, Beans Velocci, was the one strength in this course. Discussion section was great and I felt like I learned more there than I ever did while in lecture.",
    "While the material is interesting, it is extremely difficult to understand the professor. He acknowledges the first day that he has a very strong accent, however, he makes no attempt to speak slowly and clearly for the class.",
    "One strength was how the professor as able to show us the ways in which first hand sources could be interpreted incorrectly and lead to false theories about monsters or alien encounters. The professor utilized the resources at Yale and even brought us to the Beinecke on several occasions. A weakness is in the description of the course and the ways in which some of the material is combined. The course starts with Greek philosophy and it was difficult to understand how that was relevant for quite some time.",
    "I wish section was really about the reading. It was clear that ~half the section just hadn't even skimmed them, so we spent a bunch of time explaining what happened in the books rather than figuring out their historical or literary context. Ivano is a great lecturer, though!",
    "This course too hard than it needed to be. There material did not become interesting till the end and the amount of material expected to be memorized was nearly impossible.",
    "Strengths: very interesting course material, helpful discussion sections, interesting readings, manageable workload, fair exams. Weaknesses: lectures could have been more clear and direct, larger themes could've been presented more clearly throughout to put factual information in context.",
    "I enjoyed the study of history through the eyes of someone studying other worlds, and the sprinkling of science into the history. I do wish it was less westernized though, or at least if we were going to concentrate on the west, we had a week or two to study smaller civilization perspectives on other worlds. Like aztecs, mayan, egyptians, native american\/pacific islander. The little we studied from them were from a european perspective. It all felt very white and not very diverse. I did like the sci-fi readings we did though.",
    "I think the course was very well-organized, and I would not change anything."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if the professor stopped changing his slides again and again. I just think that it becomes confusing and unfair, and sometimes he didn't even tell us he changed the slides. I would not recommend this class to someone who does not like doing a lot of readings, as I had more readings in this course than I did in one of my seminars. I also would not recommend this course to someone who cannot take notes quickly. I consider myself a fast typer, but it really stressed me out to keep up with the pace at which Ivano went through the slides. He has a great deal of enthusiasm, but sometimes he goes so quickly that I cannot comprehend what he's trying to say to us or what I should take away from a lecture. If you have a great passion for science fiction and think that this class will satisfy that passion, you're only partially right. The second half of the course was more centered on what most people think of as \"extraterrestrials,\" but the first half of the course was extremely dry while we went through Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Anaxoagoras, etc. I'm not really sure it was worth sitting through that first half of the class, just to read a few sci-fi books in the second half.",
    "The class is easy, but unless you get a good TA I would not recommend.",
    "The workload was pretty low and the professor was pretty engaging in class. It is a cool way to take a history lecture where you can learn some philosophy without having the intensity of a philosophy course. Also towards the end you get to learn about ancient alien theories and cults, which was fascinating.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are taking it Cred\/D\/F. Professor Dal Prete writes tests that are borderline impossible (think 15 IDs no choice and an in class 8 page essay). The IDs come out of nowhere and half of them are barely mentioned in the course material. It is a shame because the readings and course material itself is very fun and interesting. All in all a great credit\/D but if you take it for a grade GOOD LUCK.",
    "When else are you going to get to take a class about aliens? If you suspect you may not be alone in the universe (no one will out you!), you can learn the history of other peoples throughout time also reckoning that they may not be alone.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you absolutely have to take it. The midterm and final were nearly impossible with an unreasonable amount of questions and no choice given among them.",
    "This is a great course for STEM majors who may have an intense schedule. The readings are all engaging and interesting, and they directly contribute to the understanding of the class material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, history major or not. The class this semester was comprised of students from many different backgrounds and majors which made class discussion interesting and well-rounded. Manageable workload, interesting course material, not particularly writing heavy, and knowledgeable professor.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the class even though I had some criticisms, and professor del preto did a fantastic job of making the course interesting and fun.",
    "Yes I would, because it was a very fun, interesting course. A must-take here at Yale!",
    "The course is very interesting, and great for a 5th class. The readings are fascinating and you walk away from the course with a greater understanding of our perception of life through philosophy, science fiction, and even psychology!"
