    "Yes. Stathis is great at unpacking complicated theories in a way that made them easy to understand. This course may have been even better if it wasn't cross-listed as a grad course because it often seemed like parts of discussion were more geared at the PhD students than at the undergrads in the course. The readings may seem like a lot - one book a week - but for the most part the books were interesting, and I learned a lot from reading them.",
    "If you're interested in civil wars, dynamics of warfare or political violence in general then this class is a must! Although the class was at 9.25am I very much enjoyed going to class every week. The discussions were lively and the students were always pushed to dig deeper. Prof. Kalyvas is one of the best political scientists in the world and it was very interesting to see how he approached the material. There will be a lot of reading but, if you're interested in the topic, you'll leave the class truly informed and all that work would be worth it. You'll be asking the right questions and looking deeper trying to comprehend the subtle mechanisms that drive political violence. This is hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "Yes definitely take this class if you would like to study heavy difficult materials under a incredibly smart professor who would unpack complicated theories in a very fun and light-hearted manner (under the good sense of the word). As a side-note, definitely take any class that Stathis Kalyvas offers. Sounds like a fan but I am indeed a fan of his way of teaching."
