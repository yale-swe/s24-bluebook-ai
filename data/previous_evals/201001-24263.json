   "comments": [
    "You really have no choice, it is required as a corequisite to the freshman organic class. It really is not that hard just read the lab manual before doing your lab reports and other things you have to hand in closely.",
    "This lab is required when you take organic chemistry. If you're interested in taking freshman orgo, realize that this lab is a lot of work in addition to the lecture class, but I wouldn't let it deter you if you are interestedin orgo because it is a pretty well-designed, interesting lab. The material first semester is not particularly useful to lecture, but the second semester had a lot of overlap.",
    "It's pretty good. You have to take it with lecture and it's not bad at all.",
    "I would recommend the lab. It is often required with the course, but I enjoyed lab and definitley had fun with it.",
    "This is the lab part of Freshman Organic Chemistry, and is actually very helpful with regards to the course. You get to put all your knowledge to use by actually synthesizing the molecules you learn about and seeing the reactions play out in front of you. I never really liked lab work, but it's really fun hanging out with everyone in your section and trying to get the best yield possible.",
    "The lab is basically the same as fall semester. Procedures are laid out for you, not too difficult. You do two\/three lab reports, which take time, but are unavoidable. Get a good TA--David Romney is great, but they'll probably change. See if your TA would read any drafts of your work beforehand.",
    "Chem 127 is lab for Freshmen Orgo II. It's required but it's not that bad. It's a little more work than first semester's lab but you actually begin to synthesize neat molecules. By the end of lab you've encountered the reactions in lecture and lab so it's good to see them in practice.",
    "You have to take this class if you are in Freshman Orgo so um...yea, I would recommend it.",
    "A lab a week, usually 2-3 hours, not too bad. Can be a lot of work outside of labs at times though.",
    "i would recommend this (you don't really have a choice if you're taking freshman orgo though)",
    "Chem 127 may seem at first to be a bit bewildering, because Freshman Organic Chemistry lectures do not cover syntheses significantly until the 6th exam period. However, once students begin to learn about reactions in lecture, they understand a lot more of what is going on in the lab -- the two really tie together quite well in the end, and the lab experience is indispensible to understanding many of the concepts mentioned in class.",
    "A required course for freshman orgo. Would recommend to those who need it, and those who enjoy synthesis labs.",
    "If you take Freshman Orgo, you have to take the lab. I really enjoyed lab this year- it wasn't much work, and the labs were all a lot of fun. My TA (Freddy) was amazing, and Dr. DiMeglio is really nice.",
    "It was much more interesting than first semester. A bunch of work though, so don't take it unless you need it for credit.",
    "No; too much work for too little credit.",
    "Well, there really is no choice in this. If you take Freshman Organic Chemistry, this class is required. Try to get Maung (Freddy) Tun as a TA if possible.",
    "I recommend this course, although it is probably a requirement for most of you. It is a good inroduction to organc synthesis reactions. The workload can be overwhelming during times when lab reports have to be submitted; good time management skills is a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is required, which it usually is. However, even though this is a half credit course, the workload is much more than that.",
    "This course is required if you are taking CHEM 125. That being said, it's more fun than last semester because you're not just doing basic techniques, but actual syntheses which sometimes match reactions you've learned about in Organic Chemistry lecture. The lab final at the end of the year isn't bad, though the format takes some getting used to. This is all explained, though, so no need to worry about it now. There aren't too many post-lab assignments due, and when the full-length lab report is assigned you are given at least two weeks' notice.",
    "Chemistry 127L is a great lab to take. Although the work is very time consuming (experimental plans and lab notes are due every class, and post-lab assignments are frequent), it is not difficult and is really useful in understanding the reactions and techniques presented. Also, there are only two full lab reports due during the semester, so the workload is definitely not unmanageable. Most importantly, the chemicals synthesized in the lab are really excited - you make everything from dark purple powder to banana-scented ether to real aspirin. Especially after hearing complaints about how boring physics labs are, I would definitely recommend this lab. Also, take the lab WHILE taking organic chemistry - topics often overlap and complement each other.",
    "Great lab course; usually takes around 3 hours, though during the winter, this seems unusually long since it is already dark when you get out of lab. Highly recommended",
    "You have to take this if you're taking freshman orgo. Make sure to get a good TA.",
    "A lot more enjoyable than first semester. By this point, you have mastered the skills learned first semester and so lab is much smoother and often shorter. I often got out after less than two hours. Also, the lab now corresponds to lecture, which makes it much better. About the same workload as first semester. Freddy is the best TA.",
    "It's mandatory. The good part is that the reactions covered in lab are important ones. The bad part is the busywork of lab notes and EPs.",
    "The second semester of lab is better than the first because you do cooler reactions and you know all of the techniques.",
    "The course was synthesis-based, and very well-taught. I would recommend it.",
    "Kinda necessary if you take Freshman Orgo...ad I don't see why you'd take it if you weren't taking Freshman Orgo. Lab definitely helped my understanding of Chem125, and vice versa.",
    "This is a practical component to the study of organic chemistry. It is significantly more enjoyable than the first semester of lab, because this time you are actually working toward a specific goal each time (synthesis of some compound). If you are willing to put up with long hours, and conform to the intricate nuances of formatting, you will benefit greatly from this class and greatly sharpen your practical skills.",
    "Great class. If you're premed, it doesn't matter what I say here cuz you're taking it anyway. But really, as far as labs go, the work is manageable, the pace is decent, and the hours aren't too long.If Freddy is still TAing this course in the future, be sure to get him as a TA if you can. He is the best TA in the whole wide world. (No seriously, he is.)",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. just do the work.",
    "This lab takes up a considerable amount of time, maybe around 5-8 hours a week outside of class to do pre-lab and post-lab written assignments. As long as you follow the rules, it is pretty comprehesible and not too hard to do well, although you do have to teach everything to yourself. It also depends a lot on what TA you have - there are varying levels of helpfulness, clarity, knowledge, and grading severity.",
    "This is a mandatory course for Chem 125, but regardless I would recommend it. Very reasonable and interesting course that is a must for premed and various majors.",
    "yeah, gopher it. Actually doing experiments and syntheses in lab is fun if you're into that thing, but the work is pretty annoying\/cumbersome\/just gets in the way and is mindless.",
    "Definitely take the lab equivalent of Freshman Orgo.",
    "It's required for Freshmen Orgo. Regardless, it's a good course and a must-take for any prospective premed.",
    "Overall a good lab. Most of the labs are not that long (I was almost always out of lab by 3:30 or 4 when the lab was slotted to go until 5). You actually get to make some neat compounds (aspirin and banana scent esters), and you use a lot of really well know reactions that you'll learn about in class.",
    "I think this is the more interesting semester of orgo lab since there are more syntheses. That also means more reaction mechanisms and such, but it's not too bad. You have several lab reports throughout the semester, but at least they're not every week, and you almost always get out of lab early. It's a pretty good lab to take not only because of that but because the experiments can be fun, too. (e.g. esters that smell like bananas!)"
