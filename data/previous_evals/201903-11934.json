    "How to deal with messy data, how to clean data, how to get data from a website, how to transform data, how to get insight from data, how to ask questions and visualize data, how to answer questions with some modeling.",
    "My ability to work with messy data sets and use R greatly improved through this course",
    "In this course, I learned how to clean data, do data analysis using statistical methods by doing many interesting projects. More importantly, I learned how to write clean and good code, and analyze the data in the right way",
    "Data cleaning, data mining, and analyzing the real-world dataset",
    "-Data Science in R: web scraping, basic graphics, correct style, for loops and vector code,... -how to look at statistical problems and plan solutions before trying random (and often wrong) approaches",
    "Learned how to do data analysis -- how to explore a dataset in a hands-on approach, and how to analyze the data logically and sensibly. Learned valuable data cleaning\/wrangling skills, such as extracting relevant data from HTML documents using regular expressions. Learned how to deal with practical\/realistic data analysis scenarios -- for instance missing\/incorrect data.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: A very thorough course and well designed. Jay was organized, very willing to help and give feedback, and ran an excellent class. Weaknesses: None really, this is minor but it would sometimes have been nice to have received more feedback on why points were deducted from assignments.",
    "I loved this course. The beginning of the term was really intense and challenging, but great. The last few weeks of the class felt rather slow compared to it. This class is made that you get from the class only what you are willing to put in effort in it. The class is not a typical lecture, we sometimes look at Jay write some code, sometimes we sit alone at our desk and try to ask questions that may be interesting to study, sometimes we work in groups and try to do some modeling, sometimes we spend time scrapping, writing code, and checking if the data we got is actually correct. It was also great to have weekly meetings with Jay or Elena, to see if we were on the right track, to check our code, to find more efficient ways to deal with the data. And also a great way to work with other people in the class. One of the strengths of the course is I am not scared anymore to deal with data. It can be very messy, but I feel confident that I will be able to find something out of it. It was a nice balance between scrapping, writing code and writing a report to answer questions. It was nice to be able to work in groups with different people during the semester. Good teamwork, easier to move and get ideas. And I feel that I can directly apply this knowledge outside the class: deal with any sort of data, trying to be critical in asking questions and thinking about a problem. We saw a dozen case studies, and learned some useful code and techniques to deal with them. The case studies were on different topics, so we saw a wide range of possible applications. However, I wish we had seen maybe one or two more case studies. It would have been nice to see new data and to try to answer more questions with another kind of modeling. I heard so much about the New Haven Housing Data from other students and professors of the department, I was surprised not to see it in this course.",
    "There was very minimal lecture\/instruction and we did not get much feedback on our assignments. It would be helpful to have lectures that correspond to the data science and statistical techniques that we then use in the different case studies. It was helpful to meet with Jay and Elena, however these meetings became less frequent over the course of the semester. When we received graded assignments there were not comments associated with them and we did not always have a corresponding meeting",
    "The projects in the course are very interesting and worth doing. And I really like the useful tips from Jay to help us to write good codes. Also, I really enjoy finishing projects in a group. That helps me to learn how to collaborate with others.",
    "We are able to learn the ability of using R language to clean the real-world dataset",
    "Jay Emerson is an amazing professor. I highly appreciate the practical nature of the course, the freedom to develop skills from one's own starting level and the high density of personal review sessions.",
    "We constantly were manipulating data, which really improved my understanding of R.",
    "Strength: intensive coding on data cleaning and graphing. Weakness: feedbacks are vague sometimes.",
    "Could have undertaken more projects, and spent slightly less time on each one. Strong course in that it forced you to get your R skills up to scratch and the initial learning curve was great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You will get a lot out of it. If you're new to R it will be especially challenging at first, but you will learn a lot.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in dealing with data. It actually can be learned by anyone, who has some programming experience (so not just necessarily statistics students), or students who are willing to put the time to learn about it. I feel this knowledge can be directly applied outside this course, wherever there is a need of data.",
    "I recommend this course if you want to improve your facility with R and working with real world data sets. It is not a standard course with lectures and clear objectives, which can be challenging at times.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. First, this course is very useful. If you want to learn how to be a great coder and analyze data in a correct way, you should take this course. Second, Jay is very kind and helpful. Jay spent almost every Friday to meet with us and gave us so many useful advises on our projects.",
    "Yes, especially for those who want to find a job like data analyst.",
    "Absolutely! It is the best way to apply theoretical statistical knowledge to real-life problems.",
    "Yes, it is beneficial for students to see how statistics can be applied in a practical situation.",
    "Yes. We can learn how to apply our data analysis skills in real life.",
    "Yes, much more interesting than a lecture course on data analysis.",
    "Yes"
