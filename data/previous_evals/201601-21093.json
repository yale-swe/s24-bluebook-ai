    "You should take 424 as a CS major. It won't blow your mind, but it is useful, not a gut, presented adequately, and pretty interesting. It's like your favorite vegetable- it's good for you and isn't bad, really. It's actually sort of good. Do it. 424 is a good cs elective. You learn a lot of interesting and practical information. You get good programming assignments, but it's not so intense that it dominates your semester. I learned a lot, applied my knowledge, and had fun. The course sections (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) were unbalanced in their duration\/depth. This should be fixed. Prof. Sherman acknowledged this at the end of the course and stated he intended to fix it. Professor Sherman presents the material in a clear but slow way. He could have covered material in a faster and maybe more interesting manner. He also wasted about ten minutes at the beginning of every class waiting for people to show up or going over non-critical logistics. That being said, he was very responsive via email, and I learned the course material well by going to lecture.",
    "Take it if you want to learn how to write parallel programs! Especially massive high performance programs (like those used in scientific research). We learned to write parallel programs using message passing with OpenMPI, shared memory with OpenMP, and the GPU with CUDA. This is very much a programming course. If you prefer practice to theory, this class will not be too much work, but it may be more difficult if you struggle to program with new paradigms. Exams focused on practice and always included comprehensive references. They always drew from infomation in lectures. Textbooks are provided through course reserves (so you don't need to buy them) and in general cover the same material as the lectures do (the slides are provided for studying).",
    "Great class that passes by people because it's a 9am, but I definitely recommend it if you want to become a better programmer.",
    "This is a good, straightforward CS class. It's more about the APIs for parallel programming than the concepts behind it, though Sherman does try to put in a bit of both. Some of the problem sets are really hard -- parallelizing diagonal matrix multiplication comes to mind -- but if you put in the hours you can get them done. I feel like the two major things I gained from the class were 1. understanding parallelism in code and 2. becoming a MUCH MUCH better debugger. Seriously, you've never truly debugged until you've tried to debug a parallel program. Sherman is a good, clear lecturer, and he works really hard to make himself available to students.",
    "CPSC 424 with Andrew Sherman was one of my favorite courses I've taken thus far at Yale. It has changed my focus as a younger Computer Science major. I think the course somehow conveyed an incredible amount of knowledge with an entirely reasonable amount of work, and I think that Andrew Sherman did an incredible job. TAKE THIS COURSE if you can get into it. It is a survey of popular parallel programming paradigms and packages, and (at least this year) started with MPI and parallel programming theory\/fundamentals, and moved into OpenMP and CUDA as the semester came to a close. I took this course concurrently with Theory of Distributed Systems (CPSC 465) with James Aspnes, and I think that was an incredible combination for anyone who has the benefit of both courses being offered in the same semester. CPSC 465 with Aspnes gives a ton of the mathematical intuition (but some theory for the sake of theory as well) behind certain topics in distributed systems \/ parallel programming, and CPSC 424 gives a ton of practical experience in implementation and practical theoretical concepts.",
    "You should take this class! It's a really worthwhile elective, and it's not offered every year. You learn a lot about how to make your programs run really fast, which is useful to any CS student. It was my favorite CS elective. JUST FREAKING TAKE THE CLASS."
