    "I think THST 210 is a pretty good intro acting course and I would recommend it.",
    "If you are looking to take an introductory class to acting then this is a great class. It's a good class to relax in compared to other typical Yale classes. The point of the class is to learn about character and multiple interactions within a show. I would definitely recommend, but only if you are going to take the class seriously.",
    "I would summarize the class as an introduction to the basic ideas of what actors are trying to achieve onstage. I would recommend it to students who have never taken an acting class before.",
    "If you want to be a theater studies major or are interested in going into a career in acting or directing definitely take this class! It will help immensely with your training for your craft. Do not take this class if you're not passionate about acting\/about the training behind acting, which is far different then simply enjoying musical theater performances. You must love the work put into it, too.",
    "THST 210 is a great class for improving your acting technique! It's a lot of fun and you really learn a lot about your performance style!"
