   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class, and take it with Sybil Alexandrov if there's any way you can. Your Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and conversational abilities will improve, and Alexandrov makes it fun, even early in the morning.",
    "The class material is what you would expect for an into spanish course. If you end up taking it make sure you get Professor Sybil Alexandrov.",
    "Just your average level 2 Spanish class. Get Professor Alexandrov if you can! She was fantastic. She was very approachable, relateable, and truly cared about the students. She challenged us, but prepared us for the challenge. I learned so much from her, and my Spanish improved tremendously. She made us want to get up for a 9 o'clock class, and that's saying something.",
    "This is a wonderful class, especially with Professor Alexandrov. She's enthusiastic and makes every attempt to engage any student. If you choose to take it, your Spanish will definitely improve and you'll have a great time.",
    "It's L2 Spanish. Take it if you want to build your Spanish from a basic level or are just looking to fulfill the L requirement.",
    "I would recommend Spanish to another student. I thought that L2, though it met every day, had a very reasonable workload, and I gained a lot from thinking in Spanish every morning.",
    "Spanish 120 02 is a great class for beginners in Spanish. It covers a great deal of vocabulary and grammatical concepts that increase a student's ability to communicate. The class moves at a reasonable pace, and everything was done fairly. I had no big problems with the class, and I would strongly recommend this class to a fellow student. The workload is far less than any other class I had. I would also highly suggest taking the class with Professor Alexandrov because she is a great professor.",
    "i would recommend this class if you have to fulfill your language requirement. There is a lot of work(hw every night) but it is manageable.",
    "It is a good class to learn the language at a basic level, but does have daily homework, which is not challenging on most nights. The class will greatly improve your spanish.",
    "The course, especially with Sybil Alexandrov, was not as overwhelming as I expected going in. I struggle with langage but the professor was fun and I was fine.",
    "Although Spanish 120 is only a L2 Language course, a lot of material is taught. A lot of students thought that they were placed too low but still ended up learning a lot in this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Learning a new language and learning about another culture broadens one's view of the world, and the materials we used made it fun.",
    "I would highly recommend Spanish 120 02 with Sybil Alexandrov \u0096 in fact, I wish I could have Professor Alexandrov for Spanish 130. The class was well organized, manageable, and pleasant! By the end of the semester, my class had certainly become a family and it was exciting to see us become more comfortable with the Spanish language each and every day."
