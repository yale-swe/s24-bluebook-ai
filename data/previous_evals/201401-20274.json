    "Definitely take Math 430 if you are thinking about going to grad school or are simply interested in the subject. The material can be quite interesting and fun to learn. That said, Prof. Frankel was not a great lecturer. Sometimes it felt like he was not very prepared to teach (though he certainly knew the material). He was quite approachable, though.",
    "Not very much point-set topology, which was cool. Algebraic topology itself as a subject seems a little sketchy, with proofs often by visualization or something, which is difficult to get used to. But it's pretty nice, and a totally different ballgame than other subjects. Under Frankel this is not an easy course at all. Homeworks are fine, tests are... well not easy is one way to put it, but doable. Definitely harder than some of the graduate courses here. But he's awesome and teaches you a lot. You just have to spend a lot of time on the subject.",
    "It's a good intro to the subject. Be prepared to put a little more work in than what's required in the homeworks if you want to get a better idea of what's going on though."
