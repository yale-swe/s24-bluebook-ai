   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course in order to develop a keener sense of how the policy world works, particularly as a balance to our (MA in IR) otherwise rather theoretical coursework.",
    "Very good class that provides an overview of the major issues the US is looking at across the globe.",
    "This course offers a broad understanding of contemporary issues of foreign affairs.",
    "Basic overview of issues confronting contemporary American diplomacy. Could be a better class, but still great if you like to get a good survey.",
    "This courseis an absolute must-take, no questions asked.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I would describe it as a survey course with greater emphasis on some regional issues than others. If one is interested in a basic overview of key diplomatic concerns, this is a useful course. If one wants to discuss foreign policy and the integrated nature of these concerns, this survey may fall short.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Great overview of current issues in International Diplomacy. Professor Negroponte is very approachable and helpful, so don't be intimidated.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - it is one of the best and most useful at Yale.",
    "It provides a useful overview of US foreign policy issues but is more geared, I think, to those with little prior exposure to the subject.",
    "If you are an individual who believes that one has to be at 50,000 feet at all times to feel as though they have had 'rigorous' classroom experience, don't take this class. If you want to learn a lot about how the real world works, and about how whatever it is you study *is* germane to people on the ground, this is the class for you. The course kicked my butt, in a good way, and reminded me of why I am here in school in the first place- to become a better person and do things to help people in the world...in service of my country.",
    "International Relations 765 01 is an upper-level course on American Foreign and Security Policy designed especially for those seeking a diplomatic career. Taught by one of America's premier diplomats- Ambassador John Negroponte- this course explores the most important issues of international affairs.I would strongly recommend this course to any serious student of international relations. I believe that a good practitioner of international relations must be armed with both academic and policy tools, in order to most effectively tackle the diplomatic challenges ahead. In this regard, Ambassador Negroponte is the Master Tradesman, and we students are his apprentices- listen carefully.",
    "The course is pretty unimpressive except for the professor. Take it if you want to learn things from Prof. Negroponte but don't expect to learn much more than you would from reading the Economist.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to study contemporary events and diplomacy with an expert."

   "comments": [
    "This course added a critical element tomy preparation for government service.",
    "Some good readings, but most contained facts and insights that I already understood.",
    "The thing I enjoyed most about this course was perhaps Professor Negroponte's insights into how the different administrations that he worked for operated-- and about the policy making process in general. It was very helpful to my program-- and from a future career perspective-- to have this course taught by a policy practitioner.",
    "I could go on for days about this one. This class, more than any other I have taken, has better prepared me for what I will face in my career.",
    "This course greatly enhanced my knowledge of international relations, and added significantly to my \"diplomatic toolbox.\" The syllabus covered a broad array of foreign and security policy themes, each of which was analyzed with a depth of perspective that could only be obtained through the guidance of practitioner like Ambassador Negroponte.At Yale, there are many academics who write and teach about the actions and decisions of great statesmen; yet there are few great statesmen here themselves. It was refreshing to be instructed by the latter- not by someone who writes the books, but instead by someone about whom the books are written. I was fortunate to hear it directly from the source himself- and this contributed greatly to my knowledge of the diplomatic profession.",
    "This course was extremely helpful in my understanding security issues and diplomacy altogether - invaluable for someone in my discipline."
