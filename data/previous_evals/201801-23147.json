    "I've learnt a lot about oil painting techniques and materials, history of painting, and how paintings age and are preserved.",
    "Great way to get a better understanding of painting methods and materials, as advertised.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to observe a painting and understand the process behind its creation. Among other specific skills, I learned how Old Master Painters mixed their gesso, how they created skin tones using paint, and how they utilized layers to create their final products. Perhaps most importantly, though, I learned how to be patient both with material and with myself.",
    "I think that I learned a lot about oil paint as a medium. I learned how oil paint can behave when you add more or less solvent or medium. I also learned about the history of the medium. Mark is a great teacher, and he has a wide range of knowledge about the subject that he is teaching."

    "Maybe we can have some in-class sketch sessions outside of drawing studio and inside the museums, that way we can draw together as a class and develop observation skills.",
    "It covers a lot of material and has interesting assignments but could benefit from more time spent painting during the class.",
    "I thought that the course was great because I learned a lot about painting techniques. I'd like it more if we actually painted more in class and spent less time on writing."
