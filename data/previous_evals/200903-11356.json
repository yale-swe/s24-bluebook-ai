    "It is necessary for the sociology major, but mainly if you are interested in the sociological research that deals with collecting and analyzing data to find trends in society. The class workload is relatively light but be prepared to work hard on the papers and projects. Although they may be frustrating, they are very rewarding in the end. The professor and TA were very helpful in clearing up any problems with the assignments, lectures, or projects in the course."
