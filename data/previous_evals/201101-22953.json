    "No-Too much individual work due to bad teaching",
    "This class teaches you applied and useful things in the field of Environmental Engineering. It almost felt strange learning useful things at a liberal arts college. Take this class if you have to. It's not too bad. Boring lectures, not very organized information, but it gets the job done.",
    "If you are taking this for the major then you will take it. Its a lot of material and is covered fairly quickly. If you are lost in class make sure you ask questions.",
    "This was an interesting class and you definitely can apply the things learned to a career involving engineering. Sometimes the lectures get to be a bit boring and the psets can be long but if you are interested in learning the processes of water treatment this is a great class. There are also a couple of labs you do that can be fun and helps get away from the classroom. The midterm and final were pretty difficult.",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "poo.",
    "Yes and no, depending on the students interests. It is a good course, but unless a student is specifically interested in water treatment and waste water plant design I may point them in another direction.",
    "This course is a great course for any environmental engineer. Water is the big issue of our time and this course really teaches you all about making water drinkable and disposing of waste water in a way that minimizes its impact on the environment.",
    "take it if you have to and pay attention in lecture.",
    "You're probably taking it because it's required - it's easy to fall behind in what's going on. Just do the psets with other people and try to pay attention during lecture."
