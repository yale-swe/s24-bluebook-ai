    "Not a gut, interesting at times, very hard quizzes followed by easy 6-10 page final paper.",
    "If you take this course you will definitely learn a lot. You will also work a great deal. Do not be fooled by the seminar format. This is basically a lecture with more frequent assessments and a final panel discussion at the end. That said Professor Belperron knows a lot about the material and explains it in a straightforward way. She was very approachable and helpful when one had questions. Be warned that this is not a gut or an easy science credit, some of the readings can be mundane and the quizzes will be annoying (they are worth very little in comparison to your final grade, but require a great deal of studying). However, you will gain an appreciation for the material and learn much more than you ever expected about vector borne diseases, public health issues, etc.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE ITNot a gut, but not hard. PERFECT BALANCE. You'll go to class and leave feeling like you've learned a lot, but it also will not take away from your core classes.Need a science credit but don't want to waste a class? TAKE THIS CLASSAlso Prof Belperron is THE BEST. She even wants to get to know you and get lunch with her students. I LOVE HER.",
    "Yes! Great non-gut science for non-science majors. You can't sleep through it, but Prof. Belperron is very good at explaining what's going on, so even if your brain doesn't easily grasp the science she'll help you through.",
    "The material is fascinating. If you like a straightforward, lecture style class then go for it.However, the quizzes are VERY detailed and surprisingly tough. On the other hand, she does grade on a curve. Not a gut, but doable if you study.",
    "Yes.",
    "This course is a great introduction to vector borne diseases and cell bio. Study the details and keep up with the lectures and reading and you will do well! Take it if you are at all interested in epidemiology\/cell bio\/need a science credit---it is really interesting and actually provides information that you can use in life.",
    "This was definitely an interesting course! It provides not only the biology of vector borne diseases, but also some perspective on the related health and societal issues.If you're a science person (as I am), you may find it a tad easy, but I still found it very useful as it focuses on a rather narrow issue in depth. If you are just in a need of science credit, my intuition is that you might need to work a bit harder on understanding all the biological concepts, but it's definitely worth it!"
