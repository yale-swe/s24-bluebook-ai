    "ART 111 was basically doing projects and iterations of projects in different mediums. The class wasn't structured, instruction was vague, and most of the time I felt like I was expending unnecessary time and effort. If you're not an art major but wanted to learn about art, I wouldn't suggest this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Visual Thinking with Anahita if you take it. I wasn't sure about this class but I needed to take it because it's a prerequisite for the art major.If you take it, I would recommend taking it with Anahita, she takes the class seriously and gives good criticism. If you have a lot of experience with any specific medium or type of art, she takes that into account and helps you further what you are working on instead of wasting your time. If you don't have a lot of experience, she definitely will help you figure out what you're interested in doing.A warning - the class is very fine-arts oriented and teaches the technical aspects of form, composition, and a LITTLE color. We covered stop-motion animation, drawing, collage, sculpture, and performance.",
    "Take it early like Freshman or Sophomore year.",
    "I would recommend to other art majors. It's basically a studio course that covers many different ways of making and thinking about art.",
    "I would only take it if you're an art major and you have to take it (right now it's required). I think it's meant for people with little art experience, but I think non-art people struggled to get a grasp on concepts like composition, balance, drawing, etc. I didn't love the class just because I didn't feel like I learned anything. You get to try new things (stop motion animation, collage, sculpture, performance art) and it's super open ended, so if that's what youre looking for take it, but if you're trying to improve technical skills, I'd avoid it. Unless you're an art major and you have to take it, in which case I'd get it out of the way asap.",
    "It's a requirement for the Art major, so take it if you have to and get the most you can out of it.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that really is what you make it. If youput effort into it, it can be rewarding. If you don't, you could very well just be wasting your time and see it as a waste of time.",
    "It really isn't a huge time commitment so you can definitely add this class on. Don't expect a lot of technical experience to be gained, but it does help you to - surprise - think visually."
