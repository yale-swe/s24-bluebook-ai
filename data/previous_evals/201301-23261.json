   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're really, truly interested in the subject of corruption and what to do about it. Otherwise, skip it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The workload is light - readings every week with a three page paper due every other week, and no final anything! - and you have the chance to really engage with the subject matter because of how much Professor Carlson herself demands of the class in terms of participation to make up for it.",
    "The problem with the class is not the way the class is taught; the problem is the subject itself. We just don't know that much about corruption and how to fix it, so studying it can be frustrating. Professor Carlson is great, however. Very approachable, smart and engaged. Not the best seminar I've taken, but recommended nonetheless.",
    "Interesting overview of corruption w a slight focus on africa. Really overviews the topic well.",
    "This course focused on developing working definitions of a highly subjective social science concept, and so was good for the development of critical thinking skills. It was a bit frustrating at times, because there were no right answers!",
    "A comprehensive panel of information and existing perspectives on the matter of corruption, but focuses more on underdeveloped countries' studies than on the perhaps psychological or existential sides of the matter.",
    "This seminar is serious review of the corruption research. You read a lot of studies and learn that there is no sure fire way to \"fix\" corruption. Only take it if you are really interested in reading the literature.",
    "Interesting stuff. Basically learned that we don't know how to measure corruption or solve it, but I was intrigued every week. Probably had a lite more reading than was necessary to capture the dilemma we were going to discuss, and we could have talked more about characteristics of good research, which seems to be key in these studies of corruption. Carlson is a low-key but no-nonsense prof, which was good (but she's leaving this year). Format was great for the students, alternating response papers every other week, which comprised the whole grade (plus participation), though it did mean that on \"off\" weeks, far fewer people had done the readings well and discussion wasn't as good.Material is worthy to be studied, even if there isn't much solid knowledge on corruption. Fast-growing field. Much potential for research, too."
