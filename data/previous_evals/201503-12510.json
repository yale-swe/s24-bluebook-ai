    "Take it if you can get in! It's a great class to just practice some Spanish two mornings a week.",
    "It's basically an advanced Spanish class about legal principles, with a focus on the law in the Spanish-speaking world. I would recommend it for any student who is looking for an advanced Spanish class that does not have to do with reading and writing about literature and has at least a little interest in law.",
    "Build your Spanish vocabulary for discussing legal matters.",
    "Legal Spanish was an excellent class. The work load was very light, and the material was interesting and not too difficult to understand, even for a non-native speaker. The professor is adorable and engaging. Overall, I would definitely recommend it as a fun L5.",
    "A chill writing\/conversation class where we talk about legal issues in Latin America and Europe. The material isn't particularly difficult, and it's a lot easier than Advanced Spanish Grammar. Take it if you want an easy L5.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in learning more about the law and legal systems throughout Latin America, especially if you have an interest in bettering your oral and written Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's low pressure and for the most part interesting. The more you put into the class, the more you will get out of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to others. We had a lot of great discussions, and the material was quite interesting.",
    "Great class, but best if you are interested in the law.",
    "It is a fun level 5 Spanish class that has a very interesting subject matter and a wonderful professor. I would recommend the class to another student, especially if they are interested in politics and law.",
    "I would recommend legal spanish to anyone interested in continuing the Spanish language."
