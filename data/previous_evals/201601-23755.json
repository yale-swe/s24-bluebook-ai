   "comments": [
    "Course offerings about television are incredibly sparse at Yale, despite our impressive film studies department. The amount of interest in this course proves that more classes like this are definitely desired. The syllabus is great, including (but not limited to!) The Good Wife, Gilmore Girls, Grey's Anatomy, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos. You get to read seminal screenplays and understand how they fit into the oeuvre of television as we know it today. Aaron Tracy was an excellent instructor. He works as a writer in Los Angeles and had a wealth of advice to give, not simply in the writing itself, but in the actual mechanics of working as a writer in Hollywood. He was generous and understanding with extensions (we all know papers tend to pile up) and he brought in pizza on the last day of class. I have no intention of going into this industry (and I was definitely an outlier, in this regard) but I LOVED this course. If you have the chance definitely take it.",
    "would totally recommend to anyone who likes to write and analyze tv",
    "Such a great class both for those who want to pursue careers in entertainment and for people who just love TV. Learned a lot about both the industry and the art of TV writing. Highly recommend!",
    "The Art of TV Drama begins as a study of some of the \"greats\" of today's TV Golden Age and continues into a study of the structure and possibilities of TV as a medium and then the writing of (part of ) a pilot. It's a lot of fun as a course and makes you think about TV in a different way. I would definitely recommend it to another student, though I would caution that there is not as much attention payed to the politics (of gender\/race\/sexuality) at play in the TV we read and the culture around it as there could be.",
    "If you have any interest in being a writer for film and\/or TV, this class is a must-take. Otherwise, it's a fun and interesting college seminar with a non-trivial amount of writing homework.",
    "Really fun class! It's a cool combination of reading other famous TV scripts and then ultimately writing your own. Go into it with an open mind and push yourself to try new things! I looked forward to the (very minimal) homework every week. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "CSBK 340 was an excellent screenwriting course. You learn a lot about how to develop your characters and set up scenes. The instructor offers valuable real-world experience that can be very useful if you are trying to break into the field. Definitely take this course if you are interested in one day becoming a TV writer.",
    "A really cool primer on a form of writing that isn't taught at Yale: definitely worth it for the readings, the discussion and the incredible guest speakers Professor Tracy brought to class.",
    "Definitely take this class if offered again. You will become smarter regarding TV shows and drama in general.",
    "If you can get in, TAKE THIS CLASS! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you aren't interested in film or tv, this is the ideal class for you. If you are interested in storytelling generally, you will love this class. If you are just a huge Grey's Anatomy fan and want to know more about how the sausage is made, you will enjoy this class. TAKE IT!"
