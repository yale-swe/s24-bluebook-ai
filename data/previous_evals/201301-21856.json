    "Great class",
    "Definitely take this class. All of the German classes I have taken since L1 have been fascinating. The teachers are usually young and relatable, and they know how to keep the material interesting. The workload is definitely manageable, but this specific course does start to move away from grammar. Therefore, you are expected to take responsibility of the material you have not yet mastered.",
    "German 130 was wonderful! I loved it. We read quite a bit of German poems and short stories. It was satisfying to put all of my effort to use and actually UNDERSTAND something written in a foreign language.130 was a lot like 120: the workload was not too heavy, the tests were comprehensible, group work was manageable. Take it! Because German is awesome."
