   "comments": [
    "Honestly it's the most boring of the three sections. If you struggle with logic and tend to not be great at argumentation, I would say Credit\/D\/F is the way to go. Don't let philosophy deter you from DS, though.",
    "DS Philosophy in the spring focuses on major Western philosophical works from Descartes post-Kantians in the twentieth century, highlighting major debates like materialism vs. idealism and deontology vs. consequentialism. While those terms seem pretty complex (and they were to me before taking the class), I now understand them so much better because of taking this course. For that reason, I would definitely recommend it to another student, as it provides insight on both the philosophy of morals and of the external world and helps one understand the origins of the ideas that we have today.",
    "Professor Norby is a fantastic philosophy professor. The class leans more towards him speaking and students responding than towards conversations among students as often happened in my H&P and Literature courses, but I think that this system works best for the often deeply arcanely written texts we cover. Generally, he will put forth a couple of ideas and sometimes conflicting hypotheses and students will respond, backing one side or another or making their own arguments. Additionally, he answers a lot of questions about the texts and helps cut through the weeds of the language. As a result, students probably talk less frequently than in, say Lit, but get a deeper understanding based on the conversations with him in class. I got a lot out of this type of classroom engagement. With essays, he gives detailed responses throughout and provides really helpful feedback. I probably learned the most from his feedback out of any of my professors this term. He's also just a very enjoyable presence in class. Norbz is adorbz.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. I learned a lot and felt very comfortable speaking. Norby is fun and makes references that students can relate to.",
    "I would recommend it especially to anyone who is great at abstract thinking and an incredibly fast reader. Personally (I am one of the fastest readers I know) I was unable to finish the majority of the readings this semester. Still, the value of the course was not just in the amount read. Anybody could benefit from this course, because it teaches you to think."
