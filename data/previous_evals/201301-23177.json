   "comments": [
    "A good junior seminar. Much more of a historical theory discussion than a straight laced history class, but enjoyable. Kind of a lot of reading, but pretty laid back.",
    "Really interesting and informative survey course on imperial history, focusing a lot on imperial theories and imperial academia. Professor Behm is fantastic and so smart, and seminar was really interesting and engaging (despite the fact that I had it at 9:25, which is definitely a credit to Prof. Behm). Take it if you're at all interested in the theory and history behind imperialism. Workload is totally manageable--weekly readings aren't too extensive, one in-class presentation, one 5-8 page source review, and one 20-page term paper. Definitely take it!",
    "It is an excellent history of (Western) Europe course. The reading material is composed of some of the more prominent historical scholars on the topic of empire. The homework is quite heavy reading-wise, however.",
    "Absolutely take it if you are interested in empires, but don't take it if you just want a straight history course. It involves some political theory as well, which can be fascinating, but be prepared for more dense reading.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend to those interested in colonialism, no question."
