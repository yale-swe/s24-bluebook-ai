    "A semester's worth of hoop-jumping.",
    "I would not have taken it if it was an option. I am very dissapointed in the Yale History Program for making this burden a necessity in the first semester. I sent so much time writing papers that were not useful at all.",
    "It is mandatory! Otherwise, it is a good course, especially for the first semester of PhD program.",
    "This class will be beneficial to those seeking to learn more about some specific sub-fields of history and for becoming acquainted with colleagues.",
    "\"If you've never taken a historiography class, this is an essential experience. If you have taken a historiography class before, it's very unlikely that it was at the same caliber as HIST 500, so you should take it anyways. Professors Botsman and Klein facilitate an incredible discussion and classroom atmosphere.\""

   "comments": [
    "It made me more aware of what current students outside my field study.",
    "Great introduction to fundamental works in the field.",
    "I believe this course was designed to be a survey course and to that end it was mildly successful. At times the assignments felt like busy work that did not relate to my research at all.",
    "This course does a good job of introducing students to new types of the historical works. I would have liked to see a more critical engagement, however, with key theoretical texts for history and texts that have shaped how the discipline has evolved.",
    "It goes over many of the important debates in the historical field today, and lets students explore broad trends before they get absorbed in their own research. It's a very important start to students careers not only as historians in training, but also as members of the graduate student community."
