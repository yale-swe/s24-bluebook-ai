    "The benefit of this course is that it brings together all the new doctoral students. It isn't about learning a lot; it's about meeting people, discussing interesting papers and talks, and getting started on being a PhD student.",
    "I declined to enter workload, because workload for this class is really what you make of it.",
    "I wish the class would have focused more on all the aspects of working through a PhD at Yale and given us a better idea of what to expect over the course of our time here, rather than focusing so much on the weekly lectures, which were kind of hit or miss.",
    "I believe this is a very important class for the first year Phd students in order to transition students into the PhD and most importantly get started on the reasearch (the earlier the better). I found the quality of the FES pewsentations mixed and some not really appropriate to the seminar. I would hope for more scientific presentations and less applied work for this class as we focus on our research. I would suggest to structure the class more in terms of research methods and break down the assignment into small parts with several deadlines."

There are plenty of great researched at FES and YALE to maintain the idea of including many speakers in the class but fosing more on the research process."
