    "I learned how to write and recognize a lot of Chinese characters. There's defintiely still a significant amount more that needs to be learned before I can easily read a newspaper or article, but at the same time I know enough to probably somewhat understand a piece of Chinese text.",
    "I significantly improved my Chinese reading, writing, and speaking abilities. I learned many new grammar patterns and expanded my vocabulary.",
    "I have a greater grasp of Chinese grammar and can communicate more fluently with more nuanced vocabulary words.",
    "In this course learned that Chinese is even more beautiful, intricate, and relevant to my life than I had ever imagined. I also learned to trust my own language instincts and to take risks without fearing public humiliation."

   "comments": [
    "very time consuming class. the grad student that taught a few times a week was not a good teacher",
    "One of the best run courses Yale has to offer. The only suggestion I would make is to lighten the homework load.",
    "Strengths: Very organized, very engaging, teacher used both discussion sections and grammar lectures which helped balance the material Weaknesses: at times overwhelming",
    "The course does a great job of covering a lot of material and helping students practice their language skills. The only weakness in my opinion was that many of the discussion classes did not seem as useful for learning. Most of the students did not prepare for those discussions and often only practiced very simple grammar patterns. Also, if there were many students in the class that day, each would get very little speaking time. That said, I still really enjoyed the discussions.",
    "Meeting everyday keeps me accountable for practicing Chinese everyday. However, more discussion instead of reading the textbook would be better received.",
    "Strengths: Everything, but especially teaching. Weaknesses: I did not always feel like my classmates were engaging with the material as much as I was, which was sometimes frustrating."

   "comments": [
    "as long as you put in the time, the class is not hard",
    "YES!",
    "Take this course if you're very into learning Chinese. I wasn't particularly interested and needed to finish the language requirement, therefore, I didn't enjoy it as much\/ However, if you're very interested, this course will be very rewarding.",
    "This is a great class to take if you are a heritage Chinese learner. It is very well-organized and fast-paced, so you will learn a lot quickly. Compared to the previous semester, there will be much longer writing assignments and the rate at which you're expected to learn characters is much faster. That said, I think it is a very manageable class with great teachers.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese, yes. Don't do it for the credit alone.",
    "Yes! If you are a heritage speaker and you have ever had doubts about furthering your Chinese abilities, take this course and it will show you a new and unexpected side of yourself and your culture."
