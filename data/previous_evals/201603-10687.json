    "I definitely recommend this course, because of the readings that have the ability to change your perspective of what vision is, and the pleasant conversations that sprout during this seminar.",
    "Before you take the course, think very carefully about the topic and whether you would be interested in getting into deep discussions\/thinking about it. Once you know that you would be genuinely interested in exploring sight and insight, definitely take this course! Professor Carlisle provides you with time and space to think in and out of the classroom, and I found this course very supportive of my learning college writing as a freshman here. Also, some of the readings and discussions gave me perspectives that I cherish very much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially is they feel nervous about writing in college. This course is a good way to develop your critical writing skills and give yourself space to experiment a bit if you are unsure of your writing ability."
