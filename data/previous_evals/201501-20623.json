    "I highly recommend ANTH 754 01 to another student who lacks statistical background",
    "Yes, it is necessary for a student who interested in archaeology to learn statistics.",
    "I would summarize it as \"basic statistics for archaeological analysis.\" I liked that we stuck to more simple statistics, since in many ways, these ones are the statistics most commonly employed in archaeological analyses. I would recommend it for these reasons.",
    "ARCG 754 is a class that should be taken by any student looking to work with raw archaeological data. While many classes teach theory, few teach one how to comprehend statistics and apply them to archaeological theory. This class will also help students to know when statistics are being used appropriately and inappropriately in scientific papers."

    "ANTH 754 01 allowed me to be introduced in data preparation, manipulation, analysis and presentation, and will surely help me in preparing, manipulating, analyzing and present my dissertation data.",
    "Very helpful. In archaeology, we need to deal a lot of data, and statistics is a very useful tool.",
    "I think this will help me better organize my data that will be used in my dissertation. It also allows my work to appeal to more people and to be more conducive with other analyses.",
    "This class helped me to understand the beauty behind statistics and just how easy they can be to apply to archaeological datasets, I have a healthy respect for their use, and I can now exert a more critical eye when reading publications utilizing them. I will heavily relay upon what this class has taught me when writing my dissertation."
