   "comments": [
    "Yes- fun course. Professor Honeychurch is high-energy and has a lot of interesting insights. There's a lot of flexibility in the course as well, and so I felt like every student had a chance to pursue something he\/she was interested in for every topic. Also, we had a \"virtual\" class on Second Life! Really weird experience, but very interesting.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes of the semester. The work is very manageable, and all of the classes give you a different aspect of mobility. It is a must to take a class with Professor Honeychurch before you leave Yale.",
    "Take this class if Professor Honeychurch is teaching it! There will never be a dull moment, and you'll learn tons about societies you didn't even know were mobile. The class can be a lot of work (4-page reading response every week, two presentations and a final paper), but it is a manageable load most of the time.",
    "This class is fun and broad, but somewhat disorganized. I know I got something out of it, I just don't know what.",
    "Great class. please take it. It is super fun and interesting",
    "Take it! You will never look at the world and mobility in the same way again. The class also gives you a lot o freedom to explore topics you're interested in, you'll learn a lot from the other people who take it, and Honeychurch is wonderful.",
    "This class applies different lenses to that matter of mobility. It's a great survey introduction to a subject that is simultaneously obvious but abstract. Professor Honeychurch, who spends much of his life living and working amongst Mongols, is the best person to be choreographing this class. I say \"choreograph\" because that is the best way to describe his teaching style - each member of the seminar comes from a different academic and extra-curricular background, and the in-class discussions were often illuminating as people drew from their past experiences. I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in exploring mobility. People who can only learn in a strict, structured environment might have trouble dealing with the free-form nature of the class, though.",
    "Yes, it's a very interesting and unique way of studying humans",
    "Don't expect a strict breakdown or constance awareness of how you're being graded in this class. If that sort of fluidness drives you crazy, don't bother. If, however, you like a more laid back style of feedback and assessment as well as class structure and conversation, this class is for you!Interesting reads from which you can draw your own conclusions (don't be mistaken, however, there's a lot of it should you choose to do it all, as well as weekly response papers) and an enthusiastic professor who'swilling to let you form your own ideas",
    "Absolutely great class- by far the most fun I've had at Yale. Honeychurch is like Indiana Jones... only if Indiana Jones actually liked teaching. You learn a lot about mobility but it never seems like work because the class is enjoyable from start to finish."
