   "comments": [
    "The only reason this would be a worthwhile class to take is if you do not know basic C++ and would like to be guided closely in learning it. By the end of the semester you will know how to use templates, derivation (including multiple and polymorphic derivation), and operator overloading, but just barely. If you already know C++ this will be very boring. There are no substantial programming assignments. Prof. Fischer is not an engaging lecturer. Most of the students are from the Master's program. If you intend to take this as a gut and not go to lecture (not what I did), you may not do well on the picky exams, and be sorry.",
    "This class basically teaches you some object-oriented programming principles and spends most of the time teaching C++ syntax and parts of the C++ programming language. This is material that is basically impossible to make interesting, so be prepared. Professor Fischer was not a great lecturer this year, and I would probably have been better off not going to any lectures and reading the lecture slides. The lecture slides themselves are not great, but listening to him lecture about them in class did not make it any clearer, so a lot of the material was clarified for me using google. Problem sets usually do not take long, but they are highly variable. Some may take less than 50 lines of code, some may take 200. If you've taken 323, this will be a piece of cake, because he assumes nobody knows anything about programming. Exams are annoying and test on small details. I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone unless you have to take it.",
    "Relatively easier problem sets, extremely boring lectures which few attend, exams that require memorization than thinking. Take it if your course load is too heavy.",
    "Do not take this course. It is the most frustrating course I've taken at Yale. I disregarded the terrible evals when considering classes because the class was apparently easy, but I wholeheartedly regret my decision. Lectures are incredibly boring. Problem sets are easy, up until the last few, and the midterm\/final were ridiculous and generally unfair. Read up on OOP\/C++ on your own time and save yourself from the misery of this class.",
    "Intro to C++. A little boring, but some useful knowledge and it's good solid coding."
