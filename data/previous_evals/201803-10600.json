   "comments": [
    "Understanding of physiological systems and methods to measure\/process their signals.",
    "Had a signals, respiratory, bone mechanics, nerve stimulation, and EKG lab. All were very nice, relatively simple for a STEM lab at Yale, and I learned a lot! Truly the most enjoyable lab course I have taken so far.",
    "Basic MATLAB skills (making structures, analyzing graphs, area under curve, statistics etc.), basic physiology (neuromuscular, cardiovascular, bone mechanics, respiratory systems), how to take basic physiological measurements (lung capacity, electrical cardiac axis etc.).",
    "You learn about a lot of human physiology in action. Very interesting.",
    "Principles behind body physiology through experiments",
    "This course provided a basic introduction to various forms of data collection used in biomedical engineering. This includes measurements of bone strength, lung capacity, nerve conduction, and cardiac electric signals. The course relies heavily on MATLAB.",
    "This course was incredibly helpful in understanding the technical and biological background of common diagnostic tests and signal acquisition techniques.",
    "I learnt about biosignal data acquisitions and processing.",
    "I learned about how to use Matlab and data acquisition devices to understand physiological responses.",
    "I learned more about the human body and its functions.",
    "Practical skills involved in biomedical systems.",
    "A better understanding of the machinery, as well as simple mechanisms of the respiratory, circulatory and electromuscular systems.",
    "I learned about using matlab for data acquisition, I useful skill that seems applicable. In addition I was refreshed on certain aspects physiology.",
    "This class interfaced very well with the BENG 351 lecture - better than most classes do. I learned how to take and read EKGs and EMGs. I learned how to test bone mechanics and test respiratory function. I improved my knowledge of data analysis in Excel & MATLAB."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this was probably the best lab class I have taken at Yale. The labs were engaging and I felt like I took away something from each one. However, I think the lab reports were sometimes a bit tedious in the calculations.",
    "It was well paced, prof. Fan was super easy going and flexible, material was understandable, lab reports were reasonable. Everything was great! I also enjoyed the BME panel although very few people went.",
    "Strengths: content, labs, lab reports, schedule, Dr. Fan, TAs. This course was great! The content covered is very interesting and relevant to the biomedical sciences. The labs were very well designed and a lot of fun (shocking yourself to measure the muscle twitch, taking your own ECG, shattering chicken bones etc.). The reports were also very straightforward and manageable in the given time to complete them. The course also only meets every other week (literally only meets 6 times the whole semester...) so it feels like an ACTUAL 1\/2 credit and having 2 weeks for each report is nice. Dr. Fan is also very kind and wants everyone to learn and succeed; he even put on a career panel with catering for us. TAs were also very helpful and nice. Weaknesses: none",
    "It really focused on teaching the information that was important. Unlike a lot of lab courses, there is no \"fluff\" and busy work is minimal.",
    "The labs were all very interesting, and I am glad we had one every other week because the lab reports were time consuming.",
    "I was satisfied with how the course was run. Some of the problems on the post lab assignments were very challenging",
    "The course teaches quite a bit about the use of MATLAB and biomedical devices. The course fails to address how to analyze the data which has been collected. It assumes a very high level of comfortability with MATLAB.",
    "The lab reports are graded arbitrarily at times. Sometimes the lab report instructions are confusing. The class is super interesting though, and not too difficult. TAs and Prof. Fan are extremely helpful and nice.",
    "This course is well designed and a low stress way to learn a lot. Some of the lab reports could use more instruction on how to do some of the more rigorous Matlab calculations.",
    "This course does a good job at making the labs simple enough to follow along and the lab reports told you exactly what they wanted to see.",
    "A strength of the course is that the labs were fun and informative. A weakness is that the lab reports seemed tedious.",
    "Strengths: Helped improve my understanding of the corresponding lecture course. Gave me exposure to many different biomedical data collection and analysis techniques. Weaknesses: Grading often felt very arbitrary. Lab reports did not correspond well to what we did in class."

   "comments": [
    "It is a good lab that fulfills the biology requirement for pre-meds.",
    "A nice break from the rest of the BME requirements. Lots of nonBME took it too (ie Premed, even one for fun). Definitely a 'fun' lab course if you are interested in the physiology!",
    "YES!! Take this course!! Take it from me: I am not a BENG major, I did not take physiological systems, and I had 0 coding experience (I also didn't take BENG 249...) before taking this course. I found the course very fun and engaging and also accessible to someone without much background like myself. Dr. Fan is very kind and encouraging and wants his students to succeed. The TAs are also very great! The lab also only meets once every other week (so 6 times the whole semester) which makes it feel like a true 1\/2 credit. You thus get 2 weeks per lab report, which are already very manageable as it is. The labs are very cool and engaging and you will learn a lot about physiological measurement and MATLAB. This is easily the best\/easiest lab for pre-med!",
    "It was a good course if you are a biomedical engineering major.",
    "I would recommend this to any pre-med- this is the best bio lab at Yale, it teaches material that actually is relevant in an interesting way, and isn't a ton of busy work.",
    "Yes",
    "This course was interesting and useful. I would recommend to students who would like to study biomedical engineering or physiology. The course covers a wide range of methods and body systems. The course requires a comfortability with MATLAB. It's a lot more fun if you take it with friends.",
    "Yes. super interesting material, relatively low workload",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you have some background in Matlab, because it is an informative course with not too heavy a workload.",
    "Yes if it is required for your major.",
    "Yes! It was fun and relaxing yet really helped me learn biomedical engineering.",
    "Yes. It is entertaining, interesting and fun in general.",
    "Yes, this is a good premed lab and is also good to help you better understand certain aspects of BENG 351 lecture, especially EKGs, respiratory function, and electrical impulses in muscles."
