    "Great!If you sight sing, take it! No questions needed.If you don't sight read or aren't proficient, take it! You will do just fine and improve a lot, just as I did.",
    "Very enjoyable, and you learn some awesome music.",
    "If you LOVE Early Music with all your heart, mind and soul, you will LOVE this class. It's like entering a different world, and Grant Herreid is incredible. Take it.",
    "Probably the best musical experience you can have at Yale. Even if you've never considered singing early music, this course will open your eyes to a tremendously rich and fulfilling repertoire. I still get goosebumps listening to some of the stuff we sang. The workload is very light, and the performances are fully legitimate affairs, in which you perform with the best of the best. More than any other course, I emerged from this one thinking \"wow, now that was a Yaleexperience.\"",
    "Take this course! It's such a fun class, the professor is wonderful, and it's just a great way to spend two hours a week. The performances are always fulfilling and it's also a privilege to get to work with other talented musicians."
