   "comments": [
    "If you're passionate about languages, take this class.If you need to fulfill a language requirement and are looking for a fun\/interesting\/useful\/well-taught language course, take this class.If you want to see Robert awkwardly spill wine on Mireille's skirt at the end of Lesson 20 of \"French in Action\", take this class.If you want to learn about how the French don't say the word \"stupid\" and learn how to say quotations from \"The Little Prince\" in French, then, of course, take this class.If you want to be able to speak French for six minutes at the end of the semester after only studying it for four months, then take this class (preferably with Madame Burton because she is amazing at what she does.)In short, I don't think I can express well enough how much I recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely, with the caveat that they make sure they are taking a light course load.",
    "It is intense but interesting and a good way to get started with french and learn in quickly.",
    "It's a good French course. It's full immersion. So from day one it's all French. It's not taught like your typical language class so you won't go through chapters like food or colors or hobbies. You'll just kind of learn random vocab words\/grammar in conjunction with the video mini series it follows. It's a cool mini series. It's 20 episodes long and feels like you've started watching a new movie or TV show. The weakly tests on grammar\/vocab are annoying but do-able.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 110 to a student who has little to no french background. The course begins fairly easy and builds up to harder vocabulary, grammar, and a more intense workload. I would ensure students to be prepared for weekly tests, compositions, and workbook checks.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Know that it's a fair amount of work going in, though.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work, it is an excellent introduction to French. I do not believe it is possible to learn as much as you will on your own or in a more casual class in the same amount of time. By the end of French I, you should be able to have simple conversations\/write a letter about your friends and family, weather, hobbies, profession\/ambitions.",
    "I would say that it is a class for beginners French. I would not call it easy, but I would say that it moves at a great pace for learning and truly understanding thelanguage. I would definitely recommend this to another student because it helped me really understand the language, and the teachers (Madame Burton) was amazing. It was a wonderful, fun class, and was really very enjoyable!"
