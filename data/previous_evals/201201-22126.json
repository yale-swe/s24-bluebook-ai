   "comments": [
    "Great application of past meche learnings and new material.",
    "Great course to take. It brings an industry view of mechanical engineering which I find to be lacking at Yale. However, it is a lot of work and difficult material.",
    "If Ron Lehrach is teaching this course, take it! It doesn't matter how you feel about turbines and rockets. Ron Lehrach is the best teacher in Mech. Eng. He is extremely approachable and really loves this material, making the class a truly pleasant experience. That said, I would warn you to stay on top of your work and try to start the assignments early (they're easy anyway), so you can get help if you need it. The grading didn't seem harsh, but it was definitely thorough and fair (not particularly lenient).",
    "Easily the best Mech E. lecture I took at Yale.",
    "best engineering class i've taken by far, perhaps the best class i've taken at yale (ive taken intro cog sci, intro psych, mofopo, civil war, etc. all these don't come close, for me as an engineering major). the gap between this class and a core class, say, dynamics (383), is astronomical in terms of enjoyment and also feeling like i'm actually learning something instead of doing euler rotations over 10 pages just for the sake of doing them. ramjets, turbojets, rockets, thisstuff is just plain cool. FOR ONCE, i am motivated by the subject matter at hand and a real application of thermodynamics, the energy equations, etc. arises. the best part about this class has to be the instructor though, ron lehrach (LeBron). who needs phds and tenured profs when this guy obviously teaches better than any single one of them at yale? very relaxed, yet very helpful, extremely knowledgeable as someone who has devoted his life to industry (pratt& whitney) and government flight programs (nasa prototypes). overall just a nice, awesome guy. just take it as an elective, please please. PLEASE. just do it.",
    "Best engineering class I've taken in 3 years. It's all the stuff you wanted to know when you were 10 and wondered about rockets and airplanes. An extremely interesting synthesis of thermodynamics and fluids. That said, don't take it if you don't have a good thermo\/fluids background. Not very much calculus. Mr. Lehrach is a really interesting guy to talk to about industry experience, etc.",
    "Take it! Lehrach is great. Homework wasn't too bad. Exams are all take-home and pretty fair.",
    "Start with thrust and propulsion, then engines then ramjets then scram jets then liquid propellant jets. Pset each week, take home midterm and take home final.",
    "I suspect that no one will ever need this advice, but I'm going to give it anyway. I took this class as a History major and a second semester senior. Do not take this class as a History major and a second semester senior. I was in over my head, and too burnt out after four years to really stay afloat. The class is excellent, and Professor Lehrach is awesome, but I really never should have been here.Now, if you're a Mech E major, sign up RIGHT NOW. Because when I understood stuff, it was really cool, and it seemed like the in-major folks had that experience all the time. So, go for it.",
    "Rockets and jets are cool. So is Ron. He's a real nice old guy (retired from industry, not a professor) whose only reason for teaching this class is his own passion for the material and your understanding of it. There are weekly psets, and a take-home midterm and final. Basically there are about 5 concepts that you will learn by about midterm, and you will keep re-applying those. It's not terribly conceptually difficult, just gets a little annoying sometimes with the bookkeeping.",
    "Propulsion is a very interesting subject, particularly if you like aviation or rocketry. The material is about 25% percent thermodynamics, 60% supersonic engines (turbojet, ramjet, and scramjet), and 15% rocketry. Lehrach worked at Honeywell on scramjets, so his expertise lies in supersonic propulsion, and consequently there is little treatment of turboprops or turbofans. The exams are both take home and not especially difficult, and the problem sets are acceptably long and not overly tedious. I would strongly warm against taking the class without an acceptable foundation in thermodynamics, but if you feel comfortable with those concepts, you'll find this course interesting and well taught by an expert in his craft."
