    "I really enjoyed this class, but don't take the title too seriously. You don't learn anything about medicine. At all. Instead, it's a series of guest lectures designed to give you background on a few papers, which you then read and are quizzed on. It's actually great fun, but there's no real overarching theme to it and it consequently can feel fairly disjointed. Oftentimes a pathway is introduced as \"this goes wrong in X disease\" and then you go on and learn about the biochemistry of the pathway while leaving the medical part behind.",
    "Rigorous, but rewarding. It would be a shame for a student interested in MB&B not to take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. Early on, the sections are a little nerve-wracking in that you never really know what to expect, but the group discussion format really helps out in that if you don't know an answer, others can help you pick up the slack. Particularly for those who have \"read\" basic science articles, this is an excellent class to evaluate just how well you know how to both integrate and apply knowledge.",
    "This class was definitely the most challenging and hardest that I've taken at Yale, but it was also the most rewarding, and I think I learned more from it than from any other class. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about the MB&B major and who is ready for a challenge. Professor Steitz is phenomenal, as were the TAs, and I enjoyed just about every guest lecturer.",
    "Medical Impact is a very solid science course that teaches you how to: read and analyze primary literature (most of which is recent or of current relevance), work with peers from all kinds of research\/academic backgrounds, and write in a thoughtful and organized scientific style. The format of lecture and subsequent discussion section worked surprisingly well, as it gave students the opportunity to hear from an expert, read relevant papers on the topic, then discuss and analyze with peers working together on a single group response for the discussion questions. The lecturers and\/or material were sometimes boring, but I'm guessing a lot of that has to do with your own background and interests. Fortunately, this class allows a good deal of scientific exploration in the written assignments, where you can either write on a topic that you are familiar with, or choose novel topics that interest you. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who's interested in scientific research as a field, particularly if you have already done some lab research of your own. Definitely not a course for the casual pre-med or fan of science.",
    "yes. just be aware that the final project is graded really hard. i went in with a solid A and after the final project had a B+ for my final grade.",
    "This is the only class I've taken that is aimed at teaching us how to engage with the scientific world which is what all of us aspire to do. There are so many things I didn't even realize I was bad at until I took this class but I feel so much more confident about my ability to understand and write about research. Here is how it works: on Mondays a professor lectures about a particular disease\/area of biomedical research for an hour and then you go home and read 4-6 papers (A LOT OF READING) before Wednesday afternoon, when you take an hour and fifteen minute long quiz with other people in the class aimed at probing your understanding of the research the papers discussed. This is a constant stressor throughout the semester since there was so much reading. They also didn't quiz us on all of the reading, so it would be great to cut the number of articles down to 2-3 instead of 4-6. Maybe 4-6 would be okay for an individual quiz, since you have 2 weeks to read them, but in the beginning it took me like nine hours to read one paper and then at the end we also had the research papers to work out. Other assignments in the course were the mini-review (3 pages ss) and the final paper (10-12 pages ds). The mini-review was fun to write but hte paper was stressful because it was so long and very thorough since we had to propose follow-up experiments to study a disease. I would recommend not having a quiz during hte last week of classes to give students a chance to not feel overwhelmed by their papers and reading the journal articles. I don't feel like we would lose that much learning by not having it but it would have really been a lifesaver, especially since this was an individual quiz.Definitely take this course if you want to be a scientist-- this will not be as helpful for doctors, and all the crazy competitive people who just want to get an MD don't need to be there to stress the rest of us out anyway. The skills I learned here are invaluable and to have had a protected place to learn them is incredible and not something that I would have thought about before taking this class.Also the professors and TAs are great.",
    "I enjoyed the class. The format is pretty unique: a lecture on Monday, assigned scientific papers on that topic to read afterward, and then \"discussion section\" on Wednesday, which basically means working in groups of ~4 to answer questions related to the papers. The format was pretty nice, and I liked the group work--for me, it felt like getting together with a study group to work on a problem set. Outside of reading the papers and doing the discussion sections, there were two \"quizzes\" (more like mini-midterms, which take all of class time) which were fairly difficult but not unreasonably so, in addition to a mini-review assignment which I found pretty painless. Then there's the final paper! Thank the science gods that they make you work on this piece-by-piece throughout the semester: topic\/references, abstract, and outline were nicely interspersed. I say this because the paper was kind of a beast; I'd say it was one of the more challenging assignments I've done for MB&B. If you start early it's manageable, but it requires a lot of thought and a lot of work so definitely take it seriously. It's a satisfying assignment once you finish!Overall, I enjoyed the class, but personally never *really* fully engaged with the material in the course. Like most things in Yale (and in life), the more you put into it the more you get out of it. If you can put in the time to really read the papers thoroughly and think about them critically before discussion sections, I bet you'd have a really intellectually rewarding experience. With that said, no matter what this is a great class that will probably help you think more like a scientist.",
    "If you're an MB&B major, this class is a must-take. Even if you don't need it to fulfill the upper-level seminar requirement, you should at least shop this course. I wasn't originally planning on taking this class, but it has ended up being one of my favorite science classes at Yale.Med Impact is a unique course that combines theoretical concepts from biochem and other bio courses with hot topics in disease research. The class covers a wide variety of diseases and research techniques - the scope can seem overwhelming, but you come out of it knowing so much more about biomedical research. Take this class!!",
    "My favorite course for the MB&B major. I would definitely recommend this course to students with a solid bio\/biochem background. The course really helps you to learn how to think as a scientist.",
    "Lectures are boring. Patrick Sung's interminable droning on the first day of class should have been enough of a warning sign for me. The 3-5 primary research articles assigned each week are... boring. Unless you're into spending all of Monday and Tuesday night cramming paper details in your head. The writing assignments are... you guessed it - boring! Again, this is unless you're a fan of finding and reading 25 primary research articles to write a 12 page research proposal (which, let's face it - you're not). Grading is unbelievably arbitrary and dependent on your TA. Don't take the class gunning for an A unless you're prepared to get above a 96% in it.Honestly, the hardest part of the course was figuring out who the hard-grading TA was, determining the TA grading schedule (they rotated each week), and choosing your group (read: finding the whiz kids) accordingly.And if you do get sucked into this for your MB&B requirement (note: TAKE METHODS AND LOGIC INSTEAD), don't bother going to lecture or reading the reviews.",
    "This is honestly the best class I have ever taken at Yale. The workload is relatively light and each topic covered is interesting.",
    "Medical Impact of Basic Science is a bit of a misnomer, as the course is more about reading the scientific literature critically. Each week covers a separate disease, and there will be 3-6 papers, including both reviews and research articles, to read. The first class of each week is a lecture, and the second (with a few exceptions) is a discussion section, with the class broken up into groups of 3-4 to answer a set of questions. Reading the papers thoroughly is absolutely essential for this class, and if you keep up, the quizzes should be relatively straightforward. The other major course assignments are a mini-review of research related to a neurological disorder and a significant final paper that is similar to a research proposal. If you've taken the foundational MB&B or MCDB courses and have at least some time in your schedule, I recommend this course.",
    "You're looking at this class because you probably have to take it at some point, but I really encourage you to, instead of finding another elective. You'll learn a lot, in terms of facts about important research already done, but also can get some good practice reading science papers and thinking through ways to further research. however, really, really read the papers on the weeks you have quizzes. You'll have weekly discussion groups where three of you answer four questions, and then twice, you'll have a quiz where ONE of you answers MORE questions. They are very hard when compared to what you are used to week in, week out.",
    "you read 3-4 research papers each week (in addition to a bunch of reviews, news articles, background, etc that you're supposed to read, but aren't really necessary). the readings are posted on thursday or friday, and the next week, on monday, you get a lecture from a professor about the material. on wednesday, you break into groups of 3 or 4 in order to answer 3 or 4 questions (sometimes, multi-part). this is basically like an in-class problem set. you choose your group every week, and can get away with sometimes working with the same people as before, btu you can't consistently work with the same people. this rhythm of the class is awesome, but there are two midterms, where you have to prepare two weeks worth of papers INDIVIDUALLY, in order to take a very difficult exam ON YOUR OWN. this was the most stressful part of the class, and I think it can be redesigned to avoid needing to master 6-9 papers for one day\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that is just absurd.the other part of the class involve two papers. one is a 3-pg mini-review that is fairly easy. the other is a 10-12 pg research proposal that can be pretty tough. it's mostly toughto come up with a good topic, because the techniques you are probably going to be familiar with already, either from your lab, previous courses, or from this course. luckily, they hold your hand and you do this paper in steps. first your topic is due, then a preliminary abstract, and then an outline (OR full draft that that they will read, if you want). finally, your paper is due during finals week. that was also very stressful.it seems like it is easy to do fine in this class, but probably hard to do extremely well, since so many of the other mb&b majors are geniuses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or Rhodes Scholars #butactually."
