   "comments": [
    "If you like chemistry, you probably want to\/have to take this course and it's great with Prof. Slavoff. I never found it excessively stressful and the exams were all reasonable. The concepts can be challenging but it's super rewarding to finally grasp them. Even for non-science majors, if you have the background, this is a worthwhile SC credit.",
    "Pretty hard after the first midterm. Good instructor, and a well-structured class. If this class isn't required of you, be warned that you'll end up seeing a lot more material than you'd probably care to see. Oh, and homework counts with Slavoff.",
    "Interesting, well taught, informative, and lots of crossover with both bio and physics. Not an overwhelming amount of work if you stay up with the material and really understand the concepts.",
    "hard class but if you have to take it then take it with professor Slavoff.",
    "Pretty much what you expect. Can be tough, and a bit of work, but satisfying overall.",
    "I have never had such a positive experience in a chemistry class - I hated Gen Chem and was scared of taking orgo - but this was honestly the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale, and as a non-stem major, too. Take this class off-term, with Professor Slavoff if you can. The teaching team is extremely diligent, and the small class environment allows people to feel comfortable asking questions. Miles away from the normal intimidating, massive pre-med culture of other chem lectures. I never thought I would enjoy chemistry, then I took this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one looking for a smaller and more personal beginning to organic chemistry. Taking the class on the off semester is nice, and the professor is very skilled in helping students understand difficult concepts. The workload is pretty reasonable, and the exam policy is excellent: the final is just one of four non-cumulative midterms, of which one may be dropped. This is a forgiving course that wants you to succeed, which is a good way to start an otherwise challenging subject.",
    "Orgo is really not that bad, particularly with Professor Slavoff. I felt like I was being spoon fed information at a very manageable rate right until the last couple weeks of the semester, when reactions started to get pretty difficult. Nothing took me by surprise in this course either- the practice tests were very similar to the actual tests without giving answers away. It pays to do well early on though. The midterms got harder each time, and telling yourself you'd do better on the next one is easier said than done.",
    "While Organic Chemistry at Yale has poor reputation, Professor Slavoff's course is well taught, clear, and easy to follow. She is an excellent professor, and is happy to answer questions during lecture. Exams are challenging, and grading is more strict than in other organic courses, but it is well worth to take this course with Professor Slavoff. Highly recommend for any student who needs\/wants to take Organic Chemistry",
    "You should definitely take this course with Professor Slavoff. She made a lot of very intimidating material feel approachable, and I had a very positive experience with this course.",
    "Professor Slavoff is an amazing professor. She makes orgo very logical and fun to learn.",
    "Take the class of its a requirement.",
    "Sarah Slavoff was an amazing professor and I would definitely recommend taking this course with her. No one takes this course for fun (that I know of), but be ready for lots of memorization. The course wasn't too bad, but not super enjoyable either.",
    "Would reccomend, especially with Slavoff. Attending class is essential, useful to read the textbook and ask questions.",
    "This class is not a horrible as everyone makes it out to be, but you do have to put in work. It can be difficult but there are plenty of people to help you through it and professor Slavoff is excellent.",
    "Professor Slavoff is extremely kind and invested in her students' learn experience. The pace at which she taught was comfortable and I cannot imagine a better person to teach orgo! Her lectures were well-organized and easy to follow. Honestly, it was a relatively painless semester considering it is orgo and I am by no means a STEM person. The psets were long at times, but for good reason. There are four midterm exams (no final) and they are all fair. I never read the textbook, but her lectures paired with Chemistry as a Second Language seemed to pull me through. Took this class because of the #premed life but it was actually pretty interesting!",
    "The course was a good introduction to organic chemistry. There were the standard textbook problem set + Sapling homework assignments in addition to 3 midterms and a final exam. All were manageable and the material was easy to comprehend if you took the time to look over it and ask questions to the professor and\/or the TAs."
