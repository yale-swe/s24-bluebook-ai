    "If you have the opportunity to take this course as a seminar, I highly encourage you to do so. I can think of no course that is more practical to every day conversation. It is particularly great for students who consider themselves foodies - Professor Freedman likes students who know what they are talking about or are at least engaged and interested in learning more. The readings are super interesting for the most part and the workload is fairly modest. I can promise that you will leave this class a better scholar and a more interesting person.",
    "I would say it is a comprehensive and very interesting class, perfect for anyone interested in careers in the food industry or in food studies in general.",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this class to another student ten thousand times over. I think this class is a great way to work with one of the strongest professors at Yale in a very close environment. The topic is interesting and the class is brilliant.",
    "Definitely take it. The class gives you a better understanding about cultural norms surrounding food and how eating habits have evolved over time. Most of the people in our class were non history majors, so the class is appealing to everyone.",
    "This class is divided into two topics, the first being actual history where we focus on china, india, europe and for a tiny amount, latin america. The second half, however is about restaurants in the US and what is considered Upscale. Personally, I did not care about this part of the class. It felt very intimidating and more geared towards students who did have the money to dine at such chic places. Overall, the class was fair with the grade being compromised of 3 papers. All of the topics were free choice. The reading was not ridiculous and I am pretty sure most students can get away with not doing it all the time.",
    "This class is a more writing intensive class (that doesn't give a writing credit) that gives an interesting insight into a new topic, and it gives new perspective on something that is so common in our day to day life. If this is something that you're interested in, then take this classthis is one of those classes that Yale advertises for its diversity and interesting topic. Professor Freedman is really knowledgeable and brings in interesting guests (this year's seminar included Alice Waters and Lidia Bastianich), so this class is always packed with interesting information.",
    "This class was incredibly interesting and engaging. Beginning with discussions of ancient diets and going all the way to modern times, the class covers a lot of material, though more weight\/time is definitely devoted to the more contemporary. Professor Freedman is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, approachable, and helpful, with a classic teaching style. I really enjoyed the class, and would recommend it to most anyone.",
