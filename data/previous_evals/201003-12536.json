    "For those of you wondering what level you should choose, a little of my background: I went to Chinese school (2 hours weekly) from grades 1-8, and was not a good student (didn't study, didn't do homework). I didn't go to Chinese school during high school. I self-studied a bit in senior year and got a 5 on the AP Chinese test. I speak mandarin with my parents about half the time at home. I found this course to be very manageable. So, if you are at a level comparable or better than mine, you should be able to handle this course without much stress.One thing about the tests: you have to be very zi3 xi4. Small mistakes are the main reason why I lost points, and probably the main reason for other students as well.",
    "This is a really great class, and I would definitely recommend it! There is a lot of homework, and quizzes every day, but the workload is definitely manageable and I feel like my Chinese has improved significantly. The class focuses a lot on grammar, which is useful for heritage students. Also, Xu Laoshi is a really great teacher, and it's clear that she really cares about her students.",
    "Definitely! It's a fast paced course, but definitely manageable. Professor Xu is very friendly too!",
    "It is a class for heritage speakers not just in the material covered, but in the way it is taught. The sample dialogues in the textbook are between a mother and a child and have to do with the conflict between the generations and traditions. So it is interesting as a class on culture as well as on language. I am actually not a heritage speaker, so I find this even more interesting.",
    "Great course to improve formal writing skills. Perhaps not so great in terms of increasing oral skills, but having a tutor helps with that. Great seminar with a consistent\/daily workload that is manageable as long as you keep up. I would recommend Chinese 132 to native Chinese speakers and people willing to do the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wishes to study, work or learn more about the Chinese culture.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the course. It is a course guaranteed to improve your Chinese ability.",
    "It's five days a week, and you're going to spend A LOT of time studying. If you relax for even a little bit, you'll be completely behind. That being said, my Chinese has improved markedly over just one semester, and I'm finding myself reading newspapers with far more ease than before.",
    "Intensive course that has a workload of about an 8 credit equivalent although you only receive 4. Simplified Chinese only, so it has limited use unless you go to China.",
    "Healthy amount of daily work--will keep you focused. Would recommend it to any intermediate Chinese language level heritage speaker.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 132 to another student who want to improve their chinese. My chinese has definitely improved a LOT, and upon returning home my parents (both native Chinese speakers) commented on it. However, the class is NOT for non-heritage chinese speakers. The class assumes you have some proficiency in speaking and spends a lot of time on learning vocab and sentence patterns, not on practicing speaking."
