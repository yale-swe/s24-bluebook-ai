    "I was very disappointed with this class. There was no support and it was taught at such a theoretical level. I found the instructor to not be supportive of our learning.",
    "The contents are hard to understand, it is the most difficult class in Yale I have taken. But the lab notes are pretty helpful.",
    "this is a weird class; the professor hardly explained anything and all I did was copy the codes from the lab and try to get outputs.",
    "lecture slides should be more detailed.",
    "good",
    "The course was disorganized to the point that it was detrimental to student learning. The professor needs to understand what are priorities for learning and what is less important. Also, given that class time is limited, everything should start on time to maximize instruction. The class may be a data class, but there is too much technical detail and not enough emphasis on how to interpret in real-world contexts.",
    "This course was terrible. It was the worst course I have taken thus far at the school of public health. First, basic principles of teaching graduate level courses were not being followed. For example, the lecture slides were very poorly written and poorly organized. Not a single lecture started with a set of objectives outlining what we were supposed to learn that day. We never got all the way through a lecture during the hour and 20 minutes of class. New concepts were introduced on the lecture slides without being defined and put into the larger context of what we were learning. Second, the homework assignments were entirely dependent on the lab handouts. They would have been impossible to do otherwise, as not much teaching went on during the lab sessions either. Third, the homework assignments were incredibly time consuming. This was partly as a result of the poor quality of the lectures. It was also partly because we were expected to complete questions on the homework assignments that were not covered in class or in lab. An inordinate amount of time was spent using Google (at the suggestion of both the instructor and the TA) to figure out how to complete the kinds of analyses we should have been taught in class. Finally, the textbook for this course was not helpful at all. It was very difficult to follow for students who had never seen longitudinal data analysis before. This class was very frustrating and I leave knowing that I will need to take another course on Longitudinal data analysis to make up for what I didn't learn here.",
    "The course is very useful and fundamental. Perhaps more time and credit should be devoted to this course.",
    "i hope the lecture slides could include more examples.",
    "Lecture notes are not clear.",
    "The lectures are not helpful at all, was not clearly organized, nor did it not help much with the homework.Would have liked to have a review of the homework or at least provide an answer key so students can go back and review where they went wrong.",
    "There is a disconnect between what is taught in lecture and lab and what we are asked to do on the homework. It makes the class difficult.",
    "The instructor was a very nice woman. She was approachable and gentle.The course was lousy for several reasons:Very little examples.. Not at all an applied course. So it left me feeling like what is the point of this all. There were so few real Life examples in the material. There was an over reliance on teaching the theory.... Who cares about the theory?If I could have dropped this course I would have.YSPH needs to shape up and correct this problem. The same instructor has been there for years with little change in her technique despite dozens of repeated complaints about the course.",
    "This course is somewhat helpful to understand longitudinal data analysis but could be taught with more clarity. It seemed like simple topics were covered in detail (like what a logit is -- we know that already) but the new material was somewhat glossed over. Perhaps more real world examples would help. Also, the class is somewhat disorganized.",
    "Maybe the lecture notes can be improved to be more well-organized.And I think we can add more things into this course, such as how to deal with the missing data.",
    "The material was difficult to follow, especially for non-biostats students. It would be very helpful to explain some of the basics, if only briefly.",
    "A useful data analysis course.",
    "The professor was a poor teacher, the book was bad, and the TA wasn't helpful. This made it a very difficult and not fun course.",
    "I think there needs to be more of a distinction between the appropriateness of methods for longitudinal data vs. multilevel data. The lecture notes could be improved. The final project was a good way to solidify some of the course material. The homework assignments were generally fine, however there were some questions that we weren't really able to answer based on the course resources.",
    "Awful."

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0nice",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instructor knows the material very thoroughly. However, she needs to learn how to prioritize what to teach--she spends too much time on trivial information in the beginning of class, and then rushes at the end. She also needs to make slides more organized--learning statistics in the slide format is tough, so she should make it more organized.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin seems incredibly knowledgeable as a statistician, but she is unable to communicate this knowledge effectively, efficiently, and in an organized and well-though-out manner in the classroom. Dr. Lin lacks basic teaching skills as well as an understanding of her audience. The classroom was a mixture of biostats and non-biostats students and the lecture materials should have been organized with an eye towards that.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instructor has pretty good attitude but somehow it's not so easy to catch what she wants to carry over.",

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is a great prof. I wish we could discuss the material a little more. I would also have liked to have shorter homework assignments (even if there were more) where we were able to cover smaller pieces instead of such large analyses. It made it difficult to get through the homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Supportive and warm-heart.Sometimes the lectures are not that explicit.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very dry. Just talks through powerpoints. Not an effective way to learn.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The lectures were often difficult to follow, but Professor Lin was always willing to take questions and answer them to the best of her ability."

I guess since the instructor didn't teach the material well in lecture he doesn't have much to work with for the lab sessions.",
