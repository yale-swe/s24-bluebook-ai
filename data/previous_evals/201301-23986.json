   "comments": [
    "I think that the experience in the class, as is the case in any language class, is very dependent on both the instructor and the other students who take the class -- German 120 involves a lot of in-class time and collaboration on many, many projects, so make sure you shop the other section if something doesn't sit right. The language is not taught in the traditional way, with a lot of emphasis on grammar with little speaking, so if you think you work better with a lot of instruction on grammar and writing, you should maybe consider taking intensive German instead of the regular track. Other than that, the class is well thought out, fun, and engaging, with a very wide variety of activities.",
    "A good follow up to German 110. Take it if you want to learn German. Some of the work is quite cumbersome, though.",
    "It's a really good course, and I couldn't recommend it higher. It is more work than 110, but that's to be expected.",
    "It is a good introductory German class. You will improve your German a lot after taking this class.",
    "I would recommend it because it has just the right amount of workload",
    "If you like learning German, take it.",
    "Definitely take this class. Yale has a great language course and it is well worth extending such practical skills. There are lots of little homework assignments, but nothing too overwhelming. You have the choice to submit a group project or final paper, rather than a final. Every other week there is a test on the material covered, but they are never too taxing.",
    "I would recommend it. It was a fun class.",
    "Yes, though I would advise the student to enroll in the smallest class if possible, and I would recommend Andrew Kirwin as the best instructor."
