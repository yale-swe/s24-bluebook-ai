   "comments": [
    "The first semester of the intensive year-long thesis is mainly focused on narrowing your research topic and question and writing a literature review. While you should have all of the skills necessary (from SOCY 160 or other sociology classes), the class is mainly meant to keep you on track and to answer questions as you design and write a much longer research project than any other you'll have done up to this point.",
    "Students gain clear strategies for completion of (1) project creation, (2) literature reviews, and (2) data collection in this course. The course helped all students to workshop and brainstorm their projects!",
    "Great way to feel prepared for my thesis. Calmed my nerves and put me in super productive environments\/conversations to help me get ready to write!",
    "This course was especially helpful in making the structure of the thesis clear to me. Having due dates for the lit review made it so I actually got things done, especially since there wasn't much for me to do before getting IRB approval",
    "Good advice on the structure of a thesis, how to do research, and do a literature review.",
    "This course taught me the nuts and bolts of preparing ones self to do research in the social sciences. This semester we focused on study design, literature review and getting an IRB passed. To this end I learned a ton about how to practically do these things I had read about in papers for the past many years."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength is the sense of community and support the class provides. Meeting biweekly with the other people in the major is a great way to see that everyone is dealing with the same issues, and Professor Almeling is very much a mother-figure to us all. With the TAs--both of whom were phenomenal and both of whom are sadly leaving us next semester--you have a lot of mentors to go to with questions and to get feedback from. The only weakness is that the class is now pretty large because of the growing size of the major. That makes in-class time for individual feedback limited.",
    "nice to create a cohort of students working on sociology senior essays. there was a sense of camaraderie in the course. course did seem a little disorganized, and sometimes I wish that the timeline would have started a bit earlier, as the workload seemed to concentrated at the end of the semester.",
    "Having the DUS and two awesome TAs, as well as everyone else in the class, made my thesis seems less like a huge challenge and more like something I wanted to do! Really no weaknesses, perfect for what its supposed to be!",
    "Strengths- working with the other seniors, regular opportunity to check in and make sure I was on the right track Weaknesses- I wonder if there was anything else we could have worked on during this semester, it seems as though it would be possible to work on a lit review alone during winter break and now that it's winter break I'm not sure if there is anything for me to do",
    "I think the fact that quantitative and qualitative projects were in the same class, and people had so many different topics meant that a lot of the information didn't always apply to everyone, and sometimes it was hard to focus on your own project. It was nice to have the support of other people figuring out the process.",
    "The main strength is that this course supports students in their quest for a senior thesis. The biggest issue that I see is the challenge of only a few TFs and a professor shepherding so many people through their wildly different theses. Sadly I don't have any good suggestions for this problem except finding more ways to give individual instruction.",
    "There was a lot of opportunity for guidance which is really helpful. I would prefer having a more clear timeline in the beginning; I feel like we laid one out and it kind of fell apart."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're deciding between the semester-long and year-long thesis, I'd highly recommend the year-long. The process of deciding on and conducting your own research project can be arduous, but it's really rewarding. Plus, the sociology department does a great job of setting you up for success and supporting you throughout :)",
    "Yeah! Take the yearlong thesis if you want to major in sociology. Doing your own research and data collection, though more work, is a rewarding process.",
    "Yes. This course is required for all SOCY majors who wish to earn an Intensive degree, but it is an absolutely incredible framework for sociological project creation.",
    "Obviously a must if youre doing a year-long thesis. Even if youre considering it and are nervous, do it! Super great way to feel like the project is possible, if not exciting!",
    "I didn't find a lot of the activities in class especially helpful, but overall it was good to get a grounding in how to go about writing a thesis, which is a bigger project than I have had experience with.",
    "I would definitely suggest the year long thesis over the one semester one. This longer thesis actually allows one to do research and produce a product that you can use to put on someones desk and say check out what I can do for you."
