    "The class was an exploration of different modes of montage and the uses and implications of those modes. Mediated between an exploration of an overarching theme--montage, and an analysis of specific directors' works and styles. I would recommend because the class really touched upon issues fundamental to film and the relationship between aesthetics and politics.",
