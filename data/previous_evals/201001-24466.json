    "Take this class. It's an interesting survey, and you will learn a lot about different types of personal writing, which seems perhaps like an easy thing but proves rather elusive when you try it yourself, until Professor Stepto guides you.",
    "great course. you read one autobiography a week, but you don't really have to do the readings because of the style of the course. prof stepto is amazing. he is one of the most approachable professors i have ever had, and he really works with you to make great papers. a really fantastic course, without too much work. definitely take it, especially as a senior seminar.",
    "This class made me sad.It's pretty boring and the professor makes it very easy to get away with not doing the reading. I wished we would have more interesting conversations, but it was always the same thing (and always pretty boring).Prof. Stepto is a really sweet person, but not particularly good at leading a seminar.",
    "This is a great, chill course to take. I liked most of the works we read, and Professor Stepto was very endearing, helpful, open-minded, and passionate about the subject. Do shop it to see if you like his seminar style, in which he goes through the main themes he noticed in the reading and asks students' opinions on them. There is a lot of reading, but most of it is fun and relaxing. One of my favorite aspects of the course was the chance to write personal essays and our own autobiographies. It was a great way to think critically about the reading we were doing and how it related to our own lives. Professor Stepto is very open-minded with your topics, giving you a lot of freedom with whatever you choose to write.",
    "Professor Stepto is wonderful, take any class you can with him. He is incredibly encouraging and always helpful in office hours. This course takes a historical approach to autobiography in America, starting with Ben Franklin and Harriet Jacobs and ending with essays from the New Yorker. The books are engaging - read what you can. Will get you thinking about how to write your own autobiography.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you have an interest in autobiographical writing. You don't need to be an English major to join this course and get a lot out of the class. Professor Stepto is always willing to help on the material and the class atmosphere is very nice to work in."
