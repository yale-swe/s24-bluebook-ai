    "This class was great! Professor Romani is an incredibly caring instructor, and the readings selected were good. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "once in a lifted is perspective on how our own demographics age wise lives all the way across the world. what is different but most exciting often what is similar",
    "I would highly recommend Youth in Contemporary South Asia to another student. You learn a lot from the class without chafing under pressure.",
    "This course will definitely get you familiar with the anthropology mindset of thinking. I, myself, am not an anthropology major but learned so much about evaluating youth through a sociological viewpoint. There should definitely be more courses on youth available.",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale!!!! It is so unfortunate that Sahar won't be teaching at Yale anymore because she truly was a most gifted instructor. This course was so engaging, and I actually looked forward to the readings each week. It allowed me to critically view issues such as development work, gender, sexuality, violence, etc. in South Asia through the lens of youth. The final project, where we were given a choice between a paper and a podcast, was super fun! I realize this review wont really matter since this course may not be offered again, but I can't help but tell Sahar how great of an experience this course was!!",
    "Take it. This is a fantastic course! Always looked forward to these discussions. We dealt with really important questions and were able to connect them directly to our own lives. Through exploring youth in South Asia we were able to explore questions that apply to youth and our experience as young people: what is a generation? how does neoliberalism impact our everyday lives? what is the purpose of education, is it an equalizer or does it reproduce structural inequality? We explored issues of gender, caste, socio-economic status, race. I often didn't like the readings very much but the class always made up for it. Sahar is an incredible professor. Very engaging, asks great questions, and really cares about her students. Super approachable, friendly and passionate about her work and yours."
