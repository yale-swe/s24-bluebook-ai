Martin was very accessible and generous with his time for review sessions, which I also found invaluable.",

    "There were some minor kinks in the system, to be expected in a first class. 3 hour Monday lectures felt really long at first-- but I came to appreciate them over the long run, and would not change them in retrospect. But, sticking closely to a set break time half-way through would be helpful. Getting into the lab to check as soon as possible would have been great, too (though not humanly possible this fall given Greeley's renovations).",
    "It needs a better flow. Many classes the instructor seemed to run out of material and not quite know what to do with us.",
    "Organization of the course still needs work, including student-led class discussions. There was general uncertainty as to the expectations for these, as well as the class paper\/project.",
    "Class periods need to be better structured. It often felt like we were just eating up time by the end of the period. Perhaps 3 hour sessions are not the right length.",
    "It would be helpful if the instructor will provide a lecture on - brief lectures on the plan physiology - technical terms ( if difficult, review session by TA would be helpful!)",
    "More hands on learning would be great - more time in the lab.",
