    "Light workload, but would not recommend. Dry and boring.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you know that you like the films and want to study them more. It's not a great film class on its own because the instruction is weak. But DEFINITELY take it if you like Hitchcock and want to learn more about his films. It's also a pretty easy workload -- you have to watch the movie once a week, do some readings (interesting, not too long) and write two papers.",
    "If you're interested in film, you need to be familiar with Hitchcock. This is a good way to watch a lot of his work and learn about his themes. However, the class itself is rather boring, so you have to weigh what's important to you.",
    "Take it if you want a film class that's a good overview of Hitchcock, not too much work at all and a good introduction to the world of film and film analysis.",
    "Yes.",
    "Not difficult, great films, boring lectures.",
    "Yes"
