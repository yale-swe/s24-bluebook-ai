    "Definitely recommend for anyone interested in Development.",

    "Economic Development is a seminar style class with class discussions depending on the students themselves. Professor Boozer presents various themes with enthusiasm.",

    "This course was somewhat hit and miss regarding the relevance of lectures to my areas of study. Some days we covered important theories that have shaped how development is conducted. Other days we focused on mathematical models without an obvious link to development.",
    "Economic Development is a core IDE course. The readings and class topics introduced me to new ideas and concepts in the field.",
    "This deepened my knowledge a lot by allowing me to practice my research skills.",
