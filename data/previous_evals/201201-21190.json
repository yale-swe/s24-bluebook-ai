   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. I don't think you will ever find another class like this one at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. No matter what you are studying at Yale, you will get something out of this course. Learning about group dynamics, systems, and characteristics of a good leader is something key to learn as a freshman and I can already see how I will use the skills I learned in this class in the future.",
    "Very practical and applicable material that we gained. Gives students a new framework in which to view leadership problems. Although, it was framed as a health studies class, which it was not. Just misleading. Still a great course!",
    "The course gave students the tools to analyze leadership systems and to foster effective leadership outside of the classroom. I HIGHLY recommend taking this course! (But note that, while it is listed as Health Studies, the course does not revolve around global health.)",
    "Take it. It's not about public health but you learn more about leadership theory than you would in any other class here at Yale. It's the type of class you might be taking for an MBA. One thing that is annoying is the fact that it does not count for any type of distributional requirement. That being said, you will certainly learn a bounty of valuable perspectives.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. A very interesting way to look at leadership, and really not too much work. Everything that you learn is in some way applicable to your life, which is really amazing and unlike many courses at Yale. Take this class, or any class with Professor Bradley that you can get into.",
    "Leadership and Global thinking is a freshman seminar you don't want to miss.",
    "It was an awesome seminar with some really interesting readings for the most part. Some readings were not so great and the essays became worrisome as the format was hard to figure out.",
    "If there is one class at Yale you have to take before you graduate, it is Leadership and Global Thinking. More than any other class I took during my freshman year, this course has influenced the way I think and approach both academics and my life. Going into the class I was convinced I knew a lot about being a leader (I led a lot of groups in high school, etc.) and leaving it I now realize I knew almost nothing about leadership. The readings for this class are always manageable and consistently fantastic, and Professor Bradley does an amazing job at facilitating classroom discussion and creating a nurturing and safe environment. An absolutely amazing professor, she is truly teaching the class to help her students grow and learn and to shape the people they will be not only during their time at Yale, but for their entire lives, which is much rarer from a teacher than you might think. The class has two main papers about leadership and both have enough flexibility that you can write about something that fascinates you, using a leadership lens. I found writing both papers to be incredibly rewarding, as they allowed me to take what I learned and use it to analyze situations that interested me. I literally cannot recommend this class enough. If you are able to take it, you should.",
    "If you get the chance, take this class! The classroom dynamic is great - lots of interesting discussion guided by a gifted professor. The reading is both interesting and immensely helpful, and the assignments pull the entire class together. If you are interested in learning about leadership theory and global approaches to problem solving, this class would be a great pick.",
    "A freshman seminar about the theory of leadership and how it works in different circumstances ranging from the leadership of a firefighter team putting out a forest fire to the NASA team that was in charge of bring back Apollo 13 safely to Earth.Professor Bradley encouraged the class to discuss topics amongst ourselves- discussion on readings essentially made up the class agenda most days.I would recommend this class if you like reading about various historical problems and how leadership structures addressed these problems. There are some really cool readings, but be advised- there are some drier readings in my opinion- usually the ones are theory. To be fair, these do help you understand the stories more and lay the theoretical foundation for the class.",
    "This class analyzes a variety of topics related to leadership and group dynamics, and forces you to analyze these concepts in real-world contexts. Although it is difficult to measure exactly how much you learn, you definitely come away with knowledge that is very applicable to anything you may study or do in your life. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "A really interesting class that introduced theories of leadership, group dynamics and other social science ideas. The readings were pretty interesting, but since the class is a seminar, the experience and discussions come down to all the other students. If you don\u0092t put in the time to do the readings and are unwilling to contribute, you will get a lot less out of the class, trust me.Professor Bradley is genital and a great person. However, she is mostly just a moderator for the class, although she makes sure it is running optimally. The two main assignments were papers which had us apply ideas from class into real-life problems. These werea little tricky, but rewarding to do."
