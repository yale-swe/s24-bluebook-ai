    "The opportunity to travel with this course was an amazing learning experience, and the topic was very interesting. It was great to hear from guest speakers as well, and attend events around the university that had to do with the course material. I think that the structure of the capstone course--doing a project for a 'customer'--makes it difficult to do independent intellectual work, or pursue personal areas of interest within the project. I think that the course would have been a better learning experience overall if we were not working for a customer. I think it's a bit weird to have global affairs give their labor to entities that they don't really get to choose for themselves....",
    "Strengths: topic, practitioners, ground experience Weaknesses: reading list, client",
    "I really enjoyed going to Senegal, I thought that was incredibly informative and very fun. I also liked the independent nature of the course. The independence, however, was also sometimes a weakness, as I felt like we had little instruction and actual tangible learning-time. We were provided some readings, but never really had the chance to look through regional history and discuss it in class in a way that gave us a more solid foundation of what we were trying to study.",
    "I think that the course could have had a clearer plan in the beginning, but given all of the experiences offered by this course, I would say that it was extremely strong."

    "I would not recommend any Global Affairs Capstone to a Yale student. Obviously the capstone is required for a Global Affairs student, but I think the Capstone in general is the worst part of the major. I personally do not appreciate that students dont get the option to write a thesis instead and have to be in a group project on a topic not of their choosing. I feel like this is the Jacksons way of trying to make students feel like theyre making actual change, when in reality its too short of a time period to do anything of value.",
