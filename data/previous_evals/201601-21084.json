   "comments": [
    "CPSC 184 is an great intro to IP law course that is interdisciplinary in nature. As a science major, I took the class with a vague interest in IP law and came out with a much better understanding of how to read legal papers and an idea of what it could look like to do science and IP law related work.",
    "Great overview into the patchwork of laws that provide intellectual property rights to creative works in the U.S. I would recommend the course if you are interested in having useful general knowledge on IP. Course load is decent: 4-5 readings a week (1-2 court cases and the remainder are news articles), 6 two-page single-spaced reading responses, and an open ended final project. Do the readings and participate in discussion.",
    "A lively, engaging, and topical course, with a remarkably chill, fun, and knowledgeable professor. The readings are always interesting and never overwhelming. I always looked forward to class, as it normally contained a pleasant balance of lecturing and student participation. I intend on studying IP, particularly copyright, in law school. So, taking this course was a treat. But I suspect that even someone with a cursory interesting in copyright, trademark, or patent, would find much to enjoy in this course.",
    "Professor Tang is awesome and definitely worth taking this class with. She's willing to meet one and one and always tries to make the material approachable and enjoyable. A great way to get a writing credit and learn about something new and totally different.",
    "I would say this course is a great introduction into intellectual property law. I would recommend this class to another student, especially one who is interested in the arts and law.",
    "This is a great class! You will learn all the nuances of IP law to impress your friends. You will read weird and ridiculous court cases that get people arguing in class. Discussions are fun and lively and Professor Tang is amazing. It's not very hard; weekly readings, a short reading response every other week and a final project. Highly recommend",
    "The syllabus was really clear and provided interesting variety. I really appreciated the opportunity to take this and believe it has given me greater insight as to whether I'd like to study this material professionally. Prof. Tang is really fashionable and really knows the material well, and is really engaging to debate the cases with."
