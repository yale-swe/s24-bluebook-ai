This was by far my favorite course - the instructors clearly chose the students for the section very thoughtfully and took every effort to have all students actively engaged in each session.",

   "comments": [
    "After completing the assignments, we discussed the process of each tool and their strengths and weaknesses and shared ideas from each of our experiences. It was a fantastic way to learn these tools!",
    "Each week was a new skill. This course was all about skills and solutions which is so different than other courses that only talk about problems and issues. The fact that we read\/ learned about a solution and then spent a week writing up our own solution helped in understanding the concepts so much more. Also, Bill and Amy are FABULOUS",
    "The tools that are taught are extremely useful.",
    "The tools were useful. I also liked that we analyzed the tools and discussed in which contexts they would be most appropriate.",
    "The roundtable style discussion and the constant critical lens through which we looked at all tools.",
    "I liked the way we learned a lot of different planning tools and discussed the pros and cons of each. It was helpful to think of the tools as a range of possible options, with different tools being optimal in different situations. Working through some of these tools\/models - individually or as a class - was helpful in illustrating this.",
    "Very practical skill that can be applied in many management positions. Liked that it can be used in large or small projects. LOVED that we got to work on a project of our choosing.",
    "The best aspects of this course are 1) the professors; 2) the course materials being learned - useful in application to real-world projects, but also in forcing you to thoroughly think about your project even if you don't use them; 3) in-class feedback on assignments: getting to see how your classmates have applied the tools in unique and interesting ways.",
    "Amy and Bill are an ideal professor team: balanced in knowledge, wide experience, different perspectives, and fun to listen to. The course provides specific ways to deal with conservation projects, especially at the planning phase, with high efficiency and effectiveness. I now know how the BINGOs--TNC, WWF, CI, WCS--establish project goals, create action plans, assess stakeholders, and manage resources. I feel I can and will apply these techniques and ways of organizing, prioritizing, and standardizing one's thinking to work with smaller conservation nonprofits."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly the only thing that really bothered me about this course was the timing. Losing 3 hours out of my Wednesday evenings really took a chunk out of my productive work time. I would much prefer to have this class offered during normal course hours.",
    "Would love to have gone on a field trip with Bill and Amy",
    "Perhaps it would be interesting to use more advanced tools, including software, so that we can obtain a more competitive edge.",
    "The time of this course (Wed evenings for 3 hours) I thought was not optimal for this kind of interactive class. Many people have low energy at this point in the week. I think the energy and engagement would have been higher if it were 2x a week or earlier in the day. Also, though it was helpful to discuss the assignments as a class after we did them, I would have appreciated getting some personal feedback as well. It feels strange having finished the course without really knowing how well I was understanding the material.",
    "It would be helpful to get a bit more clarity on which tools are still actively being used, which have fallen out of use, and which organizations endorse\/use\/stray away from each.",
    "Sometimes the discussion moved a bit slowly, with everyone sharing all their thoughts on all the models, rather than hitting the main points and then moving on.",
    "Suggestions: 1.The only thing I would add is to have a clearer outline of every step of the homework assignments. 2.It should be stressed in the beginning and as the class continues that one should stick with their original project unless they have several extra days to rework that section of the project.",
    "I think that it worked better when we did our assignments out of class and discussed them in class; the in-class assignments were also helpful but perhaps less useful because we weren't familiar with the proposed topic and thus spent more time debating elements on that.",
    "Timing of class--from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm--was difficult for some. I personally liked having a large chunk of time to delve deeper into certain tools without interruption. Personal preference."

    "Great course! Amy and Bill are the best resources at F&ES for conservation.",
    "It is definitely worth taking. I would recommend trying to come in with as strong a sense as possible of what types of tools you may gravitate towards and which will provide the most value. This can help you prioritize your time and really delve into those tools that will be most useful for you in your work in greater depth.",
    "Its an awesome course. Start applying now. Only take it if you are very serious about managing projects in the future. Give it your all from day one. Know it is going to be a lot of work so allocate your time suitably. Pick a project and stick to it!! :D",
    "First, absolutely take this course. Second, the weekly assignments are geared towards teaching you the tools you need for your final project; try to choose your final project topic early so that the homework assignments can be used for your final project. Third, the professors are very helpful giving individual feedback on homework - take advantage of this!",
