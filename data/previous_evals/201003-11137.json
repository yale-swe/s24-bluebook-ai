    "Yes.",
    "An exciting class for someone eager to explore relatively untrammeled ground - which is exactly what a good seminar should be.",
    "The course was less of an art history course, and more of an experimental foray into medieval thought. While we started from primary sources, we also examined how other scholars have attempted to deal with the concept of medieval light. It was an extremely thought-provoking course, and I would recommend it to another student."

    "Exposed me to basic and not so basic readings on light",
    "Thinking about light would add another dimension to the art of any period or genre, but seems especially pertinent to medieval manuscript illumination. My own work will benefit from the multitude of approaches discussed in class, such as thinking about the configuration and effects of medieval lighting conditions, how medieval philosophies of light affected how objects were understood in their own time, etc.",
    "By taking on the concept of \"light in the Middle Ages,\" our seminar discovered a widely unexamined, yet absolutely pervasive, unavoidable, and important topic. I know that for me, and I believe for other members of the seminar, the need to examine the role of light in many capacities is vital to moving towards an understanding of medieval art. I find it very difficult now not to think about the role of light in my other art historical work, which complicates everything."
