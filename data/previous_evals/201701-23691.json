    "I learned about different approaches to answering the question \"What is blackness?\" which is a question that we never answered as a class but was a question that I found valuable in framing all of our discussions. I learned about different dimensions of blackness in Latin America and the United Statesfactors regarding imperialism, music, dance, and so on. Perhaps one of the most valuable things I learned was how to evaluate these kinds of questions in an interdisciplinary waythrough deep histories, textual analyses, and sociological studies.",
    "- thinking diasporically about Blackness in a Latin American context - learning more about Latinx communities in the U.S. - navigating the complexities of how Blackness is embraced differently in different regions",
    "Expanded vision of blackness in Latinx and Latin America, interdisciplinary modes of thinking, ability to work with music, literature, and film in analysis, combining theory with primary sources, syllabus building.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale thus far. Professor Ramirez did an amazing job selecting challenging readings that spoke to and brought together various disciplines and scholars represented in the classroom. This course introduced me into rigorous texts outside my field. It pushed me to think of my own work in different and important ways, and provided the space to bring in work outside my discipline into my own research.",
    "This course was really interesting and filled in a major gap in my knowledge of global black history. I'd never studied a course related to Latin America before and I really enjoyed learning something completely new in such an engaged and vibrant class atmosphere.",
    "In this call I gained greater insight into the complex ways in which race and class operated (and still does) in Latin America and the Caribbean. We read, thought about, and discussed how those ideas of race conforms and does not conform when in the context of the United States. We were forced to critically analyze our own understanding of race and how that is shaped by our lives in the United States, our families backgrounds, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength is how broad and interdisciplinary the course material was. We started the class several hundreds of years ago in history and proceeded to the present, and it never felt like we were committing some kind of atrocity in doing so. This is in large part because the material we covered felt so emblematic of the themes we were exploring such that it rarely felt like we were missing something huge. Another strength is Dixa's facilitation of the discussion, which I found to be incredibly helpful. She posed amazing questions and forced us to think hard about concepts we hadn't considered before. There was one thing I felt could be improved. While I really appreciated Dixa's introduction of each week's materials to the class, I felt that at times the questions she posed at the beginning got lost because of how many questions and themes she introduced to us. Perhaps one thing that could be done is simply cutting the number of questions asked at the beginning or providing more of a roadmap for the discussion.",
    "strengths: - good size class - effective discussion format - interesting texts that lent themselves to nuanced discussions - good variety of disciplines represented in the readings - good engagement with contemporary issues points for improvement: - more literary and\/or other artistic texts - no weekly response papers - needed clearer instructions for assignments",
    "This was an excellent course - one of the best I have had the pleasure to take as a graduate student at Yale. We were constantly challenged to think critically in relation to not only the texts assigned but the broader themes and issues they were intertwined with.",
    "Strengths: syllabus assignment, assigned texts that span across disciplines, facilitated interdisciplinary discussions, expanded my understanding of how to work across academic fields, multimedia helps students stay engaged, weekly writing assignment facilitates more rigorous in-class discussion Weaknesses: There seemed to be a lot of confusion among classmates about the review assignment.",
    "Strengths - students across different disciplines within the humanities and social sciences. Readings reflected this diversity. Pushed me in ways that other courses have not. Weaknesses - None.",
    "Class discussion was well facilitated with the right amount of instructor steering and student-led discussion. The range of readings and resources was excellent. We sometimes didn't touch on all the readings in discussion but this happened rarely.",
    "I thought the readings assigned in this class were really great as were the students that made up the class. I think more discussion on how people of colors attempts at survival can still be read as anti-blackness would be an important aspect to discus and emphasize."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. The class will teach you how to think in interdisciplinary ways about blackness and how people have understood blackness across Latin America, in various times, and through various forms of media. If your main field of study is in the United States, it'll give you a good balance from a non-U.S. perspective on questions of blackness. If your main field of study is in Latin America, it'll give you a broader understanding of how blackness has differed across countries.",
    "Yes! This is a class that deals with material that I have yet to encounter in any other class.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Absolutely! There is no other class here at Yale like it. The focus on blackness from the perspectives of individuals in Latin America and Latinos in the U.S. is the first of its kind here at Yale, and extremely important for anyone concerned with race, identity, culture, colonialism, Latinidad, Afro-Latinidad, Gender, Sexuality. This course covers everything!",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and class discussion felt important and illuminating.",
    "Yes, I think this course was really good for getting students to think about race and class outside of a United States context as well as the way that race is a flexible enough category that changes depending on time and place."
