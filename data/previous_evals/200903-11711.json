    "No, Physics lab has been the least enjoyable lab course that I've taken at Yale. The labs wouldn't take much time, but you're forced to sit there and write a lab report filled with information that's in the manual anyway. Unfortunately, if you're reading this, you probably have to take this anyway.",
    "fairly painless.",
    "This is a typical physics lab course where you pretty much know what's going to happen but have to be really careful in collecting data. Some of the labs are long and annoying, but the reports are fairly easy to write up. Definitely try to get a good TA!",
    "Physics 165L was as good as a lab could get. Sometimes labs seemed long and pointless, but other times they were actually pretty interesting as you could physically visualize concepts we learned in class. There was not really any TA lecture before the labs, however, so it is a very independent learning experience. Having a good TA makes the experience much better.",
    "I took physics 165L because I am pre-med and needed a physics lab. If you are not pre-med, and you are not a physics major, I see no reason to take this course.",
    "I would recommend this lab. It goes great with the lecture as they cover the same things and help solidify your understanding. It's also not a lot of work in comparison to other labs. The quizzes aren't so awesome, but if you come to lab prepared they're not too bad.",
    "Terrible class, sorry you have to take it, sucks to be you.",
    "Physics 165 is not terribly difficult, the lab reports are short for the most part, and the experiments provide good insight into important concepts in basic physics that are a must for science majors.",
    "Each week requires a lab that takes about 2 hours. The lab reports are a page long. One of the biggest elements of the first semester is error propagation. Other topics cover everything from kinematics to fluid properties.",
    "This class would be boring to anyone with a background in physics labs. I had little experience in the past, so this is a good starting point for those looking to do more labs in the future. Only take this is you have to. I have heard that the upper level physics labs are more interesting.",
    "First of all, know how to do partial derivatives--error analysis, which takes up a significant part of this course, is easy if you've had calculus. Unfortunately, if you haven't had calculus, you'll have to learn partials on your own. While error is an important concept, too much of this lab was simply partials practice.Understand the concepts in the experiments before you go into lab: the quizzes assume you fully understand all the concepts you're about to use including rote memorization of formulas, etc.Pray you get a good TA-this makes all the difference as it always does in a science course at Yale. Sid and Alistair are willing to answer questions and you should feel free to approach them--they are eager for you to understand the concepts being taught and if you're TA isn't helpful, go to them.",
    "I would only recommend it if you have to take physics lab. It's a pretty good class, and you shouldn't really worry about having to do it, but I wouldn't go out of your way to take it.",
    "The first semester Physics lab covers aspects of Physics from newtonian mechanics to fluids. The structure of the class involves pop quizzes, lab reports, and a lab practical.I did not have a good opinion of this course UNTIL (surprisingly) the final practical. Here are my comments:-pop quizzes are needlessly stressful, and the focus is often unhelpful for the actual experiment. We are taking the lecture course, we don't need to be quizzed to death. The focus on many quizzes has been calculation of uncertainty--this is ridiculous. My suggestion is to limit the number of quizzes and announce them.-The lab reports had too much focus on uncertainty sometimes, and it is not formally taught. Not in lab and not in lecture.-I despise practicals. These are lab courses which are 0.5 credits. Practicals are very stressful during a time when we all have tests and papers. BUT: The practical, to my delight, was well crafted. It's focus was on mixing different concepts learned throughout the semester to achieve a goal. The focus, finally, was not on calculation of uncertainty. Rather, the focus was on the scientific process, and of using concepts learned. Kudos to the creator of the practical.That said, this lab was at times incredibly stressful. Calculation of uncertainty got very complicated. Reducing its importance would make this course less stressful. I thought the practical was incredibly fair, though students at the end of the week had an advantage. I hope grading in the end is generous--there's enough grade inflation in humanities and social science courses, and down grading science\/math people will only put us at a disadvantage.",
    "I would recommend Physics 165 lab - the experiments are enjoyable and demonstrate the general concepts of the physics lecture course.",
    "Great lab. One of the few I've taken at Yale that actually helped with understanding course material and didn't take over my life.",
    "Every experiment you were supposed to do in high school physics but it never really worked. Here, they work. The policy on lab reports is that the write-up should not exceed one page, which is great. Overall, far less painful than orgo lab, but nothing a bad TA can not ruin for you, so get lucky.",
    "take definitely with physics 150, a very easy lab",
    "*sigh*You probably have to take it, right?",
    "clearly, people only take this lab because they have to. it's not fun, but it's much less tedious than other intro labs like MCDB 121 and CHEM 119.",
    "Phys 165 is a very good and fun physics lab. I would recommend it to a fellow student who is premed. The course was an easy way to learn basic physics principles.",
    "Take this only if you have to. If you're looking for a fun and exciting lab experience, this isn't really the class to take.",
    "Again, only if you have to take it....",
    "The fall semester of the lab kind of sucks. It involves taking many boring measurements with meter sticks, timers, balances, and devices attached to computers. While in theory you're supposed to be able to take all your data, do all your calculations, and write a commentary on what you're doing in your lab book in 3 hours, in reality there's often barely enough time just to take the data, and adding in the rest of the stuff in addition to doing a 1-page lab report can take at least 5 hours outside of class. (Still, this is less work than a chem lab.) Also, there are quizzes on the instructions which are unreasonably hard and test on extremely minute details--it's not enough just to read them before the lab, you have to memorize everything they say, and there's a really hard practical at the end which counts for more if your TA is an easy grader. Some of this might be changed by next year though--Rick Casten says he's implementing reforms. I took the spring semester (E&M part) first and the experiments were more interesting and more manageable time-wise, but consider substituting 205\/206 instead.",
    "If required.",
    "The final for this class is terrible, but the labs are manageable. Sometimes I questioned myself as to how applicable or necessary the labs really were for a conceptual understanding of what was taught in physics lecture. But since it is a premed requirement, it is something that I needed to take. Otherwise I would not have taken this class.",
    "It's a relatively easy lab (no lab reports!), even with the tediousness of calculating uncertainties (using partial derivatives)...until the final. Yes, there is a final and it was HARD. But no worries, they curve it and things should come out ok. Definitely a \"take it only if you must\" course though.",
    "Most likely, you don't have a choice. But if you did, it's not a bad class to take. It may seem a bit dull at first, but it does become more interesting, and you can do a lot of hands-on learning. The grading isn't bad, but it depends on the TA (though it's curved at the end). The quizzes were fair. The only problem was that the final was a bit rough. However, it was also kinda fun, and since there's a curve, it shouldn't be too bad.",
    "I would recommend this class as a supplement to 150. The experiments helped solidify some of concepts that you learn from the lecture. Though the experiments are sometimes a bit tedious, the work outside of class is not that much as you finish your lab notes and write a one page addendum. The lab practical is challenging so try to really know your concepts and how they may be incorporated together in experiments.",
    "Not an overly taxing lab experience. Not an overly exciting one either. A solid introductory physics lab course nonetheless.",
    "I would recommend the class if you have to take it. The workload is manageable compared to other science labs.",
    "It was ok. It was really easy. I think it was easy for a lot of people in the class. It wasn't curved and with 40% of your grade as homework and clickers, it was fine. I think it might be easier than 150. I didn't learn too much more physics than high school though.",
    "I did not like this course at all. The workload was WAY too high as a result of the variation in grading among TAs. My TA graded extremely hard, and while the grades are equalized across sections, having a hard grader in a class with a bunch of premeds just means everybody in that sections works 2-3x harder than other sections to get an A. Terrible system, and ridiculous that this is 0.5 credits. The experiments were uninteresting as well.",
    "You should only take this course if you need it for premed prereqs, or your major.",
    "I mean... take it if you have to",
    "Take it if you have to. Study for the quizzes - they will require a lot of memorization and you will need to recall all formulas introduced. Also, learn uncertainties as early as possible, as they will repeatedly be used.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "good",
    "I would only recommend taking it if it is required.",
    "It's pretty painless, but don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Well, if you're taking Physics lab, you probably have to. My best advice is just to gut it through. You basically have 10 labs, somewhere around 8 quizzes, and addendums. The course is ok, but the practical final does suck. Make sure you know how to calculate uncertainties. I would recommend taking the lecture course and the lab together, because I didn't and felt that it was a little more difficult.",
    "This lab is very relaxed. It's an easy credit, and probably a lot easier than taking 205 or whatever the more advanced lab is. Lab reports are very short and don't take much time.",
    "It's not a horrible lab. I liked it better than orgo lab. They're pretty long though, usually.",
    "This lab was a good overview of the practical applications of physics as an experimental science. It was mostly about the concepts and historical experiments. Its strength was to try and make us independent, more creative thinkers (especially with the lab practical). The major weaknesses are old equipment (which led to us not really proving certain laws) and the experiments not being presented in conjunction with actual class material (though that is hard to coordinate when both 150 and 180 students take the class).",
    "Terrible class. You basically have to teach yourself.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Pre-med requirement. The labs are kinda boring but the writeups are really easy to do and don't take much time. The practical was impossible to prepare for and really puzzling.",
    "If you have to do it, it isnt any worse than any other lab, and your lab reports are only a page which makes it less painful.",
    "I would only recommend the physics lab if it is required for a major. The lab is three hours each week, and most of the time you will spend the entire three hours in lab.",
    "Lab sessions are long and tedious. Be prepared by reading the handouts and doing as much as you can at home before going to class. Be prepared for the quizzes by reading the handouts thoroughly.",
    "PHYS 165L is a pretty standard lab course. The workload isn't terrible but doing the labs and addenda each week gets pretty tedious. The experiments themselves are also not that exciting but you do learn a lot about error propagation. The practical was unexpectedly more complicated and out-of-the-blue but it's doable. Don't take this unless you have to, but even if you do have to, it's not a huge burden.",
    "YES! Labs are so much fun when you have a good lab partner and TA. Workload is not too heavy, although you absolutely have to read the labs before every session, otherwise you would 1. not be able to do the quiz (if there is one) and 2. feel lost throughout the entire lab session. I'm not quite sure how the grading works though, I believe each class is curved, and that might or might not work to your advantage. The practical exam can also be really tricky.",
    "Take it if required.",
    "Experimental physics is by no means a pleasant area of study. But I think the instructors have taken strides (save for the scary quizzes\/practical exam) to make it as pleasant as possible. And it definitely helps (moreso than in chem\/bio labs in my opinion) with learning the subject matter also.",
    "It's not a horrible lab. The quizzes are really difficult.",
    "Sure, if you have to. Based on what I've heard about Physics 205, this class will correlate more with what you are learning in Physics, even if you're taking Physics 200. It's minimal work (read up on the upcoming lab, do the lab, do a quick one page write-up) and it helps reinforce and introduce certain concepts you encounter in lecture.",
    "It's something you have to take, if you're pre-med in particular. Study for those quizzes, and take your TA's advice on the lab reports, because they will affect your grade. Some of the experiments are fun, some are tedious, but pay attention because the final is actually pretty difficult.",
    "It's alot of cramming to finih f you leave it to the last minute because it's simple but there's often alot to write. I'd recommend answering all o te questions in lab because backtracking is awful and sometimes impossible. The final exam is also the sinker separator and the final is awful. It tests knowledge of physcs in general, bother skills that you've leaned in lab,,,",
    "Do not take this lab unless you absolutely have to. If you can take it somewhere else, I would advise doing that. It was much harder than it had to be and the final practical was impossible. You will not enjoy this lab at all.",
    "Only if you have to take it, obviously.",
    "This course was a good introductory mechanics lab -- not too difficult, and was very helpful in understanding the concepts we learned in class. It's not too much work, but if you can answer some of the questions or do some of the error propagation during class, that will save you a lot of time later when you're doing your report. Also, you do have to study for the quizzes, particularly some of the later ones, otherwise it's easy to make mistakes.",
    "Ehh, take it if you need to. Not that great.",
    "This course covers a lot of material, however if you've taken AP Physics you might want to jump to a higher lab. With no real physics background before I found some parts very difficult at the beginning but after awhile I got the hang of it.",
    "I would recommend Physics 165 Lab to any student who is interested in the field of physics or science in general. The topics covered are quite interesting. However the final practical exam does take extra preparation. I found the course to be challenging but rewarding because there is alot to be learned.",
    "Take it only if you have to. The work was excessive and the experiments weren't particularly enlightening all the time. The practical also was painful and annoying. Your experience will vary the most by TA though. Mine at least made it bearable.",
    "I thought physics lab was a good lab. Several of our experiments really helped me understand the topics in lecture better (although a few were a little difficult when we started those before we covered them in lecture). I really loved the way the lab reports were set up. The fact that most of it was done in class freed up a lot of time outside of lab without taking out any of the time devoted to understanding the concepts. Report wise, it was the best lab I've ever taken. In most of the other labs, you have to rewrite the entire intro and procedure in detail, which I feel is both tedious and time consuming, without adding any knowledge. The reports for this lab were perfect. I think my biggest complaint would be the weekly quizzes. I understand the need for them; however, many of the questions seemed designed to just make us memorize formulas from the handouts. We did not need the formulas memorized for the lab while we were doing it because we had the handouts, and for the actual class we were allowed a sheet of formulas, so memorizing them seemed pointless.",
    "Physics 165 is not too time-consuming, and it helps reinforce the concepts that you learn in class.",
    "I personally enjoy chemistry labs better, and really only took Physics 165L to satisfy pre-medical requirements. It does help understand some parts of Physics 150 better though, so taking the two classes in conjunction worked well.",
    "This course basically covers basic stuff (measuring g, calculating moment of inertia, etc). The concepts themselves are pretty straightforward and not hard to understand, but the lab reports are annoying. Moreover, the grading of the lab reports seems to be arbitrary (except for the weekly quizzes). The TAs are usually helpful during the lab session. The final exam is not too bad, but the grading for that also seems pretty arbitrary. Overall, a below average course at Yale, but a necessary evil, esp for pre med kids. If you're interested in physics, you should take the phys205L, 206L, which I hear don't require any lab reports.",
    "Physics 165 is an introductory lab for mechanics. I would recommend Physics 165 for the purposes of gaining practical laboratory experience and a foundation for a career in the sciences."
