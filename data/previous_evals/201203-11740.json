    "I was really sad to leave class on the last day. We had a small class of great musicians and enjoyed a wonderful journey through the harmonic and formal development of romantic music in the 19th century. Starting with the simple chromaticism of the late classical era, we went through increasingly complex harmony patterns, ending with an introduction to octatonicism and serialism. In terms of musical form, we studied sonata-allegro form at length, then touched upon Lieder, song cycles, and opera. The difficulty of this class seems to vary from semester to semester, probably more so than the quality of modern compositions, so I would not enter the course expecting it to be easy or hard. In my semester, it was relatively light in terms of workload, with the exception of two model compositions and a paper that can eat up a ton of your time. Reena is the coolest teacher I've ever had, and definitely try to take it with her if she teaches again. She recognizes that musical analysis, even in its theoretical aspects, is as much of an art as is musical performance, and does not try to push one way of analyzing a piece upon you. In fact, you realize that the rich array of interpretations at many different levels is a beautiful dimension of musical analysis. I think it helps that she is foremost a composer rather than a theoretician, so she is more focused on what the composer wishes to express rather than how to impress the rest of the music community with a fancy, lofty interpretation. We also had our model compositions performed and recorded by skilled musicians.",
    "I definitely recommend Music 211 to another student. After having taken both 205 and 210, I finally got a taste of \"breaking the rules,\" so to say, as we learned about modal mixture and the implementation of dissonances into the harmonic framework. The assignments were interesting, and having the opportunity to write a nocturne in the style of Chopin as the final project was a lot of fun (even if time-consuming). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I would hope others find it the same.",
    "I'd recommend this course to any advanced music theory student looking to further his\/her knowledge of theory and history. It's also a great way to meet other students who have backgrounds in theory\/composition.",
    "Music 211 is an overview of transitional theory between classical and romantic music as well as romantic theory. I would definitely recommend it to another student. We finally get to analyze cool music. I now have a much greater appreciation for Schubert, a greater understanding of hemiola, and I know what fauxbourdon is.",
    "211 is a really fun course if you like music theory. Many of the assignments involve writing musical examples of things we've learned, usually in the context of a composition rather than rote repetition. I particularly liked being exposed to Lied, something I wouldn't have otherwise had any reason to listen to, but really enjoyed. Great class.",
    "Great class, far better than 210. It's a prereq for the major but you should take it even if you bypass it. You learn about lots of . The grad students who teach it shuffle around each term, so you might get a different instructor. If you see this being taught by Jonathan Guez or Reena Esmail, take it, because they're both awesome."
