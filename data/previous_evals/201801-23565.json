    "I learned a lot about the legal justifications and mechanisms for zoning and local land use law.",
    "I learned a great deal about land use law cases and zoning.",
    "I learned how zoning can impact all aspects of a real estate transaction. More specifically, the means by which developers, law makers and private property owners go about making real estate decisions and the implications of those decisions.",
    "A great overview of land use law! Opportunity to delve deeply into specific topics relating to climate adaptation and resilience as well as the basics of land use law.",
    "I learned how to read cases, which is a valuable skill. I also learned about the planning and zoning process, and how to think about land use from a combined legal and environmental perspective.",
    "Land use planning and law concepts, municipal-level decision making and planning, how the \"sausage is made\" so to speak, tactics for implementing environmental policy, barriers to effective local-level implementation",
    "Too many to list. I think I learned something every class from the professor and the subsequent student discussions.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the principles and structure of land use law and regulation in the United States, as well as improving some of my abilities to critically read legal case summaries and brief cases.",
    "I developed a foundational knowledge of how the legislative process leading to zoning works, both in an ideal and real sense. I now understand some of the challenges and developing tools that surround these regulatory processes.",
    "I learned a lot about zoning, land use law and how to think like the system to preserve the environment.",
    "Fundamental familiarity with legal processes, case law, etc. related to land use; how to read and brief a case (for the legally interested non-lawyer in me); knowledge of what zoning is, its history, how it actually works, what kinds of things states and municipalities are enabled (or prohibited) from doing related to land use. I also found my final paper very interesting to research, and learned a lot from that experience.",
    "This course provided me with a better understanding of the legal tools relevant to land use challenges. It was very helpful in bridging the gap between understanding what the possible solutions are for dealing with these challenges and how these actually happen legally.",
    "Understanding of the legal complexities of land use law.",
    "I learned how to read legal cases and zoning laws.",
    "understanding what future clients don't know about the law",
    "land use law in the USA was explored. This is an area I observed many people lack information on."

    "It aligned perfectly with my expectations. This course kept a steady pace and instilled a lot of useful knowledge about land use law.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: It felt the course was a little disorganized at times, partly because of time constraints. Slide show presentations at the beginning of the class providing a general overview could've helped, especially w.r.t taking notes.",
    "I loved the class and the content. I just wish the textbook had been a bit less expensive, though I know that there isn't necessarily anything that can be done there. It was also a really good level of difficulty for having no legal background.",
    "As mentioned, I didn't feel like I had a strong enough law background and Marjorie often presented information very quickly and without powerpoint or visuals, so it was hard to follow.",
    "Strength: Students were allowed to speak freely on any topic. Weakness: Only a handful of students regularly participated. Area of improvement: Perhaps, having student centered discussions would increase participation. For example, on alternating class sessions, one student will lead the discussion on the course topic at hand rather than the professor.",
    "should be less focused specifically on cases and less time in class should be spent going over specific cases. rather, it would be useful to more broadly speak about environmental policies and how they came to be",
    "Strengths: a very manageable reading list, with a great variety of cases. Marjorie has lots of great experiences to draw from, which always keeps classes interesting.",
    "There was a bit of a learning curve for me in this class, since i had not previously engaged with this type of material. Therefore, I felt a bit lost at the beginning until I got my footing. The learning environment was supportive, though, and the material built on itself in a logical way.",
    "The guest lecturers were very helpful - I greatly enjoyed their visit. More of these would have been helpful. I enjoyed when Marjorie told us about cases she was currently on, it really helped give context to the concepts I was learning. Perhaps one or two case studies as a class provide more of this type of learning.",
    "There was a ton of reading, which was difficult, but that's also why the class was so effective at inducing learning. I took a class in the School of Management this semester as well, and that professor required lots of reading. However, each week a small group of students were assigned the readings for that week and tasked with leading the discussion. While every student was expected to do some reading each week and participate in the discussion, the budget of doing all the readings and providing insights was rotated among small groups of students each week. This might be a useful tool to consider implementing in this class as well. Participation grading would be a way of encouraging every student to do at least some of the reading each week, which is already part of the class, but it might be a way of more evenly distributing class participation. Just something to consider.",
    "The class was really enjoyable to be a part of, the professor was kind and had great candor and a very positive approach to the learning opportunity. The class could have been improved by placing more emphasis on the structure of the lectures. Some were well put together and clearly thought out, but some were hard to follow and seemingly unstructured.",
    "The class itself was as strong as the participation on any given day. The text was expensive, but it is a new edition. With any luck the price will drop in succeeding years.",
    "Honestly, I think this course is perfect as is. I don't think it has any weaknesses nor could it be improved.",
    "The strengths include Marjorie's teaching style, which is open-ended while making sure that each class session communicates certain key concepts. Another: that Marjorie teaches law to non-lawyers, getting them familiar with the structure of a law class without a lot of the pretentious baggage that seems to attend such affairs. She's very down to earth and yet she knows her material really well. I think one thing that could improve the course would be offering a fact sheet or a few fact sheets on the concepts so that people had a succinct reference for some of the more technical questions that, by March, we really should have known down pat. I took careful notes but never wrote these up in a succinct way--and wish I had (or wish that someone else had, perhaps as their final project for future semesters' use). I also sometimes thought that certain students in the class spoke a lot (and at tangents to the material); Marjorie generally tolerated these interruptions, but on occasion these diversions were counterproductive to getting through the material (and not really relevant for most of us). So, figuring out a good way to both answer students' questions and move things along (to \"gently table\" students' questions) might help things.",
    "A major strength of this class is that it is based on learning very applicable and practical knowledge. The class has a great flow throughout the semester. It is also designed well to be taught to people with a law background and without one. I think it could be improved through the use of more powerpoints as we discuss cases - even just a few summary slides of the main points would be helpful just in case non lawyers missed a key point in the discussion.",
    "Professor Shansky is a very talented teacher and one of the course strengths is her real-world professional experience. One of the weaknesses was the legal jargon - was a little hard to keep up as a non-lawyer.",
    "This course gave me a solid understanding of general land use law but could be focused more specifically on environmental issues. I would've loved to learn more about climate change adaptation.",
    "stick closer to the syllabus and cover more cases"

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend if interested in local zoning law- primarily US context.",
    "Be prepared to read legal cases and discuss them in class. Do not get overwhelmed if you have never taken a law course before. Marjorie really does a great job of explaining the cases and leading students to the important aspects of the rulings.",
    "If you're interested in land use issues, take it! No other class at FES covers this material and it's really valuable. I think this will be really useful in my work post FES.",
    "I would say that Marjorie is one of the kindest educators I have ever met but that you need to do law background research to understand what is happening.",
    "Take this class if you are looking for an introduction to land use law - no introduction to law is required. Great for people interested in urban and land use planning, climate adaptation, and resilience.",
    "I would advise anyone to take this class who is interested in thinking about how and why land is used in different ways based on location, values, law, and politics.",
    "Take it! Don't be intimidated by it being a law class if you are not a lawyer. Marjorie makes sure everyone is following along. Just make sure to do your readings or you won't learn a thing!",
    "Adequately budget your time each week to get the readings done early and try to participate in discussions as much as possible.",
    "Great class, but don't expect to simply go to lecture and learn the material, you will need to do your reading and stay abreast of the discussion to get something useful out of the class.",
    "There was one student who organized all of the case briefings into an excel format. This was very wise.",
    "Feel free to ask a lot of questions, Marjorie is an open textbook and full of knowledge.",
    "Try reading some of the cases and make sure you enjoy these (or at least find value in some of them) before taking the course; virtually the entire workload is reading through the cases before each session. I also recommend working on your final project as early as possible, because Marjorie could probably provide really good feedback on these--that I don't think I really got because I waited until too late in the semester to write up my first draft.",
    "Great course if you are interested in land use! Do the readings every week. You will get much more out of the class if you do and very little if you don't.",
    "if you've previously taken land use law, it's very similar. it helps a law student see what nonlaw students don't know about legal issues."
