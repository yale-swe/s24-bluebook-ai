   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "a lot of homework at the beginning without a lot of support... onramp wasnt enough to be able to navigate the course easily. later, a lot of code was provided which helped a lot with data analysis, but then didnt learn as much about coding. tricky balance to strike, and it was really helpful to go through a lot of it with the TAs. also modules were generally interesting and it was cool learning about diverse areas of research from the people performing it and analyzing real data sets!!",
    "Strengths: well-designed homework, different modules Weaknesses: Lecture nodes",
    "I thought that the ability to have a mix of new and also repeated (from years past) projects was nice and diverse but the new projects though engaging were difficult to follow instruction on. Having clearer communication of expectations (even if the project may be open ended) would be helpful. There was also significantly more work for this course than any of my others which made it very taxing and I didnt know if more work really meant more benefit.",
    "Course needs more organization in terms of what is taught and how it is presented. Everything felt chaotic. Class may be easier to teach in Python.",
    "Strengths: It featured a wide variety of interesting topics with good introductions to how research is done on them. Weaknesses: I never felt very well connected with the rest of the class, but I think this could only be fixed by having class more often. I don't think it is necessarily a good idea to make projects into group projects given that each student should learn as much programming as possible from this course because for many it is the only avenue to it.",
    "strength: many new information. TAs are really helpful.",
    "Strengths: great TAs! very useful in class and out of class sessions - these were by far the most helpful parts of the course! hands on modules - I often found that what confused me in the lectures were clarified by doing the assignment perfect amount of time for completing assignments skeleton code was useful for learning how to do useful things in matlab in a short amount of time, without starting from ground 0 Weaknesses: Would have liked to learn to how use pymol in addition to first glance"

   "comments": [
    "yes, with the caveat that it was a lot of work and might be frustrating, especially without matlab experience",
    "Yes, learn about how to build models for biological problems.",
    "Yes. It was a good primer into many different fields of research I may not have discovered by taking just classes in my department. In the long run the work was worth it.",
    "Yes, PEB is friggin awesome",
    "Most definitely, it was a very interesting course that has a lot to offer.",
    "Strongly recommend. I can think about the question from a different view after taking this course.",
    "Yes definitely! Excellent for getting an overview of PEB research, and in learning relevant coding skills."
