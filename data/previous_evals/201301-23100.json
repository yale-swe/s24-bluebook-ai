    "I would summarize French 231 as an exploration of Quebec culture. Professor Cayer seemed intent on giving us background of Canadian history, literature, as well as music culture, and even current events, a combination that was very well-rounded.",
    "Yes, without hesitation. You won't often have the chance to learn about this region and read French-Canadian literature. Prof. Cayer does an excellent job including some background information (you don't need to know anything about Canadian history or culture going in) and gives lots of individual attention to his students. Assignments were creative and gave lots students plenty of freedom to choose their own topic.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Cayer is a great instructor, which only makes his already impressive syllabus even stronger. This course is great in that it is unique in the French department's offerings. The global regions on which the French department's courses focus are typically France, North Africa (history of French colonization), and the Caribbean (history French colonization). One of the major francophone regions - Quebec and Canada - are very rarely the focus of courses in the department due to the faculty's current areas of expertise. I knew I wanted to take this course when I first saw it listed last summer, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations.",
    "Un survol de la litt\u00c3\u00a9rature qu\u00c3\u00a9b\u00c3\u00a9coise fran\u00c3\u00a7aise des XXe et XXIe si\u00c3\u00a8cles, touchant sur plusieurs th\u00c3\u00a8mes et courants dans la litt\u00c3\u00a9rature qu\u00c3\u00a9b\u00c3\u00a9coise. Prof. Cayer conna\u00c3\u00aet bien le sujet et est enthousiaste en classe, mais parfois le cours sentait un peu comme un cours de conf\u00c3\u00a9rence au lieu d'un s\u00c3\u00a9minaire.",
    "Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to keep up their French skills. Also highly recommend it to anyone interested in American studies because Quebec's culture offers a unique perspective on the United States."
