   "comments": [
    "Basically nothing that I didn't teach myself (the textbook is called \"Teach Yourself Hindi\" for a reason). I did learn some from Seema ji's classes, but I found that I often had to un-learn what Swapna ji taught because she wouldn't understand the valid questions I asked and would often explain the grammar for a completely different concept. I guess my patience increased.",
    "This class continues the teaching in Hindi 110, and branches out in showing more of Indian culture, figures of speech, colloquialisms, etc, while learning more of different verb conjugations.",
    "My ability to learn another language (Hindi)",
    "A very good continuation of L1. More of an emphasis on listening comprehension and speaking this term, which I thought was appropriate.",
    "My Hindi definitely vastly improved during this L2 course, owing not only to further practice with the language but also to individualized feedback from the instructors and being encouraged to participate in a Hindi Debate.",
    "I really really enjoyed this course Hindi is such a beautiful language, and this class really did feel like a step up from L1. I think my listening comprehension skills, especially, grew immensely when Reeta-Ji told stories during our weekly conversation sections, I found myself understanding more and more. I also LOVED participating in the Hindi debate; it felt like my language skills really were becoming applicable, not just to everyday conversation, but to the discussion of more philosophical, complex, and politically urgent topics.",
    "Developed a more complete understanding of and command over Hindi",
    "I developed as a beginner Hindi learner and mostly used Hindi 110 as a foundation to build and strengthen skills, learning new grammar but now focusing more on being able to formulate whole ideas in writing and speaking.",
    "I learned basic Hindi grammar and vocabulary, and I learned to apply this to real-life usages of the Hindi language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "So disorganized",
    "Strengths: Seema ji's crystal-clear explanations and willingness to answer any and all student questions\/concerns. If you have a question, ask Seema ji. It will be answered to your satisfaction, and if it isn't, she is really good about letting you ask again so she can further clarify. Weaknesses: no lesson plan, daily homework is announced with typos at 8pm the night before it's due, seemingly arbitary quizzes, the TA, the unclear grading mechanism (seems to be based on favoritism only), the level of professor engagement (extremely low for Swapna ji...), the fact that Swapna ji spent extensive amount of time on stories about monkeys\/poems that were indecipherable to a L2 class and also taught us NOTHING about the grammar that would be on the weekly quiz, the dialogues which were nothing but reading and memorization practice (they were presented in such a way that they taught us nothing about the grammar, which is obviously the focus of an L1\/L2 class...), everything except the strength of the course is a weakness",
    "Pros: Teachers are extremely skilled, and very invested in helping you learn Hindi. the class is very chill, with a weekly friday quiz, a midterm skit, and a final Hindi magazine creation project. Grading is forgiving, and the class time is only 50min\/day. Cons: As a student without any Hindi experience, expect a sharp, sometimes frustrating, learning curve. In addition, the class meets every day, so expect to carve out a chunk of each day, but fortunately it has two daily sections you can alternate between.",
    "Very Good course. They provide you with all of the necessary tools to succeed and develop Hindi speaking skills.",
    "I think the course is run very well. I don't have any major suggestions for changes.",
    "A huge strength of this course were the weekly vocab quizzes, which we didn't have in L1; I felt as though they really expanded the bounds of my language learning, and our usage of the words in various contexts throughout the week was super helpful. I did think that the course could have been a little more organized at times; often, when the time came for our end-of-the-week quizzes, there was a lot of confusion about what we were supposed to know; and I felt like we lingered for an inordinately long time on two chapters in the Complete Hindi book. But overall, it was a wonderful learning experience, so no serious complaints.",
    "Strengths: very strong interpersonal interactions with teachers and classmates Weaknesses: not particularly structured or planned out",
    "As compared with other courses, it is a little disorganized, but sometimes that is bound to happen with two professors-- but I am not bashing this setup, both professors are wonderful. It would be easier for students to keep track of (and complete) assignments if they were always reliably posted online.",
    "I absolutely loved how close-knit our class became, and how we work together as a class. The class could be better organized so we know exactly what will be covered each week."

   "comments": [
    "no",
    "Absolutely not. You are significantly better off taking a more challening but better organized language course in which you may actually learn something. The class is so poorly organized and not remotely facilitated to enhance student learning. You will almost never get a straight answer to a question (unless you ask Seema ji). Good luck learning anything from the TA or Swapna ji.",
    "L2 was a fun class. The professors are very friendly and care about your language proficiency. The workload is doable, even with weekly quizzes. I would recommended Hindi if you're looking for a fun language to learn.",
    "Overall, this course is a fantastic way to learn the Hindi Language and associated culture. My only qualm is that the instructors speak very quickly in Hindi, which make them somewhat hard to understand.",
    "Yes but only if you are interested in learning another language.",
    "Hindi is a great language, and Seemaji and Swapnaji are great professors. If you want to learn Hindi, take this course.",
    "Yes, definitely! This is a great language credit with manageable work and amazing instructors who really care about your learning.",
    "Definitely take it this is the level of Hindi when you really learn how much it can differ, in its grammatical structure, idioms, and word order, from English. That's an intellectual challenge worth giving yourself, and in my opinion the most valuable part of learning another language.",
    "Yes, Seemaji and Swapnaji are fantastic teachers and will help you to develop a strong grasp of Hindi if you are truly passionate about it.",
    "I would recommend this course for a number of reasons. If Hindi is taught as your university, why not take it. You would take this course if you do not have much prior exposure, of course, because it follows after L1. But all the more reason to continue and begin immersing yourself in the language. My Hindi has significantly improved since last semester because of L2.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student! I loved this class, and this class would be perfect for any student interested in learning Hindi."
