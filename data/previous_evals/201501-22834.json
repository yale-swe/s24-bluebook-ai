    "I really enjoyed this class. It was a lot of work, but you get out of the class what you put into it. Professor Barron is a great lecturer, and he is clearly passionate about the topic. He makes himself available for office hours every day, so if you do not understand a concept, he is very willing to explain it to you one-on-one. The subject is also just very interesting. People from many different fields take this class, and it helped me think of the world with a new perspective."
