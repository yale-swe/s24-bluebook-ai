    "Read over responses about Nicole Clay and overall course assessment. This was one of my favorite classes when taught by Ronal Breaker and Don Engelman. As soon as Nicole Clay took over it rapidly degenerated to my worst class. Take it if you must, otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",
    "This class was... okay. It's a struggle bus the whole way through. But let me guess why you're reading this eval. You probably want to know about the revered Prof Clay. Well, I am so glad you asked!Let me tell you about Professor Clay. Let me explain in numbered format.1. WOAH arrows EVERYWHERE on her PPT slides. What just happened? Mind explosion!!!2. She lets us out of class ten min early because there really isn't that much too biochemistry, right!?3. She starts class five minutes early every day because, hay, it's biochem so WHY NOT!4. Prof Clay doesn't really know how to explain things clearly.5. She thinks it's okay to torture us and make us memorize COENZYME STRUCTURES for her exams. When I first saw that question, my reaction was: \"I'm gunna pop some tags.\" So I just spent the rest of the test singing Macklemore to myself because there was no way that anything else was going to get me through it.6. Everyday was a constant mind trip of sorts through her PPT slides. It just kinda... happened. And then it was over. REALLY QUICKLY.7. Dear Yale, I am not going to tell you to fire this professor. But let's just say that y'all better get her out of the classroom REAL FAST because we students deserve better. We really do. We really try. So let's make it happen.",
    "Prof. Clay is awful--don't go to lecture during her half of the class. You'll learn enough from her slides and the textbook, and you'll avoid getting confused in class by her awful lectures.",
    "This biochem series should only be taken if you have time in your schedule to devote to studying IMMEDIATELY after class and studying two weeks before every exam.",
    "I would recommend the course. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the material.",
    "I should've listened to last year's evaluations. Listen to me, if Nicole Clay is teaching is course--DO NOT TAKE IT. I REPEAT, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF NICOLE CLAY IS TEACHING IT. She will make your life miserable.Good things - four noncumulative tests are very manageable, no psetsRonald Breaker begins the course introducing ideas in such a well structured, understandable way that it almost makes you feel excited to learn about the material (mostly proteins and DNA and RNA synthesis and replication). He taught the material in a way that I could follow, and I knew exactly what he thought were the most important aspects. It's so good, and during this time, I was wondering, \"hm, why do people say this course is so bad?\"Don Engelman then takes over to teach about membrane biology mostly. His test questions are kind of ambiguous, but over, he was a pretty good instructor.Then Nicole Clay swoops in and you finally understand why people say that this class sucks. She turns this course from the principles of biochemistry into memorizing the citric acid cycle, glycolysis, the glyoxylate cycle, the electron transport chain, the urea cycle, etc, etc, so on and so forth---all of the intermediates, the enzymes, the coenzymes, the number of ATP and NAD, the location, the regulation, the names, the structures. If you've already exhausted your short term memory, you're not gonna have a good time. Her lectures are unstructured, and her ideas cannot be followed by any logical human being. She jumps around constantly in her lectures and follows ridiculous tangents and never clues you in on what she actually thinks is important.From what I can tell, this course is more straightforward than the MB&B version, where the tests are mostly looking at experimental data and analyzing it.With all that said, if you want to take biochem in a semester, it's definitely doable (though the class probably went from 100 down to 55 people at the end).",
    "The first part of this class was actually great - I was just taking biochem to fulfill a premed requirement, but actually found the material taught by Professors Breaker and Engelman to be really interesting! They were both good professors, especially Breaker - he is one of the best teachers I've ever had. His ability to explain things, and his caring for students, was incredible. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying biochem (never would have expected that). That quickly changed with Nicole Clay. She is one of, if not the, worst teachers I've had. Most of us were completely lost - she just throws details at you and expects you to memorize impossible levels of information, and you have no idea what you're actually learning. She alsois completely unavailable and doesn't seem to care about her students at all. Luckily, the TA's were AWESOME and got us through the class. I had Andy Kuo and he was absolutely incredible. Great at explaining, always available and willing to go the extra mile to help. Hopefully they will listen to students complaints for the second year in a row and change instructors. Then it would be a great course!! But if they don't, I would seriously consider MB&B. Oh, and the class is 4 non-cumulative exams, which is great for a science class!",
    "Try not to memorize. Try to instead recognize patterns and make connections.",
    "This is absolutely fascinating, very exciting material, but the nature of the course (short, dense, split between professors with extremely different styles) makes it quite a sprint--and the four midterms means it never really lets up.Note: I may have been one of the few, but I really thought Prof. Clay was great. If you're willing to look at what she's laying out in the slides, her thematic links (rather than bulk memorization) make a lot of sense.",
    "Biochemistry was an overall essential course to the understanding of human biology. The material is tough, but it has helped me fill in so many gaps to the way organisms tick. I think the course could benefit from more frequent assessments than just the 4 exams and given the difficult nature of the class, outside assignments and additional evaluations could help students perform better in the class. The organization of the metabolism lectures is confusing and needs revision, but all three professors were actually quite enjoyable. Nicole Clay should be commended: she really worked hard at fixing a lot of the issues past years raised about her teaching style. There is some work still to be done, but don't be too intimidated. The metabolism exams are semi-brutal, but the best strategy is simply to memorize all metabolites. This seems impossible, but this advice will make sense after the first metabolism exam. Don't freak out about this course vs. the MBB course: if this one works better in your schedule,just take\/shop it. It wasn't the end of the world and the lecturers have worked hard to improve the course.",
    "If you need to take biochemistry, I",
    "Make sure you have a solid foundation before taking this course",
    "The class is pretty good. I dislike the decrease of reliance on concepts as the class progresses and the memorization at the end is not effective for learning.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Ronald Breaker is a wonderful professor! He was very organized and clearly passionate for the subject. It was one of my favorite classes this semester until Professor Clay began teaching. She was not very organized and liked to teach things backwards (as in, teach the end of a process first before teaching the beginning) which made understanding very difficult. Her exams were also very picky and not concept focused. She would ask you to draw out specific intermediates in a reaction.",
    "Don't take this class. If at all possible, take the first semester of the MB&B version. The problem with this class is that it moves too fast and doesn't have any assessments. So if you're going to take it, you really have to keep up with the material on your own.",
    "I would not recommend this course. While Ron Breaker is fantastic, Nicole Clay is the opposite, and the sheer amount of information that is expected to be memorized for exams is unreal. I heard that MCDB biochem was worse than its MB&B cousin, and I am beginning to think that this is true. Lectures were bland, and exams were very difficult.",
    "Oh man. This class. Four tests no final yaaayyyy NO. Do not take this class. Seriously. Only if you absolutely cannot fit the first semester of MB&B into your schedule. I ended up doing very well, but this is a memorization class that will not teach you biochemistry. Nicole is probably going to get a lot of negative press from this class, whichI totally get. She had completely unrealistic expectations as to our level of preparedness coming into the class (a common phrase was \"and you all remember this from high school,\" which is laughable because my high school biology class spent a semester on weather patterns) which meant that at least half if not a majority of the class was playing catch up with the background material in the first place. Then she wanted us to memorize a million pathways. Now, I'm not saying these pathways aren't important to learn, but I took this class to learn biochemistry, not practice memorizing lists. My time at Yale could have been better used. However, I'm guessing it wasn't entirely her fault that she was asked to teach so much material in eight weeks. Even my MB&B friends in the arguably more thorough year-long course were shocked at the amount of material we were being asked to learn in the last couple of weeks. They need to either tone this class down, focus on concepts, and don't force everyone to memorize like ten long metabolic pathways, or cut out the semester-long course. Seriously. Everyone can take the first semester of MB&B and they would probably be much better served. I have pretty much zero takeaway skills from this class besides being able to recite the glycolysis pathway and a couple of others, which is pretty useless without really understanding what it means. Ron Breaker is a masterpiece, Don Engelman is one of the most forgettable professors at Yale, Nicole Clay is... Nicole Clay. I'm sure you'l see that in other reviews. Just don't take this class. Please take first semester MB&B. Your brain will thank you. Also I know this class looks good in shopping period, Breaker is fantastic, and they make him first for a reason. The course is stupidly backloaded so that you learn basically nothing for the first half of the semester and then have to memorize all of metabolic biochemistry in the second half. But by then you can't drop it. And you only have Nicole. Just don't do it. It's a trap. Please. Stay away.",
    "Don't take this class. Take the MBB bichem, even if you are MCDB. The class will seem fine during shopping period and even up to the withdrawl deadline because Prof. Breaker is a great teacher. However, the second half of the course will be miserable. You will be tested on things only covered in the optional Psets and not the lectures. The lectures will be hard to follow, and overall it just isn't worth it.",
    "MCDB 200 is a very challenging class that will require you to invest a good deal of time to understand the concepts. Having a strong understanding of biology and organic chemistry is extremely helpful to understanding and contextualizing the concepts you will learn. Doing will in this class requires investing a little bit of time every day to reviewing concepts, memorizing structures, and studying synthetic pathways. Although this workload is high, the return on the investment, both in terms of exam performance and on your understanding of biology and chemistry as a whole, is monumental.",
    "I think it was better than it was last year. If it keeps improving, it could be a really great class.",
    "You shouldn't take it unless you have to, or are especially interested in the material.",
    "You seriously learn a ton in this course. Just because Nicole Clay's section was so frustrating I would recommend taking the fall semester version of Biochem. Although, Breaker and Engelman were great professors.",
    "MCDB 300 is a good introduction to the principles and basic reactions of biochemistry. The course started off very concept-based, though the latter half of the course became very reaction and memorization-heavy.",
    "Rote memorization-especially Professor Clays portion of the class.",
    "First half with Ronald Breaker is awesome, second half with Nicole Clay is hell. Avoid Nicole Clay at all costs."
