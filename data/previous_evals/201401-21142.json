    "If, God forbid, Daily Themes were the only writing class at Yale, I still wouldn't take it. This is a terrible, tragically flawed class premised on the assumption that writing can be effectively taught to a lecture class of 90 or so people of varying ability levels, academic backgrounds and general temperaments. Deming exacerbates all these problems with his truly uninspired prompts (many early prompts repeat in not-so-subtly modified versions later in the course) and pretty unabashed favoritism; those who have taken previous courses with him (or presumably [albeit inexplicably] show up to his office hours) will be called on to read aloud, offer insight, etc. and the rest will be delegated to second-class citizenship. I don't understand Deming's taste in writing and some of the spotlighted student pieces are truly awful. I guess the saving grace of this course is the relationship you develop with your tutor, but since the tutors are randomly assigned, it is just as likely you end up with a tutor that supports and appreciates your work as one who fundamentally does not understand it. Maybe if you have not taken another creative writing class this would be okay but if you have and have a low tolerances for self-indulgent masturbation I would steer clear.",
    "Deming is a great lecturer, enthusiastic, poetic, well-spoken. Consistently offers gems of wisdom that come in eloquent sentences. This course was great throughout, but the energy diminished towards the last few weeks. Many of the themes felt repetitive and I wasn't growing as much towards the end. This is a course that offers the students only as much as he or she puts into it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It's so much work and you'll resent the class, but it's rewarding. You'll improve as a writer and become more disciplined. This class gives you the opportunity to write in a capacity that you probably won't ever get to again.",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to work on your writing and put in the time. The class is not worth it if you are just going to get the assignments done each day. You will only get out of it what you put into it, and it can be demanding at challenging at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. We had weekly lectures that provided a variety of perspectives on the writing process (tone, imagery, syntax, dialogue, character, setting, etc.) and wrote short pieces that allowed us to experiment with those skills and ideas.",
    "The lectures are fine, but not always that interesting. You can only listen to English majors lifelessly read aloud so many times before going crazy.",
    "Definitely take Daily Themes if you're able. There's a good reason why it's one of the classic Yale courses.",
    "Take this course if you can get into it. You have to write a sample theme on the application in response to a specify prompt. Download the application as soon as you can. Write the theme and get some feedback from friends. During the course you write five themes a day for fifteen weeks. Each theme is in response to a specific prompt. Some are fiction. Some are non-fiction. You can take one week off, so you will write a minimum of 70 themes. The discipline of writing every day is sometimes frustrating but very effective in improving your writing. The amount of work you put into the course is largely up to you and how much time you choose to spend on each theme.",
    "Daily Themes is a fantastic training for becoming a writer. It forces you to sit down and write on a near-daily basis, and you develop an intimate relationship with your writing tutor, who provides invaluable feedback for helping you hone your style. The solitary act of writing and the interactions with your tutor are the most important part of this class. The lectures are generally thought-provoking, although the guest lectures tended to be hit or miss. The writing prompts were occasionally not wonderful - sometimes, there were prompts that asked you to write about writing, which I think is something that is valuable for a writer to do in his\/her head but doesn't necessarily translate to good writing. On the whole, Daily Themes is an excellent course, and I highly recommend it to anyone aspiring to perfect his\/her craft.",
    "Take it take it take it take it. I was a bit hesitant at first because of the daily commitment, but it's actually only 5 themes a week and you're allowed to skip one week in the semester (I chose not to because I came to love the writing so much). I came in without much experience writing fiction and loved the flexibility the short themes provide to experiment.",
    "Very good at connecting with students and very nice person, but you realize, after a while, that you're not learning anything from his lectures. You read good writing, he talks about it, and says things you kind of figured out in prettier ways. If I were him I'd bring in more text samples, and just read them, rather than such depth in each one. Also, having prompts up earlier, more clarity around schedule, would help.",
    "This is an interesting class. You'll write every day. Sometimes you'll like it and sometimes you'll hate it. If you take it credit\/D you might consider writing 2 or 3 responses that aren't very good and putting real effort into the other 2 or 3. If you write some weeks where all 5 aren't very good themes, you won't get anything out of the class. If you take this class Credit\/D you can get by with two hours or less work per week, possibly including class time (1:15) and tutor meetings (:30).",
    "Great course to do with the rigor of writing. It gets hard at times but is fantastic to have a piece of writing that marks something I was thinking about every day this year.",
    "Lecture was the least though-provoking class I've taken at Yale. But my tutor was incredible, and writing 5 days per week was fine at times, great at times.",
    "It's a ton of work, but will help you develop your writing ideas and sensibility. I'd say take it -- it's not like any other writing experience you'll ever have again.",
    "I did not expect Daily Themes to improve my writing, but I did want to get smarter about writing. After taking this class, I find myself starting writing assignments of any size faster and more confidently. I'm also sharper when it comes to my own shortcomings as a writer - better able to see them and fix them. I've trained myself to think about the reader instead of just myself, and to think more about clarity and consistency of message. Still, even in the last week of the course I was making elementary mistakes in craft and word choice. Part of this course was realizing, in fact, how very much I still have to learn. The tutoring section was a humbling experience, but extremely valuable. I may never again receive the same respectful attention to my writing, whether it's good or bad, from someone so intelligent and helpful.",
    "Take Daily Themes if you love creative writing but haven't had the opportunity to write anything but academic papers for a long time. Lectures are good (Prof. Deming is very upbeat, and some of the guest lecturers are great), but don't really focus on improving the actual nuts and bolts of your writing. Your relationship with your tutor is the most important thing about Daily Themes. They will read every scrap of your writing and offer feedback, so try to form a comfortable and honest relationship with them. It's worth it.",
    "You write a piece five days a week, have lecture once a week, and meet with your tutor once a week to discuss your writing (every tutor gets about 7 students, so it can be pretty personal). I think it's the best way to learn creative writing- not by agonizing over one or two assignments (though that will likely happen, too!) , but just writing in volume and reflecting on it. Lots of practice. If you get a good tutor, chances are you'll really enjoy the course: they're very helpful, sensitive readers. Excellent class, though lecture can be boring. I personally had an exceptional tutor, and learned a lot by sharing my writing with her- finding out which things show through your writing, whether intended or not; seeing the themes and motifs that return again and again; being encouraged to push into unfamiliar territory. I highly recommend it!",
    "Daily themes is a great class to learn how to write consistently every day. It's awesome to take a course that forces you to create one thing every day. The lectures aren't always amazing, but the experience is great. Take it!",
    "Daily Themes is a great experience, and you will get out of it what you put into it. If you are willing to commit yourself to the daily ritual of writing, and not fudge it, you will grow from it. Also, as a non-English major, I especially appreciated the chance to have a change of pace from my normal course load.",
    "Overall, Daily Themes is a fantastic class with a very unique structure. I'm so glad I decided to take it, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It can become a little tedious, especially towards the middle-end of the semester, but is definitely worth it in the end. I didn't find the lectures particularly helpful or stimulating, but with the right tutor, this can be one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "I recommend it as a great way to challenge yourself to write every day and to stretch your writing abilities when you come across topics that you don't like. It was nice to have a class force me to still try to write something of interest and quality even if i hated the prompt or or initially couldn't think of anything to write. The stretching also gives you a lot of great material that you can use for future, longer pieces. It also shows you what you tend to write about frequently which is useful for future pieces as well. I loved my tutor because she was always able to exactly articulate what I was trying to do with each piece better than I could, which was so helpful in thinking of ways of revising pieces to achieve that end better. Overall a very low key but also extremely rewarding creating writing course.",
    "300 words 5 days a week is no easy task, but it is definitely worth it. Take this class- it will improve your writing and change the way you think.",
    "Take it.",
    "Interesting class, where the writer will have to figure out how to get the most out of the course.",
    "Write 250 words a day. Sit in a lecture once per week where you don't have to take notes. If you don't do the writing, you won't do well.",
    "Recommend but with caution-tutor may not be everything you dreamed. It is up to you to write well and challenge yourself. I got to dig really deep though because you have to write so much things will come up you had forgotten. Would have liked more criticism though.",
    "Daily Themes is an excellent opportunity to develop your writing habits and skills. You will get out of it at least what you put into it, and likely more.",
    "If you don't mind the concept of thirteen weeks of somewhat random speechifying about writing (hit or miss) and writing 65 themes over the course of the semester, go for it. If you get a great tutor, this class could be really amazing, and the act of writing every day can be really beneficial. Just don't fool yourself - it WILL get frustrating sometimes, and if you're going to have a really busy semester, take something else.",
    "Great class to improve your writing. Writing every day gets you into a good habit, and you can really see your writing improve as the semester progresses so it's a very rewarding experience.",
    "Write something you probably won't like 5\/7 days a week.",
    "Take Daily Themes! Because Calvin Trillin, Bob Woodward, and Sinclair Lewis once sat in that seat. Because when else will you write five days a week, every week of the semester (with a week off for Spring Break and another for general laziness)? Because of the struggle to find meaning and value in a course where the lectures are so seemingly scattered. Because the unsparing regimen of writing daily fosters rigour. Because when the sensational becomes stale, he resorts to the essential passions of common life that he might well have forgotten in the clamour of the Yale life. Because of liberation through constraint. Because your futile attempts to find some sense of style and voice will have been, first and foremost, an attempt! Because write, write, write!",
    "Yes. If you like creative writing and are looking to not only improve your typical types of writing but to take risks into new genres I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you want to be a better writer or even just gain a better appreciation for writing, this is your course. I don't suggest taking it during a 5-class semester, though. You'll get more out of it if you have time to really focus on writing each day.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. There is a TON of writing obviously but there is no reading and you do have enough time to do it if you just manage it. My writing improved so much over the past 4 months and it's so fun to do creative writing and just write to write rather than write to get a good grade.",
    "Often found lecture uninspiring, but the act of writing every day makes the class more than worth it.",
    "You might be scared of this class, but take it. You will get so much from it. Contrary to popular opinion, the workload was very manageable. My advise is not to agonize over the prompts, but set aside a maximum of 45 minutes a day. Lectures could be a little frustrating but the reward you get from writing every day will be so worth it.",
    "Take Daily Themes if you get the chance; you're writing can't *not* improve if you do it every day. Deming is a great guy whom you should get to know, and the writing tutors are all very cool. Of course it's a lot of work\u2014it's difficult to set aside time to be creative 5 times a week\u2014but you'll be glad you did it. Deming and the guest lecturers do tend to have this really capital-R Romantic vision of writing as a spiritual journey with metaphysical implications, which can get really annoying if that's not your cup of tea, but it's still a great experience.",
    "If you honestly think you can devote an hour or so a day to writing, then definitely do this class. You'll learn a lot about yourself as a writer and be challenged to take risks.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your writing and are disciplined enough to keep up with the assignments. This class is a wonderful chance to drill yourself as a writer.",
    "I took this class because I was scared of writing. As a science major, I'd gotten used to problem sets and exams, but written assignments still inspired dread and invoked the Procrastination Monster. Coming into senior spring, I knew I wanted to work on those skills. Writing one low-stakes piece every day helped me to drop the fear, and also helped me to see the world in a different way. Depending on the prompt of the day, I would be writing down interesting snippets of conversation, or seeing the texture of the bricks in campus buildings for the first time, or trying to remember how it felt to first walk into a now-familiar space on campus. The prompts tugged my brain into different ways of thinking, and the course was worth it for that alone. Then, my tutor was wonderful. He helped me not only with the words on the page, but what was lurking just off the page-- thoughts, connections, and backstories-- that I would not have reached for on my own. Sharing my writing was a bit scary at first, but once I relaxed into it and started writing about things that mattered to me, my tutor meetings unlocked thoughts that had been bouncing around my head for a long time, and helped make sense of the confusion. In short, this course is worthwhile on a few different dimensions, even though it is really hard to maintain your energy when you're writing every day. Take it to grow, take it to understand yourself as a writer better, take it to understand yourself as a person better, just take it.",
    "This was a great course for someone who enjoys creative writing, but hates writing essays. It is not an easy course, you have work to do everyday, and thus it takes up a substantial amount of time. But it was one that I enjoyed and would thus recommend to everyone I know.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're looking for more writing experience. This class pushes and challenges you in ways that most classes at Yale never will, and you'll be better for it. It's a very heavy workload, and sometimes it feels like the time you invest isn't paying off, but it truly is. Deming is great, and though I can only speak to my own tutor, the support you get in the class is phenomenal and encourages you to explore all facets of your writing.",
    "Yes. The writing tutors sometimes don't push you enough and the assignments can be frustrating, but the experience of being held accountable to daily writing was more valuable than almost any lecture or seminar I've taken.",
    "If you, like me, are one of those people who thinks of themselves as a writer but doesn't actually write - take this course!! You will become a writer. I came into this class very nervous about my writing and afraid to show it to anyone and agonizingly nit-picky over every single word (my first few themes took me 3 hours to write - EACH) and am leaving it with the ability to sit down for an hour between classes or meals or before bed and bang out 300 words that, in the morning, I usually like. But the liking part doesn't necessarily matter - its the mechanics of writing that really makes this class worthwhile.",
    "Definitely take it. YES YES YES.",
    "Daily Themes was the most personally fulfilling class I took at Yale. It's a great way to direct my excess energy to be productive and to create something meaningful. I'm really glad I took it before I graduate. I'm an Economics & Mathematics major, so it's sometimes intimidating to be in a class filled with English majors and their flowery prose, but it was absolutely worth it! The class pushed me to think differently and really help me develop a distaste for cliche, which is really important for writers. The strict discipline of 5 pieces a week unclogged writer's block whenever it happened. Now I won't have time to follow such a regular writing habit, but knowing that the writer's voice is inside me and can be readily revitalized is, well, something :).",
    "daily themes is definitely worth taking! it's a grind, but the work never feels hard. lecture seems a little pointless sometimes when there is no guest speaker\u2014discussing x-themes and quotes was my least favorite part of the class, but the prompts were great.",
    "Write and turn in 5 themes each day, 250-300 words. Simple formula that can yield great results.",
    "This class is a great excuse to get out of things you don't want to do or boring social engagements. Though the daily assignments definitely got a little stressful towards the end of the semester, it made me very disciplined throughout the rest of the semester and a better, faster writer overall. Take it if you're really actually committed to improving your writing, not just because you think this is a class you should take.",
    "If you like to write, even less than daily, take it. You'll get better, and you'll walk away with a pretty significant body of work to revise and pull from for the future.",
    "A course that is centered around the process of writing every day. The tutorial meetings allowed for personal attention and forced you to be on your game all the time."
