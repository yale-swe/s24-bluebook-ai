    "Yes",
    "You have to take it! But get the most out of it by really starting meetings with your advisor early, and thinking about your senior project well in advance of the end of fall semester. It can vary a lot depending whether you present early or near the end of the semester but most everything you do will be outside of class anyway. A couple moderately helpful workshop\/info sessions early on, too."
