    "I liked this course a lot with Prof. Sarab. She kept the class very engaging with interactive activities, invited students from the Arab Students Association to converse with us, and continually contextualized whatever we had learnt with appropriate pieces of news and pop-culture. She really cares a lot about the class, I am very glad I took it with her.",
    "very organized and structured",
    "I wish there was more Shaami and speaking practice than writing. Also I wish tutoring counted for my Arabic tables",
    "I really love how low stress the course felt for me just because so much of the work was in evenly divided amounts all across the term - as long as you put in work throughout you were gonna be fine, nothing would make or break your grade. Learning with sarab was always fun and felt effective too.",
    "Strengths - more speaking this year than in the past, good constant feedback and opportunities for extra help \/ improvement Weaknesses- dont feel like I have a good sense of any dialect"

    "Highly, highly recommend! I wouldn't have expected Arabic to be such a popular choice amongst all kinds of students, regardless of their background. I really liked my classmates and it was a very comfortable environment. I learned a lot, and looked forward to class.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Arabic, this is the way to do it! I had a wonderful experience with Professor Sarab.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "yes. the overall schedule of the semester was very natural and helpful. A great foundational year",
    "I would but it is a lot of busy work so watch out",
    "Yes definitely! take it with sarab",
    "Yes, if you are committed & plan to continue with Arabic in the long-run!"
