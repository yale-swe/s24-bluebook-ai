   "comments": [
    "Fine class. It is technically a seminar but the class is typically divided between half professor lecturing and half student presentations. The student presentations felt lacking and thus I didn't feel as if I got as much out of the class as I could have. The students are also divided between those who live and breathe the Yale Farm and those who are just interested in the topic with no real experience. Overall a fine class but I didn't feel as if I got a ton out of it.",
    "This class taught me so much about sustainable food and agriculture that I previously thought I knew\/didn't know. It is an incredibly informative and helpful for those that are interested in food in any way. The material is pretty dense; it takes a lot of creative thinking to glean the concepts from the texts. The workload is OK but there is a high expectation for the quality of the work. Don't think that you can coast by even though you're learning about food! Despite this, the lectures are amazing! Professor Bombford will simultaneously confound you and heighten your thinking about sustainable food and agriculture. At the end of the semester students spend some time on the Yale Farms which is super fun. Take this class with the intent of working hard but also learning a lot about something that is central to is all.",
    "I would recommend CSYC 342 to anyone who thinks they might be interested in eating, food production, social justice, politics, history, or social studies.",
    "Pretty much just breaks down everything you think you know about food systems and doesn't really offer any way of rebuilding an understanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!! You come out of the course prepared to talk about the drawbacks and strengths (though particularly the drawbacks) of a whole range of proposed technical fixes to agricultural questions. The class is a relatively manageable workload, with four reading responses, one presentation, weekly reading, and a flexible final project or paper that you design. Mark's lectures are absolutely fascinating, though the in-class student presentations were more hit-or-miss. Some week's readings were amazing, others were quite dense. Overall, you learn a lot about both the American and the global agricultural\/food systems, and you get exposure to a ton of different methods of approaching big-picture problems.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are truly interested in various angles of the sustainable food movement and are looking to deconstruct it a bit. It would be helpful for students who take this class to have some background in environmental studies courses or at least to be very interested in the topic and somewhat previously exposed. The course is not impossible for those who don't, but it's really more of an in-depth examination of these topics (so not a breezy intro\/overview to some cool stuff about food). There are a few units: organic, local, urban agriculture, and food sovereignty. Each one seriously examines the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as the way each has become distorted, commercialized, etc. The course essentially drives home the complexities in trying to have \"sustainable\" agriculture, and even questions this as an end as well as the definition of sustainability. I was very interested in the topic so found the course thought-provoking and eye-opening, but can imagine it may fall flat for others who are less invested. Professor Bomford is the director of the Yale Farm, so he has both practical and academic experience. He is very knowledgeable, a very engaging lecturer, and pretty approachable. The course involves a final project, which is very open-ended. I genuinely enjoyed doing mine and found the experience of this course worthwhile and valuable.",
    "CSYC 342 challenges conventional and alternative agricultural systems alike. It forces students to drop preconceived notions about what agriculture is \"sustainable\" and what is not, as well as question the concept of sustainability as a whole. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in delving deeply into agricultural and food studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend knowing a fair amount about some aspect of food issues before going into this class. This doesn't mean, be a food expert or activist. It just means you should probably have begun exploring books and literature, watching documentaries, paying attention to these issues in the news, and generally staying attuned to the national dialogue, or some part of it, around food. You touch on a huge diversity of issues in the course, which may not always feel connected but ultimately give you a broad knowledge base to draw upon for further study. There was a bit more lecture in the class than I would have liked, but Mark always spoke engagingly and authoritatively on the material. Overall, good class but you probably want to have a pre-existing interest and exposure to the topic."
