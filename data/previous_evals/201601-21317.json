    "This class was absolutely fantastic. Literally if you can take it, you should. For any major it is applicable (or even if it isn't!). The subject material was very interesting and helpful. I really liked that we learned some of the mathematical background behind the techniques that we used, but also worked to practically implement those techniques. So it managed to be the unusual mix of being interesting and a course where you learned a lot of practical information. It is a decent amount of worth, but so worth it. Also, even if your diffeq is a little old or you know how to program, but not in any of the languages that she lists, these are NOT things that should stop you from taking the course. The real strength of this course was Professor Bennett. Professor Bennett was probably the best professor that I have had at Yale. Applied Numerical Methods II was actually not originally on my schedule for senior year. But I took Applied Numerical Methods I and decided that I wanted to take another course from her this semester, because the course sounded interesting, but much more because Professor Bennett is great. First of all, I do not think I have ever had such an accessible professor. Professor Bennett holds generous office hours and also is incredibly open to meeting with students at other times. She appeared happy to spend time on questions that were relevant to the class but weren't obviously relevant for testing or homework, as well as those that were. She literally sat with me to go over lectures that I had to miss for various reasons. On top of all of that, she is great at answering her email. Professor Bennett is also an engaging and clear lecturer, who creates an atmosphere such that her students feel comfortable asking questions in class. She (and her class as a result) is very well organized. Her handouts are clear and very helpful and her examples are as well. I enjoyed that we did not have a textbook full of material whose relevance we would have to guess at, but rather notes and the handouts, which included all of the relevant material, in addition to some helpful background which was optional or which we just didn't have time to cover in class. She is careful to erase the least recent relevant material from the board. She also clearly really enjoys the material, which definitely makes it more enjoyable to learn. The homework and tests were generally pretty fair. They tested material that we had learned. For most questions, some thought was required and most of the questions did not feel like busy work. I actually felt that I learned significantly from answering these questions. I also really appreciated Professor Bennet's lenient homework policy--there were definitely some assignments on which I was able to do a better job (and therefore learn more) because of it. Professor Bennett is also just incredibly friendly and considerate (which I suppose is part of what makes her accessible). For example, she put in effort to make sure that we took a final in a room with real tables so that we would be comfortable writing.",
    "Take this class if you have ANY interest at ALL in using computers to do math\/science ever! This class is probably the best-taught class I have ever taken at Yale. While the title of the class is not super attractive, Professor Bennett's teaching is so well organized and enthusiastic that the class is just a joy. The course material is basically, how to use computers to do differential equations practically. While I struggled hard in ENAS194, I both got a better grasp of differential equations through this class but also learned more practical ways to solve actual engineering problems that might arise. Professor Bennett grades very fairly. If you get most of a problem right, you will get most of the points. The same mistake at one point, will not lead to more penalties later. Professor Bennett cares a lot more about your learning than many professors do."
