    "The class gives a theoretical overview of database systems and SQL.",
    "Databases\/disk hardware\/ software for database management",
    "How to teach yourself about databases",
    "I know a little about database theory.",
    "I developed a high-level understanding of how relational databases are built, and how to interact with them using SQL. We also spent some time considering how concurrent transactions can be implemented while maintaining database consistency.",
    "I learned about database systems and how to design them and access them.",
    "I learned about SQL from this class",
    "Data",
    "This course aims to teach the fundamentals of databases. It includes relational algebra, SQL, and much of the theory behind database management systems. However, if you are just looking for a course to give you a reason to learn SQL this is not it, which is a common perception among CS students. The course spends maybe 2 weeks on SQL and when Silberschatz teaches about SQL he essentially reads from slides.",
    "Not very much. There is too much breadth in this courses. Avi covers about 400 pages of his textbook by reading them from PPT slides. We didn't get to engage with the material at all, since there were only two proper Psets (the first was released with solutions by mistake and the fourth was never released) and the Psets have very little to do with the content of the lecture. The TA even admitted to a friend of mine that he didn't look at the slides or the textbook when preparing the Pset questions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course takes a very theoretical approach with a few examples of SQL in lectures, but psets are entirely theoretical. The only time you actually use databases is in the final project. Some more use of databases in psets would have been good.",
    "This course felt rather poorly taught to me. I was honestly pretty frustrated considering that databases and related principles are such important topics in CS. The slides on canvas were not updated so it could be rather difficult to follow the material in class. Lectures were mostly just the professor reading off of his slides without giving much thought to the class itself. There were very few examples of the concepts used during class, and the professor did not usually answer many questions about the material that weren't superficial. There was a lack of communication between the TAs and the professor so Psets and exams often felt separate from what was learned in class.",
    "Strengths - at least there is a textbook to fall back on when you don't learning from the class Weaknesses - lectures are boring, the material is very dull, not a class that can happen at 9am, probably about 25% of the class actually goes to lecture no exaggeration, group project requires way more than what you learn in class, exams are hard because about 1\/3 of the questions are select all that apply questions where you get no credit if you miss just one thing or mark one extra thing, a pretty terrible experience, DON'T TAKE CLASS, JUST TEACH YOURSELF SQL in your free time",
    "The lecture is too boring to be so early in the morning. Either make it later in the day or make it more exciting and such that you want to go to class.",
    "The content of the course itself is highly interesting. Just about every major software product in existence needs to handle and store data, and it's fascinating to learn about how databases are designed and implemented to fit those needs. It is also practical - you learn some SQL, which is the de facto language for most relational databases. The main weakness of this course is the assessments. The problem sets are too short and few in number to help you reinforce the content you learnt in class in any shape or form. The project involves more web development than dealing with databases. Some of the exams questions are good, but the rest test you on random trivia (mind you, I scored pretty well on them).",
    "This was a great class but it would be more helpful if the lectures were more engaging and we had more practice with coding in SQL. It would be good to have more guidance on the final project.",
    "Professor is not engaging, tests do not accurately test knowledge of material. TAs are not helpful.",
    "9 am lectures should be more interesting!",
    "One strength of this course is that it covered a lot of content. If you are looking for a course that covers a lot of material about the theoretical foundations of databases then this is the one. This strength was overcome by the weaknesses. First, the lectures consist of Silberschatz simply reading from slides that he made for his textbook (the required reading for the course). Also, the requirements for and how we would be graded on the final project were not clear in any way.",
    "Strengths: low time-commitment Weaknesses: Avi couldn't care less about this class and makes every effort to spend as little time as possible on it. There were only two Psets, which have been put together by the TA and had very little to do with the course content. The exams were both multiple choice, with each question having one, two or three correct answers with no partial credit, making them quite difficult. One multiple choice question on the final corresponded to roughly one point on the final grade.This is not a gut if you care about your grade! I believe that to do well in the two exams you would have to buy the textbook and read every chapter carefully, reviewing the chapters from the slides before the exam. If you did this the course actually becomes quite time intensive."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in a theoretical overview of database systems then yes. If you want to learn how to use databases, then no.",
    "I would not recommend this course. If you are a computer science major and you genuinely care about taking a class that will further your learning of Computer science, do not take this course.",
    "NO do not take this class, it will be painful and you will have regrets like me, just teach yourself SQL",
    "No. I wasn't engaged enough and in turn, I don't feel like I learned very much,",
    "The topic of the course is highly interesting - how do you create an interface for queries about data, and fulfill them in the most efficient manner possible ? The class itself only lives up to this potential in the second half, when it gets to the underlying implementation of databases. The first few weeks however deal with SQL syntax and can get pretty dull (though I suppose this is unavoidable - you need to know SQL first to build a database that conforms to it). Avi has his quirks, but has a wealth of experience in the field and gives interesting lectures. If you can stomach the atrociously bad\/conspicuously missing assessments, then I would recommend this course, since this is essential knowledge for just about any programmer or computer scientist. I would also take some of the other reviews with a pinch of salt - there are a lot of people who don't show up to lectures or revise the material, then complain about poor teaching or exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning the theoretical part of the content. I think that students need to learn most of the material themselves since the course is very dry.",
    "No, even though the workload is relatively low, the course is not worth it.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a stats-y cs elective",
    "This course may have a lower workload than other cs electives but any student looking to take this course should only take it if they want to study database systems in graduate school. Otherwise, the disorganization of the course, the non-engaging lecture style, and the unclear requirements and grading of the final project should be reasons for students not to take the course.",
    "NO! Classes like this are why CS at Yale has such a bad reputation. Databases is entirely self-taught and I'm sure there are better online courses available for free."
