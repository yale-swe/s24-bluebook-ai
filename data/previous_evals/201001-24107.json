    "Absolutely. It was the perfect place to write your senior essay, especially if you're nervous about writing it on your own. She lays it out step by step so you feel totally in control.",
    "Professor Hungerford is a fantastic discussion leader and thesis adviser. She's brilliant and perceptive which makes her advice for the paper invaluable, but she's also pretty busy so this class definitely requires some initiative and independent monitoring since she won't hold your hand. There's a lot of work in the middle of the course when you're doing independent research while getting through a novel a week, but the communal aspect makes it totally worth it.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. If you're interested in contemporary American literature, this is the course to take. A lot of work, but worth it.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. If you want to write something interesting, take it.",
    "It's a senior essay course, so if you're not going to be writing your senior essay, prepare to think of it as a learning experience in what that will be like. You can learn a lot from editing your peers work."
