   "comments": [
    "Just like the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, this is the powerhouse of classes. You will have to put in a lot of work, but if you do it will seriously pay off and be one of the most rewarding classes you will take.",
    "Difficult course. It's definitely a course that requires a lot of time. But I would recommend this course to anyone, because as someone who doesn't have a biology background, I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Summary: C&MP 550 gives a brief introduction into the organ systems of the human body. It focuses more on the molecular mechanisms of how things work, rather than the functionality of each tissue. Recommendation: I would recommend it to students interested in the molecular mechanisms of how tissues in the body work. I wouldn't recommend it to people with a desire a more functional look at the tissues. This is because it delves so deep into how everything works, that it become a little bit difficult to see the big picture. And physiology is not about individual organs acting alone, but multiple systems cooperation to carry out their functions.",
    "yes, awesome course!",
    "I thought that Systems Physiology was a good course that focused on how physiological processes in the body worked. I would recommend this class to another student, because I felt that I learned a lot of interesting and useful information.",
    "No. Dry lectures. Required for a program.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in learning about the human body system.",
    "General overview of human physiology. I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, but I would warn them that it is quite a bit of work. More than the average class."

   "comments": [
    "This course was one of the more helpful courses I have taken in terms of deepening my knowledge about biomedical engineering and being directly applicable in my research. Very very useful.",
    "Since my research is related to the cardiovascular system, this course has given me a lot of good context regarding this area.",
    "I took this course to deepen my physiology understanding beyond that of my undergrad class. The course met this goal somewhat, particularly in the grad section. I wish however that the course could have take a more holistic approach rather than delving so much into how each works mechanistically.",
    "This course helps me to review the physiological mechanisms of the body, and deepen my understanding of the medical profession. I do consider this course a great addition to help me with my dissertation and future research project.",
    "This class gave me some biological background I needed in order to do research analyzing metal imaging data from human subjects."
