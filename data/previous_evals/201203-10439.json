    "Foundations of Modern Archaeology details the early development of the discipline and the social context from which it emerged and was subsequently altered.I would recommend that any graduate or undergraduate wishing to pursue a career in archaeology should take this class.",

   "comments": [
    "This class has helped me to better understand how the discipline emerged and changed over time, providing a basis for evaluating past research and published material by looking at them as products of a particular social and historical context. This ability will be instrumental for preparing for qualifying exams and dissertation research.",
    "This course provided a critical perspective on the field of archaeology itself- this greatly contributes to my understanding of the discipline.",
    "Up to this point my background knowledge of archaeology was vague at best, not really extending beyond the late 19th century. Now I feel that I have a much better grasp not only of the western origins of the discipline, but also of various archaeologies around the world."
