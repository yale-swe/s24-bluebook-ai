   "comments": [
    "I read about different populations in Latin American, like Indigenous groups and black communities, and how their inclusion or exclusion, which differs per state, complicated my ideas of citizenship and nationhood. This class really helped me think through things I had taken for knowledge about a complicated region.",
    "I learned a new approach to reading ethnographic documents and a broad history of Latin American politics and issues of ethnicity.",
    "This class entirely changed my perspective on history, anthropology, and the politics and theory of both. Before this class I had never really had exposure to these discussions as they pertained to Latin America, and after taking it, I understand the politics of race, nationalism, and ethnicity. It was very enlightening.",
    "Learned about the history of nation building in Latin America, with particular attention to what groups of people were included or excluded in that process and why. I learned a lot not only about select countries like Cuba, Brazil, Peru, Guatemala, and others, but also about the anthropological and historical theories that accompany the scholarship.",
    "This course transformed how I see the world, really. In many ways, the skills of the course - learning to appreciate the complexity and interconnectivity of historical and sociological phenomena, searching for other perspectives, and listening to people - are reflected in the widest gamut of human experience. Being a better historian and anthropologist means being more connected with the realities in the world today. Most of all, I appreciated how the readings connected the themes of the course - nationalism, ethnicity, and the politics of knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "I think there are great sources in this class, and Prof. Echeverri is so knowledgable. She is so good at listening to comments being made and explaining them, or asking the right questions so students clarify themselves. But the reading is often so much that it is hard to focus on any of them when reading them, which I think sometimes brings down the level of conversation.",
    "I loved that the readings were so varied, and really enjoyed all of them. They were heavy at times but I never felt too stressed. My only suggestion is that you make the history class Colonial Latin America (or some Latin American history class) a pre requisite because I felt that a lot of my understanding about the topic rested on what I learned in Colonial Latin American History.",
    "Terrific class because of the conversation that Prof Echeverri leads. We discuss theories and dynamics of race and ethnicity through our specific readings and examples, and that makes for very intellectually interesting material. The guest professors were also a highlight because we were given the opportunity to engage with various experts in numerous fields all relating to our class. One improvement could address the difficulty for students to complete the weeks entire reading and write a reading response during the weeks that papers (book review, paper draft) were due. While it does not occur regularly, it was incredibly difficult to devote the necessary time to both tasks in the same week. Maybe lessening the reading amount those weeks could help?",
    "Strengths - great readings. Amazing seminar - most everyone has something to contribute, and the conversation is fantastic Weaknesses - nothing I can think of..."

    "Yes!!! An amazing course for anyone who wants to learn about Latin America.",
    "This class was fantastic!!!! As someone who had never formally studied Latin America before, this was a fascinating class to jump into because our discussions went beyond historical events to analyze the theories, motives, and dynamics of the classs themes. The class studies the history of nation building in Latin America (looking closely at Brazil, Cuba, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Nicaragua, and more), with particular reference to what groups of people are included and which are excluded. I learned most of the history through the readings, and then discussions would tie together larger themes. Professor Echeverri is incredible, and you should take the opportunity to have a class with her. This class can improve your writing and also let you dive into uncharted topics in your research paper. The weekly reading responses arent too daunting, and they help synthesize your own thoughts on the readings. There are several guest professors (!!!!!) who are sooo cool and fun to engage with! Definitely take this class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Totally invaluable way into thinking about Latin American history as well as the pedagogies of history more broadly. Unlike any other history course I've takenrather than focusing on events or timelines, this course takes a more thematic approach, looking into the histories of museums, nationalist productions (be they symbolic or legislated), transnational politics, indigenous activism, afro-latino movements, along with many other subjects. That being said, the success of the course is highly dependent on the thoughtfulness of students within the class and their desire to engage. Nevertheless, the readings are super interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! The readings are so interesting and clearly chosen with purpose. I felt that our discussions were generally productive and the two assignments were fairly open-ended and straightforward.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE if you can.. it's such a phenomenal experience. Professor Marcela is amazing, the readings are so cool, and the class as a whole is deeply enriching, especially if you've never tried anything like it before!"
