    "A good summary of the philosophy of religion.",
    "I would recommend this class for a philosophy student who has taken a few philosophy courses before. Take the class, but do not expect it to be easy.",
    "Take it if you like philosophy. Not too hard.",
    "Honestly not a very interesting class. Professor Hare is a great professor, but the topic is not very interesting. I can't believe that this is the best that religion can offer for itself.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Hare is the most adorable professor (in a grandfatherly way), and I felt like I learned a lot from the course overall. I have never taken either a philosophy course, or a course on religion, and I found this course to be a good place to start. It was unbiased and provided arguments both for and against a god. It helped me to better understand the principles behind religion and the belief in God, rather than just comparing and contrasting the religions of the world. The readings were also highly interesting as well. A few of them were a bit esoteric, but I found the majority of them to be understandable. The quizzes also helped to keep up with reading and to make sure I understood the views of each philosopher. This course provides a great overview of the major religious philosophers, and provides both their opinions and objections to those opinions. It'll help you to better understand the beliefs in your own religion, or the reasons why others have religious beliefs. I found this course to be incredibly informative, and the reading wasn't tedious. I enjoyed and looked forward to going to class every Monday and Wednesday.",
    "Definitely take this course. The readings are fantastic and the workload is easily manageable, but take it for Professor Hare. It is fun just watching him lecture and he laughs like Austin Powers. He's incredibly intelligent and still able to explain some of the most complicated texts in a clear, concise manner. Just pure, British success.If you aren't thinking about the philosophical questions explored in this course, you probably aren't thinking.",
    "It's a class for those who want to think about religion. Take the class to be challenged. An amazing class, and religious or not.",
    "It is a great class! If you are remotely interested in religion, you should take it.",
    "Really good class. See above.",
    "Yes. My favorite class at Yale so far. If you are at all interested in the truth questions of religion, take it.",
    "TAKE IT. Possibly my favorite course while at Yale. Learned a ton about some of the most important topics in life. Prof Hare is a must-take professor while at Yale. His lectures are some of the best I have had in my undergraduate career.The course looks at topics like religion and ethics, faith and reason, death and immortality, mysticism, miracles, evolution, etc. The syllabus is western \/ Christian philosophy heavy, but gives an interesting taste of other world religions. Grading fair, not too difficult. Papers require thought and work, quizzes make sure you keep on top of the readings. You cannot do well in this course without doing the reading. It's 20-40 pages a class. Nothing too difficult, but it is intellectually hefty stuff, so you cannot breeze through it in 15-30 minutes.LOVED IT> take if at all possible.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course. TAKE IT!",
    "This is a great class. Hare is a dynamic lecturer, and Ganssle is a great TF.As a Jewish atheist, it was interesting for me to try to engage with Christian philosophical theology on its own terms. I think I gained a much deeper understanding of religion than if I had taken a more anthropological class. Though Hare includes a few token non-Christian thinkers, beware that this is a class that focuses primarily on the Abrahamic\/Christian tradition.",
    "Definitely take this course if your interested in the material but be warned (or be excited!) the readings are more contemporary than most other philosophy courses.",
    "Hare is the most amazing lecturer I have ever had. He creates lectures which are uniquely suited to the material. He speaks slowly enough that you can take down notes verbatim, which is essential because of the complexity of the philosophical concepts we were dealing with. He explained all of the texts very well, and I always appreciated hearing his opinion on arguments and dilemmas.",
    "This was a fantastic course - one of the best I've taken at Yale. The material was thought-provoking and expertly delivered by professor Hare. The readings were very approachable, moderate in quantity, and (relatively) evenly balanced between different viewpoints. The reading quizzes were reasonable and the final wasn't too difficult if you've done the reading.I would definitely recommend working on the reading questions. The quiz questions come directly from there.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Very interesting!",
    "Only take this class if you're interested in modern thinkers on religion who write in an analytical way. Also, the quizzes can be quite annoying.",
    "Great class! It addresses many topics that make sense together but tend to be scattered throughout other courses -- the relationship between science and religion, the problem of evil, the place of religion in the world, the relationship of morality and religion, etc. Not to work-heavy -- the reading quizzes could be a bit annoying, but other than that, only 2 5-page papers and an exam. Very reasonable, overall. Prof. Hare is a delight as a lecturer, although he'll often take very dense philosophical material at a pretty fast pace. Definitely recommend this class.",
    "I'm only halfway through my Yale career, but this was by far the best class I've taken thus far. Professor Hare was phenomenal with amazing insight and great humor! The readings were also really really good (with a few minor exceptions). The topics covered were all very interesting, and this is one of those classes that I can say I truly learned throughout the entire semester. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "This is a great course to get an overview of the different issues in philosophy of religion. It will serve you greatly in other courses to have a basic sense of what different people are arguing. The workload is doable and lectures are fun (make sure to go!). There are four quizzes, drop one, section two simple papers and a final exam. Overall quite straight-forward. This is a survey course though, so you will never really get to go in depth of any of the topics (which are deep issues).",
    "The class covers most of the important questions you may have about religion, and there is a lot of variety in the readings you will encounter.",
    "Professor Hare is a great professor. He's funny and engaging. He knows the authors of the papers that we read for class, so he provides relevant background information when presenting the readings in lecture. Being agnostic, I think he did a good job being even-handed. I never felt like he was trying to skew students' opinions toward the Christian\/theistic view. Discussion section was great, although the TA was somewhat unhelpful. But that was okay because discussion was more or less led by students.",
    "THIS IS MY FAVORITE CLASS I HAVE TAKEN SO FAR AT YALE. If you are worried about the lack of experience in Philosophy, I was on the same situation as you do. But I ensure that you will have no problem following the class as long as you do all the readings and attend all lectures. Please take this class if you are interested in the philosophical discussion about religion and faith. This is a great class to take no matter you are religious or not.",
    "If the topics interest you at all, this is an excellent class. Prof. Hare is phenomenal. Definitely recommended.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Philosophy of Religion was a great class. Hare is super excitable for an older gentleman, and he makes all of his lectures interesting. Some of the readings are rather dry, but some are really excellent.",
    "A very good, low-stress introduction to philosophy for students who don't want to do the Ancient\/Modern sequence or who have a particular quandary in their religious\/areligious life that is tugging on them. If you're generally not a \"philosophy person\" but want to do one class that asks big questions about life, this is just what you're looking for. A lot of basic philosophical concepts from across the boardget explained in some detail along the way, too. Reading load is very light - maybe 50 pages a week on a bad week - and there's only 2 five-page papers, three reading quizzes, and a final. John Hare is a great teacher on top of that.Be sure to find a good section before committing to take the course - a good TA will make everything clearer and more straightforward and a bad one will only waste your time and frustrate you. (This is true of any class, but especially true if you haven't had assistance teasing out and critiquing philosophical argument rigorously before.)",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class. As an engineering student who had never taken a philosophy course before, it was a great overview of one portion of philosophy, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad that I took it to broaden my academic career. I thought that the readings were interesting and manageable for a philosophy beginner, the lectures were a great overview and commentary on the readings, and the workload and tests were fair. I was frustrated with this course because my section leader didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a good job at facilitating discussion, and this is material that would be so interesting to discuss because everyone has personal and intense feelings about religion. So, I would highly recommend shopping discussion sections if you decide to take this course.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a great survey of the philosophy of religion, and hits all of the major arguments for and against God. While Hare summarizes the readings usually, instead of uniquely offering a spin of his own, he still is an incredible lecturer who manages to simplify things and relate them to the way we currently understand religion. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested- the workload is not too rough and it is very engaging. The papers were great experiences, and the final exam was very easy and direct, but the mini quizzes are frustrating in that they are difficult to manage and complete. They together only count for about 15% of the grade, though, and you can still get an A even with doing not to well on them.",
    "Unfortunately, John Hare isn't teaching this course next year, so I don't know how much of this will apply, but I would highly recommend Philosophy of Religion. Hare is an adorable lecturer, who is great at making very obtuse texts very clear. But aside from that, the course itself is really good in the way it covers virtually everything we oftentimes think about when it comes to religion. That is to say, the existence of God, the soul, the afterlife, the problem of evil, miracles, and religious ethics all play a part in the course. Few philosophy classes challenge people's broad areas of belief like this one. With that said, be aware that even though this is cross-listed with religious studies and the div school, it is very much a (somewhat analytic) philosophy course. Readings can be technical and not particularly literary in the theological sense. Certainly, while there is a lot of consideration of a 3-O God, the class itself does not dwell much on theology. If that is what you're looking for, then you might want to take something else. However, if you're looking to engage and challenge religious and nonreligious positions head on with direct arguments, this course is a great decision.",
    "Good class. Professor Hare made it broader this year; even though most of the modern authors are dealing with Christianity, there's a clear effort to broaden the base of ideas covered. I wish it could've gone deeper a lot of the time, but still good.",
    "yea its really great. definitely take it if you have any interest in philosophy and are looking for a good intro course that's not too basic.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's not much work, and it relates to something deeply connected to every culture and every age. A lot of people who take it have never taken philosophy classes before, and TFs were understanding. Material that touches upon major branches of philosophy: ethics, epistemology, etc.",
    "I would say it is a broad and decent intro class for the topic. I would recommend it especially for people not very well-versed in the subject.",
    "It is a must-take at Yale.I would definitely recommend it to other students. It is the best course of the school.",
    "Wonderful introductory course to philosophy of religion!!! Professor Hare is phenomenal, and he does an excellentjob at explaining the different philosophical arguments you will be reading. Sections are also really amazing for this course. This is the time where you are given the opportunity to discuss your own opinions and arguments on the texts you read. If you are interested in understanding a different perspective of how religions are viewed and reading and discussing the arguments for the existence of God, this is the course for you!",
    "This course is a survey of philosophy of religion organized by topic. For each topic within the philosophy of religion you will read multiple arguments from different authors. Often you will read one argument from an ancient or 18th century philosopher and then several responses by contemporary philosophers. Professor Hare is great and gives very clear lectures that outline the arguments from each reading. The one thing I didn't always like about this course is that you read lots of very short excerpts from different philosophers instead of getting to know a couple philosophers well.",
    "Yes! Take it! If you are concerned about your grade (it is a hard class), take it credit\/d. It's worth it."
