   "comments": [
    "Yes - but it is not what you would normally expect. Rather than constructing a useable background on Michelangelo, the course is a series of linked reflections on what it meant to be Michelangelo.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE IT. Michelangelo's art is beautiful, and learning to look at it in the way Prof. Keizer does is incredible.",
    "You should definitely take this class. Michelangelo is fascinating, and you'll learn a lot about different approaches to art history, too. The weekly readings are excellent, and the final paper is fun to write, since you develop your idea over the course of the semester with Prof. Keizer's help.",
    "This was Professor Keizer's first year and as a result the class was pretty disappointing in execution, although interesting in conception. Shop it and see if it will be any better--things to worry about: discussions centered on the regurgitation of inane facts from the readings, an ill-defined grading systemin which Professor Keizer will not let you know your standing in the class, and an amorphous term paper assignment which is the bulk of the grade.",
    "An overall interesting course, especially for those interested in Michelangelo. It's a lot of close looking at the artist's work and drawing conclusions. Each student has to do a presentation on one week's reading (and there's kind of a lot of reading), a prospectus for the final research paper due at midterm, and then a 20-page research paper (but you work on it throughout the semester in theory). The class is pretty discussion-based (Professor Keizer doesn't really talk that much), but you will get a lot out of it. The class did go over time often, but it's overall a very stimulating course that allows you to get an in-depth look at one artist over time. A good alternative to the broader, survey courses.",
    "Brilliant, amazing, loved it learned so much!! Missed that we didn't talk about architecture, but the course was so full of everything else that it was not too sorely missed."
