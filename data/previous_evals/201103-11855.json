   "comments": [
    "A wonderful course with a wonderful professor -- it lives up to everything you've heard about it, and you'll certainly learn things about everyday life and interactions that will stick with you for a while.",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting class. However it is far more work than most anticipate. The reading is intensive, and there are regular exams and papers.",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend this class to all students who haven't taken it. It will make your life at Yale so much better:)",
    "YES",
    "YES especially with Marvin! You have to do all the readings and the exams\/curve can be very rough, but it's so interesting that it's worth it.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course, even though it is probably my worst grade this semester. Interesting, useful.",
    "This class is a must-take. I actually wasn't as in-love with the class as most people seem to be \u0097 it almost comes across a whole spectrum of interesting studies and theories, but without anything.... *deeper* gained. Still, Marvin Chun made this class fantastic, and every lecture was incredibly enjoyable.",
    "This class showed how psychology can be relevant to everyday life. I would recommend taking it, but as Credit\/D because it was much more relaxing that way. I think the material would have stressed me out more if I hadn't taken it Credit\/D.",
    "Psychology 110 is an AMAZING course. I would recommend that every single Yale College student take it. Master Chun is an amazing professor. The tests definitely require significant studying, but all of the work is manageable.",
    "Take it!",
    "A fantastic overview of the field and study of psychology, and a class everyone at Yale should take for the purpose of learning, regardless of major or academic interest.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 just to take a class with Marvin (I've heard Paul Bloom is very good too though). Beware of the curve though; it's not a hard class but it's certainly not a gut class either.",
    "Great introduction to psychology, I recommend it to everyone (even non-psych majors).",
    "Take this class with Chun! He is funny and a great instructor. Although it is not the easiest class, it is worth it because the material is interesting and the professor is incredible.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "amazing class. Great overview and intro class. Excellent lecture. not an overwhelming amount of work, but not a gut either. Do the reading. If you don't need to take it for a grade, I highly recommend taking it Credit\/D. It is easy to do average, but hard to get an A.",
    "Take it! Workload is pretty decent so if you are not taking it CR\/D it might be difficult to get an A. Tests are pretty specific so keep up with the readings.",
    "Classic Yale course. It's annoying though that you really do have to devote lots of time and effort to studying for a class whose material really is ridiculously easy. it's a lot of material. but worthwhile in the end.",
    "Yes! Definitely!",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to another student. If you are not planning on becoming a psychologist though definitely take it Credit\/D\/Fail because it is very difficult. Although it is difficult the content is extremely interesting and I never found the readings taxing because I was always intrigued. Don't expect to come out of this class able to read people's minds but you certainly learn some cool things.",
    "take it. seriously. best course ever. it' s like a spa...",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course It is very reading intensive and you will not do well if you don't do the readings. Even if you don't see yourself majoring in psychology, it is good to have this basis of understanding. Always interesting",
    "Intro Psychology is a very good survey of all of the majortopics in psychology. The course covers a TON of information that was so interesting, but at times a lot to digest. I would recommend this class if you take it Credit\/D\/F. I was taking it to fulfill a distributional requirement, and found the work load to be more than I was hoping. However, the lecture was really really good.",
    "Psych 110 is a basic intro class. It is very interesting and I do think everyone should take it. The tests are hard: they are about half lecture and half textbook. So you have to at least skim the textbook sometime before the test to do well. Chun is amazing though; take it with him if you can because he is hilarious and amazing.",
    "Yes. Great for just general knowledge.",
    "One of the most interesting and relevant classes I've ever taken. Marvin Chun is a superstar, and lectures are very interesting. The exams are a bit tedious to study for, and after the first exam people got really serious about cramming, so the curve got much tougher. It's hard to score exceptionally well or poorly on the papers, so don't waste too much time. Do the textbook reading! Or just take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "A very interesting class, and Chun is an incredible lecturer. You won't be bored with this class, and the workload isn't that bad, just reading and short essays and the midterms. The gradings on the essays didn't make much sense to me but the midterms were definitely very fair and manageable. Take this class!",
    "Yes i would recommend Psych 110 to a fellow student. I took it because I have a small interest in psychology and had never taken it before, the course met my needs perfectly.",
    "great class, but hard to get a good grade. definitely not a gut class",
    "It has been my favorite course at Yale so far! Love Marvin Chun, love psychology, love the lectures!",
    "Yes it was my favorite class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it for a future psych major, or just anyone looking to learn a bit about psychology.",
    "Unlike what some people may think, it is not an easy-A. But other than that, every great thing one can hear about PSYC 110 is absolutely true. I actually felt very happy just acknowledging that I had psych that day.",
    "A challenging class which will change your view of human nature.",
    "Great class, great lectures. The readings get a little tedious at times but definitely do them! They are interesting, you learn a lot of supplemental material from the readings that you will definitely need to know for the three exams. The workload isn't too bad - three short papers, and lab requirements but as long as you plan everything out in advance, you should be fine.",
    "Take it psych and non-psych majors. Great class.",
    "Definitely recommend it but it is a lot of material.",
    "Yes, good overview to a lot of important concepts.",
    "Psychology 110 was an amazing class. It goes through a lot of the major Psychology themes in a coherent, interesting way. I would definitely recommend this class for everyone, including those who are not thinking of Psychology, because the information could be useful in almost any area.",
    "I would recommend this class. It would change people's perception of the world afterwards. Excellent class for even not Psych major.",
    "Overall, this was a really great class. I would definitely recommend it. It does require quite a bit of reading. But, if you keep up with reading on a regular basis, it's not too bad. Lectures are really interesting and fun so it's easy to pay attention, even though lectures are longer than most.",
    "This is hands down the best course I have ever taken. Marvin Chun is a gift to mankind. He is engaging, funny, thoughtful, caring, and brilliant. The textbook is phenomenal. The exams and papers are challenging but fair. In this course, you WANT to do all the readings and you WANT to LEARN (not just memorize) the material. You only care about your grade because you care so much about the class.One note about grades: if you go to every lecture and take notes, do all of the readings, and study hard you WILL do well (at least a B+, likely an A- or A). If you don't do ALL of those things, you WILL do poorly (C+, B-, or B). If you aren't OK with a B and if you don't plan on doing ALL of the work (there is a lot), then you should definitely take this course Credit\/D\/Fail.Either way, take it. If you let it, this course will change your life.",
    "Yes it is an amazing course taught by an amazing professor but it is not a gut!",
    "If you are even slightly considering taking this class, TAKE IT. It will not disappoint. It is interesting material applicable to everyday life, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Everyone should take PSYC 110, regardless of whether or not they have any particular academic interest in psychology. You will learn a lot about how we think, how we feel emotions, and how the mind works. If Professor Chun is teaching it, definitely TAKE IT - he's amazing! Definitely be aware, though, that this class is not a gut. There is a lot of reading (usually 30ish pages in the textbook for each lecture) and the tests (there are three tests, each 25% of your semester grade) cover a lot of material. Even if you fully keep up with the reading, you will probably still need to study before each one. That notwithstanding, definitely take this class - it's awesome and whether or not you go on to take more PSYC classes, it's definitely worth it.",
    "Nothing in this course will really blow your mind, but it is still interesting in that it reinforces a lot of the intuitions you probably already have about why people do what they do. The papers are pretty interesting, and the tests are easy\/fair. And Marvin Chun is just the most adorable person ever. I wouldn't go so far as saying this class is a gut, but if you're looking for a light credit, you should consider Psych 110.",
    "Mostly because of the professor, the fair grading system, and the interesting material that was covered in this class.",
    "Too much fun, but lots of reading that you DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY need to keep up with.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Take it only if you need to. tons of reading. take it credit\/D\/Fail if its not an intended major\/anything. You do improve your general knowledge. Its rigorous. Takes up a lot of time especially hours of a lab! Marvin Chun is awesome!",
    "Definitely take this course even if you don't plan on majoring in psychology. Extremely interesting and applicable subject material.",
    "Interesting course. Definately increased my interest in the subject of psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Chun is amazing, his passion about psychology makes the course interesting. The workload isn't too daunting, and the exams aren't very difficult as long as you do the reading and attend lecture. Lectures are always very informative and entertaining. The reading can get a bit extensive as the class moves quickly, but it is interesting material.",
    "I think this is a great course for everyone to take. It is similar in difficulty to an easy AP course in high school. Marvin Chun is amazing and the material is always interesting. It was always a class I would look forward to and I am definitely glad I took it.",
    "Yes, a student who wants to take an interesting course without too much work should take this class and form his own opinion about the course in comparison those of hundreds of others who have taken this course in the past and loved it.",
    "Psychology 110 covers all the basic psych disciplines. I highly recommend the class, even if you aren't a Psych major. It's not easy, but it's certainly not hard. The work is worth it. The subjects are fascinating and the lectures are great.",
    "If you're interested in how the human mind and behaviors work, take this class. Especially when Professor Chun teaches it again. The lectures are, of course, the best part, but the textbook was also really interesting and well written. Having a real interest in what you're learning helps. Don't just take things in: really absorb the information and process it. I found myself telling people about the studies Professor Chun lectured about and the studies in the textbook, and this really helped when it came around to taking the tests.",
    "If existence and time were about to cease, and you had the opportunity to take one last course at Yale, you could do your mind no greater service than to take Introduction to Psychology with Marvin Chun. Intro to Psych was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. It covered much of the field of psychology in a single semester, with enough depth so as to be interesting but to still allow for a broad overview of the field. Furthermore, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE WITH MARVIN CHUN. Marvin Chun is both academically and emotionally brilliant. He is the quintessential college professor--both knowledgeable in his field of study and willing to share with students. He is one of Yale's greatest assets.",
    "It's a great course with practical and interesting information. Although the class is pretty tough and contains a good amount of reading, I would recommend it to others.",
    "Interesting lectures on the whole, great professor. Good amount of reading but you can get away with only learning the bold terms and skimming the textbook. 3 short research papers but make sure you know exactly what is being asked of you. 3 tests which are heavily based on lectures so be sure to take extensive notes and attend all lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to future students. Not only is it a very interesting class that touches upon many issues in general and clinical psychology, but it also taught me some important life lessons about topics like happiness and sleep that I think I will remember for a long time.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to take anything to do with psychology or has an interest in people and why we behave the way we do.",
    "It's not as easy as it looks. Definitely take it Credit\/D\/Fail if you want to enjoy it. The material is interesting but tests can be random and catch you off guard.",
    "Material-wise, this course covers a lot of the basics, so you would be well prepared to enter higher level courses. Professor-wise, Master Chun is good, but I kind of wish I had taken the course with Professor Bloom, just because I prefer his lecturing style.",
    "I would recommend it only if you intend to major in Psychology or are extremely interested in it.",
    "Take it! It will broaden your mind. And a pretty easy course over all.",
    "A quick, delightful look into what it means to be human. As long as you're interested in understanding society, relationships and yourself, there is absolutely no reason not to take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to underclassmen. The reading is interesting and isn't overwhelming, and the tests honestly aren't that difficult. Great class.",
    "Take this class with Marvin Chun. I didn't know anything about psychology, now I want to take other psych classes. Professor Chun is a beast. He knows hisstuff, and you will too after you take Psyc110. Do the textbook readings, though. But that's not an issue: the textbook is really funny. I totally have a word document dedicated to psych textbook quotes...",
    "I would recommend PSYC 110 to another student, it is a great class and even if you don't want to be a Psych major I'd still take it because it's applicable to everyday life and the material is really interesting.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great survey about the different areas that one may study in psychology. It has a reasonable amount of reading that you do not need to read each week, but you cannot leave it to the last minute. As long as you review the book one week before the test, you are going to be fine and probably get an A.",
    "Take it-it's a legendary course.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take.",
    "Definitely a must take. This class is everything it's hyped up to be. Go to a lecture and you will see. The material is very interesting and Chun is a great lecturer. I don't know what it will be like without Chun as a teacher, but even the material makes the class great by itself.",
    "Intro Psych was an adventure. The topic covered was almost laughably huge - one chapter and one lecture for \"language\" - but that made it exciting. Lectures were fun but felt more like a stream of examples and anecdotes than actual teaching of the material, but this wasn't a problem because the material as presented in the book was by and large easy enough to understand. As an intro course it was exemplary.",
    "Excellent class. Convinced me to pursue Psych in the next few years, perhaps as a major. The lectures tied all the concepts to other fields such as law and criminology. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Intro Psych is a great class. It is very interesting and even if you don't want to major in psychology, I would recommend taking the class. It provides you with insight on human nature and the things that you learn can be applied to many other subjects. Bear in mind that it is not a gut class--there is a lot of reading and each exam covers a lot of material (both reading and information from lectures). Also, Professor Chun is great.",
    "YES. Just take it. You won't be disappointed (unless if you just don't like having fun).",
    "Intro to Psych is a great course, and I definitely recommend it to anyone even a little interested in the material. I think the professor is important, but if you've got the right one, it's a must-take class.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Practical and fun.",
    "Not as incredible as you might think but a solid course. Y",
    "Definitely! The material is generally interesting and the course itself is engaging. The lectures were the most fun classes I had all week. You learn a lot from lectures alone, but the reading is interesting too.",
    "I would recommend it, but probably as a fifth class. If you do all the reading (which is really light for a textbook), then you will have no problem with the material.",
    "A great class to take, esp first semester college. Really brings into essence what an engaging lecture is all about. Teaches you a lot about other people, and yourself.I would whole heartedly recommend it to others, but only if Marvin Chun or Paul Bloom were teaching it.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend it since Marvin Chun is incredible and the material is very interesting.",
    "definitely take it! it is so much fun and teaches you the psychology you will need in your life no matter what you want to be.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Marvin Chun is a fantastic, engaging teacher. I didn't think I would like psych-- I thought it would all be fancy names for things I knew already-- but I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of things in this class that you either don't know about yourself, or that you don't want to know about yourself. Each lecture changed the way I see the world a little bit. One of most influential, and just generally best, classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, but warn a fellow student that it is not a breeze because there is a lot of reading that is essential to do for being successful. Lectures are very enjoyable and make it worth doing the reading, though.",
    "Psych 110 really is the class that everyone at Yale should take. It's a wonderful marriage of science and social science, real-life psychology studies and theory, and applications with facts. I'm so impressed by how well the class is taught. Marvin Chun is a BOSS at what he does, and it shows in his enthusiasm and passion for psychology. Certainly take the time to meet him outside of class to talk, as he's great to talk to. Overall, you MUST take this class.",
    "A really good introductory psychology class. I would certainly recommend it, you'll learn a lot.",
    "Take it if you've never take Psychology before. Psychology is a fundamental part of a liberal arts education. If you don't take this course you won't understand why that is. If you've taken AP before DON'T TAKE THIS. You will still have to do the reading in order to get even a remotely decent grade so even if you've had the material before it's not a GUT. That said it's an easy class. Chun is the best, but it's not quite an only show up to the lectures, write the papers and take the tests class. If you have already taken Psych, take intro cogsci. Otherwise TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "It's an interesting course but be prepared to do a lot of reading and memorizing.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor Chun! Through this course covers a wide variety of topics at a superficial level, Professor Chun makes the material very interesting and relevant to every day life. In fact, many lectures seem tailored to improving students' lives (sleep, social perception, love, etc.).The course has three midterms and three short papers (500-750 words). It is very low stress, but you must keep up with the readings each week.",
    "Psychology 110 was about people and how their minds work: how they learn, how they behave in groups, how things can go wrong. I would definitely recommend it to anybody: I don't know one person who didn't enjoy the class.",
    "Definitely take this class with Marvin Chun if possible. You'll actually look forward to lectures, the tests are fair, the readings from the textbook are fairly interesting and definitely manageable (about 60\/70 pages a week). You have to write 3 papers that are about 500-750 words (3 pages tops). They are graded very fairly and are designed to only help your grade or keep you where you're at, depending on how much effort you put.I loved that there are no midterm or final -- instead, you have 3 non-cumulative tests. They're not easy tests but they're not impossible...but you do have to study a good amount for them.I feel like I came out learning a lot, Marvin Chun was incredible, and the difficulty level was not too hard and not too easy, TAKE IT!",
    "It is a great introductory class for anyone who wishes to consider psychology as a major.",
    "This is just one of those classes that everyone should take while at Yale -- especially if it is with Professor Chun. While you won't go into much depth, the topics are very interesting and you will begin to see their applicability to nearly every aspect of your life. The class is definitely not a gut, so go to lecture and read the book.",
    "Very interesting class. You have to do a lot of reading unless you want to take the course credit\/d.",
    "My summary of this class is TAKE IT WITH MARVIN CHUN. That's also my recommendation.",
    "Not as great as I was expecting. Yes, Chun is a funny, engaging lecturer. But the class itself wasn't that rewarding. You learn about a bunch of different topics in psychology, kind of superficially. And while the lectures are fascinating, the readings are just tedious and don't always relate to what we are learning in class. Do stay on top of the readings though, because they are lengthy, and are helpful for the tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, its really fun and applicable to whatever field you want to go into.",
    "I would definitely recommend it---it was an incredibly relevant and comprehensive overview of psychology.",
    "It's fun, it isn't a \"gut,\" there is a fair amount of reading, buT it's totally worth it. Take it with Chun if you can.",
    "Psychology 110 takes a broad look at many different parts of psychology and gives you a broad overview such that you can find which area you like and further pursue that in the future. It is a course in which much of the responsibility lies on you - while readings have suggested due dates, the onus is on you to not save all of the readings for the night before the test. That being said, if the readings are done in an organized manner, the workload is completely manageable.I would highly recommend Psychology 110 to another student. Before taking the course, I barely knew what psychology was. Now, after taking only one semester, I am strongly considering a major in psychology and I definitely will continue taking courses in the field.",
    "Very good introduction to Psychology. Not a gut course despite number of people. Lectures are a must to attend.",
    "Great overview of psychology! I definitely recommend it!",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro to Psychology, hands down. One of the most interesting and fun courses I have taken so far at Yale, a class every student will enjoy for sure. There is work fo course for it, and it's serious, but the pleasure you get out of it just makes you wanna go to class every time no matter what. I feel that a lot of the things I learned will never be heard in any other context of my studies at Yale or even my life after college. It's an eye-opening experience, it's one of the courses that make you feel that you are getting a truly unbiased, global education. The information provided is practical for everyday life and knowing it gives you power.",
    "Intro to psych is a course with fun lectures, heavy amounts of reading, and difficult tests. I would recommend this course to students if they are willing to work hard and do the readings. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and I am very pleased with my choice to take it.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great intro to psychology. I really recommend taking this class to other students because it's really interesting at the same time as it is still challenging.",
    "I mean...it's taught by Chun, universally beloved on campus. Why would anyone NOT take it? And it's interesting. Oh, and the guest lecturer who's teaching it next semester was cool.",
    "Great class! Very interesting material, but by no means a gut class. I would definitely recommend to other students but credit\/d is a good option to start this course with.",
    "The course is evaluated through the exams and papers that are scattered throughout the semester. This helps you to keep up to date with all of the course work and means you don't end up cramming hurriedly at the end. Thank God.",
    "Yes. My favorite course this year. Challenging tests but the material is engaging and very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "A lot more work than you might assume, but very engaging",
    "This class was very interesting not just because the videos and surveys shown presented fascinating material but also because so much of the information learned was so applicable to our lives and our daily routines. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning more about how humans interact with society",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a credit\/d\/fail class because it is hard but it is definitely worth taking!!!",
    "Amazing class. Take if with Professor Chun if he still teaches it.",
    "Psych 110 is an extremely interesting course that gives the foundation for many different aspects of psychology and psychological theory. It is certainly not an easy course to ace, but it is well worth the effort.",
    "This class is great! Even if you already took AP Psych, the research Marvin Chun presents is new and interesting. Also, even if you took the AP, you still have to study a lot for the tests. Despite the large class size, the class doesn't feel too big. Marvin Chun does a great job of presenting the material and letting you know how you are doing in the class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Psych 110 for everyone, not just people who want to pursue a psychology major. You really learn in this class that psychology can apply to everything you do in life, and you realize how important it is to have a basic understanding of the field. This class is also taught incredibly well, and will be one of the best classes you will take at Yale for sure.",
    "If you have a chance to take this class, and are remotely interested in psychology, you should try it out! It's a really dynamic and enjoyable class, made all the more so by Professor Chun. The lectures are never boring or dry, and the material covered provides a wide overview of the field of psychology. The reading helps a lot with the tests and isn't too heavy either. I don't think you'll be disappointed after taking this course. It's great.",
    "i would definitely recommend it as very interesting and rewarding.",
    "It was the best class of my freshman fall. I really enjoyed the lectures although they got a little bit boring at the very end. It was very convenient to have three midterms and no cumulative final and three papers were chill. Marvin Chun is the best lecturer ever; he keeps you interested in the material and I was very happy to have him. It's definitely worth taking, even though you are a non-major.",
    "Tons of reading. Fair amount of work but very managable. Overall good class.",
    "Psych 101 is an excellent class! The lectures are always interesting and apply to everyday life. Even if you aren't planning on majoring in Psychology I definitely recommend this class! One warning: there is a lot of reading, so make sure you stay on top of it and don't procrastinate.",
    "Psychology 101 is a great class to take, regardless of whether or not you're actually interested in the field of psychology. It covers a broad spectrum of topics from sleep and stress to the brain. The amount of knowledge you'll gain about how your mind works is priceless.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It was my favorite class this semester.",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially if it's taught by Chun. He makes what is already an interesting subject, very entertaining.",
    "This is a class that everyone needs to take before they leave Yale.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Chun is an amiable and engaging teacher. The material is also very interesting even if you do not plan to major in Psychology.",
    "Don't take it unless you're ready to put in work. Do the reading every week, and you will be fine.",
    "YES - I recommend psych to everyone who asks - it is so interesting!",
    "I would recommend Psychology 110 to a fellow student because it is a really interesting class that has so many applications to daily life. Although the topics explored are not uncommon in general conversation, the depth and perspective from which they were analyzed were very interesting. Do not take this course thinking that it will be an easy grade, the material is not difficult to comprehend, but the amount of reading and the amount of memorization of facts, theories and experiments make studying for the midterms quite tedious and time-consuming. If you have an interest in learning somethings about the field of psychology, by all means take this course but don't go in because other people say you should or for other reasons.",
    "YES!",
    "I recommend this course to anyone and everyone; it's universally relevant, it's fascinating stuff, and it's well-taught. Master Chun is the bomb. His lectures were clear and entertaining, and he is also very accessible and caring. This is not a gut course - there is a fairly substantial textbook, though the readings are usually very interesting - but the assignments and exams are very fair.",
    "A great must-take course: I looked forward to lecture and even to the reading. The material is super-interesting and can be applied to everyday life. I would definitely recommend this class, just be aware that you might not get stellar grades in it.",
    "Amazing course! The lectures are really interesting and geared towards a broad audience, and there's plenty of video clips and demonstrations. There isn't that much work - just 3 papers for us - and the tests are not too tricky if you read the textbook.",
    "In Psychology 110, you will learn three different disciplines in psychology- cognitive psychology, clinical psychology, and social psychology.Yes! And I already have. Even if you don't plan to major in it, much of the material is relevant to us as humans living our lives. Perhaps, explanations for why we act as we do and social trends.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Incredibly interesting class with a fantastic teacher and a manageable workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend it",
    "Yes! As long as they do the reading and keep up with the work, the workload will be manageable.",
    "Intro. to psych covered a wide range of topics in the field of psychology without delving too deep into just one area. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's great for exploring subjects outside of one's major and it is applicable to everyday life.",
    "Great class, difficult class. I would recommend.",
    "Psychology is a very interesting and practical course. Keeping up with readings is crucial, but aside from that Professor Chun and his presentations are the kicker.",
    "The class is great!",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro Psych to any Yale student, no matter the major. The information is intriguing and very helpful in everyday life.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I loved Psych 110 and found the material extremely interesting. It was much more work than I thought and I would have prepared more for the first test if I could have. MARVIN CHUN IS THE BEST!! He is funny and engaging and made psych one of my favorite classes at Yale thus far. TAKE ITTTTT!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking PSYC 110 because it opens a lot of doors in the psychology department. The class is interesting. Don't be worried if you don't do so hot on your first test.",
    "This is a course that you want to take if you've had little to no exposure to psychology. Professor Chun will keep you interested and present a broad range of topics for you to explore. It's not a \"gut\" course at all, but you will not kill yourself by taking it. I highly recommend that others take it.",
    "If Professor Chun is teaching, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! Regardless of your major, intro psych is a fun and interesting class but BE WARNED THIS IS NOT A GUT! The exams test you on both the readings and the lectures which is a lot of material to cover so you actually have to go to class and do the readings if you want to do well.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. But consider taking it credit d--the tests are pretty tough.",
    "Definitely. Must take class! Really. Especially with Marvin Chun. The man's a magician. One class you'll never want to miss.",
    "A great class but I recommend taking it c\/d\/f",
    "FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC. Yes, everyone should definitely take this course. Not only is it fun, it's HIGHLY relevant to your life. Seriously. You there, reading this, you need to audit this class. Do it.",
    "Take this class! It's not the easiest lecture ever, especially if memorizing information isn't your strong suit. But (and it's a big \"but\" -- insert stupid joke here): the material is fascinating, and the professor is unbelievable.",
    "This is a fabulous course that students should take regardless of their major. The material is interesting and can help one understand why people do what they do. Master Chun's lectures made the material even more riveting.",
    "I would recommend Psychology 110 for a fellow student. Although challenging, it is an enjoyable class.",
    "Awesome class. Readings can be long but tests usually focus on lectures and are fair. Only 3 exams and 3 short papers. Very manageable and Prof. Chun makes the class very interesting. Also guest lecturers are quite good.",
    "You should take this class if you are remotely interested in psychology. It is a great class, and is very applicable in everyday life. It covers a lot in psych, and is very interesting even if you don't think you'll pursue a major in psych.",
    "Take it pass\/fail, Marvin Chun is legendary",
    "Marvin Chun was excellent. The course itself, I think, is less engaging because of its superficial nature. Given its scope, you can only go so far into each subject covered. The entire subject of Social Psychology, for example, gets about a week of coverage. The tests are hard, but not too hard. Just do the reading (which can get to be a lot), memorize the bolded terms, and pay attention during lecture. This class is NOT a gut, so for your own sake, don't go into it expecting an A. Also, the three papers evaluating scientific studies just suck to write. I guess it gives you an accurate window into what you'll be doing as a researcher of Psychology, but three evenings were ruined getting this accurate picture. Good thing they're short.",
    "A great class, definitely one to take at some point while you're at Yale. The course is not hard and provides a lot of insightful information. Not having a cumulative final exam bu is also great.",
    "It was definitely the best class I took all semester. While it is slightly difficult to get perfect scores, you learn so much about really interesting things. I would recommend it even for people who aren't considering psychology as a major at all.",
    "Yes. Regardless of whether or not you are considering Psychology as a possible major, PSYCH 110 is a right-of-passage, in a way. You won't regret taking the course. Of course, it's important to realize that the class is not a gut course - you'll have to keep up with readings and prepare well for the exams. However, the material is interesting and relatively straight-forward, so it shouldn't be too hard to stay motivated.",
    "Take this class! Each class is engaging, and you get a sense of the diversity that exists in psychology. Each lecture covers an interesting new topic, and could probably be turned into a class in itself. Many of the topics you cover are applicable to everyday life, and the classes inspired me to do helpful self-reflection, in addition to learning about other people. Marvin Chun is an AMAZING teacher, but even ifhe isn't teaching the class, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Chun's lectures are so fascinating and engaging. The tests and grading are very fair. There can be a lot of reading but most are very interesting. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Please take it - very interesting and thought provoking course.",
    "TAKE IT! TOO BAD THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT IN 2 YEARS SINCE MARVIN CHUN WILL NOT BE TEACHING!",
    "Intro Psych was my favorite class I've taken at Yale, I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. The lectures are incredibly interesting and are so applicable to everyday life, it's definitely the kind of class that I would keep talking about after lecture and I've found information from the class popping up in all aspects of my life. Professor Chun is perfect -- he lectures at a pace slow enough you can fully type your notes, but without ever dragging or becoming dull. He is subtly hilarious and makes lectures as interesting as possible. Also Vera is a terrific TA, she gives very thorough, thoughtful, and helpful notes on the papers. The psych tests are not easy though, and even if you come out of a test feeling confident it is easy to make small but costly mistakes, which can be frustrating. It takes a lot of work and studying to do well in the class, but all the work is interesting and completely worth it.",
    "Take this class before you leave Yale. Should be required as a matter of fact.",
    "A lot of work but a lot of fun!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is a class where you get so caught up in wanting to understand and explore the human mind and body that it doesn't feel like strict learning.",
    "With Professor Chun, this is a must-take class. Part of my enjoyment was based on the fact that I think Psychology is fascinating (even as a CS\/Math major), but he really brought the material to life in a way that I think few professors can. I also love how eager he is to get feedback from students (surveys, etc), and I can see from how he has changed his course over the years that he does respond to the feedback. Simply, Professor Chun is the man, and Intro Psych deserves its reputation. There has been no other class at Yale for which I have been so willing to spend time, and I learned so much because of it.",
    "Take this class. It is one of the best at Yale, hands down. If you are a psychology buff or took the AP course, this class is probably not for you. Professor Chun is amazing, and he will make sure to point out at the beginning of class who should or shouldn't take it. Listen to that, and you'll come to the right decision.",
    "Definitely take PSYC 110, especially with Marvin Chun! Professor Chun is simply the best lecturer I have ever seen, at Yale or elsewhere. His lectures are clear, concise, and engaging; his slides are never text-heavy, and he explains everything very effectively in a way that is both thorough and accessible to anyone regardless of your prior background; the lectures are filled with useful videos, audio clips, demonstrations, animations, and clicker questions; and Chun has an incredible (and self-depreciating) sense of humor that makes the lectures extremely enjoyable. The content itself is incredibly useful to any field of study; if you\u0092re like me and have never learned anything about psychology before, you will come out of this class wanting to be a psych major. The class draws upon hard science, social sciences, current events, and more. The lectures are uncannily applicable to your own life as a Yale student, and you will leave some of the lectures thinking you\u0092ve become a better person: you will learn how to be a better friend, a better parent (perhaps someday), a better clinician (also perhaps someday), etc. One word of caution: getting an A in the class requires doing all the textbook reading, which is quite extensive. You basically cover the entire textbook over the course of the semester, but the textbook by Schacter et al is the most enjoyable, funny, accessible, and well-written textbook I\u0092ve ever read. It\u0092s actually kind of fun to do the reading. That said, if you\u0092re taking the class Credit\/D, you can probably get by without doing any of the reading and just showing up to lecture. The lectures themselves are often like pure entertainment, though you walk away amazed at how much you just learned.",
    "Yes. This is the best course I have taken at Yale. It is amazing that one can take in so much new material from one class and not feel like it was exhausting or demanding. Each class was taught with passion from the teacher and undivided attention from the students. This is a great class.",
    "Introduction to Psychology is a great course that reviews many different topics in Psychology ( I really like that). I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Psychology; so you do not have to plan to major in Psychology to take this class. Of course, if you do want to major in Psychology, this course is a requirement. It is really a course that is open to everyone, but this does not mean you will necessarily get an A in it. There is a lot of reading every week, which can be tiring, but there is almost no homework assignment except for a couple of short research essays.I really enjoyed Psychology 110, and if you have not taken it yet, you should definitely shop it!",
    "The course introduces the study of psychology in general, covering a lot of different topics very fast. I recommend this course only for students who have no knowledge whatsoever about psychology and who wish to gain general knowledge.",
    "A great introduction to the study of psychology. Try to get Professor Chun! He makes the class so much fun and very interesting. Also, the guest lectures are fascinating.",
    "Take it! It has basic knowledge that you need to know for your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 110 with Prof. Chun to other students, regardless of their major. Psychology really is relevant to many aspects of life and academic fields. Every lecture is entertaining and informative; the 75 minutes seem to fly by, and I always wanted it to last longer. It is not a gut class; you do have to read the textbook carefully to do well on the exams. Take this class because it is one of the best lectures at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of whether or not they plan to major in psychology. The material is relevant to any and all aspects of life in general, the lectures never fail to be interesting and engaging, and Professor Chun is brilliant and hilarious!",
    "I would recommend this class, mainly to a student at least somewhat considering psych as a major or at least considering taking some upper-level psych classes. It's also a fairly easy way to fulfill the So requirement, but if you're doing it for that it's very easy to leave the course without retaining much. I feel a little disappointed leaving such a talked-about course with only a cloudy understanding of psych. There are three exams and three papers, no final. Don't stress about the existence of papers as they aren't worth a huge chunk of your grade. The exams cover many specific examples from lecture, but also the reading, which doesn't overlap with lecture much. I read all the necessary reading in the 2 or 3 days before each exam, which worked out fine, but didn't help with retention beyond that exam, which is fine within the course because tests aren't cumulative. I'm worried, though, that I may have made my life a little harder if I end up taking a higher-level psych class. Ultimately, though, being in this class was enjoyable, as Chun is an all-star lecturer and pretty much just talks about whatever he finds most interesting. I also loved writing the papers and got a kick out of finding problems in research to criticize.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, but it is a more demanding course than one would expect.",
    "Even if you aren't particularly interested in psychology or have never been exposed to it, this is an awesome course to take. There is a lot of reading, but it's worth doing, especially since a lot of the material comes up on the tests. The tests are hard but fair. The research papers can be fun if you take the time to find a subject you are interested in, and they aren't time consuming. Every single lecture is worth going to! This class was my favorite this semester. It's a great introduction to psychology, and a lot of the material learned is directly applicable to life! It was a fun class that has already been helpful to me in the real world. :)"
