    "The first half of the course focused primarily on theoretical taxation and labor models (static\/dynamic models, Diamond\/Mirrlees, limited commitment and moral hazard problems, etc.). The second half was more finance focused (and, in my opinion, more interesting), covering topics like bubbles, shadow banking, and portfolio rebalancing. I got a lot of exposure to theoretical economics papers all the way from the mid-20th century to today and got a lot better at reading\/presenting said papers."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, this was a strong course that got better over time. I personally didn't enjoy the first half that much (very theoretical and more pitched towards those interested in public finance\/labor), but the second half of the course was great. It would be nice if this class wasn't lumped in with the Public Finance course for the first half of the semester - I would've really enjoyed covering more topics in private finance \/ topics that were more similar to Math Econ I. The presentation was an effective form of evaluation - it's an essential skill for any economist and was very edifying to prepare for."

   "comments": [
    "This is a solid finale of the Math Econ sequence - I really appreciated the mixture of cutting edge and well-cited papers in this course. If you're interested in macro, finance, or just really like hardcore theoretical economics, this is a good option. The workload was very reasonable, yet the class was still challenging, engaging, and informative."
