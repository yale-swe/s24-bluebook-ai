    "You have to take it for the major",
    "It's required for graduation, so there's no way around it. It's a pretty laid back thesis, just make sure to stay on track to finish by the deadline, which isn't hard. The thesis advisors are all very accessible, so take advantage of them. They're all willing to give feedback if you want it.",
    "Organizational meeting in the beginning of the semester. 4000 word literature review on a topic on choice, followed by 10-15 minute presentation on the topic.",
    "You have to take it, but keep in mind these things: 1) Depending on your advisor, don't expect much help and support. I finished my rough draft before the deadline and my advisor refused to read it and give me feedback so I can get in another draft. 2) You don't meet that often, so don't expect much help (unless you really ask for it). I have friends who struggled through topics and changed last-minute because of a lack of help from their advisors. 3) The presentations can be annoying if you pick a topic that isn't purely biochemistry. Very little direction is given, and no one is as \"enthusiastic\" about your project if you pick a project more closely aligned to medicine or other topics (and their intersection with MB&B). 4) You don't get to pick your advisor. 5) Just pick a project that interests you. Read through papers and, if you're not tired\/confused\/bored out of your mind by the third one, you may have found yourself a topic.",
    "One of the chillest senior projects at Yale.",
    "Required for the major. Super chill since you only have to write a fairly short report and make a presentation based on this report. Professor Sung was a great adviser, extremely helpful and responsive.",
    "If you're an MB&B major, you have to take this as a senior requirement. Compared to the senior thesis requirements of other majors, this is fairly simple! It's definitely doable if you put in the work (and do so before the night before your draft is due!)",
    "You need to take this class. Work on the papers before spring break and try to talk to your adviser about it. Or, work over spring break a little bit. Don't leave everything for the last minute, it gets too hectic.",
    "You write a paper on a topic of your choice and present it to the group... pretty chill thesis",
    "A nice way to end your MB&B career. Not as bad as a thesis but still a lot of work.",
    "Super chill 15-pg paper and 15-min presentation. Its a great opportunity to delve deep into a topic of interest.",
    "Chill.",
    "If MB&B hasn't changed its policy by the time you read this, your advisor will be randomly assigned to you. Once you find out who the options are, if you feel strongly about wanting\/not wanting a specific advisor, make this clear to the instructors! It could make a big difference.",
    "It's a very straight forward literature review that you need to graduate. Nothing much more to say.",
    "This class sucks. It isn't even a class, it's just turning in a paper and giving a presentation. It wasn't hard and I enjoyed reading about my topic, but it felt really useless and like a stupid formality to getting my degree. The paper is shorter than many research papers and proposals I've written in other science classes. There's very little real guidance. Konigsberg was useless. He only provided grammar edits on my paper. The extent of feedback I received for my content was, \"This is a very interesting and complex topic.\" He then asked questions on my presentation that were out of the scope of my project. If you're an MBB major, you're going to take this class because you have to. If you care about writing a good paper, I'd recommend meeting with the advisors late first semester and trying to pick a good one (I heard Karla was good, Sung only took 2 people, and Scott's name is just on this class because Yale wants to pretend he still teaches) and then try to convince them they should be your advisor. If you don't care, you can easily write this paper after spring break before the draft deadline, receive minor edits, and do fine in the \"class\".",
    "Senior research review article.",
    "You have to take it if you're MB&B. It's very low-key and I wrote most of mine over spring break (but start early if you can!)."
