   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class but with the caveat that unless you are familiar with both the literature and history of EME, you might be lost half the time in class. It was great, however, to not just look at the writing of the books but their physical construction and appearance.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, but only to students hoping to work in this period. It presents enormously helpful material, but it's difficult to pigeonhole. To describe it, I'd say the class gives one various filters through which to approach the early modern period. With these in place, certain phrases and ideas - certain words - light up in a way they never would otherwise.",
    "The professors are AMAZING but the material is pretty boring (middle english dictionaries...)Great to have a seminar experience with them but maybe consider doing something else.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. There is a lot of reading, but the only workthat is due is a medium sized term paper, that was actually very enjoyable to write. It can be about anything you wish to write about, and the professors are open to anything you find interesting (within reason.) If you expect wild, passionate back and forth class discussion, you won't find it here, but if you are looking for a relaxed seminar with two amazing professors, and the chance to play with some of Yale's amazing Early Modern book collection, absolutely take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you want to listen to two great teachers come together and talk about all kinds of early modern topics. There's a lot of reading but its all very interesting.",
    "An excellent way for Yale English literature students to access history, to access context -- something we don't do most of the time. Professors Kastan and Wrightson prove excellent foils to each other, moreover. The fact that the seminar was, in the end, primarily lecture makes me wonder whether it might be better taught as a small lecture course."
