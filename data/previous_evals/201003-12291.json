    "You probably don't have a choice about taking this. It's fine. We read Livy's History of Rome (or as much as we could get through, i.e. about a third of book one).",

    "I would recommend this class because it is great practice in Latin reading, interesting material, and overall a fun class.",
    "A good introduction to unedited, real Latin prose. Depending on what this and L3 Poetry will be reading, make a choice based on content. Not a lot of surprises for anyone who has taken L2."
