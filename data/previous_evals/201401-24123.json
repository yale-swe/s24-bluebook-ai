    "Great course with interesting up to date relevant topics which are in the news discussed regularly in class.",
    "Strengths - really interesting topic, nice to hear from other speakers, assignments were all meaningfulWeaknesses - some of the topics were too clinical\/not interesting, but that is more of a personal opinion, I understand that the class needs to address a wide range of topics",
    "This was a great course to learn about heart disease and stroke. But even more, it is an opportunity to critically analyze articles and apply epidemiology knowledge to specific topics. The guest speakers were excellent as well. The only thing I think could be changed is earlier posting of the articles and discussion questions (primary applies to the first few weeks of the course).",
    "I thought this course did a good job outlining the issues with epi research in cardiovascular disease and presented the practical ways that these issues are dealt with in the research community.",
    "Instructor was very knowledgeable and encouraging. Lecture material was engaging. Guest lecturers were well-selected.Paper assignments could have been more interesting\/specific.",
    "I enjoyed the course throughout this semester very much.",
    "The class was very good and gave great coverage of a wide variety of topics related to heart disease and stroke epidemiology. I feel very knowledgable about a topic that I knew little of before starting this class. It could be improved by having more consistent student involvement in class, but I'm not sure how. Professor Lichtman certainly made every effort to increase participation!",
    "Great course about heart disease and stroke. A little too clinically based. I would have liked to learn more about the psychosocial and environmental aspects of heart disease and stroke in lecture."

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Professor Lichtman is so amazing! Great attitude, loves to teach and it truly shows. Would love to be in another course taught by her. Also appreciate the fact that she keeps up actively participating.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0She is really sweet and engaging - tries hard to get the class to participate and involved. Her feedback was always helpful and she actually cared about her students doing well\/getting something out of the class",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Judy is so wonderful, and one of my favorite professors at YSPH. She's always willing to meet and provide feedback. I liked that we were required to submit ungraded drafts of our final paper, it made writing the final product in the middle of exam week so much easier.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Great, really made us put our thinking caps on and kept the entire course interactive.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman was great - she's done a ton of research in this field and we really benefited from her experiences in doing the work. She also gave fantastic intermediate feedback on the final paper, which helped me to conceptualize the study that I was planning in a new light.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Instructor was very knowledgeable and encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0I love the approaches the instructor used to teach this course! She often raised critical questions in public health and epi research during class which got us think deeper about research and prevention. Her insights and feedback are always very thoughtful and practical for future applications.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Professor Lichtman was always very excited about the material and her enthusiasm was infectious. Her lectures covered a lot of material, but was also sufficiently detailed. She taught the material very well.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Very approachable and sweet instructor. She had great feedback and was always willing to meet with students."
