    "I would suggest this course to others because it promotes healthy discussion of published materials.",
    "I think it is a good way to take an in depth look at various concepts of cell biology. While it cannot be comprehensive, it does a good job of highlighting major areas of study.",
    "I would recommend this class to other cell biology students, as well as those who may not have the most extensive cell biology background because the discussions in class and the interactions with instructors who are experts in these areas can help guide you through unfamiliar territory.Each week we discussed one or two papers and the discussions for several weeks would be focused on a particular area (i.e. the endocytic pathway). Students took turns leading discussions with the help of instructors. Each week a one-page summary of the reading was required.",
    "I would summarize as in Question 1.Yes, I would recommend it because I am glad I took it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course."
