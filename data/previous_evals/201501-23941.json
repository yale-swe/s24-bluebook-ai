    "Excellent seminar course with fascinating readings!",
    "This is one of those classes where you will get a lot out of it providing you do the readings. It depends on your classmates and class discussion whether or not class will be an enriching experience for you. Janna and Jessica are very sweet (they bring candy!), but take time to harvest their expertise, as they spend most of class listening and asking the group questions. The exercise of leading your own class discussion is a valuable one, but absolutely amazing was the childcare visit exercise.",
    "This class is amazing. If you have any interest in public policy, social justice, feminism, politics, non-profit work, economics...you should take this course. The gender balance of our class was really skewed toward females, but contained a really wide range of interests and academic focuses, which made discussion really interesting. Janna and Jessica are probably two of the coolest, most knowledgable, and inspiring instructors you will ever have (and they bring snacks to class!).",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale- I enjoyed coming every week! I highly recommend. If you get in, do us all a favor and take it. Especially if you're a dude. P.S. There are snacks! (It's a class about kids!)",
    "Don't be mistaken (like I was): This is not a comprehensive course on childcare, public policy, and society. It's a class about how to bring access to education to low-income populations in the United States. Don't get me wrong -- this is an important issue, and one that certainly deserves a whole semester's worth of conversations and debates. But, that's not quite what the syllabus advertises, and so I wish I had known what I was getting into after shopping period. Besides a couple of the early sessions when we did discuss the psychology of learning and some issues related to gender roles, every seminar dissolved into a discussion about poverty in the United States. If that's something you're passionate about, and if you believe that education holds the solution, then this class is perfect for you. Even if you're remotely interested in this subject, I think this class is worthy of a try. It's pretty laid back for a seminar. The workload is more than manageable, and the professors are really supportive to whatever final project you want to take on. I don't regret taking the class, but it's also not quite what the syllabus makes it seem, so just be warned.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class. It has shaped my understanding not only of the topic of childcare in the US, but also broadened my understanding of policy and human service systems in this country.",
    "Unique class that is definitely worth it! Jessica and Janna are great but have very different skill sets (they give off a Ms Peach\/Ms Plum vibe), but this is good for the class and give unique perspectives on the subjects. This is an understudied and undervalued topic that is great for policy discussion. Also, the feeling in the room is very laid back and open. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to most Yale students. It helped me to recognize the importance of child care as an issue. The class is relevant to policy, politics, economics, and psychology. Childcare is much more interdisciplinary than I ever thought.",
    "This is a fantastic course taught by two incredible people! The readings were really interesting, and the conversation was very thought provoking. Definitely would recommend!",
    "If you are reading this review, you should take this class. I heartily recommend it to anyone with any interest in the subject. Janna & Jessica are, without a doubt, the best seminar leaders I have ever had. They ask questions that get to the heart of the matter, and often share their own valuable insight but really allow the discussion to be student-directed. Nearly everyone participates, which is a refreshing change from many seminars. The class is structured so that it is well-paced and interesting--student discussion leaders ask questions at the beginning, Janna and Jessica follow up with a few of their questions and another discussion ensues, and at the end they often have a thoughtful exercise planned (for instance, working on one's own to design an ideal early childhood classroom, or working in a group to decide how to allocate a certain amount of state funds for early childhood programs). The papers are not difficult, but they are valuable and make you think. You are given a lot of flexibility as to what you want to write about, and Janna + Jessica give you great guidance on your final paper topic. You don't have to be interested specifically in education, or in policy--if you are interested in children at all, even a little bit, you will love this class.",
    "This class reviews several aspects of early childhood education adn child care, through the lens of a variety of actors - policy makers, the government, parents, child care providers, and of course the children themselves. You will leave with a far better understanding of the in and outs of early childhood educaiton and child care from a political, social, ethical, and financial perspective."
