   "comments": [
    "I really liked this course in general. It would be helpful to have a lab and to give students more experience with coding and working in groups. Relative to other classes, this class did not require a lot of time or effort, so I don't think it would be unreasonable to have more assignments and work required. Additional assignments could help to reinforce the development of new skills.",
    "Excellent introduction and assessment of qualitative methods. Would have liked more instruction on how to use coding software, and a group assignment for coding (in lieu of individual assignment) since that would be closer to real life scenario. Some of the assignments were unclear in terms of their details (not the goals of the assignments). Could also be worth while to conduct mock interview\/focus group or observe a video of a good example. Would have like a bit more depth on HOW to integrate quantitative with qualitative. But recognizing the time constraint, I thought this course met all of its objectives and was a great overview. Would be great to get the word out more about qualitative methods!!",
    "Strengths - great skill set to have!weaknesses a lab component was much needed",
    "Really loved the course. Learned a lot about qualitative and mixed methods to bring back to my own research. Very flexible and attentive to the students needs and interests.",
    "Great course",
    "strengths: this is an incredibly useful class and I am so happy I got to attend it!Dr CUrry is obviously the guru to learn it from, it was such an honor to learn from her!the choice of material was great! published articles (less the textbook , was not so practical) and own materials were very very useful.weakness: I wish we had more homework!I wish at the end of this course I were more confident that I can do this type of work by myself. I hope next class will offer group practice, more assignmentsI also wish the feedback were offered sooner in the course, so we had time to improve ourselves.",
    "The level of material was very interesting and we learned a wide range of qual applications. The assignments themselves did not seem optimal, but the professor seems to be working on that for next year.",
    "This was a great course, and well facilitated by Professor Curry. I enjoyed her ability to teach a wide-array of students and auditors from various backgrounds. The assignments were long and difficult, but useful. She was very open to feedback, so I am confident she will turn any weaknesses into strengths with the next course she teaches.",
    "Strengths: good overview of a very useful skillset not covered in other YSPH courses, knowledgable instructor, interesting readings, and some applicationWeaknesses: This course could really benefit from both a lab component and more hands on experience actually conducting qualitative data collection and analyzing the data. Also, the material and examples used in the course are very much focused on quality assessment at the hospital level. We see very little of how these methods can be applied in other settings."

    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Very approachable and knowledgeable. Did a great job of bringing her own work into the class as an example, and encouraging students to do the same.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Thumbs up. Like a mother figure!",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie was an excellent instructor. She was consistently well-prepared for each discussion (with great examples from literature and her own work). I really appreciated how much she desired our input and feedback. It was a pleasure to be in her class.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Amazing!",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie is amazing. She is an inspiration to all of us. Her passion is obvious, and she is great at explaining sometimes confusing\/daunting qualitative methodologies. Loved her.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Did an excellent job.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Fenomenal! Fabulous!Extremely engaging, knows her stuff cold, after all she developed most of it, it was an amazing experience! Very generous with feedback!",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Wonderful, engaged teacher. Incredibly knowledgeable on the topic and was a pleasure to take the course with.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie Curry is a great professor: funny, intelligent, personable, able to laugh at herself, and really receptive to feedback. She is very easy to reach via email and available for meetings. Her experience really shows during class, she is a true expert in this field and taught the course flawlessly.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Strengths: Lively, friendly, very knowledgeable, draws from a wealth of experience conducting qualitative and mixed methods research.Weaknesses: Sometimes lacks confidence in the classroom, e.g. comments such as \"I could be wrong\" and \"I don't really know, but...\" and \"this is probably a bad example, but...\"Also, the instructor always had to rush to another course after ours and could rarely stay after class to answer questions, though she did her best to answer as many as possible quickly. It would be useful to have established instructor office hours. I definitely would have used them."

    "Neel was a good TA. He made himself available for questions and discussion, and was helpful in going through the coding software, although we didn't have opportunity to use it further. I think it would have been better for him to lead a section rather than hold office hours, so that we could go through certain things as a class rather than one-on-one. (Much of the benefit of this course was to engage with the other students about their work.)",

He was also well organized and built up a good bank of resources for students.Weaknesses: He seemed to lack confidence in his own excellent knowledge and experience! I think the class could have benefited from more in-class contribution from Neel."
