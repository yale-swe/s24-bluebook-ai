    "I would definitely recommend this course, but be warned that there is a heavy emphasis on art and photography. The material was all very interesting, the readings were excellent, and my perspective on the settlement of North America was greatly changed. However, the exams were definitely tough.",
    "This is a good class if you're into the subject matter. Wasn't really my thing, so about half-way through the semester I started skipping lecture quite a bit. Also, it's far, far too much work, for both a grade and Cr\/D. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're an American Studies major or something--in which case, full steam ahead! Prof. Faragher is a good lecturer, for all that I wasn't wild about the class.",
    "I really liked this course. Lectures were incredible; section was really well utilized. The only real weakness that I can think of is that it's a LOT of work for a lecture-based course: the midterm and final exams extremely required extensive memorization, which I found annoying. Also, the term paper was a significant amount of work. If you take this class, try to get SIGMA as your TA - she's super nice, understanding, and smart.",
    "YES. Take this course if you have any interest in how the West has shaped American history and modern culture. It'sso much more than a survey of events that happened in the trans-Mississippi region. It discusses the West as an idea of frontier and how the myth of the West has become ingrained in who we are. I'm an engineering major and took this Cr\/D\/F on a whim because I'm from California, and absolutely loved it. The exams and paper are not too difficult. So rewarding. Made me rethink my major choice.",
    "Definitely take this class. Cool material and light workload.",
    "It is well worth taking. A really excellent class. Maybe Cr\/D? though I took it for a grade as a second semester senior and didn't find the work to be onerous--just a couple days of major studying before midterm and final. Really not to be missed.",
    "Take this class- the exams are a little, say, silly, but it's the American Best.",
    "A great class! Very interesting. Lecture can sometimes seem long, but overall Professor Faragher is engaging and his classes are more like \"story-telling\" than lecturing.There are only 3 assignments- midterm, term paper, and final. There is a good amount of memorization required for the midterm and final, but if you keep up with readings and\/or go to class, it is not difficult to study for the exams.I would definitely recommend this course. I learned so much about the West -- I might even hike the Grand Canyon this summer. Inspired!",
    "This is an excellent class that will make you see this country in a new light. Highly recommended.I ignored a lot of the advice and took it cr\/d\/f. If you do that, you'll still have to go to class, etc., because the exams are very thorough and it seems like it would be very easy to fail them if you don't study. But if you're prepared to pass, you'll probably get a good grade anyway. I didn't really read the secondary books, but I now realize I could've gotten away with that even if I'd taken it for a grade. Bottom line is, only take this credit\/d if you're willing to work relatively hard anyway, and just don't want the class to affect your GPA (i.e. if an A- will hurt you).",
    "If you like history and are interested in the story behind American colonization then definitely take it. But be prepared to study a lot for midterm and final.",
    "A strong lecture course which approaches the history of the West from many different perspectives and mediums. Not an easy course, but certainly a manageable one and worth attending class, doing the small amount of reading, etc. Focus on images--if you like talking about\/interpreting art, you'll love this class (if you're generally neutral towards art like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how interesting the image discussion is). The textbook is interesting but covers much of the same material as lecture, and the other readings are generally engaging and not too long. Term paper allows you to write on any topic that interests you (incorporating primary sources, which is a lot of fun). Only negative to this course is the insane amount of information required for the midterm and the final--frustrating, but if you've got a good short term memory, you'll be fine.",
    "Yes, I would solidly recommend it, with one reservation: it'll take more work than you expect. The paper requires significant primary and secondary source research and the exams demand a good amount of studying. But beyond that, it will challenge almost everything you've ever thought you knew about American history. It's a good way to be disturbed.",
    "A very good survey of the American West and its role in American history from precolonial times to the present. Faragher is an amazing lecturer--clearly knows what he's talking about and is passionate about teaching it to you. I looked forward to every lecture. The workload is light for a history course, mostly textbook reading with an occasional primary-source book. The term paper is great because it forces you to use the Beinecke's massive amount of primary material, which is something everyone should do before they graduate here. Exams are challenging, but totally worth it when all is said and done. Overall, a great lecture course.",
    "AmWest seems great at first. Its a class designed to shop really well; it generally has a great reputation, the first for lectures are interesting, and the textbook seems enjoyable. But don't be fooled. The nascent feeling of confusion youll indoubtedly start to feel into the third lecture will only grow as Farragher's confusing and unorganized lectures will seriously start getting on your nerves. Also, this course has way too much required reading to ever complete. You'll stop trying to get it all done after the fifth week. The midtemr and the final require a ton of memorization, i've warned you now, and too much of the grading relies on getting a good TA, so shop sections at the beginning fo the semester.",
    "I'd never taken a history class before this one, but I'm glad I did: I would really recommend it if you want a look at how Western history has shaped American history. John Mack Faragher is a boss \u0097 he's a great lecturer that's really passionate about the subject. The images he uses in the class slideshows are really interesting, and a lot of the visual history that he discusses is really applicable to all the events we studied. The workload isn't unreasonable if you go to lectures and do at least some of the reading:\u00a0section, midterm, paper, and final. Take it!",
    "Recommend. Straightforward assignments and fair grading (at least with my TF). Tests involve a lot of memorization (including images) but don't end up being too bad.",
    "This is a great class. What you get out of the class depends on how much work you do for it. Some people got by without doing a lot of work (and for them it made a great fifth class), and some did more work. It makes a great class to balance out a schedule heavy with math and science classes.",
    "This class is the best I've taken in 4 years at Yale. The course begins with the Spanish conquest of the New World and develops with French, English, and Russian presence in North America; the great western trails; native American relations; the gold rush and development of the railroad; homesteading; development of the cowboy; Alaska; and the myth of the west in literature and film. John Mack Faragher is a wonderful lecturer and clearly has a passion for this material. His textbook is actually fun to read, and the other course readings are good too. The defining characteristic of the class is that the focus is exclusively on images; Faragher assembles ~60 images for a lecture and teaches the history behind what they depict. This is great to see in lecture, but it also means that the exams will test your knowledge of these photographs, paintings, woodcarvings, etc. The workload of the course is split between section reading and participation, a midterm, final, and a final 10-page paper. The midterm has a big time crunch on it (10 IDs, 5 images, and an essay in 50 min), but the final is much more reasonable. For the IDs and images, you definitely need to memorize the year\/author\/work that the image comes from for full credit, but it's not that bad since you're given a comprehensive review sheet before the exam. Despite the workload, the course is phenomenal and witnessing the various themes of American history being expressed in different situations is a sight to behold.",
    "Just not a great course - take Civil War in the fall instead. I guess I just don't feel like I came out of this course learning anything - we all know the West is mythologized.",
    "The American West covers the late 15th century to the late 20th century. You will explore different meanings of the words \"west\" and \"frontier\" and explore these concepts as a place of cultural encounter\/exchange\/mixing and as a powerful ideological force in American history and culture. There is a lot of reading, but it's doable, and you get a lot out of lecture.",
    "Faragher structures his lectures around images of the West. He's an excellent lecturer. The readings are primarily a textbook he wrote which is very informative and easy to read. Also some primary source readings which are good although can feel a bit rushed.",
    "I would recommend this class to a history student, but I'm not sure otherwise. The midterm and final rely heavily on memorization, and I would never recommend this for an easy class.",
    "American West is a very good history lecture. However, you should really go to the first few classes to see if you like Prof Faragher's lecturing style, which I know not everyone enjoyed. He essentially has a script from which he reads. Granted, it is engaging and follows a fluid narrative. I found that I enjoyed the class but it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Writing the paper was a great experience as we were all highly encouraged to delve into primary sources at the Beinecke, which I had never done before and found to be a fulfilling exercise. The exams are straightforward but reply substantial preparation and memorization. If that's your jam, this is a great class!",
    "I would recommend this class to people who really enjoy US history. It's not a lot of work but the midterm and final have an ABSURD amount of information of memorization.",
    "Be wary of the amount of reading, and the survey nature of the class. it is jumpy, it does not focus on one area, not even the west. it spans centuries in the same lecture, does not form around themes in particular, and generally is scattered.",
    "This class gives you a great deal of insight into the history of the American West in aspects that you would normally not see in a normal American history class. We read great primary sources that were absolutely intriguing, and Faragher's text book was great as well. Lectures were pretty interesting, and I loved doing the research paper! The exams were mostly about memorizing, which sucked at the time, but overall were okay.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I absolutely LOVED it!",
    "Great history class, a Yale classic. Faragher is inspiring, although a littledry at times. Workload isn't too bad, a lot of reading, with lots of ID memorization concentrated before the midterm and the final. YOU WILL NEED TIME TO MEMORIZE. Make sure you have it. Term paper is pretty interesting, meet with your TA to make sure it's a good topic.",
    "Take it. It's incredibly interesting and a great C\/D\/F to take senior year",
    "Yes! Take it if you are interested in thinking about American history in a new way and especially if you like art. There is a lot of art and it's kind of like an art history class in terms of memorizing images and dates for the exams. I found it extremely rewarding!",
    "TAKE IT. YOU MUST BEFORE YOU GRADUATE.",
    "Yes- history 141 is a great course for people who are very interested in art, because it really uses paintings and pictures to capture historical movements. The reading is sufficient but not overwhelming.",
    "i would totally recommend it--you learn so much about the West",
    "This is the only history class I've taken at Yale, but it was a lot of fun, interesting, and not too much work. I would recommend it to every Yalie.",
    "Fantastic lectures with ties to visual and primary resources than you'll find in a typical history course. Midterm and final require A LOT of memorization.",
    "absolutely, for american history students this class is a must.",
    "American West is an interesting class to take if you're AmStud or History and want to learn about American expansion West. Professor Faragher really knows what he's talking about, and the workload isn't too bad (although the midterm is a bit rough!)",
    "Professor Faragher is a brilliant lecturer who keeps attention constantly! I love him and would take any class he teaches!",
    "Great class, not your standard history course. The American West is a fascinating and important part of our nation's history, and something that most yalies would enjoy learning about from Faragher.",
    "Definitely take American West! The lectures are really interesting and well done, section is fun, and the tests and paper don't take all that much work. The course covers everything from the first discovery of America to modern times, and Professor Faragher takes a lot of trouble to look atall angles of colonization. He uses lots of images (many of which you'll need to know for the tests), so it can be a little like an art history class at times.",
    "Yes, if you truly enjoy the history of the American West and want to learn what they don't teach you in American history classes-like how screwed up Americans were to basically all ethnic minorities.",
    "This is basically an art history course with a lot of reading that examines the west, from America as the 'final frontier' to the west coast to Alaska.",
    "Yes! Interesting subject matter taught by an engaging professor.",
    "This class seemed good in the first few lectures but quickly became incredibly boring. Professor Faragher is incredibly nice (really, a great guy), but his lectures were not invigorating. I did learn a lot, but I thought it was going to be way better. Oh, and the midterm and the final were literally rote memorization and a nightmare to deal with. Plus a final paper on top of that? Save yourself the trouble and take something else.",
    "The American West is a lecture class that takes you through the history of the American West, from colonial times up to modern day. Lectures are fascinating, and Faragher is a great speaker. The midterm and the final are pretty rough in the amount of memorization they require (you have to memorize some 150 terms and images), but it's well worth taking, and the readings aren't too bad.",
    "American Studies 141 01 is a great history course for any student that wants to learn about the USA and our fascination with the West. I would highly recommend this class to any student, no matter what major.",
    "Yes. This will completely alter your perception of the American identity, de-mythologizing it, and perhaps freeing you... Also just super fascinating."
