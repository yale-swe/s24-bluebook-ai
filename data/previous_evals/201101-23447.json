    "Weakness: no labs. labs in other courses really helped me to solidify the concepts I learned in class.",
    "All of the guest speakers were the primary strength of this course. I think, however, some of the speakers were somewhat tangential and maybe to specialized for this type of course.",
    "This class is not incredibly interesting or engaging, but it does cover important material for future epidemiologists. Also, it was nice to have a number of different speakers come in to talk about their research and types of challenges they face.",
    "Dr. Ma is great but I'm not sure why we have this class",
    "Overall it provides a good summary of the many kinds of measurement issues. However, I do not feel the subject material is new enough after taking Epi 1 and 2 to justify a separate class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course; it benefited from having various guest lecturers talk about their expertise. I enjoyed the time slot of the course, as well. The instructor was very encouraging and helpful- she always provided relevance to our internships\/careers from class topics. I think this is a great course, not only for CDE and SBS students, but other disciplines would benefit as well.",
    "You learn a lot about the different measurement issues that are involved in chronic disease epi. The weeks with topics you are interested in are great and very informative but the weeks with topics you aren't interested in are tougher to pay attention to. There is a wide range of material covered in the course.",
    "The course gave a good overview of measurement issues in chronic disease epidemiology. The lectures covered a wide array of topics without getting too deep into any one area. I enjoyed the readings but did not feel that we got the chance to dig into them and discuss.",
    "Measurement Issues in Chronic Diseases was a great class for really critically analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different types of research studies. It was a good class to take concurrently with Epidemiology II and really refined my skills in understanding the methods and design of studies. I wish there were more exercises involving reading articles and talking about them in class. More discussion would be nice.",
    "A professor who cares about the topicExcellent guest lecturers who are able to provide great prospectiveGreat flexibility in working our \"homework\" and assignments which allowed us to explore our own interests.Sometimes the didactic sessions are too much didactic and a bit less interactive. However the class is large.",
    "many of the speakers were the same as those in our CDE\/SBS seminar so at times it felt like a waste of time.",
    "This course provides a good overview of various measurement issues. Guest lectures were interesting and relevant.",
    "interesting, challenging, relevent topics reviewed and discussed by people in the field"

    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is very nice. She does a good job of organizing the course so many different topics are discussed. She also does a good job in scheduling guest speakers from all sorts of backgrounds and specialties. Some of the lectures seemed really long and drawn out and it was difficult to see the parallel and\/or relevance to the homeworks sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is very smart, and she taught the information effectively. It was nice to have other presenters for many weeks as well.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She does a nice job but I question the purpose of the class",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She's a wonderful person with such a big heart and a genuine desire to help everyone learn.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was excellent. She shares her real-life experiences in class which makes the issues being discussed more pertinent. She was very receptive to students and gave excellent feedback.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Prof. Ma was very helpful and knowledgeable. At times the lectures were a bit dry, but I felt she did her best to bring in real life examples etc.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was an excellent instructor. She was very helpful during office hours and really made an effort to meet with students last minute. I thought she was very knowledgeable on the course material. I appreciated the use of slides in lecture for guidance and not to read off of.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is very approachable and happy to answer students' concerns and questions if you make the time to meet with her.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent unstructor who clearly cares about the class. Well organized.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was always enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material. There were a few sessions where it was more lecture than interaction, but otherwise I have no suggestions.I appreciated Dr. Ma's willingness to answer questions on the course material both in class and during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0very invested in the students learning the challenges of performing research, appreciate the way we were challenged to identify\/improve upon current methods."

   "comments": [
    "Even though the presentation part of the course may be intimidating to some, it nevertheless helped me to learn much more about designing a study, and it is not as easy as criticizing one.",
    "This course introduces various measurement issues as it relates to certain exposures and diseases.",
    "It's a good course that highlights all of the challenges that come with doing epidemiological research. It's not tons of fun, but you learn a lot.",
    "The class could use some central notes or text. It is piecemeal and I did not walk away with much beyond what was already being learned in epi 1 and 2. Not a criticism of Dr. Ma, but rather the purpose of the class in general",
    "I liked the fact that the midterm and finals were take home, allowing students to think more about the essays. Also, I really enjoyed the student presentations. They were probably the best part of the course- it was interesting to hear what others came up with, and was a challenging but exciting assignment.",
    "It's required for CDEs so there isn't really a choice. The assignments are helpful for learning how to critique epi papers. There are no tests which is great.",
    "The course provides a good overview but does not go into any one subject at length. The information is useful and applicable to those who want to pursue research, but it is at times a bit dry.",
    "Measurement Issues in Chronic Diseases discusses in detail the strengths and weaknesses of epidemiologic design and analyses. I would definitely recommend this class for all students that plan to work in epidemiologic research.",
    "This is a good course on an important topic. I would recommend this course to others.",
    "This is a good overview for first year students about the issues of chronic disease measurement epi. It is both confusing and enlightening, as Dr. Ma explained in the last class session.",
    "very good class, very relevant to future work in clinical reserach"
