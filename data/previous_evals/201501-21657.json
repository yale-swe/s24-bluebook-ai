    "Can be a tough transition following the laid-back nature of the fall, but I learned a ton of useful new things in terms of computer generated representation.",
    "It didn't blow my mind but it was fun and not too hard.",
    "You've made it! Buckle down for the roller coaster that is Steven Harris....but in all reality, it's your last semester. Do it for yourself. Throw yourself into the work like you never have, push yourself to tackle all of the detail problems you've ignored so far, explore new materials, and most of all make yourself proud, no matter how the studio ends up going. Take the time to bond with your studio, don't stress too much about job stuff, and get to know Steven and Marta. They're pretty great.",
    "I ended up producing a lot less than I wanted to because I was stuck in a rut, listening to what Marta and Steven thought I should do, which never lined up with what I wanted to do, so I would say do whatever you want and just make it look nice because prettiness is the key thing we were taught to do here.",
    "This studio was my favorite of any that we had during our time in the architecture major. I was surprised to feel this way at the end of the term, especially because many people had warned that this semester could be frustrating, but I rarely felt any frustration. It's good to treat this course as an opportunity to make the best work that you can, not just in service of your senior project, but also because you've come a very long way and learned a lot during the last several years! Steven and Marta are also incredible instructors. Marta provided a good historical frame in her lectures with which we worked on our projects, and Steven has so much useful knowledge as a prolific and practicing architect. Take advantage of these two as resources during the term. It's important to develop a project that you feel strongly about, but also be willing to accept the feedback of your instructors who know so, so much about the thing that they're trying to teach you. Really what I'm trying to say is: make good work and get as much teaching as you can from your instructors. You'll be very proud of your body of work at the end of the semester.",
    "It's studio. You know the drill. It's great to spend so much time on the same project and really start thinking about details for the first time. Your experience will really depend on what project Steven chooses. Ours was a cemetery off the coast of Miami and it was AMAZING. Also, studio trip - highlight of my time at Yale.",
    "Despite what you may have heard, Steven is not a heartless monster. He was actually one of my favorite professors at Yale. He is wonderfully fabulous, with a great sense of humor, and Marta is a great balance to his more eccentric side. You will learn a lot of presentation skills from your TAs and become marginally more employable. If you're lucky you will have the opportunity to fly out to a warm place for a weekend in February. This was a fun studio and I'm glad to be graduating with this class.",
