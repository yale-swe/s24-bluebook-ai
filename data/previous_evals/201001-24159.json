    "Hopefully by the time you take this, the course will have more structure to it. That said, if you want to learn how to read and comprehend Modern Standard Arabic, then take 140. We read several short stories and did a lot more listening drills than the previous levels, which I found beneficial. We also had to read science fiction stories in groups, which was a waste of time because you aren't really going to need to know many of those words, but perhaps those won't be a part of the syllabus next year. Overall it wasn't very much work. Quiz every week, core conversation to be memorized every week, and some reading. Very manageable and the vocab from the short stories is helpful if you're hoping to be able to read newspapers\/listen to the news.",
    "Arabic 140 is all about learning vocab and reading genuine texts. There's no grammar.I would recommend it if you have to take it for your major, and only then.",
    "Watch out. Don't take it if you don't need it and aren't willing to make the time commitment because it's crazy, and your grade will suck otherwise. The good thing is that if you do well, it's 1.5 credits which is weighted more on your GPA.",
    "Though you may be tempted to stop at L3, L4 is significantly better.You focus on practical skills. There isn't a lot of grammar, so all of your attention is on developing reading and writing skills and vocabulary acquisition. Certainly not a flawless curriculum, but has great potential.",
    "you will learn arabic, but probably not in the most efficient way possible. if you want to learn the language, you don't have much choice and i wouldn't let the disorganization of the department scare you away if you are interested,",
    "Despite the daily homeworks, quizzes, tests I have enjoyed learning Arabic for the past three semesters. However, this semester, Arabic was just not fun! We read a bunch of Sci-fi novels that had ridiculous amounts of new vocab and I didn't get a chance to improve my speaking skills. I definitely improved my reading skills but there was just so much vocab to memorize that it was hard to retain anything.Rotating the teachers was also a bad idea because I felt like there was no motivation for me to go to class if I didn't like a teacher one week. I felt like we were being experimented on and I really hope that things improve starting next semester.",
    "Arabic is a tough workload with little return and a negative environment. So many of us were frustrated with the new curriculum and the disorganization of the professors, especially Shady, as well as the disproportionate difficulty of the tests compared to semesters past. Instructions for preparation are never clear. The class is disorganized and not very fruitful.If you're taking Arabic for fun, you will end up hating it and being very disappointed. I would search for independent classes at Slifka. If you need it for your major and you're set on majoring in a discipline that requires Arabic, then I sympathize with you and best of luck gritting your teeth through it.",
    "This course was incredibly time consuming and difficult in the amount of sheer work you had to do, although it was definitely easier in the actual application of the language skills you learn. We spent a TONof time translating and memorizing HUGE amounts of vocabulary, but at least we weren't doing mindless drills any more. Get ready to go insane reading incredibly long and tedious sci-fi novels though.",
    "No. Unless the curriculum undergoes a major overhaul.",
    "I would, with the caveat that arabic takes forever to learn",
    "Continuation of L3 Arabic but forget the book. It's all stories frohere.",
    "The workload is extremely volatile and the readings are difficult. You don't leave feeling very confident about your Arabic. But learning the new vocab words and testing your comprehension and listening are necessary steps if you want to continue learning Arabic.",
    "take spanish. it's not worth it. i can't speak arabic.",
    "As of now, this class is absolutely useless. I am far worse at Arabic than I was after L3. Skip. This. Class.",
    "Don't listen to what they say! Yes, the vocab is hard, and the translations are long an onerous, but at the end of the day, that is how you learn the language. If you are disciplined and do the work, you will find that your proficiency has really improved by the end of the course.",
    "Hard to say what this will be like next year. This year it was a mess, too many disparateexpectations and not enough actual learning and reinforcement.",
    "JUST A TON OF WORK.",
    "ARBC 140 was a waste of time. You'd be better off taking the semester off and enrolling in a summer Arabic abroad program where you'll ACTUALLY learn how to speak the language instead of wasting time doing pointless translations and learning irrelevant vocabulary.",
    "It's the next level of Arabic. They pretty much ditch al-Kitaab and read short stories. The speaking and listening are relatively weak - it's mainly focused on reading. We had to read really annoying sci fi novels, but hopefully they'll reform that."
