    "This class is great if you want to get a lot of experience with speaking\/reading\/listening to more Spanish. You don't actually learn that much new grammar, but it vastly increases the fluidity of your speech and I am leaving the course feeling much more proficient as a Spanish speaker.",
    "I would recommend spanish 140 to any student interested in the course. I think the course is manageable and interesting, plus I believe its important to study another language.",
    "It's a pretty standard Spanish class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I enjoyed the material and improved in speaking and writing in Spanish. The workload was manageable and I benefited from being in the class.",
    "You will learn to speak much better, more refined Spanish in SPAN 140. We do activities in the textbook and watch movies in class, and homework is usually more activities or a reading from a book we might be reading."
