    "Yes, it is a low-key way to improve your speaking and writing skills",

    "Viet 140 is an intermediate Vietnamese course covering topics that are very useful (for example, for when one is going to visit Vietnam) and interesting. You develop your Vietnamese vocabulary and grammar through the homework assignments and quizzes\/tests. The final project is relatively low-stress, depending on what you choose to do. A classmate and I chose to film a humorous documentary, which proved to be an extremely fun and rewarding experience, while at the same time also summarizing\/compiling very nicely all that we had learned during the semester. Show up to class.",
    "If you'd like to learn higher level vocabulary and speak better, you should definitely take this course. Prof Quang is great.",
    "Vietnamese 140 is an excellent and effective class for advanced speakers of the language, as it assumes you have a basic foundation in Vietnamese. The pace is swift, since it meets every day, often with small quizzes the day after a new lesson is introduced. (Don't worry- they were quite manageable.) My skills in reading, writing, and speaking have definitely been improved. The outside resources got me really excited in learning the material.",
    "Take it, it moves quickly but if you keep up with the work you'll do great. Professor Quang is very nice and understanding. Overall, a great course!",
    "take this course if you want to try something new or if you want to refine any vietnamese you may already know."
