   "comments": [
    "This class emphasizes the technical parts of computability theory over the larger philosophical questions. For a math major, none of the math was particularly difficult.",
    "Yeah, take the class. Not that hard.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about computability. I thought that it would focus more on the incompleteness theorems, but that doesn't come until the very end.",
    "Great class. It starts slowly but gains momentum towards the end when you get to see all the nice results. The final is designed so that you really understand the material and after doing it all pieces finally fit together.",
    "This class is really fun. You don't need to have taken any logic before, and it's just material that's useful to know. There is not that much work - problem sets every 2-3 weeks, and they're not difficult. Both Sun-Joo and Jonathan are amazing, and very willing to help. Highly recommend.",
    "Very worth taking. This course was completely out of my comfort zone, which is why I am glad I took it and stuck with it. The workload itself is not too bad, but the material is complicated, and unless you are very good with math, logic, and proofs you will have to spend a lot of time thinking about it.",
    "1. Very interesting material. 2. High level picture is maintained throughout. 3. Fantastic, dedicated and enthusiastic professor and TF. Must take for the mathematically inclined.",
    "Fantastic course. The most interesting material I've encountered in my Yale career, and Sun-Joo teaches everything excellently. The class really rewards you for catching up--there's not an incredible amount of work, but studying for the oral exam demands a bit of preparation, especially if you haven't been reading the textbook. But why wouldn't you, since everything is so interesting?!",
    "This is the greatest class with an amazing professor. There isn't a high work load, but the material is really interesting. The psets get you to understand the material, but don't take much time. It is really left up to you to think about all the interesting results. I couldn't recommend this class more.",
    "The material can seem overly specific, but in fact several results are useful outside of the class (e.g. provability vs. truth, set theoretical results on computable functions, approaches to encoding language or information in individual numbers, etc.). Moreover, the final theorems proven are really interesting and worth spending time thinking about. In all, the class was sometimes vague, and required careful contemplation. The problem sets were fairly simple, and the workload in general was very manageable, which was nice in that it allowed more time to simply think about topics of personal interest. The oral examination and problem sets seemed very good formats for applying learned ideas. A fairly easy, unique, and interesting class.",
    "Incredibly fun class. Highly recommended.",
    "You should ABSOLUTELY take this course. I had no logic or philosophy background whatsoever and relatively (at least with respect to Math\/CS majors) minimal CS\/Math background and still loved it\/never really felt like it went over my head (that is, not if I stopped to think about it myself outside of class--it's a two-hour lecture so sometimes it's tough to stay engaged). The material is super interesting and it will really force you to think in a different way (similar to Discrete Math, which you should also take). Prof. Shin is a phenomenal professor who truly cares about her students. If you decide to take the class (which you should) do yourself a favor and buy\/read the book, not because you really need it to do well in the course but because 1) it's pretty darn interesting, and 2) plain-English proofs > fancy notation\/appeals to cardinality and symmetry any day.",
    "This is a great class. It's in my major, so obviously I think you should only take it if you think you're interested in Logic, etc. already. However, it's a great course! Professor Shin is funny and sarcastic and her class is organized really well. It's one of those classes where you have to work, but you know that you can do well once you know everything, and you work hard in a way that's completely manageable. You have four homework sets at the beginning (very straightforward), a group project presentation, an oral test with Professor Shin, and a final homework which is sort of like the final. If you're ready for the class, you will do great and enjoy the class."
