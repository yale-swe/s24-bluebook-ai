    "It's a very good course",
    "thorough exploration of complexities of disease surveillance. Interesting readings",
    "Interesting course, a good overview of surveillance, learned a lot.",
    "The course was good.. Amanda provided her expertise and past experiences to make the sessions interesting.",
    "Strengths: Content is organized in a good fashion. I like Amanda's lecture style--engaging. Assignments give students a chance to think for themselves and apply concepts from lecture.Weaknesses\/improvements:Communication. Changes in course schedule were too great. Additionally, expectations should be more clear. Needed guidelines for the presentation. Presentations during finals week is not great.",
    "This course was very redundant with several unnecessary assignments. While it was informative, it felt like the instructor was giving assignments for the sake of giving assignments (an exam felt unnecessary for the nature of the topic). This course should be restructured without an exam and more individual assignments (i.e., an individual assessment of a surveillance system).",
    "Very good look at the types of surveillance systems, and their pros and cons. Articles are good, but there are too many. More case studies\/examples to work through would be good!The group paper is not great. A paper like this could be written by one person in a a slightly more compact form (10 pgs single spaced) and would be overall a better thought exercise for that individual.",
    "Its an overview of surveillance. Its a little difficult to have a lecture at night and to follow the material, as its a bit dry.",
    "This class was good overall. The time of the class isn't great but workable since the professor teaches after she leaves from work. The two hour class is only based on lecture material so it can be overwhelming, especially with the 70+ slides per lecture. The material is informative, as well as the readings. However, there are many readings every week. I would have gotten more out of the readings if we only had to pay attention to a select few every week rather than 10+ every week. The midterm and final projects were very helpful for students to learn surveillance.",
    "It was a good class, but very dry.",
    "Overall the course material was good and enabled me to critically think about how surveillance is conducted in the U.S. and globally.",
    "The course was very well taught. The only recommendation I have is that presentations be held to a pre-determined time limit so that class does not run over by a significant amount of time.",
    "The course was interesting but lacked depth.",
    "The course was very disorganized."

    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Good..Drew a lot from her past experiences and also from her expertise with new haven surveillance... which provided valuable learning",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Strengths: engaging teaching style. Very easy to speak in class b\/c Amanda is welcoming and encouraging.Improvements: Better communication. Respond more quickly via email, lay out clear expectations.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante is nice but grades very harshly. Many classmates commented how surprised they were at how she took off points on the exam for very petty things. Also, she is not very attentive to student's time as she has arrived late to class and kept us late on several occasions. Her slides were long and drawn-out.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Overall, very accessible, down to earth, and great.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0She was really vague and didn't do a great job at informing us of what she wanted with things.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0The instructor was good and knowledgeable in her field. She is responsive to students' questions and engages students in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante was extremely passionate about teaching and sought for students to be passionate about learning as well. She was sensitive to students' needs and adjusted the course accordingly.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Amanda brings practical experience to the class which really makes for a great leaning experience. She was also very kind and responsive throughout the class.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0The professor is very knowledgeable about the subject at hand. She was very willing to work with the students, flexible, and approachable."

    "Course started out very interesting, but waned throughout the semester. If you are interested in surveillance as a career I recommend this course. Otherwise, if you are not terribly interested then consider another course",
    "I would not recommend this course. The instructor managed to take a relatively interesting and simple topic and turn it into a difficult course.",
    "Good overview of surveillance. Not too much work, yet interesting. One of the few applied epidemiology courses offered at YSPH, and waaaaaay better than the outbreaks class.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in surveillance. It is a very good skill set to have.",
    "The class can get better, more structured.",
    "Public Health Surveillance gives a solid understanding of surveillance systems in both a theoretical and practical framework; I highly recommend this course for any student who wants to understand how public health systems work.",
    "It is the only surveillance course offered at YSPH, and if there is particular interest I would take it. I wish it were taught at a different time and that there were more case studies and group work involved during lecture time."
