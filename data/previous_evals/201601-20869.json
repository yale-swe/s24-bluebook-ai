   "comments": [
    "This was not a great class. I took it thinking I would learn about architecture, and thinking I would be able to look at, talk about, and critique architecture, but I feel I've learned close to nothing. The class was so theoretical and much more, it seemed, about the 'philosophy' of architecture than its history. Lectures weren't particularly interesting, and there was more reading than was humanly possible to finish some weeks.",
    "A philosophical look at architecture from the 1700s onwards. As the only stem major in the class, I expected to be at a disadvantage, but as long as you think creatively and analyze the influences of the architectural pieces on each other, the class is interesting and informative. Kyle brought all the material together in an imaginative way, often jumping between different time periods and pulling out links, presenting the lectures with humor and a theatrical delivery. This class has taught me to appreciate my environment and read architecture as a form of expression, not just a roof over my head.",
    "Take it, even if you're not in the major!",
    "If Kyle Dugdale is ever teaching this class again, do yourself the biggest favor of your Yale career and take it.",
    "This is an excellent course that looks at modern architecture for its philosophical and historic significance. One of the most exciting things about the course is the way it interweaves major philosophical traditions with architectural history. Kyle Dugdale is an excellent, engaging lecturer, and you can be guaranteed to have a positive experience in his lectures. There are a few odd, unfortunate rules, like sign-in sheets for a lecture of ~40 students that are replaced with a late sheet at the start of class, and these take away some of the magic of the course, but it is definitely worth taking regardless. The expectations can be unclear, though, so be sure to speak with your TA about what, exactly, they want from your synthesis essays.",
    "Interesting topics, but the teaching was sometimes vague and it can be unclear what you are supposed to be learning.",
    "Interesting course, more abstract and philosophical than what I expected (it was often about the fundamental concept of architecture, what architecture should try to achieve, how much authority an architect can claim etc.) Take it cre\/d if you are unfamiliar with history of architecture and modernism",
    "Yes, but I will warn them about the workload. Overall though it's a great course, and a perfect fit for people who are passionate about architecture.",
    "Take the course credit D. the grading seems arbitrary and tough.",
    "Modern Architecture History will challenge your conception of architecture through an examination of its most significant challenges. It is an inspiring course that uses architecture as a mode to discuss a range of issues at the social, cultural level. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class! It is fantastic. I took it with Kyle Dugdale. His lectures made connections between architecture and many other disciplines, making the information easy to understand and remember. There is a lot of writing but the subject matter is almost completely up to the student. I took this already having a fair amount of experience with architectural history and it was still very exciting! Definitely take it!",
    "The class is fast-paced and the amount of reading is at times a little greater than I would prefer, but on the whole Arch 261 is worth it. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a solid grounding in the basic history of modern architecture and who is eager also to begin having discussions about how to evaluate buildings and how to take the principles covered in the course and run with them.",
    "Excellent course, but not your typical lecture. Kyle Dugdale has a very unique lecturing style - try it out before you commit to a class with him. He will push you to question the issues at stake. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Workload comparable to a seminar class.",
    "Where do I start?! This course is usually taught by Eeva-Liisa, but was taught by Kyle Dugdale for the Spring semester of 2016. That said, I cannot speak to the regular iteration of this class, but this semester's course was undoubtedly one of the best lecture courses I have attended at Yale. Provocative, funny and thoroughly enriching, Kyle's lectures approached the history of modern architecture in a distinctly liberal fashion, often leaving us with more questions than answers (something that he *did* say to preface the lectures). There is something in this course for both architecture majors and non-architecture majors alike, just do be prepared to have discussions well beyond your comfort zone. Conversations in lectures and sections tend to roam far and wide, unfettered by prescribed material."
