    "the ability to critically understand the theory behind marx's analysis of capital",
    "I learned how to break down and close read dense and complicated texts as a result of this class. I was also pushed to form creative arguments using late capitalist thinkers as a foundation.",
    "Henry focused many of the classes on the links between different texts, the broader contexts in which these texts existed, and the fine grain of the writers' techniques and intentions. This \"other side\" of the readings made each lecture not only instructive but surprising."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The reading list is dense, and not everything is discussed in class. But the assignments are flexible and can be pretty creative, which allows for students of a variety of backgrounds to take the course and get something out of it.",
    "The syllabus was great, especially with the supplements in section (Lukacs and Postone felt particularly necessary), but I would have preferred fewer of the vaguely Marx-inspired but methodologically different later readings (e.g. Graeber, Piketty) and more engagement with and critique of the Marxist canon as such (Spivak?). Also, especially since this was (at least nominally) a seminar, classes could be quite lecture-heavy.",
    "I believe this course should have some sort of pre-requisites clearly stated. It is falsely marketed as a course that everyone can take when in reality there is a necessary background in critical theory and philosophy that is required.",
    "strengths - amazing reading list, engaging course weaknesses - class was hard to follow, kinda meandering at times",
    "Professor Sussman is extremely knowledgeable and uses most of class time to speak about and break down the readings for that week. However, this means that it is up to the students to interrupt if they wish to have a class discussion. Since people are generally hesitant to interrupt their professor, there was little discussion amongst the students during class time.",
    "The strength is in the lectures. The readings chosen were varied and well-connected but the most interesting part of this course was listening to Henry make links I would have otherwise missed. This course taught me to read differently, looking both inward and outward at the same time. This course gave you as much as you put in. Henry didn't demand student participation or enforce readings, though of course it was expected you would. As a result, one weakness might be in the discussions that arose (or didn't) in class."

   "comments": [
    "If you are willing to put in a lot of time to understand the works, absolutely. If not, I would still recommend it, though it will be difficult and you will get less out of it.",
    "I would only actually recommend this course if Jensen is still the TF. If the late capitalist imaginary compels you, go forth! Sussman is very encouraging and will supply you with a phantasmagoria of late capitalist musings. In his sections (and sections for the sections), Jensen supplied the rigor to this intriguing but freewheeling course.",
    "I recommend this class so long as Jensen Suther is teaching the section, in which case you should do the course and attend his section as well.",
    "Perspective-changing course. Fantastic experience.",
    "very fun class, already recommended it to two others",
    "I'd recommend the course to another student if they felt prepared to dive into the course material--you might become lost if you don't feel familiar\/comfortable with Sussman's way of teaching or if you don't do the readings.",
    "If you're into reading Marx and Derrida, go for it. If that's not your thing, don't take this class, otherwise you might feel unengaged.",
    "Definitely. Henry is a superb lecturer and has been the one professor at Yale who really took an interest in my personal academic interests. He helped me immensely in tying my own work into that of this class. Also, the readings are great! Maybe I could have used more time for Das Kapital."
