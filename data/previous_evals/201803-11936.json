    "basics of R lots of tricks understanding linear regression, logistic regression in R learning permutation tests\/bootstrapping ( i didn't know they were so easy and are going to very useful for research)",
    "Learned a lot of R and also some basic stats (e.g., what confidence intervals, pvalues, nonparametric tests, multicollinearity, logistic regression, etc. are).",
    "I developed skills with R, which will be valuable for both research and professional opportunities.",

    "r programming",
    "R programing T test F test linear regression",
    "R & stat.",
    "Learned R; practical, applied skills in regression and data analysis and exploration, outlier finding and treating, very basic API\/web scraping, plotting with R, using core R packages like ggplot and dplyr, different regression types, using different real world, interesting and varied data sets",
    "This was one of the best-taught and best-structured courses I've ever taken. I came from no programming or statistical knowledge, and left with a good grasp of statistical methods and how to compute them in R.",
    "This course was a great introduction to programming in R, the class was well organized and I learned a lot"

   "comments": [
    "- Very good material - Always uploaded in time - Good assignments (easy but not so easy also)",
    "The class is fantastic. It's very time consuming, but extremely rewarding. No suggestions for improvement.",
    "The course was approachable even without a formal statistics background, but it would have been nice to get more into dplyr or scraping. It was somewhat disorienting to learn base R then have dplyr added at the end as an addendum, as this made it harder to think of dplyr solutions and encouraged me to use base R even when dplyr offered more elegant solutions.",
    "Patient professor, well structured problem sets",
    "instructor is very organized.",
    "Xiafei Wang is possible the best teacher I ever had with this course being possible the best I ever had. The content she has created is well organised, perfectly builds on each other, is contemporary, interesting, real-world, applied helpful, created perfectly didactic, to teach what she intends to and pre-treated to work for what we don't need to focus on. She delivers it with similarly much love and care and the lectures are helpful and superbly structured and delivered.",
    "The online participation forum was very helpful, both for study purposes and to ask questions of my own.",
    "The class was great, it was a little challenging that the exams were on paper since all the homework and classwork were on the computer"

    "Yes, though its an easy course, it'll help you learn important R concepts. If you already know R getting hold of its material would also be useful. If you've not taken R at all, then a must-take.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn how to use R.",
    "Yes, I think it was an effective way of developing quantitative skills that emphasized statistical interpretation, rather than just data visualization.",
    "Yes, useful",
    "yes",
    "Definitely Yes",
    "Yes The course is well organized and taught. Students can learn a lot from the course.",

    "Very much! I can't wait for the next time Susan teaches a course.",
