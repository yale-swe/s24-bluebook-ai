   "comments": [
    "Metaethics is probably the most important subject you can take at college. I would recommend this course for the material...but the actual teaching\/discussion do not provide as comprehensive set of lessons as you might want.",
    "Matthew Smith is leaving, so this question is moot.",
    "As a non-philosophy major, this course was pretty challenging. Especially initially I felt outgunned by Grad students. But ultimately its incredibly worthwhile, and forces you to sharpen your thinking and argumentation. Plus, this is just a really cool subject matter. I'd take it. But especially if you occasionally feel lost, go to Smith's office hours--he can be really helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The material was fascinating, and I felt like we managed to get a decent handle on the issues as we went along. We lost a few of the seminars at the end due to Prof. Smith being sick, so that was a shame, and occasionally Prof. Smith's demeanor was a little bit antagonistic towards some of the students, but generally it was a good vibe and a lively discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great overview of meta-ethics, which is a fascinating part of philosophy, and one that is often not taught at Yale.I would caution students who don't have a lot of background in philosophy that this will be a tough course - and a tough course to do well in. Or, it will at least require initiative to reach out to Matt Smith and get feedback on the reading assignments (which he does not provide) and to work with him to write a good paper (which he will help with if asked - early enough).That said, Matt is a great professor. He's really sharp and also a great guy to chat with and learn from during office hours. And if you might be intimidated to chat with him at first, that is just his way of approaching debating philosophy, and he really is an approachable professor.",
    "I would certainly recommend the class to other philosophy students. Metaethics is an interesting, although challenging, subject."
