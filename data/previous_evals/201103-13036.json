   "comments": [
    "Great course. You cover a variety of topics, spending just enough time on them that no one gets bored but you don't feel too rushed either. Great introduction to novels and movies in Spanish (you get to read a book that THE Jorge Luis Borges deemed \"perfect\"!) Professor Tortora is wonderful; very approachable, understanding, prepared. Take this course!",
    "Spanish Conversation is a good class because it is great to be able to just let go and speak a language without the constant worry about grammar and correctness, which are important but can't be conscious concerns all the time. I enjoyed reading a novel and watching a film in Spanish, but some of the short readings seemed like forced discussion starters. Tortora did a great job with the class, but there were problems with the course curriculum and reading that were frustrating at points.",
    "The professors who teach Spanish 150 are all really great, I've heard. I had Margherita Tortora, and she was extremely nice and understanding and helpful. The class is a really good way to practice your spoken (and written, too) Spanish, but how much you get from it really depends on how much you put in. It's easy to slack off on the homework and not get a lot out of the class, but still do pretty well. I wish that I had had more time to study the vocabulary and do the homework more carefully. Sometimes, the rush to get through the material took away from the class a bit (we read articles about several specific topics, and also read a novel at the end of the class - reading the novel was really interesting and satisfying!). Overall though, pretty minimal workload and agood class for keeping your Spanish fresh. If you took AP Spanish and got a 5, you're more than prepared - the course focuses on using Spanish rather than nitpicking grammar or anything like that.",
    "Good to get a L5 credit out of the way. Grading with Tortora can be a bit harsh, but the class isn't difficult. Can't say my speaking skills were improved that much.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 150 for a fellow student as a light workload class to fulfill the language requirement. I did not feel like it was particularly interesting and my Spanish did not really improve. It's also not at easy as you might have heard especially depending who your professor is. Tortora was fairly tough. Most people I think got between a- and b. Not at all the auto A that I heard it would be.",
