    "Mostly, it's a lot of small assignments and every once in a while an assignment will hit you out of nowhere and you end up putting hours of work into the class. Overall though, it's a good class and helps improve your spanish as well as your courage to use it.",
    "Better and harder than L1, Spanish L2 was more of the same (same textbook) but with more grammar and work.",
    "A continuation of introductory Spanish, interesting and fast-paced, a lot of work.",
    "Spanish 120 covers more difficult conjugations than SPAN 110, such as subjunctive, imperfect, and more. Take it if you need to and want to speak Spanish more proficiently.",
    "Just a continuation of 110, don't worry about it. Do the work and you'll be fine.",
    "A lot of work when looking at the course overall, but broken down into easy, daily routines that make it very, very manageable.",
    "Yes if they are willing to work fairly hard every day.",
    "Good class, gets easier as the course goes on, but the start of the course is difficult.",
    "Span 2 is grammar intensive and requires a lot of studying, but you learn so much over the semester.",
