    "Don't have it be your first time reading Kant or his ethics, but you'll come out with a strong understanding of the work. Not tons of reading, though it's Kant.",
    "A very interesting reading into Kant's ethical theory. Should have some background in Kant prior to taking. Is not a review course as much as one particular interpretation (i.e., that of Prof Elizondo) of Kant. No complaints because it was a unique, fun, and different reading. I do wish there had been more opportunities for discussion because it seemed like each class was just trying to get through the notes Prof E. had printed out.",
    "Kant is very difficult, but obviously anyone considering this class knows that. The professor was very knowledgable about everything related to Kant, which is awesome, but unfortunately he did not let us explore the material very much by ourselves, in class. Every lecture was just two hours of him reading off of his sheets, and there was little to no interaction between us and him. Questions were obviously allowed, but there was no real atmosphere of discussion. Also, class time always went over the allotted 1 hours and 50 minutes, which was frustrating. The only assignment was one paper, which might be attractive to some, but just make sure you stay on top of the readings. Take this class if you love studying Kant (haha) or if you have to.",
    "This was a fascinating class that basically presented a very interesting reading of Kant -- that his Groundwork, especially the concept of treating rational beings as ends-in-themselves, has been utterly misinterpreted. Without having been read alongside the Metaphysics of Morals (which is also read in this class), it is impossible to get a taste of the teleological kind of virtue ethics Kant was trying to present. Very fascinating. The class itself was deathly painful at times: it was Dr. Elizondo reading from prepared notes for two hours after dinner when everyone just wanted to sleep. Even moving it to the afternoon or morning would have done wonders to the class dynamic. There was virtually no discussion, unless you were able to interject a question in-between Dr. Elizondo's reading. There was only one final paper, with nothing else as a part of the grade. Overall, I am glad that I have been exposed to this new way of reading Kant, but I really wish it had been through different circumstances.",
    "This was among the best classes I've taken at Yale, but it was NOT what was advertised. Firstly, and most importantly, it was not a seminar, but rather a two hour lecture punctuated by brief questions. We never had enough time. In fact, sections of the syllabus were cut completely due to time constraints.That said, the class was great. Prof. Elizondo is a very clear and articulate lecturer. He argued a very provocative thesis (that Kant should be seen in line with, and not as a break from, the Aristotelian tradition). His doing so, however, did not come at the expense of deep engagement with the fundamentals of the text. I left the course very thoroughly convinced, my readings of opposing authors notwithstanding.Prof. Elizondo is also great when it comes to responding to questions outside of class.I would strongly recommend taking any class taught by him so long as one does so knowing and accepting that it may not in fact be a seminar."
