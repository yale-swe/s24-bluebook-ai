    "One of the most disappointing classes I've had at Yale. Had a lot of promise but the requirements\/expectations were unclear and constantly changing. I took this course because I thought we would be working for a client and the Professor indicated that while there would be no formal client the outcome would be similar. Instead, it was incredibly frustrating the entire semester. Braverman and Ted were nice, but the course was one of my least favorite at Yale.",
    "Strengths - Pushes you to think hard - A great exposure on ways to approach difficult problems Weakness - Higher accountability for team work could be baked into the design of the course",
    "The topic of assignment was hard to materialize right until the very end, maybe a bit more guidance at the beginning could be better"
