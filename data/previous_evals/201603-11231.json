   "comments": [
    "I learned to think more critically and to be able to see novel applications for mathematical concepts. Because of this class, I was able to look at a question and solve it from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Integration by parts and substitution Working with sequences and series - convergent\/divergent Finding the volumes of solids of rotation Polar coordinates",
    "I extended my knowledge of calculus and became better prepared in basic integration techniques that I had initially acquired in high school. Series had been completely new material for me so I was happy to have learned that.",
    "In this class, we learned the equivalent to AP Calculus BC curriculum. But the difference between this and the high school course was the pacing and the use of the flex classroom technique. Because of this, I had to learn how to understand things on my own at first and to use all the resources available to understand material.",
    "I was able to learn how to calculate volumes and areas of solids of revolutions and how to make estimates using different kinds of series. I also learned that team work is very important in sciences especially when it comes to doing problem sets",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical skills onto my classwork and homework and I understood how to use integral calculus as well.",
    "I learned the basic Calc knowledge that comes with the course, but I also learned how to teach concepts that I had difficulty understanding to myself.",
    "I learned new integration techniques.",
    "I developed the skill to study beforehand watching the Coursera videos and answering Prep Questions. That was completely new to me once I was used to big lectures.",
    "My problem solving skills increased.",
    "In the first half of the course, I learned different strategies of integration. In the second half, I learned various tests for series to check for convergence\/divergence. I also learned about parametric functions and polar coordinates.",
    "I learned more calculus.",
    "I learned how to take integrals and how to interact with sequences\/series and their useful applications to real life.",
    "This class is heavily series, with some parametric and polar functions thrown in.",
    "I learned series, sequences and polar equations.",
    "Calc is actually fun once you understand it. Cool",
    "I didn't learn much during this course! Except that the Math department at Yale isn't great.",
    "Continued Calculus from AB in high school. Many calculus concepts"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe that a strength of this course was the presence of the more intimate classroom ambience. Unlike large lecture courses such as Economics and Cognitive Science, the availability of smaller courses allows for a more interactive learning experience. That being said, I felt that the \"flipped classroom\" format of the course was a weakness; I was ok with the idea of getting an introduction to the material before the class, but I felt that there should at least be a sense of classroom instruction reinforcing what is learned in the class. I don't think that the majority of the learning should be available through an online platform; I believe that a student should be compelled to go to class because he or she cannot learn it from merely an alternative platform. That being said, I found myself learning more from the online course than I did from the actual course, as it seemed that all that we did in class was go through practice problems, which I can do on my own by simply opening the textbook.",
    "Strengths: Vigliotta was a great teacher.",
    "The teacher never addressed concerns raised on the online homework\/prep problems \"do you have any questions?\" Box Going to tutor hours was the most helpful thing",
    "I think that tutoring could better be set up to fit with the students' schedule. I had trouble meeting with my assigned tutor and felt like a lot of the work and preparation for tests were on my shoulders, but truthfully I should have tried harder to make office hours, etc.",
    "The strength of this class was definitely Professor Vigliotta's lectures. She was very clear in explaining concepts, provided\/worked through many examples, and even provided worksheets for extra practice and to delve into more abstract ways that one might see the concept that was being learned. The only weakness may have been the Coursera program in part. The videos were often not as helpful on the quizzes, and sometimes I couldn't figure out a question based on the video alone.e",
    "This course hard at first because the lectures are very short and the material is meant to be understood by the student himself as he engages in learning outside the classroom. I think it would be helpful to have more worked examples during the classroom and to solve the worksheets during the class.",
    "The strengths are the practice exams and questions posted online. The weaknesses are that if something on the video wasn't understood, I would have to google the topics and learn on my own.",
    "I think that the biggest improvement would be if the videos were given before class, then basically the same lecture was given in class with room for questions, and then homework was collected at each class based on what was taught at the previous class. I think that having only one problem set due each week makes remembering the material more challenging.",
    "The teacher seemed very unsure and was not engaging during the lesson. She was not good at answering questions and I did not feel well-prepared for the exams.",
    "The professors were a great weakness of this class. The classroom was flipped, so you were required to watch videos before class (which were not helpful at all and more confusing than anything) and basically teach yourself everything. I honestly did not learn anything from the actual class. I taught myself everything out of class.",
    "the video's could have been better.",
    "I liked that the size of the class is small (about 30 students) and the lectures were followed by in-class worksheets to practice the concepts that were covered.",
    "Strengths: - moved through the material at a reasonable pace - Coursera generally made sense Weaknesses: - testing material sometimes did not match what was taught in class, to the extent where it felt unfair",
    "The prep videos are very useful in order to review the material. The weekly psets also make you keep up with the material.",
    "I liked the aspect of the flipped classroom which allowed us to ask questions and be in a small class. However, the questions that went with the videos often didn't have much to do with the P-Set questions and sometimes made the topics more confusing.",
    "I didn't like the videos and how they were used to teach us all the information in the course. Essentially class time was for figuring out the holes in the videos and doing problems. I didn't like that we were essentially supposed to teach ourselves all the information.",
    "video's could have been more to the point and had less tangents making the information more clearly presented, but my professor did a good job of going over the information in class.",
    "I really liked the class structure with videos beforehand and review in class. I just wish they could make the deadlines accurate on Coursera",
    "How much you're able to learn really depends on the grad student you get to teach your class. Make sure you get a good instructor and a good tutor unless you've taken this course before.",
    "Strengths: well organized, pretty routine Weaknesses: extremely boring and very little one on one help unless you seek it"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I do recommend. At the very least, it's a prerequisite for a variety of STEM majors. However, I do also think that it challenges one to think through a mathematical lens and to critically confront a novel situation through an algorithmic approach.",
    "Yes, it is a foundational course in math and everyone should take at least one calculus course in my opinion.",
    "Even though I struggled with this class, yes, I would. Professor Vigliotta is very kind, understanding, and helpful to her student. She knows so much about the material and is easily approachable with questions. But you need to remember to keep up with the Coursera page, and to SEEK HELP EARLY if you are having problems.",
    "No, unless you it is a pre-requisite or you want to develop your understanding of Math.",
    "Yes its a good course to take and very helpful.",
    "I would, but I would prepare them to have to learn a lot of it on their own time.",
    "No",
    "No, not unless you have taken Calc II before. Many people who have already taken this calculus did well in the class while the other students were left to dry to fend for themselves.",
    "yes it is useful if you like calc.",
    "Yes, the course is very helpful for reviewing and extending the concepts we would typically learn in a high school AP Calculus course. The workload was reasonable and the peer tutors\/professor were very accessible if any help was needed.",
    "You should take it if you need a math credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but it is a tough class so make sure to stay on top of the material.",
    "I liked the aspect of the flipped classroom and I liked studying series.",
    "I think that this class is set up for success for a certain type of student: one that is very good at learning on their own and has the time to go in depth on their own. I wouldn't suggest this class to many people.",
    "Only if you need it as a required course.",
    "Yeah the course is rewarding and also very doable.",
    "I would only recommend this course if another student absolutely has to take it. And if so they should get a tutor and use any other resource they can. If you don't have to take it, don't.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you have to take it. It's not very enjoyable.",
    "Yes because it is an overview of basic calculus. It is easy to follow the curriculum and find answers to questions, but sometimes there is a great difference between tests and problem sets. Often lectures are unhelpful because of the flipped classroom approach."
