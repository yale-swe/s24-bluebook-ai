    "Class of Awesomeness, Semester of WIN. Definitely recommended.",
    "This would depend on the student. While I gained a great scope of insight from this class, very little of it was \"spoon-fed\" I would recommend it to an individually motivated person who had great zeal for the topic at hand.",
    "An analytically-oriented course teaching the historical fundamentals of fugue analysis and practice. It's filled with opportunities to use fugue analysis tools to construct your own analyses; very practical. Recommended for theorists-- not so much for historians, though that component of the course certainly exists.",
    "The Arts of Fugue course introduces numerous analytical perspectives on fugue, including structural and rhetorical analysis and history of theory and focusing on the fugues of J.S. Bach. I would recommend the course to any student interested in the technical features and history of fugue."

   "comments": [
    "I doubt I'll be working on fugue but this class solidified a lot of things that I sort of knew into an intellectual framework.",
    "Even if I don't end up conducting research on fugues, the topics in the course represent important background knowledge for any theorist, and many of the analytical techniques are potentially applicable to pieces other than fugues."
