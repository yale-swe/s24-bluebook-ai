    "Yes, I would recommand it to everyone who wants to get some more math after Math 222.",
    "Very good. Take it.",
    "Diff Eq is one of the most applicable courses that I have taken at Yale. Everything that we learn can be used in physics, econ or some other class and I think that this is something every student should take. This course was also not too difficult, with a take home midterm and relatively simple problem sets.",
    "Professor Luli does not make this the \"standard differential equations\" course whatsoever. Many difficult, and obscure, topics (Jordan Canonical Form, Limit Cycles) are covered in class that are not even mentioned in the book, while numerical methods and power series solutions were not even mentioned. Topics one might expect from a \"mathy\" or \"hard\" differential equations course, like uniqueness and existence of solutions are not covered at all. Overall, I would recommend not to take this course and instead either take the Engineering course (for those Engineering inclined), Physics 460 (for those physic inclined) or Analysis (for those Math inclined).",
    "yes, i would recommend it!!",
    "Take it if you're interested in Diff EQ, or just need an easy high-level math class.",
    "Nice class. Recommend to take it especially if you are taking another more theoretical class. Would be a good change."
