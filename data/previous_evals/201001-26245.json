    "I really enjoyed this class because I think it speaks to a lot of what the public views as \"public health\". I almost wish that this class was required for first year students because I think that everyone should know the basics of surveillance. The topics for this class were very timely and interesting. The workload was very doable and I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Very good introduction to surveillance. This subject can be applied to all aspects of public health. The lectures were very interesting. The fist half of the semester was structured to learn the logistics about surveillance systems and the second half we took what we learned and applied this to different areas. Overall, a good course.",
    "Pro; Interesting class!Con: Readings in syllabus are generally not given links - you have to look for readings yourself. I usually spent about 20 minutes finding everything online. Then, maybe 40 minutes reading a couple articles.",
    "The course is great and it offers a deeper understanding of how surveillance can be conducted and used in public health",
    "Strengths-fair workload",
    "Strengths: use of real-world examples, breadth of subject matter",
    "Very good surveillance class. gives a good background in epi.",
    "I thought it was an informative course in that now whenever i read an epi report or journal, i pay attention and analyze the methods section much more closely, so I believe that a heightened sensitivity developed to those types of issues."

    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante is incredibly knowledgeable and she maintains a light-hearted attitude for class, which makes her very approachable. She is very receptive to questions and there was a very high amount of class participation and interaction, which I thought was really great. She was also very receptive to what our interests were and tailored the class to meet some of our interests. I thoroughly enjoyed showing up to this class every week!",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Dr. Durante is a very good professor. Her lectures are very interesting and her knowledge of surveillance systems is amazing. She is also very approachable and helpful when we had questions.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0She's an interesting professor and I like her teaching style (casual, relaxed).",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0She was great. The topics she selected were very interesting and she did a good job conveying the importance of surveillance, possible limitations that can be encountered and how to overcome or adjust to them.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Strengths- engages the class, makes time for students, concerned with student's input",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Professor Durante is well-versed in public health surveillance and brings her many and varied experiences to the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0Prof. Durante is very approachable and explains course content clearly. Very approachable and she engages the class every time.Great professor.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Jean Durante \u00a0I think Dr. Durante did a good job. Strengths included real-world experience which I believe makes a world of difference in applied classes such as this."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. I think you really build a fundamental understanding of surveillance and you go into depth to talk about some basic things that I believe all public health students should know before they graduate. For example, learning about what diseases are reported and how state departments are run and what to do in disasters. Also, I would recommend this class to others because Dr. Durante's unique position of being the New Haven epidemiologist allows her to provide us with very interesting stories and experiences.",
    "Very good course. Would definitely recommend if you would like to learn about surveillance systems.",
    "The course is a very useful class for anyone interested in working in the field of public health.",
    "Good overview of surveillance. Amanda's very pleasant.",
    "Great course. Highly recommended.",
    "Surveillance deals with the methods of how epi information is collected, the various strategies and methodologies that may be applied. I would recommend it to another student who was interested in a real-world methodology class."
