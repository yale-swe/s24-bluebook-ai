    "Take it, even though it is hard.English 114 is a class which I learned to love to hate. As weird as it sounds, I really hated this class at the beginning; I had no idea what the papers were supposed to be about and the discussion in class seemed to be detatched from the general topic of ENGL 114: Improving YOUR writing. However, as the class progressed, the papers allowed for way more freedom when it comes to the content and the discussion started being, actually, interesting.Overall, even though ENGL 114 is a lot of work, it is worth it. My writing as an international science major was, being kind to myself, at least bad at the beginning. Now, I am able to write a paper based on reasearch about pretty much anything. The change is palpable and incredible. Prof. Carlisle will expect every participant to work and work hard, but she herself puts very much effort into helping you! Also, if you end up taking this class: USE WRITING PARTNERS!! They are an incredible and really really help!",
    "Make sure you choose a class with a topic that you enjoy.",
    "Picture writing was a great section. I came into it thinking we would be writing about photographs and other images but the class goes much deeper than that. The first paper, in which we analyzed Susan Sontag's essay \"On Photography,\" seemed really abstract and really forced us to think critically about someone else's argument. The second essay was about a graphic novel (which is really fun to read!). The third was a full-blown research paper on an image of our choice. The fourth assignment was a presentation that advocated some sort of policy claim based on our third paper.The papers are well-spaced out although they sometimes overlap, which can seem overwhelming. However, this is really not a class in which you should be worried about your grade, as Prof. Carlisle makes clear from the beginning. Just enjoy the great class discussions and do the best you can on the papers. Your writing will improve.",
    "Take this class! If you are not specially passionate about writing but you are interested in pictures you should definitively take this class.",
    "Recommended as a strong introduction to English and writing at Yale. The class is a way to practice college-level writing, but on topics that are interesting and very open. The class also teaches basic research skills that will be useful throughout college. Great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend ENG 114, especially if you don't feel super confident about your writing, or if you are very interested by the topic of the class."
