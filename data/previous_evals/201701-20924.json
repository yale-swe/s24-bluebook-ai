   "comments": [
    "I learned about microbes, diseases. and the way we study these organisms.",
    "I learned a lot about bacterial mechanisms of motility, pathogenicity, and infection.",
    "I feel like I have a very good general knowledge of bacteria now, which I'm excited about using in future biology and chemistry courses.",
    "There was definitely a lot of information to take in in this course. All different aspects of microbiology and I thought it was quite comprehensive. In particular, I think I really improved my experimental thinking skills e.g. in finding virulence genes.",
    "I honestly learned so much about how bacteria function and how they interact with the human body. I also learned a large amount about various experimental methods to analyze bacteria, their mode of action, and how they interact with biological systems.",
    "I learned several very practical skills that are widely used in microbiology, pathology, and drug development research.",
    "You learn about the functions and types of systems that microbes use to survive and how they can infect and live in other host cells.",
    "LOVED this class. very interesting and intellectually stimulating",
    "Practical information about microbes Super interesting material",
    "I learned about bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.",
    "Very informative class. You actually learn a lot about microorganisms. It's interesting",
    "So much about the basics of microbiology, how to design genetic screens, evaluate bacteria.",
    "This class gave me a much better knowledge of basic biology concepts that are related to microorganisms (metabolism, selective pressure, lab techniques, etc.) but also included a lot of helpful and interesting information that was specific to bacteria, including how they can be used to answer experimental questions, what their life cycles are like, and the impact they have on the broader world. It was also useful for emphasizing a scientific-method oriented way of thinking about biology questions.",
    "Microbio is an amazing class for development of basic microbiology knowledge and, though I'm actually an EEB major, I'm certain this would be incredibly useful for any microbio lab work you wanted to do. It's an incredible combination of breadth and depth that, while difficult to keep up with, is very rewarding when you get it.",
    "Excellent overview of (primarily) bacteria and infectious disease.",
    "This course provided a wide overview of microorganisms, as well as real-life applications in medicine and disease.",
    "The course covers a very broad range of topics in microbiology and focuses a lot on experimental approaches.",
    "The course was fairly straightforward, if you went to class, paid attention, wrote good notes you were alright for the exams. Grading was weird, however, and things that you might not expect on the exam will be on the exam.",
    "I learned a whole host of new material concerning biomedical approaches to epidemiology and microbiology.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to microbiology. This course was also a good review for certain research concepts such as gene sequencing and microscopy techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Its a lecture based class, but I wish there was a discussion section available, at least once a week and optional.",
    "This was a great class! Giving Professor Wertz less material was a great decision, because both Professor Jacobs-Wagner and Professor Hatzios are fantastic. Professor Wertz has the most boring and least useful material, but he also is just a very boring and unclear teacher who is difficult to follow. Professors Jacobs-Wagner and Hatzios did a great job. My greatest frustration was that professors wrote ie., and eg., instead of i.e. and e.g..",
    "You learn some interesting stuff, like microbiome or virology taught by a professor from the Med School. However, a lot of the material felt less relevant, like how the flagellum is assembled",
    "Very difficult class- requires a lot of studying and effort with only 3 exams",
    "Professor Hatzios and Professor Jacobs-Wagner are great professors! The only downside is that you don't know how they're grading the class, so my grade will probably come as a surprise. Also, your entire grade rests on three exams, so you have to be on top of your work.",
    "The course is very well organized and structured. The lectures are pretty interesting too. I wish there were more practice materials to help students study for the exams.",
    "The class is well structured, I definitely appreciated the instructors printing out the slides for us to write on during lecture. Everything was concentrated in the lecture slides and the exams were very fair. It would be great if there could be more practice questions.",
    "I didn't really like that this was taught by so many people. It made it difficult to keep track of all of the different material and teaching styles. It also made it difficult to get help before exams because you'd have to meet with all four different professors in order to get questions answers. Otherwise, I liked the material.",
    "The tests seemed fair, and the teaching assistants were very knowledgeable. I think that the lab goes very well with the lectures. An issue I have with the course is the opaque grading. It is very unfair to students to not give them letter grades on their exams and instead just tell them the mean. It means that we can never be confident in our final grades or whether we should have dropped the class weeks ago. It's stressful for no reason -- this is the only class I have taken that has ever had this grading system.",
    "The material provided in this course is extremely interesting. The switching between professors provides a bit of discontinuity, but not too much. I felt like the material was very well taught the majority of the time. It is very much an independent course where it is the student's responsibility to keep up with the material, which I didn't mind at all but I feel like could be problematic for some students.",
    "A strength is that all the material is from lecture, therefore it is all taught to you and if you pay attention in the lecture you will know all the material. A weakness is that because of this, using a textbook is hard and there is no supplementary material to be presented in a different way besides lecture.",
    "on the second midterm, I was very frustrated with the grading. On two questions, i was docked 2 points each for only including 2 reasons when the professor was looking for 4 reasons BUT NEVER STATED it in the question. seems unfair to dock points, when my answer was 100% correct, for not including enough information that was NEVER asked for",
    "Practice Exams\/Problems - that one WS was really helpful!",
    "MCDB 290 is a solid major course and is well-organized. The professors are good lecturers and willing to help. I appreciate the two midterm+1 exam format, although this could be stressful.",
    "Strengths you learn a lot and class is interesting",
    "Wertz's lectures could be a bit more organized, better explained. Jacobs-Wagner was perfect.",
    "A very good class. The lecturing was excellent, the course material illustrated general concepts but had useful specific examples, the topics were relevant and interesting, and the class was well-organized -- it was pretty effective to have professors from different specialties, and they coordinated well. The lecture slides were especially helpful and the tests were reasonable. It could possibly have benefited from having more exposure to original studies and\/or a discussion section to help understand the experiments being covered, but I understand why time constraints might keep that from working.",
    "It's really an amazingly-structured course in general. Extremely rapid pace, but it's obviously intentional so I wouldn't call it a weakness. The change between teaching style can be a little jarring with the multiple professors, but they're all just close enough in style that it's not really an issue.",
    "Professors Hatzios and Jacobs-Wagner were wonderful - clear, effective lecturers. Review sessions before exams were helpful.",
    "The topics of the course are great and very interesting. I think there could be more engagement with the students, whether it is a weekly TA session or some kind of assignment to keep students accountable for the material.",
    "The course covers a lot of different topics and puts emphasis on experimentation, which is great. The progression of the topics is very nice. Also, that experts in the topics teach each one is amazing. I wish we had covered a bit more of non-bacteria microorganisms.",
    "There were multiple professors for the course, which was disconcerting. Some I found super engaging and other's were not as much. It also confused me for the second exam, as the format was not similar to the first exam.",
    "this class was extremely well taught and the professors gave students ample resources. I have no criticisms of the class.",
    "I thought the lectures were interesting, particularly the lectures on antibiotics and infection. The strengths included the review sessions from the TAs. I thought these review sessions were excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, its not too bad, but the tests are weighed heavily.",
    "Absolutely. You'll learn so much!",
    "Microbiology was probably to most interesting MCDB class I've taken so far. Definitely take it with the lab!",
    "I would recommend this class, as long as you are willing to put in the effort to memorize and understand everything. The exams are VERY detailed (short\/long answers only). Also recognize that your grade will only be dependent upon 2 midterms and 1 final exam.",
    "Yes! If you need an MCDB elective, this is a challenging and interesting alternative to cell bio that isn't too time consuming.",
    "I heard the grading in this class is quite harsh but we'll see. Overall I would recommend taking the class. Very low work compared to other MCDB courses with no section or weekly quizzes. There was definitely a lot of information to take in in this course though, so study well during the semester. All different aspects of microbiology and I thought it was quite comprehensive. In particular, I think I really improved my experimental thinking skills e.g. in finding virulence genes. Designing experiments was a big theme throughout the exams. The class is well structured, I definitely appreciated the instructors printing out the slides for us to write on during lecture. Everything was concentrated in the lecture slides and the exams were very fair. It would be great if there could be more practice questions. Professor Jacobs Wagner is amazing, she really engages the class and explains difficult concepts very well. Professor Hatzios was also great.",
    "It was okay as an MCDB course. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the subject matter, I thought that it was very interesting. I thought that the structure of the course could have been better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I found it super interesting and super relevant. I also found it well taught.",
    "This is a great course. After the intro bio sequence, I was pretty disillusioned with biology. This course was much more interesting, and practical however; I am now more reassured of my major.",
    "This is a good, interesting course to take that is straightforward. There is a decent amount of information to learn but it is all from lecture and the tests are fair. The only grade is from tests which can go either way. The only downside is there is a lot of information to remember.",
    "absolutely",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The class is well taught and very interesting. There are 3 professors who are all quite good (although Wertz is a bit boring). The course has 2 midterms and one final, no sections, and no homework so the workload is quite manageable.",
    "Awesome class! Took it non-major (MB&B). Super interesting!! I actually enjoyed bio again. Draws heavily from Intro Bio, Biochem (I) and Parallels biochem II nicely. Great if you think microbes are cool. Lots of memorization for the 3 exams. No psets. All Lecture.",
    "MCDB 290 is a great class--a lot of memorization and grades only depend on exams, but it is well-taught and well-organized.",
    "I would definitely recommend it but just know the curve is harsh so be careful.",
    "Yes! So interesting, you learn so much, and Jacobs Wagner is great",
    "Absolutely. If you're at all interested, take it. Very good professors, the material is interesting, and it helps explain a wide range of topics that are relevant in subjects outside of microbiology.",
    "This is a fantastic course for anyone who wants a solid microbiology toolkit going forward. Be aware that it's an intense amount of material, with a lot of rote memorization of protein names, signalling pathways, etc. That said, there's enough focus on concepts that the memorization feels like it's being put in context in a useful way. The professors range from competent to amazing, so they make it possible to actually absorb and take good notes on the absurdly huge quantity of information that's covered.",
    "If you have any interest in bacteria or viruses, this course is for you. Professors Hatzios and Jacobs-Wagner are engaging and helpful. Great way to fulfill an MCDB requirement!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in medicine in addition to microbiology because many of the concepts were directly related to pathogens and disease. Overall, it was a very interesting class where I learned many things.",
    "Totally, this class is great.",
    "I would recommend it but only if they are prepared to memorize a lot of information.",
    "YES! The subject matter is fascinating and the professors area joy to be around.",
    "This is a very interesting course. I am really grateful that I took it. I would recommend that students who enroll in this class in the future read the textbook."
