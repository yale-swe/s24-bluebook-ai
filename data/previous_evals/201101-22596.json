    "If you want to learn the language, then of course take it",
    "Great continuation to Hindi 110, and despite the complaints of some students, I think that we covered a tremendous amount of Hindi grammar and structures -- I can't believe how much we learned in just one semester, let alone a year. That said, the weakness of this class is a lack of vocabulary, which I think Seemaji is trying to address, and which is actually the easiest thing to pick up next year. The professors have been extremely accommodating and take student suggestions to heart. I really enjoyed this class, and hope you will, too!",
    "This class has a nice, laid-back feel to it -- it isn't incredibly intense. But bear in mind that there will be a big difference in work if you speak some indian language versusu if you don't. The class is taught more intuitively, and there are no vocab lists, so if you don't just sort of naturally understand some of the concepts, you might find it very challenging."
