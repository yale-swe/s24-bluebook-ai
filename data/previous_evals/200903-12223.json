    "An interesting look at the development of the short story genre, including some well-known authors (Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Borges, Cort\u00e1zar, Allende, etc.). Not an extremely taxing syllabus: one story per class session (and they're generally pretty short). P\u00e9rez is a good lecturer, and knows what he's talking about. I'd recommend it.",
    "Reading Spanish short stories in Spanish, then talking about them in class. Three papers, not too long. You really get out what you put in, since it isn't clear if you don't do the reading. It is a pretty light work load and really interesting. Take it!",
    "This class is not hard and it is very interesting, you learn a lot about Latin American intellectuals and there self-conception and you debate ethical issues that will have you reading literature from around the world in a different way. Professor Gonzalez is very nice and knowledgable and although the class is more like a lecture than a seminar, what he says is always interesting and makes you reconsider what you had first thought when reading the stories.",
    "I am a huge fan of Professor Gonzalez and liked this class just because I got to hear him speak about Latin American literature. He is very knowledgable and passionate about this subject, and absurdly good-natured. However, the course itself wasn't that fantastic. The stories we read ranged from mediocre to wonderful (Cortazar's El apocalipsis de Solentiname comes to mind as an example of the latter) but the theme, \"Ethics and Politics in the Spanish American Short Story\" is a little too broad and the lectures felt very scattered. The stories didn't really relate to one another other than the fact that they were about ethics and politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The reading list is great, Prof. Gonzalez is really nice, and it is a very easy workload. If you are looking to improve your speaking skills, however, this is definitely not the class for you because it is mostly lecture.",
    "This class is a seminar, but it is taught more like a lecture. There is little student participation and you mostly listen to the professor's thoughts on the stories we read, which can be interesting. It would be easy to go through the class without doing much of the reading; the three essays you write are on texts that you choose outside of class.",
    "Survey classic Latin American short stories with emphasis on ethics in both the works' content and form, including the ethical predicaments of authorship. If you want to read the short stories on the syllabus go for it. Remember that the course feels more like a lecture than a seminar.",
    "Great class, wonderful readings, good class discussion.",
    "If you are a literature major in search of a Spanish class, this could be a quite difficult course, but at least it is a bit more straightforward than poetry. The readings can vary radically from say 6 to 19 pages or so, so sometimes they will be short but difficult, or sometimes they might be long and difficult, so if you don't really have Spanish down, this can really hit you over the head. Fortunately, the professor really clarifies things during class, although students seem to be generally intimidated by discussing the material, but at least the environment vies to be as low pressure as possible. Still, the readings are difficult and tedious for students not hardcore into Spanish. If you need an advanced Spanish class, there is not a lot to choose from, but this course is as low pressure as possible, but the readings can be ridiculously tough going since they are about pushing for more abstract ideas. The great thing is that all the readings are on the Classesv2 server, so at least this course will not burden you financially."
