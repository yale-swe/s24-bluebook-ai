   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class and this section to another student. The course was well-taught and fairly graded, and my Spanish level speaking, listening, reading, and writing definitely improved.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 140 because Spanish is a beautiful language and mastery of it is important, but I would not recommend it with Prof. Safille, unless the person I was recommending it to had a lot of energy and patience.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 to other students. It's a great course that strengthens all facets that are crucial in learning a language, from compositions and grammar to speaking\/pronunciation and presentations.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a solid continuation of Spanish skills. However, overall I don't understand why we watched Spanish films and videos with English subtitles. I rarely tried to comprehend the Spanish for fear of missing out on understanding the whole video by reading the English.",
    "Spanish 140 is good for improving fluency both written and spoken. The novel that is read at the end of the semester and the short stories throughout help in understanding Spanish literature.",
    "Barbara Safille is an amazing teacher and if you can take this class with her, you definitely should! The class itself is interesting and will definitely help to improve your Spanish abilities without being unmanageable.",
    "I would recommend this course both to people who need to fulfill their requirement and to people who enjoy learning languages. I especially praise the reading material for this course. The short stories both in the book and in the course packet are challenging but still interesting enough to be worth the effort. Learning the vocab sucks though. Luckily this is only a small part of the course."
