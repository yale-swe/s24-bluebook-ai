   "comments": [
    "I am not quite sure what I learned this semester because I do not understand 80% of what occurs in class. The professor moves very quickly with the material. People do not usually ask questions in class.Do not take this class unless you need to take it for the requirements of the Economics and Mathematics major. I felt completely lost in class and very confused regarding how to start problem sets.The TA was not particularly helpful or useful. The class notes are very difficult to understand as well.",
    "If you're an Econ\/Math major you have to take it. If you're interested in Game Theory and are really good at math, I would definitely recommend this above the other game theory courses offered here. However, I do wish I had taken Polak's course before this one.",
    "Incredibly difficult and abstract, but Professor Horner realizes this. He cares more about you understanding and enjoying the class than about getting you with a bad grade.",
    "It is a great course to take if you want to get a thorough understanding of game theory.",
    "This is a very challenging class that I only suggest for econ and math majors or people who are really interested in mathematical econ. The weekly problem sets are meant to push beyond class material, and they certainly do. The midterm and final (non-cumulative) are supposed to test the basic concepts, and not push like the problem sets, but they are still quite difficult.",
    "Not as fun as the name sounds, but more enlightening from a theoretical perspective than the introductory game theory course.",
    "This course has an unnecessarily bad reputation. Yes, the material is incredibly difficult and many problem set questions are more or less impossible. However, Horner does not expect his students to be able to answer most of the questions he assigns, and as a result the homework are graded on a \"1, 2, or 3\" scale and not a large part of one's grade. Both the midterm and the final are open-note and, while difficult, quite fair with a generous curve. I'd absolutely recommend the class to any econ major who considers himself to be mathematically inclined.",
    "Fun material but the second half of the course is extremely difficult. One of the harder courses in the Econ and Math combined major.",
    "If you need a more formal understanding about game theory, this would be the class for you."
