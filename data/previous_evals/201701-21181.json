However, the greatest weakness, as a result of that, is the general lack of structure in the course which then lends itself to very speculative and dangerously substanceless discussion. I wish there was a stronger academic rooting in the course-- I think that would have increased the depth of our discussion and analysis."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. Marc is a wonderful professor and he sets up the discussion well and then really lets the students drive it. It's a phenomenal syllabus that changes every time he gives the course, so it's amazingly up to date. If you're interested in going into theater after college, I don't think there's a more useful class in the theater studies department. If you just like theater, this is a really great way to build a foundation of knowledge about what's out there right at this very moment. Can't recommend it enough. Take it!",
    "Marc Robinson is such a wonderful guy and an amazing professor. Hearing him speak about theatre is always exciting and the plays that you get to read and think about in this class are so cool. Theater Now is my favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take everything Marc Robinson teaches. You will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who has the time and the interest to engage in a lot of unstructured but exciting learning about works that have premiered very recently and so are very fresh on everyone's minds but are not necessarily that well studied."
