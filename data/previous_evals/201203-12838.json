    "You learn Spanish. It comes after L1 and L2. Basically just going over most basic tenses and adding vocab. Doesn't take as much time as other language classes do, and is very well taught with a good curriculum.",
    "If you need it as a graduation requirement, I say take it. Otherwise unless you love spanish (which I don't) I would say its a very big time commitment.",
    "Yes. I noticed a ton of improvement in myself and my classmates over the course of the semester, and getting to watch Pan's Labyrinth at the end is pretty cool.",
    "It wasn't very difficult. Do the homework and know your grammar from that, and don't skimp on the vocabulary. Really understand and be able to speak about the short stories and short films, a lot of discussion and testing centered around those throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend L3 if you really want to improve your Spanish and practice your speaking. It is a good amount of daily work, but your Spanish will improve."
