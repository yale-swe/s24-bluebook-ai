    "This class was awesome! You learn to weld and get to make a couple of really cool sculptures. Plus you get access to the metal shop, where you can make all sorts of awesome things. Brent is really laid back and an awesome prof. He does a great job of guiding students in the right direction without being overbearing.",
    "Lots of fun playing with metal.",
    "If you can get into the class, take Art 121. You'll get to make two really cool projects, and work with an awesome professor. You'll have to come into the shop outside of class, but I found that I enjoyed my time outside of class as well."
