    "CBIO 606 is a seminar course where you get to thoroughly read, critique, and present interesting Cell Bio papers in a small-group setting. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Overall, I feel that this course definitely advances a student's scientific acumen.",
    "Definitely, a great course that allows you to really engage with the papers, methodology and learn new insights into the current topics in cell bio.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to learn about critically discussing primary literature while learning about current topics regarding cell biology.",
    "Great course. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Cell Biology 606 is a well-designed seminar class that emphasizes on reading primary literature and nurturing critical thinking skills, a must-have for those who are interested in pursuing scientific studies. I would definitely recommend it to other students."

   "comments": [
    "Since I haven't joined a thesis lab yet and don't know which department I'll join, I can't comment on how this course will contribute toward my dissertation\/research. However, this course definitely enhanced my ability to read well any paper from any discipline. If I end up joining the Cell Bio Department, this course will prove to be extremely useful for familiarizing me with this topic.",
    "Gave me a broad insight into how to approach different problems, definitely helped understand now only the cell bio background but subjects that were applicable to other classes.",
    "I learned about various topics, some of which relate directly towards my thesis research project, while others are interesting and important nonetheless to me from an academic perspective. This course has indeed helped me deepen my knowledge towards my discipline.",
    "It provided a basic knowledge of the field to support my future research plans.",
    "1. Critical thinking2. An overview of the most significant works in cell biology.3. The skills of oral presentation and writing are trained by group presentation and weekly summary.4. At least when I was working on prospectus writing, without the need of searching pubmed like crazy, I knew instantly that clathrin-coated pits were firstly described in mosquito oocyte by Roth and Porter in 1964."
