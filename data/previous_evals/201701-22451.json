    "I took the course to broaden my understanding in energy science. The essay part is probably the most useful to me because I get to explore different fields.",
    "Advanced knowledge in synthesizing, characterizing nano materials that can be applied in energy field.",
    "I learned about nanotechnology and its applications in energy",
    "I learned how to write a commentary-style paper and a perspective-style paper. Unfortunately, I didn't learn much else because the material was too difficult for me since it assumed that I had a lot of prior knowledge and understanding which I did not.",
    "This course was a great graduate introduction to fundamental theories in energy (i.e. charger transfer, recombination kinetics, light emission\/absorption properties), as well as more applied techniques used in fabricating technologies for energy applications."

   "comments": [
    "I think it's better to have three short essays and one final long essay. The midterm type essay is too short to include lots of info but too long for an abstract type of essay.",
    "More interactive discussion would help students solidify their learning of the material. More variety in teaching methods (other media, not just slides + lecture format, would be helpful).",
    "The lecture can cut some content off, leaving the time to more details of the content that students are interested in.",
    "I preferred the days where we had slides, so I could refer back to them.",
    "Some parts of this course are too difficult to be understood.",
    "It was good",
    "I think this class could be very helpful for a graduate student who studies nanotechnology, but not for anyone else. It would need to be more basic in order for anyone else to be able to understand the material. The course description didn't give any indication that the material would be so difficult, so clarifying that would probably improve student satisfaction with the class.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes but only if you are here to learn. It's disappointing to see some students seating at the corner of the class doing their own stuff. It's irritating with all the typing sound and giggling. There are two students came here just to show up and most of the time playing web page games. Another student is apparently nervous (preparing for resume and application) in trying to find a job in business. Excellent advisor, excellent content, some terrible participants.",
    "Yes, we definitely can learn a lot from this course",
    "Absolutely take this course! Professor Hu is amazing and the class was fantastic!",
    "I think this class could be very helpful for a graduate student who studies nanotechnology, but I would not recommend it for anyone else. It would need to be more basic in order for anyone else to be able to understand the material.",
    "Great course, highly recommended if you are new to nanotechnology or would like to learn about cutting-edge research and topics in energy.",
    "Yes."
