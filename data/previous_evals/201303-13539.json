For a school that has a stated interdisciplinary focus and a multitude of interdisciplinary students (as well as single-discipline students, as there should be a mix) there is a marked lack of actual directed study and focus on interdisciplinary classes."

    "Readings - I felt that our discussions often focused more on the content of the readings (ie the topic being studied) rather than how and why integration occurred. I would have preferred more readings like those we did at the beginning of the course about frameworks, epistemology, methodology, rather than the format of choosing a different topic every week to discuss.I think the course would work better as a methods course and\/or as a course where people conducting ID research could talk with others in different disciplines to gain new perspectives and understanding.Overall I think the course needs a more critical perspective on how ID research is conducted, it's inherent assumptions and methodological\/epistemological constraints, and ways to improve our own understanding.",

This would best be done by including a TF or joint professor who can speak from a non-academic (ie applied) view of integration and its use in the \"real\" world, so to speak.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to my peers.",
    "If you are interested at all in interdisciplinary work at FES or beyond, this course is necessary to frame your understanding of interdisciplinarity and to help you become much more effective as an interdisciplinary researcher and\/or applied consultant or whatever it is you are working towards."
