    "Take it if you want to study Spanish. If you're excited to learn Spanish (or you need to fulfill the reqs, and Spanish seems like the least of all evils), you'll like it. If you don't like Spanish or language classes, you probably won't like it. It's pretty exhausting that it meets every day, but then again you get 1.5 credits and it's pretty easy to get a good grade, so it's a GPA helper.",
    "Basic continuation of Spanish. Goes over grammar\/reading comprehension. Recommended for those wishing to become fluent in the language or those wishing to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "Yes. It will improve your Spanish",
    "It is a good summary of what you've learned in Spanish, but the standard is much higher than in L3, and it is overall a much harder course.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140. It was a good class and I enjoyed learning and improving my Spanish. Lots of verbs!",
    "I would recommend it if they want to improve their Spanish and don't mind working hard. It won't teach you that much new from L3, but it will make you way better at the same concepts.",
    "Not tough if you've taken the levels before. Grading is very fair. Just reinforcing ideas.",
    "This is a good intermediate spanish class that strengthens your grammar foundations and makes you a more confident speaker.",
    "I would recommend it only as a stepping stone to L5 level classes (which I'm hoping are better classes than L3 and L4 have been). The curriculum is mundane and mechanical, and I learned very little for the amount of time I spent in class.",
    "Spanish 140 is a class that you should take if you want to polish up on your spanish grammar and vocabulary before L5. It is a good preparatory course and the workload isn't that bad, but it does meet everyday which kind of gets annoying. I would recommend this class to another student who really wants to learn Spanish well."
