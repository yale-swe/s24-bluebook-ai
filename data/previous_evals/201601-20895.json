   "comments": [
    "I loved having Sam as a professorhe gives a lot of good feedback but for the most part trusts us to do our work at our best level. I also appreciate how he treated everyone, regardless of skill, with the same respect (and he didn't let people who had more experience with drawing to get an easy pass- I felt like he held everyone to the same expectation of doing the best work they were capable of). I sometimes do wish he had been more critical early on",
    "Good class, really enjoyable and really improved my drawing skills. Sam and Alteronce both are encouraging (even when my drawings weren't great), and they allowed us to experiment with different mediums (ink, charcoal, pencil, and clay) throughout the end of the semester. The final project is big but definitely manageable, and I really enjoyed doing it.",
    "Very easy. The work is time consuming, yes, and as a Yale student, you're probably already oh-so-busy. But if you want to get good at drawing, this class will provide you with the structure to improve multiple aspects of your creative ability, it will give you a community of artists that will critique your work, and it will provide you with the motivation to draw (because you will have assignments outside of class that impact your grade).",
    "Take this class if you want to learn how to draw. Take this class if you have to fulfill an art major requirement (although it might not be as fun). Take this class if you want a cool art class to balance out a ton of STEM classes. Don't take this class if you're looking for a gut.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you have no drawing experience I felt like I was able to really learn a lot, and it was nice to get to practice a skill I've been wanting to gain for a while. I find myself drawing a lot more after this class, so it's definitely worth it in that sense. Less technical instruction than I'd prefer, and sometimes the assignments were a bit unclear, but it was fun and I learned a lot!",
    "A basic intro to drawing class. I would recommend if you enjoy drawing, otherwise spending four hours per week might get monotonous",
    "Yes, definitely. This class will allow you to work on your drawing in a great atmosphere where you feel pushed only by yourself because you want to do your best for your teachers and classmates. I got much better at drawing just by practicing in class and getting bits of wisdom from Professor Messer. We got to draw a variety of things: still lives, indoor and outdoor landscapes, nudes, and much more. This was a great class.",
    "The class was not very stressful but very helpful. I feel I learned more about how to approach making a piece of 2D art rather than drawing techniques.",
    "Take the class with Messer (and Alteronce, if he's still around!) While other Basic Drawing classes can get a little work intensive, Sam did a great job of keeping the workload light and the class focused, interesting, and our assignments diverse. His focus is not on the technicalities of drawing -- which is great if you don't have much of a background in art -- but in seeing the 3d world on a 2d plane, and the nuances of visual thinking and mark making.",
    "Prof. Messer's version of this class is very fun and useful. You cover the basics in cool and creative ways."
