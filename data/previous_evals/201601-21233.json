    "If you have interest in birds at all or you just wanna learn more, this class is a good way to do so. This class ain't a gut so if you just playin then don't do it homie. This class only for those who gonna brave the storm. There a fkload of material in this class man. It ain't unmanageable but it ain't no walk in the park pickin daisies either man. Take Cr\/D if you dun know about your commitments man. Go on the field trips if you can man. Prum's a bird god and changing the field in various areas by himself man. So worth man. I fkin loved it man, but dun do this if you just playin man. Jus 2 midterms, a final, n a final paper man. 10\/10 man",
    "An enjoyable experience besides the fact that the class meets so early in the morning. Not too much work, accessible, and surprisingly fascinating (Prum's passion and theories have a lot to do with this). Especially toward the end of the semester the topics get increasingly interesting, from migration to singing to sex. Just gotta get through the anatomy\/physiology before the fun stuff. The paper seems like a challenge for those who haven't written science papers before",
    "Not a gut science class, but not considered difficult either. If you really want to learn something interesting in science, take it!!!!",
    "I took this class for distribution. One of the best decisions I've ever made in terms of courses at Yale. It reminds you that learning is fun. I was not a bird person going into this class, but I came out with a much greater appreciation for how complicated and cool they can be. This class would be perfect for science distribution if it didn't require a final paper.",
    "Yes! You will know a lot more about birds (feathers, songs, sex, etc.) and know how awesome they are!",
    "Take this class only if you're really interested in birds or at least are willing to learn a lot of random information about them. Prum is great and really enthusiastic about his work and the class, but sometimes you leave class wondering why any of this information is at all useful or applicable to non-bird things. If you're looking for a gut, this class isn't a ton of work, but you do have to put in a decent number of hours for studying for the three exams. It's also unclear what he wants from the paper exactly so be aware of that. Otherwise, for a non-E&EB related major, this was a decent class.",
    "Super fun lecture course. I would highly recommend it.",
    "This is such a great class! If you like birds and want to learn everything from feathers to weird avian physiology, then this is the class for you! The only work you'd need to do is study for three (cumulative) exams plus write a final paper.",
    "Perhaps one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Granted, I'm biased because I grew up birdwatching and absolutely love birds, but it's indisputable that Rick Prum is a genius both in breadth and depth. He pursues work that demonstrates his deep understanding of any subject matter involved--whether it's physics, economics, philosophy, gender studies, organic chemistry, all of it. I had nothing to gain distributional wise by taking this course since I'm a science non-EEB major, so I can really attest to how this is class worth taking for your own fun and edification. Rick Prum breathes out infectious passion. He can sometimes be a bit intimidating and abrasive but know he has a good heart and just ask him about his work and agh I'm such a fangirl. I do wish there had been more behavioral ecology and conservation and population ecology in the course (it was almost all physiology and evolution) but that's just my personal preference speaking.",
    "This course is amazing. But please, if you are not going to take this course seriously or are not genuinely interested in the subject, don't take it and leave spots for those of us who really care about this material. This is not an easy science credit. There is a lot of material and you have to pay attention to catch it. That said, if you are interested in learning in this class, it is incredibly rewarding. It just annoys me when a bunch of people looking for an easy science credit (which this is not) flood classes like this one and take spots from science majors that might even want to do research with the professor based on the course.",
    "Ornithology was just as great as the previous reviews promised. It is of course a full semester about the relatively specific topic of birds, so you have to be interested in birds in order to enjoy the class. Professor Prum has a great sense of humor and is very engaging, the class is well-organized, the lectures are very interesting, the tests are fair, and the term paper is rather flexible. I would highly recommend this class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Guys. I am a humanities major. I think science is pretty meh, and I am not very good at it. But I LOVE this class. Professor Prum's lectures are so engaging and his enthusiasm for the topic is contagious. He does a lot of history of science, which was nice for the humanities major in me. He is also very clear and answers questions well, which means that you can do very well in the class even if science doesn't come naturally to you. You do need to put time into studying, but there's no weekly homework which is nice. Seriously, guys, this class is so meaningful and fun and fascinating. My family tells me I have a \"bird problem\" and made me stop calling them with fun facts about birds every time I study for a test. It is so, so much better than taking a gut for your science credit, and you will probably do better in this class because the material is so darn memorable. I promise, you will not regret it.",
    "I was looking for a non-gutty science, and I ended up in Ornithology. Professor Prum's lectures are super fascinating, though be warned, this is definitely not a gut.",
    "An amazing class on a fascinating group of organisms. Every lecture was worth going to class at 9:25 for.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Fun! If you go to lecture and study for exams in advance, it's not too stressful. You'll come out of it knowing a lot!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The subject matter was fascinating, and Prof. Prum is a great lecturer (and obviously a leader in his field). Lots of memorization was necessary, but it was worthwhile. I wouldn't have previously said that I was interested in birds, but because of this class I can appreciate the complexity of avian biology in a new way. Be wary of the early start time, but don't let it deter you from this class.",
    "Ornithology is amazing, very interesting, not a gut, but not too heavy either. Prum's a great lecturer and the topic is, you know, cool birds, so it's guaranteed to be fun. That said, it is technical, so you are going to have to study and figure out the difference between xanthophylls and ketocarotenoids and all of the other fun polysyllabic terminology. There are two (cumulative) midterms, a final that is basically another midterm, and a final paper (10-20 pages). Taking it credit\/D was great for me--the class is inherently fun, so if you can take it for credit it's just pure fun without needing to stress about the exams. Oh, one note--if you've taken other organismal diversity courses you might expect this to serve as a phylogeny overview. It's not--the lecture is about general topics (anatomy, evolution, song, cognition, etc.), while the lab is for memorizing the phylogeny. So, take the lab if that's what you're interested in (it's also just amazing, so do it if you can) and you can devote a fair bit of time to memorizing family names. All in all, great course, great lecturer, fun times all around.",
    "This class teaches you how incredibly awesome birds are. I highly recommend taking this course!",
    "You learn a lot about birds. But take this class even if you've never cared about birds in your life. You will by the end of it. It's difficult to explain why, but the truth is that Prum's enthusiasm for learning is infectious. If you join him, the course will seem like an adventure that only continues when it's finished.",
    "AN AMAZING CLASS. YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT BIRDS. This is my favourite class I have taken at Yale. It was fully worth walking up Science Hill 3 times a week at 9 am. You get taken through a lot of extremely fascinating topics, although they're focused a lot on Prum's research and interests so, while this is sort of a survey ornithology course, it's also not quite a traditional survey ornithology course, especially near the end. THERE'S SO MUCH COOL STUFF ABOUT BIRDS. Prum is a phenomenal lecturer and is pretty good about answering questions both during and after class. I would fully recommend this course -- BUT, with the caveat that you should really like birds, or at least already have some kind of interest in them. It gets really nitty-gritty sometimes, which, as someone who loves birds, was great for me, but I've heard from other people who didn't really care that much about birds coming in that it was just not interesting for them. I wouldn't take this just because you want a gut science course (especially because there's a final exam and a 10-15 page final paper). If you like birds though, you absolutely have to take this class. Also, go on the field trips if you can! They're incredibly fun and you see a lot of really neat things through the fancy expensive binoculars you get for the day.",
    "Take this class for a science credit!! It's not that much work, it's more interesting than any science class I've ever taken, and it's engaging and fun and you can go on field trips if you want. DO IT DO IT DO NOT HESITATE.",
    "Extremely engaging, fun, and not too much work. The final paper is a bit tough if you're unfamiliar with scientific writing; also, topics are hard to figure out, and you need to work with Prum in advance. Highly recommend.",
    "I took this to get a science credit, and am glad I did. Prum is a fantastic lecturer, and I learned a lot about birds, obviously, and much of it's super useful for dinner party conversation starters, but a lot of the material covered is very applicable to other subjects. Be warned there is a lot of material, and the tests require that you've learned it thoroughly. Definitely not a gut. If you're having trouble retaining everything from lectures, start taking advantage of office hours early. Prum is very approachable and accommodating, and his office hours for this class are definitely an underused resources.",
    "The course offers a lot of great teaching but also a lot more work than many expect. Also, many of the students in the class are serious enthusiasts if not experts which does affect grades at the end of the day so do not take this as a science gut.",
    "This course is perspective-changing, if not life-changing. I was a tired, stressed, apathetic second-semester senior and for a few weeks I came close to leaping cheerfully out of bed in the morning to make the long walk up Science Hill (it helped that the winter was mild). Birds are amazing. You get to learn all about feathers, and the evolution of aesthetic preferences, and DINOSAURS. It made me see my whole world a little differently; it changed how I think about my relationship to nature. It is not easy, but it is very manageable if you go to class; and I thought it was more than worth it."
