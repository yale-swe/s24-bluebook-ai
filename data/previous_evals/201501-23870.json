    "This course is an overview of a variety of topics, ranging from obesity and the physiology of nutrient uptake to innovations in cancer research. You learn mechanisms of action and the overall significance of each topic, and are expected to master large amounts of material. The course is enjoyable and I would recommend it if you're interested in physiology or global health, but I would not recommend it as a science credit to non-science majors.",
    "This is a great course for non-science majors. The material is super interesting, not too difficult biology wise, as long as you keep up with the material. Also, Professor Saltzman is the best professor I have ever had the opportunity of having. He is so receptive to students needs and presents the material in a way that is best for the students. He is so smart too -- he is incredible in his accomplishments. I have been at Yale for 2 years, and he has been my favorite professor thus far. I wish he taught more classes at Yale, I would take them all.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, particularly as a non-science major. I took this because I am very interested in global health and wanted to get some more in depth understanding of the biological determinants of health. This class was generally effective at doing that, but it was definitely more tailored to talking about non-communicable diseases. With that said, though, professor Saltzman is willing to talk about things you're interested in... so take the class and just suggest things you want to learn about if you're not sure he'll cover them. He is amazing, very interesting and so nice. The homeworks are generally pretty easy and the tests are as well. If you have a general understanding of the material you will do well. Overall a great course!",
    "A class that everyone should take about how the body works. The teaching is excellent and the material is fascinating",
    "Take this class! I really enjoyed this course! It taught us some of the systems in our bodies, and then incorporated a lot of technologies and applications of that knowledge. We also did a lot of interactive activities, which was great because the class was pretty small. Also Professor Saltzman is super awesome! He cares so much about his students and tries to keep class chill and engaging so you feel like you're in a safe space and can interject at any point.",
    "Take it! Good material about health issues anyone could face.",
    "Amazing science class, learned a lot and it wasn't hard if you put in the basic amount of work. professor saltzman is super chill, he'll answer all your questions and the TAs were really helpful. Definitely worth taking!",
    "YES, TAKE IT. You will not have another class like this. Pros: it's a really practical, great intro course to pathology of major diseases. I went in with no bio background except BIOL 101-104, and it fit in really well with that knowledge base. Now I have a pretty good idea of the major diseases out there, the effects in terms of global health, but also the pathology and current research in the field. Guest lecturers include head of the Cancer Center, and other really distinguished professors. Honestly it was just a really great class. Not too pressured, and I could also do all the in depth further reading that I wanted to in the Robbins\/Cottran book, which I really enjoyed. Saltzman's BioMed book was also good, and fit really well with the lectures. Saltzman - One of the best instructors I've had at Yale. He literally learned the names of every person in the class. It was a really great, warm, productive class atmosphere. Again, I cannot stress how much I enjoyed this class. TAKE IT.",
    "HLTH 251 is a great class for anyone who wants an introduction to physiology with a focus on the physiology of disease. It is a manageable course and you walk away from the class feeling like you learned a lot without all of the stress of a full physiology class.",
    "Excellent class, which will certainly need a bigger classroom next year to match demand!",
    "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. This class changed my life. Professor Saltzman is one of the best professors I've had at Yale and is such a nice man. He provided really important information about how our bodies work & the innerworkings of common diseases in a very accessible way for science and non-science majors alike. This class is set up, amazingly, to help you succeed and learn. From weekly problem sets, a discussion-based, open classroom environment and TA sessions where you could ask any question you wanted, I feel like I very deeply understand physiology. I had literally just high school freshman bio before this class and did very well, it was a pretty light workload with a SUPER HUGE reward, and our whole class became friends, which was a total plus too. Professor Saltzman even brought us fro-yo on the last day of class, if that gives you a sense of how amazing of a guy he is. TAKE THIS CLASS. It will give you tangible info about your body & how to be healthy & what is actually happening when you get sick."
