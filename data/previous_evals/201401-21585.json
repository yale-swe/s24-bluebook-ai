    "Great seminar on China, amazing syllabus on the politics, history, and economics of modern China. Best if you have a decent level of familiarity with Chinese culture and history.",
    "A thematic look at contemporary Chinese politics and history. Because each week's discussion is led by a student - their is significant variability in the quality of each week's conversation. Papers are interesting and Professor Wallace is a thoughtful and engaging classroom presence.",
    "Grew on me over the semester. Student-led discussions can really bomb, but Prof. Wallace works them really effectively. It's like he's the expert in the room who can either get us on track when we go down a blind alley, or can just offer insights of real quality. Discussion can drag when kids don't do the reading, and I'm not sure to what extent Prof. Wallace pushed us on that -- he certainly didn't do it publicly. Still, I felt I learned a good bit, with very good readings and a good class-professor dynamic.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a overview of Chinese politics and much of the history but also discussion and readings go deeply into each area providing a thorough look into each week's topic. There is a lot of student participation.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a very comprehensive, interesting overview of pretty much every aspect of Chinese politics. Take it if you are interested in China.",
    "Yes if you know a lot about China or Chinese politics. There will be a lot of students-discussions rather than professor talking"
