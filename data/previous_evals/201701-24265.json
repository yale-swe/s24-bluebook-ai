    "More information about LGBTQ social movements and critical perspectives for thinking about these issues! Also gained useful literature for my thesis.",
    "Great class. In depth analysis of human rights in relation to gender and sexuality",
    "Wonderful global perspective on the rise of transnational LGBTQ movements and homophobia.",
    "I learned a great deal about contemporary attempts to provide an international human rights framework for LGBT+ people, and the theory behind it.",
    "I learned to be more critical of my own language and of the language of others when discussing LGBTQ issues, especially on a global scale. I learned to differentiate and detect policies that are outwardly hateful versus oppressive. I also became aware of the complexities transnational activists face in navigating different sexualities and political climates across the world.",
    "Learned about transnational activism (especially the challenges faced), and some of the academic and activist discourses surrounding LGBTI people and activism. Added a great deal of nuance to my understanding of LGBTI identities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "What it was lacking in structure it made up in content. We had a lot of interesting discussions and the readings were great.",
    "Great seminar. Maybe more videos",
    "Professor Reid obviously brought an incredible background perspective to the topic. Really wonderful readings (good mix of theory and applied pieces) that sparked great discussion. Loved the student presentations because it introduced us to a lot of different topics. I thought class worked best when we had an interesting student presentation and then some piece to spark a discussion about the readings. For example, I loved when you played film clips and then we would discuss them using the lens of the readings. Overall, very enjoyable and insightful class. I think the toughest part about it was the date and time. 9:25am on a Thursday is notoriously hard for students, which means it takes a little longer for people to wake up and get the discussion rolling. I think this class would be even better at a different time (or date maybe).",
    "Professor Reid was an excellent seminar leader, and we always engaged in productive and interesting discussions. The readings were all relevant and diverse. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course was very strong in that it always provided relevant and informative readings that immersed me in the language and situation of the topic. I also really liked the case studies because they served as great examples. It was also very cool that Professor Reid is very involved in these issues and could give us background and updates on what we spoke about. I did feel that the course needed more of an introduction to what was expected of us and what we would be doing. However, this did not take away from how much I enjoyed the course.",
    "Prof Reid is fantastic with handling class discussions, and is a great resource for any questions you may have about LGBTI activism. He is the director of the Human Rights Watch LGBT program, and I think it was a cool opportunity to learn from someone who practices LGBTI activism on a daily basis. He's good with asking interesting, thought-provoking questions and gives great insight. The readings were also all around enjoyable and well-organized. No real complaints at all."

   "comments": [
    "This is a super interesting class for anyone who is interested in issues of gender and sexuality--the reading is heavy but super worth it and Prof. Reid brings an interesting perspective!",
    "YES",
    "Yes! Professor Reid, who works at Human Rights Watch, brings a wonderful global perspective on the rise of transnational LGBTQ movements and homophobia. The class had really strong readings and discussions. It opens your mind to issues often not discussed or taught about.",
    "If you're at all interested in international LGBT issues, this is a wonderful seminar. The readings cover a wide variety of topics, from specific case studies to LGBT rights theory, and Professor Reid does an unusually great job at leading seminar discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to engage with LGBT issues on a global scale and especially in the world of politics. It gives one an interesting view into this legal dimension of LGBTQ that we often hear about but never really think deeply or globally about. Professor Reid is also amazing at leading seminar. Every word of feedback or response he gives is perfect and he works well with the input of students.",
    "Yes! It was a nice break from heavily academic courses, and I got to consider some really interesting questions about LGBTI activism. Discussions were generally great, and there was never a crazy amount of reading."
