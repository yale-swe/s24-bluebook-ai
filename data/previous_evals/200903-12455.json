    "It's a solid class - Professor Steen is very good but class discussion wasn't always the most interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. There are 2 short papers\/presentations and a final paper on the topic of your choice. Professor Steen is knowledgeable, approachable, and fosters discussion in the class. Although a few people will know quite a bit from their own experiences and may dominate discussion, she is still a great reason to take this class. It is no more work than any other seminar, and it's a great topic area. While the reading can be a bit heavy, it is probably not necessary to read all of it, but it is worth it to read as much as you can.",
    "I really enjoyed Political Regulation. The entire class is about looking at ways in which the government can and does (or cannot\/does not) regulate the political system, and the competing interests that are involved in deciding whether regulation is desirable and how much is necessary or wise. Professor Steen got more involved in seminar conversations than some other seminar professors, which I actually liked--it's good to have the professor, who knows more about the subject than the rest of us do, impart some of that knowledge to the students in a seminar instead of letting us run the class to the point that we just spout our views without paying attention to whether our views are actually backed up. There was a pretty large amount of reading (usually close to 200 pages a week, sometimes less), and there were three papers--two five-page papers that are meant to delve deeper into one aspect of a week's readings using outside sources, and a final 15-page paper. Professor Steen was VERY specific about what she wanted in the papers if you gave her a rough draft to look at (and she was always willing to read rough drafts), which meant that there were usually major changes that had to be made. She makes you work for it, but it works out in the end.",
    "Yes, take it if the issues interest you - a good polisci seminar",
    "I only recommend for political science majors.",
    "I would recommend it, but some of the reading and discussions are pretty technical, so some knowledge of and interest in the electoral process is a must."
