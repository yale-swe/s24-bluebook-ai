   "comments": [
    "I think I would recommend this course if it was not at 9 am and if some structural changes were made re: assignments and lectures. It was a new class this year, and the material was cool, but I think it was poorly structured, so I was often just very lost. Also, don't be a hero--no one can ever handle dense, dry wireless communications mathy shit at 9 am. Seriously, I think even Prof. Hu struggled with that.",
    "Yes, take EE451 if you're interested in networking\/wireless communications. The final project will be a great learning experience as you get the freedom to do whatever you want. Also, although the lectures may have lacked some direction at times, I think that the next time this course is taught, it'll be taught much better.",
    "It's a lot of work at times, especially at the end for the final project but this topic is a really important one in technology and is something that is really useful to know for the future so I think the work is well worth it.",
    "This class introduces you to the issues and concepts surrounding wireless communications. Not much math is involved beyond running some scripts in MATLAB. The final project is very open-ended, which I think is a strength. I recommend this class if you are going to be an engineer or computer scientist, as these issues are very important to understand.",
    "EENG 451 is essentially an introduction to Wi-Fi technology at the electrical engineers level with some applications in systems and computer science. I recommend the class to those who are interested in the lower levels of the networking stack. Professor Hu is an expert in the field, and the assignments and lab work proved to be quite interesting. There was also a reasonable degree of freedom with the scope of our final projects.",
    "This course was fairly easy, and the labs were ok.",
    "An eminently practical overview of Wireless Communications. Lecture material extremely accessible - no previous experience in the field required.",
    "I imagine the course is going to change a lot next year. This year it was only a few assignments and the labs were linux-based"
