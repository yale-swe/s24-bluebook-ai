    "This was a college seminar so I'm unsure if it will be offered again, but take it if you can!",
    "The Screenwriter's Craft is a seminar that's fun and rewarding no matter what prior experience you have in screenwriting and film. You essentially start the semester with a theme (which of course, can be tweaked), and then build upon that theme by developing characters, writing monologues, thinking about the three act structure, studying devices such as antagonism and epiphany, and writing scenes. You turn in the first four pages of your screenplay before Fall Break; fifteen are due by the end of the semester, though many students in the class write much more than that. Camille does a fantastic job working with you and meeting you at your level. You have at least two story conferences with her during the semester (though she's always happy to meet more often, too), and she makes an effort to understand each student and his or her story. I would absolutely recommend this class! It's a lot of fun, you get to be part of a supportive writing community, you develop a new appreciation for movies, and you get to develop an original screenplay. I loved this class through and through, and honestly, I would take it again if I could.",
    "This class is AMAZING. If you get in, you must take it!!!! Camille is an absolute gem--she cares so much about her students and their storylines. You will learn an enormous amount about film and writing, and have fun in the process! It was unlike any other class I've taken, but it was hands down the best class that I've taken at Yale",
    "I would suggest this course to any student interested in films as a writer, director, actor, etc. There is no role that is not important to creating a film and Camille (as a professional filmmaker) has invaluable and intimate knowledge of the industry to share.",
    "Definitely worth taking! The work load isn't too bad and Camille has an in-depth knowledge of film and some favorites you'd never expect. It's a great class if you want to learn about both screenwriting and film, since there are a couple lessons that are more about directing and cinematography than writing.",
    "Fan freaking tasctic, 10\/10 would recommend",
    "You should definitely take it! Camille's course is so fun, interesting, and varied. You'll never feel bored, and you'll emerge from it with so much more knowledge about the industry, the art of filmmaking, and the process of writing a screenplay. My one criticism is that it can get kind of superficial and weird at times. Camille's in-class exercises are, at worst, like games. They're hit-or-miss, so sometimes they inspire great ideas and artistry; other times, they can be a little silly.",
    "Do it!",
    "Take this class! You will not regret it. You will learn so much about how to write a screenplay, and your writing will grow by leaps and bounds. Also, in class you will watch film clips from renowned movies and learn about film structure, as well as how to parse a film. I was honestly not bored once in this class Camille has you do all kinds of different exercises, many of which force you to think outside the box and push your writing even further. She is an absolute gem of a professor, and cares about her students and their development as writers so so much. She even brought cupcakes to class, many times! It was a treat to take a class with with such a knowledgeable and dedicated professor.",
    "This was the best class I took at Yale. TAKE IT IF YOU GET IN. You watch and discuss film clips in a small class of diverse students. Professor Thomasson is an incredible teacher and works hard to make the class rewarding for all of her students. You'll have fun, you'll learn a lot about film, and you'll improve tremendously as a writer. By the end of the course, you will have written at least 15 pages of your own screenplay and have learned a lot about yourself. Also Professor Thomasson brings Claire's cake to class.",
    "If you have the good fortune of getting into this class, you'd be crazy not to take it. You'll learn about screenplays, of course, but even more about storytelling, acting, writing, and yourself. Professor Thomasson is perhaps the best professor I've ever had at Yale. My one caution: don't take this class if you're not willing to push yourself out of your comfort zone. Be ready to challenge yourself, and--if you allow yourself--to have a whole lot of fun.",
    "Take it! You dance, you sing, you act, you pretend you're not you...you learn how to make your characters dance and sing and act. It's fun but only if you're invested.",
    "This class is not only about writing, but so much about life. As writers we did not focus on the nitty-gritties of techniques, but more on feeling the emotions, struggles and choices of our characters, which we created that were more or less a mirror of our own experiences. Yet the characters we created, by making positive choices and finishing a plotline, teach us many things about love, compassion and family in return. Only Prof. Thomasson could teach screenwriting to such a high level and to be so all-encompassing, being such a knowledgeable, empathetic human being. One of the few \"Eureka!\" moments for me came in the last class of the semester, when she told us what I thought is the essence of the class, \"to love is to be vulnerable, and to write is to be compassionate and expose yourself to pain.\" I've learnt to write, to feel pain and to love."
