    "Yes, very interesting and fair class.",
    "Great material. Caring professor. Wonderful course.",
    "If you're interested in China's foreign policy, this is a really great class to give you the basics on the key topics, along with some useful tools for analysis. Prof Weiss is brilliant and does really cool work on the effect of domestic protest on the foreign policy of authoritarian regimes. The regular lectures vary from slightly dry (lots of videos in the beginning) to excellent, but the guest lectures are good! The sections are all spent doing simulation exercises that are fun, but you never talk about the readings so you have to be self-motivated to do those. There are three short papers (two policy briefs and an op-ed analysis) as well as a final that was pretty easy.",
    "This is an interesting class about China, and it really extends beyond political science. We talked a fair amount about the economy and China's internal politics (Professor Weiss's research is on Chinese nationalism and domestic protests). The course was also fairly easy: there was a lot of reading each week that necessitates cramming at the end, but there was no midterm and no real paper. The simulation papers are easy and guided, and the final was completely reasonable (terms, MC, and an essay). The course held together really well and was never repetitive, just a really good overview of Chinese modern history and place in the world. That being said, she's a terrible lecturer and it takes a lot of focus to go to lectures and not end up on Buzzfeed.",
    "This class is nice because it isn't a lot of work, but the material is really interesting. There's weekly readings, but I stopped doing them after the first couple weeks because I felt adequately prepared just through lectures. I took this class because I take Chinese at Yale, and wanted to learn more about China's history and politics. Take it if you're interested in China!",
    "This class was a brief overview of Chinese history and the use of this history to explain how the political landscape in China developed. The time period covered is from 1850s onward, with heavy emphasis on topics highly relevant today such as the Diaoyu Islands crisis between China and Japan. I would highly recommend this class to those who are interested in Chinese history and politics.",
    "This was a pretty good class - the lectures are a bit dull, but the material is generally interesting.",
    "Great, take it",
    "A very useful class for getting to know the post 19th century China and its current key affairs.",
    "To any student interested in China and China's actions in the contemporary world, I would recommend taking this class. Jessica is an amazing instructor, and the topic covered should be incredibly interesting to anyone interested in rising powers.",
    "A great polisci class. It is so easy to do well. It is also highly informative.",
    "Yes! This is a very good course to know more about China, both for people who have known some Chinese history and people who don't.",
    "Solid, basic overview of China's modern history, international relations, and domestic politics. Professor Weiss isn't exactly a dynamic lecturer, but she clearly has a lot of expertise and prepared a lot for her lectures. She also showed some interesting video clips in class. I'd recommend this class if you're interested enough in Chinese politics and affairs to tolerate a somewhat mediocre lecture experience (content is great, delivery is meh)."
