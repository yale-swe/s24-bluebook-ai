    "Wholeheartedly.",
    "Great for heritage speakers who want to improve all aspects of their language. You should definitely take this class if you're looking to improve your Spanish. It's also a really fun class.",
    "I completely recommend this class to heritage speakers who want to improve their Spanish. Minus a three month immersion, this class gives you every tool you need to reach fluency. To what degree the tools are used is up to each student, but a semester with Prof. Alexandrov will leave any student ready to pursue their goals in Spanish.",
    "A great class that allows for students to really engage in spanish-spoken discussions. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "TAKE IT!Profesora Alexandrov is amazing -- my favorite professor at Yale.Workload is manageable, tests are fair, class is fun\/engaging, the 2 books we read were fun reads. u learn a great amount of vocab, dont really analyze literature that deeply, and helps with writing skills. not much to complain about.",
    "Taking native speaker spanish can be very challenging, but also very rewarding. You will have to put effort into the course, but it's worth it because everyone in the class became really close and Sybil Alexandrov is awesome!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that has the opportunity to take it. Profesora Alexandrov does a very good job of establishing a sense of community in the class, which makes for an excellent atmosphere to learn and practice Spanish. I especially recommend this course to freshman from Latino communities and neighborhoods...it will help with the homesickness!",
    "this class is good for a student that has been around Spanish very much, knows how it works, but doesn't know why it works. It fills in the little gaps left from learning a language informally very well.",
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you are heritage speaker\/grew up in a Spanish speaking country. One of the highlights of my year!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because the Prof. Alexandrov is amazing! She really knows what she's teaching and the class is really fun. You learn a good amount of grammar and read some great books. You also discuss two movies that you watch on your time in class. In the end, you are supposed to give an oral presentation about a subject that you choose, so long as it is relevant to spanish\/spanish-speaking countries. Take this course!",
    "Yes, your Spanish will improve tenfold.",
    "This was the most enjoyable class I have ever taken at Yale. I walked in hoping for tangible improvements in my spanish grammar, and that is what I got.Prof. Alexandrov is caring, enthusiastic, and energetic. She is clear and relatable."
