    "We continued learning about German vocab and grammar. Because this was L3, a good deal of time was spent reviewing concepts we learned in L2 but in greater detail. This wasn't necessarily a negative as it made me a good deal more comfortable with the skills I already had.",
    "I improved my writing and speaking of German.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the in class activities were well designed and oriented well towards becoming more comfortable having day to day conversations in German. The introduction of essays was a good way to get practice. In terms of a negative, the online homework was usually very unhelpful, especially as after one incorrect answer the correct answer was simply revealed, rather than forcing us to keep looking for the correct one.",
    "We were often tested on reading and listening comprehension, but did very little to actually work on or improve those skills in class, especially listening. I enjoyed the organization of the class, as units were organized by a relative topic in relation to a major German city. I also enjoyed the email exchange and final video project. We only ever read non-fiction articles in class, which often made improving my reading skills difficult. The introduction of so many unfamiliar words and concepts made it difficult.",
    "Very engaging during class. The hour flew by.",
    "This course, like others taught at Yale, is concentrated on teaching German from a didactic rather than a practical point of view. Grammar is referred to only by technical terminology (e.g. accusative, dative, genitive) which is foreign to me as an English speaker. I found that to be a huge roadblock to effectively learning the language, though I was able to catch on eventually. I just think it's less important to learn WHAT a grammatical concept is and more important to learn WHERE it is used.",
    "More focus on the specific grammar rules would have been helpful. We normally only had a brief discussion of the primary grammatical patterns and had little discussion of exceptions and other cases."

   "comments": [
    "This class was, in my opinion, less work than L2. I would recommend it as it will really help you transition from an introductory German student into someone who really feels comfortable engaging in the language both in written and verbal communication.",
    "Yes! Cecilia cares about her students and you'll learn a lot about the German language.",
    "I suppose I would -- it's not a bad course by any means. I do have some handle on (choppy) conversational German, though it's not as good as I would have liked after three semesters of five-day-a-week study.",
    "Yes, this was a well-taught course that especially helped my ability to speak German."
