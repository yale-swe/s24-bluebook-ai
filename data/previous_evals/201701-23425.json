    "an interesting course in terms of material and perspective, but nothing too innovative in the format or lectures. very textbook in how to run a class, except the assignments are interesting to do. if it would be possible to do away with the in-class final, then i would recommend that.",
    "The class was very good. The topics were very relevant to my course of study and my interest in policy.",
    "excellent introduction to women and children issues and equips you with the tools you need to address these issues through health policy and research",
    "Very good course, for both students in Public Health and not. Materials were accessible and interesting; lectures were clear and there was room for class participation. Assignments were useful.",
    "Great overview course PPT slides have ALOT of information - maybe do away with the final exam or provide a study guide to help us distill the important info needed for the final. Did not get much into inequities found in MCH and would have liked to see more of that",
    "I learned so much about the various factors that affect the health of women and children in the US. The main lectures were great and the guest lectures were interesting. The policy briefs were helpful and the testimony was extremely valuable.",
    "This course was great! I learned so much and loved how pre-professional the focus was.",
    "I loved this course. The material was well presented and the professor very knowledgeable. I enjoyed the class discussions and the opportunity to go further with the assignments. However, sometimes class could seem to be moving slow and it would have been useful to have a little more instruction about the assignments.",
    "Very good introduction to policy issues surrounding women and children in the US."

   "comments": [
    "lecture based with 3 assignments (mostly due in the second half of the course) and an in class final. a good class to give you exposure to an important public health matter. i would recommend it to any student, but especially policy because it is a good chunk of knowledge to get exposed to and the assignments would help develop your skill set with policy briefs.",
    "Yep. I will recommend to students who are interested in maternal and child health.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was interested in maternal and child health policy.",
    "Great class, light on workload and the assignments are interesting and useful.",
    "I recommend this course, even if you are not a student in the school of Public Health. It provided a very thorough overview of healthcare in the US (not only for women\/children, but more broadly as well). The workload was manageable and there wasn't \"busy work\" -- I felt readings and assignments were all pertinent to the course, and a good supplement to the lecture content.",
    "Great overview for someone interested in Maternal and Child Health in the US. Not too much work, but meaningful assignments.",
    "This class is amazing! I learned so much about various factors that affect the health of women and children in the US. The guest lecturers were great and the assignments were interesting. The testimony was a valuable experience and I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to present one to the class. Professor Lee has much experience in this field and offers great anecdotes concerning the realities of certain policies. She is a warm and caring instructor who is passionate about the course and sincerely cares about her students. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "This was a fantastic course if you're interested in learning about healthcare in the US with a special focus on women and children.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is well taught and very interesting."
