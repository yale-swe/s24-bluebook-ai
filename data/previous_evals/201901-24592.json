    "I feel like I was largely brought up to speed on the rapidly expanding field of genomics. Learning all of this, I began to question so much of what we know (and how we know) about the role of the genome and how the information in the genome manifests itself. Everything from how DNA is organized and accessed to what biases exist in sequence data was incredibly interesting. Along the way I learned how to take raw sequence data and transform it to an annotate genome.",
    "1) Pursuing my final project lead to greater proficiency in R 2) A better general understanding of the genome 3) Found the Genome Structure and Comparative Phylogenetics Techniques sections most useful",
    "Knowledge of organism agnostic comparative genomic methods, starting from first principles of sequencing and the like.",
    "A broad, general understanding of the techniques, terminology, and applications of comparative genomics. Practical skills working in the command line and how to use comparative genomics pipelines to develop a project.",
    "From basic computing to the technicalities of genome sequencing, assembly and analysis this class covered it all !",
    "I learned about genome sequencing and assembly, phylogenetic comparative methods, and basic computing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this course was the paper presentation and discussion, facilitated by intermittent lectures by the instructor. Students had a lot of freedom to take the course in the direction we wanted all the way from choosing which papers we wanted on the syllabus to where the discussion went. Having the syllabus as a living document that we could amend and reference constantly was amazing. I think we should ditch Canvas and move to GitHub entirely. I think the largest weakness was the lack of structured computational skill building. In my experience, these tools only stick in one's head with practice and a goal in mind. I think outlining a goal early in the class and using some sort of discussion\/computational session perhaps lead by a TA would be invaluable and result in better final projects that many students could even include as work towards a chapter\/paper.",
    "Strengths: - Flexibility: we had a fluid syllabus and the final project had flexible perimeters. However, I understand that other students often do not prefer lack of structure. - Really like the reading list and the class notes in the syllabus - Very positive learning atmosphere - I felt very free to ask stupid questions haha Weaknesses: - I think everyone came in with different ideas of what the course would provide. In addition to this, given that this is the first year the course was given, I'm not sure the course itself knew what it would be. At the beginning it tried to be everything - a coding workshop, a hands-on genome class, and a paper discussion. Of course, as it defined itself as the year progressed, I'm guessing those who thought it would be a coding class or hands-on genome class were disappointed. I think a really big chunk of the class thought it would be a hands-on workshop on genome analysis, using packages or workflows that are already published. Given that everyone had very different ideas of what their final project should look like, I can see how it would be difficult to cater to everyone. - I really liked the idea of having a reading list of papers. Having students present the papers wasn't a bad idea, but it became very frustrating when the presentations took more than half the class. Often, if the presenters did not fully grasp the paper it made my own understanding weaker as I would begin to second guess my interpretation of the paper. - In my opinion, the class really became what I thought it would be in Week 9 (Phylogenetic Comparative Methods).",
    "The course itself was useful, but could have done with more interactivity during paper presentations (or shorter paper presentations). Also, a bit more structure\/impetus for programming material.",
    "Strengths: Casey's immense knowledge-base and how he lays concepts out in a very approachable way. Coverage of basics but also delving into literature on applications in a variety of fields. Weaknesses: Only once a week. Would help to have a designated coding session weekly. Hard to effectively cover the material and teach the coding element in just two hours. Would prefer the class to be broken up into two slightly shorter weekly sessions."

    "Yes, this was such a fun discussion every week. I would really enjoy some form of a continuous genomics reading group once per week. Because I went into this course with a genomics project in mind this course helped me achieve many of my goals.",
    "Yes! It was a good introduction to genomic studies and I found the final project very enjoyable.",
    "This is a great course accessible to a wide audience of biologists. Dr. Dunn is approachable and sensible. I would easily recommend this class and variations thereof.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it can be useful for students of all levels of current understanding of the subject.",
    "I would if there were changes to the format, as explained in improvements to the format."
