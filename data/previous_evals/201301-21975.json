    "very obscure information but really really interesting. GREAT class. Bushkovitch is the man, he knows everything. He is intimidating in the beginning and cold-calls people, so doing the reading is necessary, and there's a lot of it. otherwise, very chill class, you just get to go talk about mongol hordes and ivan the terrible and russian orientalism for 2 hours a week, write one short midterm paper and one final research paper.",
    "This class will furnish you with a surfeit of information on a topic no other class at Yale comes close to. The content of the course is fascinating on its own merit; its broader implications are not really discussed. The course packet is a thick, well-compiled book of primary and secondary sources. You read Tolstoy and selections from the Qu'ran as well as medieval Slavic epics, summaries of archaeological findings, and the Secret History of the Mongols. It's the best reading I've had in any class outside DS. Seminar discussion is sometimes slow-moving, with students paralyzed in the face of so much information, but eventually gets going. If you are leading a discussion, it can be helpful to cheat a bit by informing the other students in advance what you plan to focus on.Professor Bushkovitch is erudite, sometimes digressive, usually very engaging. He demands a rigorous view of history that takes chronology strictly into account and remains conscious of multiple interacting streams of event. That plus the reading makes this class on a somewhat obscure topic a valuable intellectual exercise at the very least.",
    "You are able to take an intensive approach to history in this class, more than other classes. I would say that this class is different from other history class I've taken in that Professor Bushkovtich attempted to approach \"truths\" in history rather than strong ideas. This meant covering a lot of background information before diving into the facts."
