    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It's truly a grad student course, so make sure you're prepared to handle a high amount of rigor. It also really expects you to know your stuff, since you'll have to lecture 2-3 times throughout the semester, depending on enrollment. The grade is dependent on your lectures and the weekly problem sets, and there might be a final in the future.",
    "Category Theory is a really really cool way of looking at transformations and classes of objects and transformations (categories). The field is fairly open still so there is a lot to wonder about. A lot of the questions that are asked are still open, so this is a beautiful way to find out about those things. However, this class will also not be enough for you to leave with a deep understanding of category, you will need to invest a great deal on your personal end for the course to mean something. If you put in the work, you will definitely be glad you did.",
    "introduction to category theory, good foundation if you come across category theory sometimes",
    "A class to gain a working familiarity with Category Theory and as a by product a familiarity with a broad range of mathematical fields."
