    "Structure id lie groups and algebras, young tableaux, casimir operators, etc along with some history.",
    "A good introduction to group theory and practical discussions of how it is applied to problems in physics. A better understanding of the group theoretical concepts with which I was already familiar from quantum mechanics.",
    "Group theoretic methods in physics.",
    "A rudimentary understanding of Lie Algebras and how they apply to different problems in atomic, nuclear, particle physics",

   "comments": [
    "I thought the problem sets for this class were very good at helping us learn the material.",
    "Low workload, but sometimes we skim over equations that may have deeper derivations.",
    "The problem sets were useful in helping me understand the concepts. I would have appreciated more examples during lectures, though. I often found myself understanding the procedures and algorithms we discussed, but I didn't really develop a good understanding of what they meant or what they were used for until much later in the course.",
    "Comprehensive, but a bit abstract, so more detailed examples might be handy.",
    "The lecture comes straight out of the textbook that the professor wrote himself, which feels more like a reference sheet than an actual learning material. The biggest flaw of this course is that we are flooded with various mathematical relationships of different Lie algebras without going into how they are used in different examples. The second half of the course does cover some realizations, but they felt more like a superficial treatment of some applications, which were not helpful in gaining deep insight into how these algebras play into the physics involved.",
    "The strength of this course is the broad overview of Lie algebras that it gives. The weakness is that the students don't develop much understanding of the techniques reviewed. Most approaches are given without proof."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I took it as a second semester senior, and I definitely feel like I gained a huge boost of mathematical skills that will be necessary for me to study more advanced physics in graduate school. I also feel like I have a much better understanding of some the more mysterious topics from PHYS 440\/441 that I didn't really understand the first time around, like spin, which is given a more thorough basis using the language of Group theory.",
    "Yes, this is a good class that has applications to many areas of physics.",
    "Yes if you want a very chill learning environment. If you actually want to learn things though you need to take initiative.",
    "Seems like its applicability is somewhat limited unless you're planning to use group theoretical methods in your research. That said, it is a very interesting area of physics that is touched on only very briefly in other classes.",
    "To theorists studying quantum physics and relativity related subjects.",
    "Not unless the student is very interested in the mathematical structure of Lie algebra and is motivated enough to go beyond the assigned textbook (which feels like a collection of formulae and theorems, save for the first few chapters that were the only salvaging part of the book)",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to know what Lie algebras are and how they are used in physics. For a deep understanding of the mathematics of Lie algebras, I would recommend a different course."
