   "comments": [
    "Keep learning French!",
    "French 140, like most of the previous french classes, is certainly time consuming and a lot of work. But I think that relative to earlier levels (I have only taken 130) the reward from this class is greater. I feel as though I am actually capable of sustaining conversation in French, and also have a much better hold on the grammar of the language.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Fun course that finishes up the essential grammar of the language. Also improves speaking, listening, and reading.",
    "Yes, I would recommend French 140, particularly because it offers consistent opportunities for the improvement of spoken French. Nonetheless, all elements of language-learning are covered thoroughly. Even though this is not explicitly a French literature course, French 140 offers a great variety of readings, particularly from around in the francophone world in the \"Diversite\" anthology. Engaging with these pieces is truly eye-opening and fascinating for those interested in literature from the developing world."
