    "This class was FANTASTIC. I'm so pleased I had a chance to take it. The readings - especially the theory - were awesome, and the discussions were incredibly productive. Anyone interested in power, race, gender, and\/or class in the United States (or elsewhere!) should seriously consider taking this class. ALSO Greta LaFleur is a boss and a half -- take a class with her before you graduate.",
    "I entered the course quite excited about the themes we would be discussing, but a little apprehensive about whether or not the time period (early America) would be made accessible. I was also totally intrigued by the concept of biopolitics - it's seemed like a trendy term that I'd seen here or there, but knew little about. On that basis, the syllabus looked really sweet, with international names like Foucault, Agamben, Hardt & Negri, and other theorists who I had heard about but had never read. So even though I expected the readings to be difficult, I think my excitement got in the way of really comprehending that some of these texts would be dense and outright tough. Around the middle of the semester, I think the difficulty of some of the readings was starting to really get to me, and I felt frustrated with them. I became pretty skeptical of the value of theorists who didn't put the care in to write accessibly (especially Agamben, holy crap), and this impeded me from more directly engaging with the ideas they contained. I think that's a shame on my part, but it also might have been alleviated with a slightly restructured arrangement of texts on the syllabus. Roughly speaking, the course had like 30% primary source, and the rest was a combination of theoretical work (Foucault, Agamben, Mbembe etc) and secondary academic writing (Masur, Johnson, Chaplin, etc) about the time period in question, with most of my energies going towards reading the theory. I would ask for more primary source engagement, especially a very focused and carefully chose set of texts that would work together, converse with each other, and build on each other from week to week, enabling us to develop a thick understanding of biopolitics in early America. This could also be complemented with some non-primary source work that contextualizes and historicizes the period in question. The overarching aim would be to prioritize a solid understanding of the historical period (roughly 1790-1850), on top of which could be overlaid the biopolitical theory, helping make the theory more legible and applicable. That said, there is also a lot to be said for engaging with a set of difficult theorists and being exposed to them. To Greta's great and everlasting credit, although I didn't always leave class feeling that I \"owned\" the texts or theories, now, at the end of the semester, I realize I have learned a ton - it's no small feat to introduce students to a whole body of (difficult) inquiry, but I have already been frequently seeing connections between the work in this class and other classes, as well as having a generative new lens with which to view current political developments in today's society. I am incredibly happy I decided to take this class."
