    "A solid foundation in differential equations.",
    "Really helped me develop applicational mathematical skills.",
    "It is a class on ODE's mainly focusing on solution methods.",
    "I develeoped many skills and learned many techniques to solve ordinary differential equations. I became comfortable with equations in differential form, and with evaluating and manipulating them. I also learned about the applications of the material and examples from real life, as well as theoretical reasoning for some equations and similarities with linear algebra, which was very helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "Caring instructor, manageable workload. Exams poorly written\/planned.",
    "The instructor went through things often way too quickly. However, he was very helpful when you needed assistance. I think it was just one of those situations where the professor is extremely smart and some things that are intuitive to him are not as intuitive to the class.",
    "The course was great overall. It would be more manageable for students to stay on top of all of the course material if we had access to a course schedule that structured all of the topics we've done to throughout the course. The lecture notes that the Professor uploads was incredibly helpful for that. I also appreciated that there were many problem sets and practice problem sets to prerpare for the examinations. Finally, I feel like the course could be improved by making the lectures more structured, as they were easier to understand when the professor slowed down and went over ideas gradually. The professor was always willing to receiver feedback to improve the course, which was great.",
    "I think that this class was taught very well. Manas always provided really clear lecture notes with plenty of examples. The homework was always fair and really solidified what we learned in class. I don't think it had any weaknesses."

    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking into the math or applied math majors! Professor Rachh is an awesome professor and really tries to slow down and help his students understand what is going on, and while the work can be very challenging at times he always tries to give it a real world application.",
    "This class is required for many math-related majors. The material is pretty difficult, but Professor Rachh has great lecture notes. The class moves extremely fast and it can be easy to get lost, but if you pay close attention and read the notes, it's not very difficult to keep up.",
    "Yes but not super enthusiastically.",
    "It is better than the ENAS alternative for sure. I would not just take the class just because you are non-stem.",
    "Very important class to learn techniques and strategies to solve ODEs. It covers a large majority of the material that ENAS194 does, and goes at a much reasonable pace and teaches the material better. The lectures were fast and disorganized at some points, but the Professor is very comptent and always willing to help. We had biweekly psets, which was better, and took longer to complete. It is a course that gives you opportunities to catch up, practice and learn, even as it covers a lot of material.",
    "If you have to take diffeq then take this course!"
