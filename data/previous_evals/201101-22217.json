    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class since it is very unique and interesting. Going to the lectures is imperative since she takes material directly from the lectures and it is hard to learn without knowing what Professor Jung said it lecture.",
    "Take this class. Even if you aren't a History of Art major, this course was extremely interesting and exposes you to art and history that is frequently left out of major art history discussions.",
    "Death is a topic all of us must grasp with, and there is a wealth of medieval artwork dealing with the matter. Jung is a great lecturer. Take it if you want to look at lots of crazy awesome medieval images. There's a bunch of reading but it is mostly interesting and you get the important stuff from lecture anyways.",
    "Wonderful course--fascinating. I had no background in art history, which made the course a bit of a challenge--I felt a little unprepared for the format of art history tests&papers. Nevertheless am very glad I took this course as a medieval history major. Extremely enlightening.",
    "Take it."
