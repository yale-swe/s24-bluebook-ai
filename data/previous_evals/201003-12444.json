   "comments": [
    "Every mechanical engineer should take this class; it is really important for you to become proficient at using the computer to design things. Also the class is pretty easy and the problem sets aren't too complicated. The only problem is that SolidWorks often crashes doing simulations, which can waste your time and be frustrating.",
    "If you want to learn SolidWorks, take this course. The program is incredibly useful and this course will allow you to become proficient with many of the program's features. Also, Professor Long is a great instructor, so don't miss the chance to take this class with him.",
    "This is a great class for learning CAD software, an essential skill if you want to go into an engineering career. You could learn all the SolidWorks in the class on your own, but it would take WAY longer without someone to guide you through much of it the first time. The main drawback to the class is that many lectures are on the history of CAD, which doesn't add very much to the class. You just memorize it for the midterm, which wasn't very hard. Overall, I would recommend this class despite the several unnecessary history of CAD lectures because the rest of the class was extremely helpful.",
    "Don't take this class. If you want to get familiar with SolidWorks, learn it yourself. If you want an easy credit, take another class.",
    "It's solidworks mixed with the math behind computer aided design. so you spend some of your time begging bribing and threatening solidworks into cooperating with you and some of your time trying to write matlab code that will do rotations and finite element stress stuff.it was more frustrating than it sounded like it would be.",
    "If you don't know SolidWorks (or if you do and want a gut, I guess), this class does the job. Not knowing SolidWorks myself, I found attending class useful, and I was able to learn some new techniques. Other students found class a waste of time though. There's also a completely useless (but pretty easy) midterm in the middle of the semester based on some computer graphics stuff that you'll learn in class, which I didn't find interesting. At the end of the day, this class isn't a lot of work, and it can make for a good elective.",
    "The class isn't a whole lot of mentally challenging work. It's a lot of fun to mess around in SolidWorks and toy with all of the simulations, and the homeworks aren't incredibly difficult. It's a worthwhile class to take if you're planning on a design track; probably one of the more practical courses you could take as an engineer at Yale.",
    "This is a valuable elective for MechE majors. There is, unusually in the department, not very much work, and the knowledge is very applicable to other classes\/projects.",
    "You'll learn some CAD, but you'll have to do most of it on your own. You'll also learn a bunch of useless stuff. Remember it, get a good midterm grade, and then forget it.This class is a lot of busy work. It does make some effort to teach Solidworks and CAD, but that comprises only half of the class, and the rest is of extremely questionable utility. For our first midterm, our Professor actually said it wouldn't be fair to test students' progress on learning CAD because not everyone was in the same place... It's like a being tested on primary colors in linear algebra because not everyone learned linear algebra equally well. Instead he tested us on a bunch of topics that didn't really contribute to one's ability to use CAD. Honestly, I think we learned just to be tested on it. We also pursued a ridiculous level of detail on some subjects. Some level of understanding of how your tools work is, granted, useful. Still, it's not like you need to understand the detailed workings on a graphing calculator to confidently use it, yet that was the level of detail we often pursued on the underlying principles of CAD technology."
