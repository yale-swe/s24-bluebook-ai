    "I learned about how to place the sonic, performative, theological, gendered, and denominational aspects of gospel music in the context of the development of the music industry, as well as in the heterogeneous \"Black Church.\"",
    "I learned some things about gospel music from this class, though I wish there had been more of an emphasis on the music itself. I came in with little knowledge on the subject and think I have some odd niche understandings, but not a ton of overall knowledge.",
    "I learned how to have a more informed conversation about Gospel Music and its connections to secular music. I also learned to interrogate the question of the parameters we are using when we describe a music as secular or sacred."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were diverse and super interesting, and there was a balance between accessibility (New Yorker, articles about Kanye and Chance) and academic rigor (journal articles, dense books). The flow of discussion was sometimes difficult to keep, because the range of backgrounds and experiences was so large and there were some students who knew much more than others.",
    "The class was, I thought, fine -- it was as advertised, though I wish there had been more rigor in some places and a little bit less randomness in terms of what we were talking about.",
    "At times, I was a bit confused by the direction of the course. We seemed to dwell on the question of 'what is Gospel music?' every class, and I was unclear what new information the Professor was trying to prompt us to see or understand. However, despite the fact that discussions seemed stunted at points, it was in general a class which encouraged me to think across disciplines and which challenged me to see Gospel music from a different perspective."
