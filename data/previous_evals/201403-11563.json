With that said, I think there could have been better coordination between the TAs and Professor Kotchen, particularly regarding the information presented in the weekly problem sets, since the assignments are generally what students had the most questions about. It would have been helpful for the TA's to have a better handle of the problem sets in advance so they they were prepared to answer questions and provide similar examples to improve learning outside of the class lecture.",

    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Pretty tough grader but clear and helpful TA sessions",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0I think my teaching assistant is good at explaining the concepts and questions related to the class.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Hao effectively described the intuition of the class in multiple ways. However, he could prepare more examples to describe in TA sessions.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0He is very knowledgeable and helped me a lot to understand the very basic economic concepts with many details. He was also very approachable and available. I really liked the way he explained the exercises and clarified our doubts about the assignments. He went through the mechanics, but also wanted to make sure that we understood the theory and assumptions behind the exercises. However, he could be more prepared for his sessions; he could be aware of our assignments questions before, so he could use our time more effectively.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0The one weakness I think he has is he did not review the assignments beforehand. So he would confuse himself and sometimes the students while trying to work out the solutions to the questions. What I valued most about his sections was when he explained again the topics in the class. His explanations were always clear, gave helpful tips and key point for understanding the topics.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0Hao was really great at explaining concepts. He chose words well to explain everything concisely. He was always prepared for our section, which was helpful. I appreciated his help with the homework.",
    "Instructor: Hao Deng \u00a0N\/A; I didn't attend section.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Very patient and dedicated to making sure students understood the concepts and that he answered specific questions as best as possible; good job at making sure students themselves worked through problems and questions they had about the material instead of just providing the answers.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0was generally very helpful, went out of his way to meet students' needs by creating a review guide for finals",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Jesse got sometimes confused over his own explanations. Also, it was really great that he wanted to give us general insights during the TA sessions but really most people came to figure out the homework. I really liked though that he did help us with that, no matter how long it took. Also, it was really great that he compiled a review sheet for the final exam, that really helped a lot. I think he really wanted us to succeed and did his best to help us.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Very accessible. Always makes time for explaining answers.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0It often seemed like the TAs (Jesse and Rob) were not really prepared to discuss the materials of the week or that they weren't entirely clear on the concepts that we were dealing with in class.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0He was always willing to explain and make an effort to find new ways to help students understand. Working on clarity of explanations will help him be even better.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Needs to better understand the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0The TAs were lacking of leader discussion through the semester. They have a great disposition, however they always got confused while explaining and weren't clear. I strongly recommend them to take some workshops to learn how to teach. A good option would be have TAs that were students in the course and did it well rather than PhDs. They seem to be so advance in their knowledge and current work, that get absolutely confused trying to explain basic concepts.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Being unclear about what prof Kotchen was trying to convey with his examples, language, problem set questions.....?",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0I already answered this question in a seperate GoogleDoc sent out by the TFs, for all three of them. As the main thing I noted there was the fact that all of them seemed sometimes either a bit insecure or could get confused while explaining things to students, one thing to note for improvement specifically is that their collaboration with the professor might be better in order to explain things better to us.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0He was punctual and always ready to answer our questions. As far as weaknesses, sometimes he wasn't prepared to answer some of the questions we were bringing up but that was not something that happened often.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0I thought the teaching assistants were tremendously helpful. Each of them made sure that we received review materials and went out of their way to be available and answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Weakness: Sometimes he was not completely sure of the material, but... Strengths: He always made sure he researched and got back to you with the right answer. He really cared about student learning immensely, and made sure you understood the concepts before moving on. He was always open and available for questions, and wanted to help you as much as possible. He addressed every question thoroughly, and is a very sweet person.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Rob was obviously overworked this semester and by his own admission was sometimes running on very little sleep, which may have influenced his ability to clearly articulate concepts in section\/office hours sometimes. However, he was still awesome, and hugely helped my understanding of the class. He'd go above and beyond by typing up notes and drawings after office hours to share with those who attended. Great TA.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0I mostly attended Jesse's sections, so will evaluate him here. His strengths were definitely teaching the concepts through different and creative ways. He was also enthusiastic about the material and always willing to respond to emails and questions. I can't think of areas for improvement.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0The TAs were very helpful and were willing to go the extra mile to help with understanding the concepts taught in class.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Strengths: calm, careful, detailed. I learned so much from him!",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0See response to question 5.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0I think Jesse is brilliant and you can tell he really cares about us and wants us to learn. I think sometimes he had trouble explaining concepts to us...it was clear he understood them, he just had trouble conveying the concepts to us in a way we could understand because we didn't have backgrounds in econ. But he was always very kind to us, even staying late sometimes to answer extra questions, and he was a godsend in figuring out how to do the homework assignments, since for most of the semester we had no textbook to reference and we didn't cover everything in class that was in the homework.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Jesse was a lifesaver - he related well to our questions and helped illuminate the concepts in very helpful ways. Thanks for everything, Jesse!",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0He was very friendly and willing to help but sometimes did not explain the information clearly. Seemed like TAs and the instructor were not always on the same page.",
    "Instructor: Jesse Brodie Burkhardt \u00a0Rob was an excellent T.A. He came very well prepared to the sessions, he listened attentively to student concerns and questions, and he tailored the material covered to student desires. Rob effectively explained difficult subjects and significantly added to student learning in the class. Rob went above and beyond, often preparing follow-up material to help clarify particularly challenging topics for students. Rob really was an essential part of my learning for the course. I also attended sessions with Jesse and Hao, and both were also very helpful and dedicated to augmenting student learning in the class.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Not always confident in his responses. Very receptive to questions. Often spent too much of the TA sessions explaining class material (too little time on problem sets).",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0- very responsive to demands of students (e.g. examples for exam preparation,...) - very accessible and helpful - It is important that the TA's can explain well. Sometimes the explanations where more confusing then helpful. Maybe it would help to go over the explanation between the TA's together beforehand to know how to best explain to the students - Instead of just going over the Problem sets and the solution of them in the TA discussion section it would actually be more helpful to look at the concepts again and see how we can solve them in different ways in different situations (such as is demanded in the exam).",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Often times he seemed unsure of the guidance he was giving us.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0It wasn't his fault but a lot of the review sessions were people who had not looked at the homework and were asking really obvious questions. Would have been a lot more useful if people came prepared. But it was great that Rob connected economics with other worldviews and was so mindful to issues that economics cannot cover, and its limitations.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Improvement ask students to send in specific questions first so that the review sessions will move faster and clearer",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Very approachable and available to answer student's questions. Provided extra resources to help clarify tricker concepts, which were very helpful. Could improve on giving clearer explanations during discussion and office hours.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Rob was very helpful. He would stay late for sections, provide notes, answer questions and went beyond my expectations for a teaching assistant. The only way to improve would be to move faster in the sections so we could cover more ground, especially in the first few minutes when the material is being planned out to be covered.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Discussion lectures weren't really well organized. Rob often seemed confused.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0Strength: The sections were very helpful in bridging the gap between the class lecture and the assignments. Weakness: The TFs seemed confused as well at many times with the questions on the assignments which indicates that the communication between the instructor and the TFs is poor.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Robert Fetter \u00a0One of their strengths was their willingness to explain the material seen in class, sometimes there were some concepts that were confusing for us to understood or for them to explain, but I appreciate their willingness to help all of the students with additional notes and explanations."

    "Professor Kotchen often went off topic and did not use PowerPoint slides or a textbook for the entire class. If you missed class or were confused, TA sessions were your only option to learn the material.",
    "- the instructor is very energetic and bring to class some interesting real world examples. Would be great to link them and integrate them more into the actual content of the class instead of just mentioning them at the beginning. This would also help to create more discussion with students and professor and apply the course material in real world examples. - basic introduction to economics (too long), second half which was more interesting was too little time to cover in depth.",
    "This class is ill conceived and poorly taught. While the class is advertised as environmental economics, I would describe it as introduction to microeconomics with a 'flavor' of the environment. Even this flavor of the environment was limited. I can't count how many times we talked about 'silicone' panels in class. While the TFs tried their best to teach the material, Kotchen did a poor job of describing his expectations, or providing material above and beyond the Mankiw textbook. Frankly, if I had wanted to take Microeconomics with Mankiw, I would have gone to Harvard. I came to Yale FES to study environmental economics and I feel that my tuition dollars were wasted. Part of this is not Kotchen's fault either. This class is ill conceived because it pairs students with degrees in economics with total amateurs. I recommend that FES makes students take microeconomics somewhere else at Yale, and that the environmental economics portion of the class (about the last 1\/5 of it) be separated out and made into a full blown course.",
    "I thought that the teaching was very slow and sometimes simplistic. I also often felt somewhat talked down to in the lectures.",
    "The course itself was great, not sure if I will ever get into policy but it really helped me to \"think like an economist\". A bit of blind love for econ sometimes but overall a really good mix.",
    "this class schedule at 8.30am is too early as there is a lot to learn and class size is big. prefer a later time",
    "Instructor was often not very approachable or open to answer student's questions. Instructor did introduce concepts in a clear and concise manner.",
    "Prof. Kotchen explains economic concepts exceptionally well.",
    "The professor was not very accessible and did not seem that friendly in one on one or small group interactions. For the second part of the semester, notes, an outline or presentation slides would be helpful.",
    "The first half of the semester, the reading materials were adequate as they were a good source for the foundational materials that we were dealing with. However, as we progressed into the environmental economics component of the class, the readings, while interesting and providing a theoretical base, did not provide a good resource for the application of the concepts. Many students had to look for resources outside those assigned in order to understand and complete the assignments. The other frustrating component of the course was that often we would not get to the materials that the homework assignments were based on until the day before the assignments were due, leaving very little time to complete the often lengthy assignments.",
    "The additional readings for the first half of the class (principles of microeconomics) were excellent. However, the readings for the second half of the class were not useful in preparing myself for the examinations. They provided useful background information but they did not clearly explain the concepts. Some of my class suggested using Markets and the Environment by Keohane and Olmstead. This covered some of the relevant material and I would highly suggest to recommended to future students as a standard. More lecture slides on the second half of the class would also have benefited by understanding of the class.",
    "#2. The homework, and especially the tests, didn't reflect normal work. They were always weird conditions that didn't help me learn the material, just how screwed up things can be. It would be WAY more helpful to work through more regular problems and solidify the material rather than start stretching boundaries.",
    "The textbook Microeconomics was a fundamental pillar of my learning during the first part of the course. A textbook for the second part of the course was really necessary. I wish you would recommend one.",
    "I am very disappointment by this course. I took this class to make my foundations on environmental economics stronger but he seems to be a poor teacher who fails to make concepts clear.",
    "Question 14: This course was valuable for me because it was a foundation's course and I could learn something that will be helpful for me.",
    "Regarding question 11-14, it was not easy for students to interact with the professor in a good way (mostly privately), which is extremely unfortunate. I really think that the way the professor handles the course and the students might be strongly improved. The professor honestly made me feel very insecure about myself and my performance, while I just want to do good and need him to be supportive regarding understanding the material. Also, he was generally not willing to answer conceptual questions while we did not even have a good textbook to support us. Overall, I was not satisfied by his help and learned most from the TFs.",
    "It would have been much more helpful to have another textbook for the topics reviewd in the second half of the term.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much but not the professor. The material and the TFs were wonderful and I will continue to take more economics while I am at FES, just not courses from this professor.",
    "I felt at times that really important concepts were rushed through in the class, or not enough example problems were done by Professor Kotchen. But he did a great job of metering the content for those with no background in Econ, like myself. Without any other Econ classes to compare this one too, an overall assessment is hard, but I feel like it was a very solid intro to basic microecon and to basic environmental econ concepts.",
    "The course moved at a pretty quick pace, and seemed geared for students with some econ background already. Also, the second half of the course lacked substantial supporting materials such as textbooks and power point slides from lectures. Such supporting materials would have been helpful for students who learn best from visual aides.",
    "Q14 and Q15. I feel that economics helped to answer many challenges faced in environment policy. However, I felt disappointed that I was not able to get as much out of the course as I wanted to due to the delivery of the class.",
    "Expanding upon questions 14 and 15 - I majored in economics for my undergraduate studies, but did not take any environmental economics classes. When Professor Kotchen presented to our incoming class at orientation, he strongly recommended that anyone who specifically did not take environmental economics classes in college should take this course. While I did learn a few important concepts toward the end of the course (cap-and-trade, Hotelling model, etc.), I felt like the vast majority of the course was review, and that the new concepts could have effectively been taught in a workshop or a 1 credit course.",
    "The work load was heavy and pretty relentless for this course. It would have been helpful to have problem sets based on concepts learned the previous week, as it was sometimes frustrating to have to wait until Thursday to finish homework due on Friday.",
    "The only reason I rate the class as avr",
    "I think I have two suggestions for improvements to lecture: 1) Students were somewhat hesitant to answer questions in lecture. I think I know one reason of why that may be the case: Professor Kotchen did not show his appreciation to the person asking\/giving the answer after they spoke, but instead often cut them off or just provided the answer right after (not indicating whether they answered correctly or not). Saying \"thanks for asking that question\" or \"X is exactly right, thank you\" and afterwards checking \"did I answer your question \/ was my answer helpful?\" is in my experience a great way to encourage people to participate in lecture, because it makes us feel good about raising our hand. 2) I think it would have been helpful if the examples Professor Kotchen used to illustrate certain points were better prepared, especially at the beginning of the course (on general economic principles). It seemed like he was coming up with examples on the spot, and sometimes they were either too complicated (the limitations and specifics of the case were unclear) or not really environmentally related or relevant. I think well prepared examples could have better illustrated how relevant the economic theories are for environmental policy.",
    "I expected the class to be more rigorous than it was, in ways that were not as much focused on the problem sets, as the concepts. It would have been personally more helpful to dive deeper into the concepts and how they apply to our work, than to spend so much time and energy on the long problem sets. Would have been valuable to have an additional textbook.",
    "You are a good teacher and I appreciate your early-morning energy. But, what century are we living in that there are not lecture slides online for all of your lectures and course material? There are students of varying language ability, plus there is a lot of material and you talk fast--even for native speakers listening. Studying can be more efficient for us, your students, with lecture slides. There was an unnecessary amount of frantic emailing and text messaging among students throughout the second-half of the semester. Communication that sought to get that one half-finished graph scribbled during class; or the other student who mis-wrote a formula and had to confirm with three other people (to make sure it was not the blind leading the blind); and the other various unnecessary wasted time that was avoided during the first half of the semester by referencing lecture notes online. No one likes to hear this, but from the students' perspective, it is just lazy for you to not put all the lectures in PPT form. Simple. Also, students would greatly benefit from having access to past exams \/ practice exams for the midterm and final. Half of testing is exam strategy, i.e. practicing output of your knowledge in the allotted time before test day. Same for extra practice problems; why is it so hard to have extra problem sets on had for students? This is a foundations course. These are not novel economics concepts, so surely there are extra practice sets available. Yale Medical students have practice problem sets, law students have practice exams; why not F&ES Environmental Econ students? Come on, Yale!",

    "- good explanation of basic concepts in economics (especially for students who are not at all familiar with them) students seeking to learn more in depth about economics of the environment must insist especially on the second half of the class. We didn't have enough time to cover all of the concepts in depth. - important concepts to know are explained well - however, I missed the critical discussion of them in real world examples.",

He has great examples, is very passionate about his topic and gave us real \"insider stories\" about what he experienced in the past with the government and EDF.

Also, even though at times I hated them, the assignments really assured we didn't fall behind on the material, even when we had better things to do, sometimes.",

Prof. Kotchen is clearly passionate and an expert in this area, and this came across when he would sometimes go \"on a tangent\" that I actually thought was very relevant to providing context for the principles we were learning in class.",

    "Given that this was an introductory course, an actual environmental economics textbook would have been really helpful.",
    "- first part too long, insist more on second half and offer students to go through first part on their own. - offer more discussion in class about concepts we are covering instead of just showing how they work. Example, integrate discussion-classes from time to time to open up and look at real world cases together in more depth. - TA discussion section should offer more exercises to look at the concepts covered from different angles than just looking at the solutions together. - orient the class more towards the interest and needs of the students and the way they can use the concept in real world than just class content itself.",
    "would be good to have a recommended supplementary textbook for reference. the TAs had to recommend.",
    "the mid-term exam had very limited time, it is not efficient to measure the student's knowledge about the topic.",

    "I think the class could be more advanced.",
    "Midterm was too long for the allotted time.",
    "So for one Kotchen's attitude towards handing in assignments. What is the point of not letting a student hand in his assignment via email when he's at a conference in a different state??? The other thing is for the 2nd part of the semester (except 1 or 2 lectures) he neither provided us with any form of slides or a real readings recommendation. When asked he would even reply \"You are a master's student. Go figure it out.\" Lastly, I heard a lot of bad things about personal interaction with him, that he would be cold, easily offended or downward rude. That prevented me from contacting him, even when I should have.",
    "the logic for graphs need to be explained better as there are quite a large number of students who do not have sufficient background to comprehend them. Especially the later part of the course. people got emotional doing assignments as the logic for deriving solutions based on graphs were not clear. One way to do this is to survey the students and have a 'extra' session right after October or 'Thanksgiving' break to explain the graphical solutions of the 2nd half of the class.",
    "Could provide additional resources for understanding the trickier concepts introduced during the second half of the course like suggestions for a good environmental economics textbook. Could also provide practice midterms and finals. I thought it was strange that students who studied economics in undergrad were strongly encouraged to take this class. Only the second half of the course seemed relevant to these students. Maybe there could be another advanced course that started with the environmental economics section and then went into further detail into more advanced topics for these students. Naturally the curve is thrown off by students with an economics background and this might skew midterm results and show the instructors that more students are grasping the material than in reality.",
    "The problem sets and midterms often seemed to have not been fully covered in class, with lots of confusion and TA time necessary to compensate",
    "The timing of assignments and the corresponding lectures could be improved so as to leave more time for concept development before assignments are due.",
    "Providing reading materials that explain the concepts of the second half of the class.",
    "The subjects were not very difficult to grasp however I believe it was rushed towards the end of the semester and I found it harder to learn.",

There were a couple instances of \"trick\" questions in which a concept we had been taught was manipulated in some way to be a departure from the norm. I think these scenarios are appropriate for homework assignments, but not exams. Also, the midterm was very time-constrained.",
    "I would like more discussion on each topic, rather than explain the different methods as facts, the occasions when there were discussions on normative aspects were really interesting.",
    "- More topics of international relevance. The course and the examples are very US focused and does a disservice to the global nature of the discipline. - The instructor needs to understand that this is a foundational course and students would benefit more if his delivers fundamental concepts with clarity rather than jumping around tangential topics. Fundamentals, definitions and concepts should come first. Examples and tangents second.",
    "Provide additional material for students for the second half of the course, that is related to the environment, that will help to understand the concepts better.",
    "Prof's attitude toward the students. Not personally experienced, but several instances have been shared among classmates.",
    "Spending more time on the material towards the end of the course, rather than a heavier focus on the material in the beginning of the course.",
    "- A clear syllabus \/ overview of all material that will be covered (now it includes a guideline as \"some topics might include\" - really not a helpful guidelines) - Besides that, a clear overview of the content of the material, a summary of all concepts for example, especially since there is not even a clear textbook - Preferably a clear textbook - More time for discussion and interaction with the students in the classes, now we just have to accept and understand \/ make questions about what is said, instead of doing critical analysis as well, which I consider a very important thing in grad school - I experienced not enough space for that - Find a balance between problem sets (learning material, developing skills and know how to solve particular questions mainly quantitavely) and truly understanding what was going on. Some concepts remain vague or not discussed extensively enough, just as much that even TFs could not explain properly (e.g. discounting, this would also be a VERY important topic to have a critical discussion on in relation to the environment). Because of the fact that everyone generally wants good grades on problem sets, focus goes too much to doing those well instead of really understanding what it's about. That is at least for me not the best way of learning. - Because of the professor's US background, some of his explainations are very, very much from a US perspective only, which is really not good in the case of global climate change and especially when about 40% of your foundation course audience is international. It was really not nice how the professor had a very strong opinion about certain things while developing countries have an entirely different perspective which was in my opinion not taken seriously. I think this is really a problem and besides myself, I felt discontent amongst my peers too. - Last, the professor was experienced to be not very supportive by many, which is a real pity. It would be great if the professor would consider what his students need and also be more open to critical remarks. If somebody was tough, but a great teacher, that would be really ok. If a person is sometimes just \"mean\", and not really a supportive teacher but rather making you feel insecure instead of becoming more secure, that is not really good I think.",
    "The instructor covered the material too fast and it felt that we were just introduced to concepts everyday rather than take a few at a time and really cover them in depth. It was a bit frustrating for those who are just being introduced to this topic.",
    "I think that there should have been an assigned book for the second half of the class. The book recommended by the TF's was greatly helpful, and I am not sure that I would have comprehended as much without supplementing the readings from that book with my notes from class. A book for environmental economic principles should at least be recommended to students.",
    "I think tying back the problem sets or the lectures into the larger framework of environmental field. Like the \"so what\" factor was a bit missing. We mostly discussed climate change and abatement, and it would have been nice to discuss a bit more.",
    "We didn't have slides and books to rely on in the second half of the course. It was very hard, especially for international students. Many times I looked for basic concepts on the internet and used wikipedia. The professor should be more prepared for his classes and follow a balanced plan in terms of number of topics per class. We had some classes with more emphasis on discussion, but the last classes were very tight with all concepts that should have showed in previous classes. Sometimes he couldn't answer some student's questions and has never given feedback. The midterm was also very unfair because of the number of questions and the time available. The semantics of the questions affected international students.",
    "The pace of the class got to be very fast at some points. There really should have been review sessions with the TAs before each exam, where they would explain the main topics again - not only answer each person's questions. Having sets of problems to review before the exam would also be very helpful. Also, during class it would be much more helpful to include viewpoints that differ from the accepted models and the criticism they pose. It would be helpful to learn how many of the assumptions economics are challenged, and why.",
    "The problem set questions and midterm\/final questions were kind of both of a different ilk...",
    "The course covered so many concepts and topics that it was difficult to learn any of them thoroughly. I think there was a missed opportunity by having two tests to evaluate the learning of students. Instead, a project or paper where students could have had a chance to delve more deeply into a topic would have created a better learning experience.",
    "Kotchen is really self-absorbed. We'd sometimes approach him with a question and he'd give us a response close to \"I can't believe you don't understand this.\" Instead of working through the material with us.",
    "Lectures should more thoroughly cover concepts on problem sets.",
    "The speed. We moved really fast. Also, I recommend creating lecture slides for the 2nd half of the semester so that the students have something to refer to after class. Also, a book for the 2nd half the semester would have been very helpful.",
    "I would adjust the mid-term by either asking fewer questions or allowing for more time. In my opinion, the time crunch detracted from students' ability to properly answer the questions.",
    "More structure\/opportunities to reference sources besides class lectures! After the first half of the course, there were hardly any slides and we did not have a textbook (which would've been extremely useful if pertained to what we were learning in class). Therefore, we only had our class notes to go from, and often it was difficult to understand (or read legibly) what Prof. Kotchen was writing\/drawing on the board. This may in part be due to the nature of the large stadium seating classroom (in the physics building), but I sat up close and it was still difficult to read what he would write at times. This became a a major issue when we needed to refer to our notes for weekly problem sets and for studying for the final - if we unknowingly wrote something down wrong (because it was not clear), we had nothing to cross-reference it against. Therefore, clearer notes (e.g., provided on a ppt or drawn out and posted online, as the TAs did for answers to weekly problem sets) and\/or having textbook would've instilled much greater confidence that you were studying the material correctly.",
    "The wording of the problem sets was sometimes not careful enough (stating assumptions about the situations), so me and my fellow students (and it seemed the TAs too) sometimes spent too much time figuring out what direction the questions were going in. I didn't have much problems with that myself, but I helped many fellow students with less econ background than me, who were struggling with question wording, because they got hung up on those details.",
    "Not having a textbook that covered most of the material we were learning (after the basic\/intro material that we had a textbook for) was detrimental to my learning, because I felt like we were assigned homework problems\/tested on exams on material that we didn't cover in class at all (or at least not in enough depth) to understand how to do them.",
    "One improvement would have been to have a text to go along with the second half of the class. I know there was a book some people were using but i only found out about it finals week. It would have been nice to have some supporting materials to understand the more complex concepts of the course. The readings that were assigned in the second half on the class were confusing and their relevance was not always drawn into the class lecture.",
    "Better course materials- classes notes\/textbook reading only extended to half the coursework, instructor wrote notes on board which were hard to see. Oftentimes too much emphasis on having class discussions which in a class of 100 people takes time away from more clear explanation\/presentation of relevant course material. More grading weight given to problem sets. They took about 4 hours per week but only counted for 20% of final grade. Final and midterm were hard and challenging to prepare for, but given 80% of total grade.",
    "See above note^",
    "The reading material for the second half of the course could included some explanatory material for the concepts covered -there was a bit of a disconnect between the readings in the second half, the material covered in class, and the degree of depth required to apply the concepts on the problem sets. That gap was filled by the T.A. sessions, but some additional reading material would have been helpful.",

    "Find a good enviro econ textbook to supplement the lectures.",
    "I would recommend it, but let them know they are going to put a lot of time and effort into weekly problem sets and readings. But or someone looking for an introduction to environmental economics, this course is great.",
    "- First introductory part is rather long and helps you to understand the real basics of economics (if you never have done econ before, this is a good and solid introduction). The second half goes more into depth about political economics and environment and is a good introduction to all the concepts that exist and in which context they are used. However, if you are especially interested in the second part it needs more of your personal work and research to dive deep into the concepts. The course covers them rather superficially: what is covered in class is rather an overview and explanation of how the concepts (discount rate, optimal management of non-renewable resources, renewable resources) work. I would might check other course options offered on the topic, too.",
    "Grab a textbook and take another class at Yale. The material is shallow, the teaching substandard, and you will be disappointed if you take it.",
    "Make sure you understand the concepts clearly each week - go to discussion sections if you don't - otherwise you'll be in trouble when the exams come around.",
    "Don't ask Kotchen anything one-on-one. Go ask the TAs. And be prepared for A LOT of homework.",
    "Good course if you've never taken an economics course or environmental economics course. With an economics background the first half of the course may seem too slow. Anyone who's never taken an environmental economics course should start with this foundation course.",
    "Definitely take it! Probably the best intro econ class out there.",
    "If you have no business background and you wish to have some sort of background, this would be the minimum requirement",
    "Depends on your interest, might not be necessary if you want to work on specific scientific, energy, forestry etc issues as opposed to broad-scale policy",
    "Practice right from the start!",
    "I would try to devote more time to learning the material from the second part of the semester.",
    "Do homework assignments early and then go over the answers with other students in the class. It is useful to talk through the problems.",
    "Take it, however ask many questions during class. The discussion in class should be deeper to get something different. The professor has experience in an area and he based a lot of the class in his own perspective. For a course like this, foundation, would be better to learn more about different perspectives too.",
    "Take the course",
    "I would tell them that the topics are really useful and that the book of Microeconomics that we used is really helpful and that they should read it before class so that they can understand everything better. Also that they should do all the problem sets because they are really helpful.",
    "Do it.",
    "The course ran a little quickly, and is a bit intense for folks who have no prior experience in environmental economics. But Professor Kotchen does a fairly good job of making things clear and the content is different and interesting. A good foundations course.",
    "Worth it for a general overview.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take this course as it will expose you to key terms, concepts and frameworks that are critical to current day discussions on environmental issues.",
    "A good basic course to take in which you develop many useful economic skills. However, I'd advice students to stay\/be really critical about what you are taught. I'd say don't take it for granted but ask many questions, especially related to how principles are good\/bad for the environment and what to do about it. It is called \"environmental\" economics after all.",
    "Attend as many discussions as possible and do not fall behind in the material.",
    "This course moves quickly for those without an economics background. Don't fall behind on the readings.",
    "It seems a bit disjointed, but it is good to take if you want an overview or if you want to take other environmental economics courses later on.",
    "Take it if you don't have an economic background. If you have, you might take another course more focused on what you wanna learn about economics of the environment (green markets, environment valuation...). If you have an economic background, this course might be very basic.",
    "The syllabus of the class is great and covers a lot of economics needed to work on policy and sustainable development. Kotchen's pace is very fast. The best way to profit from the course and ensure you really learn the content is to attend the discussion sections to review and ask about the course topics.",
    "Go to the TFs. We didn't even have a textbook from the second portion of the class and they recommended one that pretty much was necessary to understand everything that we were learning. We asked Prof. Kotchen and he had no suggestions for us, so maybe he didn't know about the textbook?",
    "OK if you have no econ background. Might be redundant if you do, especially the first half of the class.",
    "Check out the instructor first.",
    "Great for those without an economics background, though some may have difficulty getting into\/understanding the mindset of an economist. The world should not be viewed totally through that lens.",
    "Don't fall behind. Find a good TA since the professor is not super approachable. Work in groups on the homework.",
    "Find a study group!",
    "My advice: Attend all discussion sessions from the start. Make sure you understand basic concepts at the beginning of the course before moving on to later material.",
    "Take it, it's a good foundational course (even though you will be drained by the weekly problem sets).",
    "Realize that there's going to be a lot of material on problem sets\/ in exams that is not covered in class, and that you'll have no textbook to help you. Unless you have a background in econ or pick things up extremely quickly, going to the discussion sections is likely not an option but will be necessary for you to pass the class.",
    "go to all the lectures, review your notes Before starting the problem sets and give yourself enough time to do the problem sets",
    "Check out the different TA sessions and choose the TA who offers the best review of course material.",
    "Attend the T.A. sessions",
    "Use section if you're confused, and don't be afraid to ask questions in class--he answers all of them."
