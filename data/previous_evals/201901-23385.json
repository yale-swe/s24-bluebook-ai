    "Strengths: -Excellent spread of reading load and course plan\/design -Engagement with Professor\/mini-lectures -Structure of assignments",
    "Could have used a better understanding of ACA before learning the historical perspective. I think the last book should have come first. Writing memos without the whole picture made me feel uninformed and distrust my own argument. Highlights of the class were the debates and team activities."
