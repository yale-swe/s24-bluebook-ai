    "The course provides a great deal of knowledge on the field of remote sensing. There are so many interesting applications, but these applications seem to require special products or understanding of advanced statistics. Although I am grateful for the class, the requirements should be more stringent because it will allow you to appreciate the statistical methods used in remote sensing.There are too many students and the professors, staff, and TAs did not provide enough feedback or help. If the class was somewhat smaller, this would help. Also, lab assignments were not returned in a timely manner to ensure you understood the techniques and theory involved in each lab."

Smith \u00a0Strengths: Great explanation of topics and examples provided.Weaknesses:Inability to respond to student feedback.Improvements: Provide feedback to individual student questions. Both could also send out emails on clarifications if greater than 3 students have the same clarification question. No office hours offered.",
    "Instructor: Xuhui Lee \u00a0Strengths: knowledge of topics covered. Quick at providing feedbackWeaknesses: ambiguity in the slides and questions in homework. He also needs to improve clarification of questions on homework and labs.Improve: Remembering that not everyone teaches statistics in the same way and perhaps provide references for review as well. No office hours offered."

    "Instructor: Lei Zhao \u00a0Lei was very knowledgeable and willing to help in Lab. However, the TAs were not allowed to have office hours. The labs were long and you often did not have time to prepare and read the lengthy material in advance. There is no way to complete the lab in one period (most of the time) and with no office hours, you had to rely on emailing your TA for questions you didn't have time to get to.I don't know if it was because there were too many students, but although he was able to clarify questions, he wasn't great for feedback on the final projects.The lab assignments also were often hard to follow in terms of directions and what was being asked. One lab had major errors and each year the labs should be reviewed to ensure that questions are clarified and lab instructions and answer sheets match up.I think it would help if the TAs provided a really brief lecture on what is being covered and any areas where clarification is needed. I takes less work to do that than it is to go around to each student when they have the exact same question. This would also work if the TAs sent a general email to the entire class when a major question\/clarification occurs in the homework or lab assignment."

    "This course is a lot of work, especially if you don't have all the background 'required' from the course application sheet. There are no office hours for additional help. However,you will learn a lot of interesting things about the environment, advanced spatial statistical methods, and the application and the limitations of this kind of work. The instructors also did not provide the amount of feedback that is normally received in a smaller class.If you have a stronger physical science and statistical background you may have less issues with understanding the topics. I also felt as an intro class, we could in theory apply the topic based on interests, however, it felt that because the professors were in the environmental sector that they did not appreciate the use of the remote sensing to areas that were not nearly as related to the environment. Especially if you are only allowed to use free images from Landsat or MODIS.Also, a topic should cover how to remove clouds from images since many students had to obtain a relatively cloud free image."
