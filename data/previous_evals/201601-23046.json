    "I recommend this class for humanities and literature lovers seeking to immerse themselves in another world.",
    "This class might not be offered again, but it's a good introduction to a text that you'll likely never approach had it been left entirely up to you. Tina Lu knows her stuff and Bloch is always an engaging, funny presence",
    "Well-taught course with a ton of reading. If you're interested in entering Chinese literature through an accessible yet challenging route, and if you're willing to devote the hours, this course is for you. The professors are both literary aspects, and seamlessly fold interesting social and political discussions into our look at this Chinese novel.",
    "This class will teach you how to interpret things! Dream of the Red Chamber was very long, but I'm glad I read it.",
    "Despite the many barriers to the faint of heart (the obvious foreignness of concepts and currencies, the weirdly British translation, the sheer volume of the story), The Story of the Stone is a captivating read. The questions it poses, about love, loss, corruption, and the nature of reality, are always relevant. The course itself contributes greatly to the understanding of the story. I highly recommend this course to anyone who likes to read, or who, like Bao-yu, appreciates the joys of life.",
    "If you want to learn more about this specific text and the culture that it is contextualized in. Be aware, it is not for the faint of heart as the reading is heavy and the paper as well."
