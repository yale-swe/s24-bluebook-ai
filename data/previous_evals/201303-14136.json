   "comments": [
    "Not a super challenging class that deals with the Middle East and women's empowerment. Will probably challenge your stereotypes about Islam, and the way women are treated in that religion. I would recommend this class, but this was Dr. Shaker's last semester unfortunately.",
    "This class is a survey of feminism and feminist movements in the Middle East, in both Islamic and secular nations. Expect to do a decent amount of reading, and to come to a class heavily based on those readings (however, it was not always necessary to do all of the readings, as they were always summarized in class, as well). I would recommend the class to someone interested in the subject, but would warn that you only really gain from the class if you are willing to put in extra effort in doing the readings (and it's all too easy to get by without doing many of them at all).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, although it'll never be the same without Dr Shaker. No one is as knowledgable, kind, or disorganized, as she!",
    "Women in Nationalist Movements is a great course for you to read excellent works related to this topic as well as present and discuss ideas. Even though the range of topics related to women's equality seemed limited towards the end of the semester (we talk a lot about the same themes), I still came from every class with a new understanding of the issues at hand (or at least some new fact).",
    "Irrelevant, Shaker is leaving.",
    "I believe this class is transformative and a much needed addition to any political science student who is interested in international and comparative politics. I recommend this class with ought reservation. The readings are interesting. The research project can be fitted to your interests. Dr. Shaker is a wonderful resource and is so knowledgeable about the literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the Middle East, or in women's studies, or just in general. It has been both engaging and exciting and a real learning experience for me.",
    "Reading the course description and evaluations of this class, I could not have been more excited to take it. It seemed like a great fusion between Modern Middle East Studies and Women's Studies, two areas in which I have a great interest. The course, however, was disappointing. Each week there was a lot of reading, and people would present each class. We also had to write reflections every week drawing on the readings, previous discussions, and personal experience. This wasn't toomuch of a burden because they were only graded P\/F but I don't think they really helped me gain anything more from the class. While I did learn a few interesting things, the class had no logical structure so I didn't feel as though I came to any great conclusions or followed a linear plan. The readings were interesting at the beginning but soon became pretty repetitive.",
    "Learn a lot about nationalist movements and the role of women in the Middle East.",
    "More women's studies than polisci, this class is a good introduction to the intersection of nationalist movements and women's rights discourses in the Middle East and North Africa. I learned a bit about a number of states and gained a solid introduction to non-Western women's theory, such as Islamic feminism. The work is very manageable; weekly reading responses, two presentations, and a midterm case-study paper that leads into a longer final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, regardless of your major. Through the semester we touched on so many aspects (politics, religion, feminist theory, nationalism, peaceful protests,& more!) that no matter your interest, one or more were sure to be covered multiple times. The reading was a bit heavy some weeks, but the interesting subject matter and carefully chosen essays, articles and books made the length manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course because of the excellent reading list and the high quality of discussions in seminars."
