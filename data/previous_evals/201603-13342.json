I sometimes had to review my notes and the lecture slides to fully grasp the concepts. That said, I don't think any material should be cut from the lectures. Ultimately I think that the lecture notes that the professor made available online were very helpful for mitigating this effect."

   "comments": [
    "Shimi's teaching style, he took very difficult concepts and explained them in very, very understandable ways. He was approachable and kind. I also really appreciated that he printed out the slides and then we could take notes on them as he was talking. He was very timely with assignments and was organized.",
    "Very well organized topics",
    "Useful information, Chemical fundamentals.",
    "The problem sets were super helpful as they forced us to review the material we learned in class and keep the lectures fresh in our minds.I also thought that the clicker questions were a great way to have a low stakes way of checking in on our attention span throughout the class. Response questions are also good and I like that they weren't every class.",
    "Shimi has pre-filtered material to only focus on what's relevant, so you don't need to actually learn all of organic chemistry in order to understand how organic pollutants work and what's relevant for managing organic pollutants in an urban environment. Shimi has curated the curriculum into bite-size chunks and created problem sets to feed you the material on a silver platter.",
    "The best aspect of the course by far was Professor Shimi Anisfeld's teaching. Shimi clearly cares a lot about the students and the course material. He was extremely knowledgable about the material and presented it in a very clear and concise manner. Furthermore, Shimi was patient with answering student's questions and comments during class. I also appreciated the number of office hours that were offered each week, which gave students an opportunity to grasp concepts that may have been covered too quickly during class. Finally, the brief organic chemistry review at the beginning of the course was very helpful for me since I had little previous experience with organic chemistry.",
    "The learning curve in this course is incredible!"

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Could use some case studies from other countries",
    "Updates and follow up on the study case that is presenting in class.",
    "I think the end of the course is still kind of a whirlwind and it's hard to keep track of all of the different characteristics. Part of me thinks that a problem set put in those last few weeks that involve some kind of review of all the different groups of compounds would be really useful.",
    "It's hard to prioritize the information in the course. A couple of examples: - for problem sets, class response qs, and exam problems, the key formula or fact is buried on a slide in the lecture - it wasn't apparent in the lecture at how important this one equation would be later on. He does try and highlight some of these as he goes through, but some are not emphasized as much in lecture as they are on the problem sets - there was a heavy emphasis on delta h and g and the various theoretical underpinnings of how and why certain organic pollutants respond to various external stimuli, but in the end I felt that this focus confused me more than helped me. I did come into the class with 0 organic chemistry experience, so perhaps different for those who wanted the full theoretical understanding - I just personally do better to learn the applied case first and then learn the why second. This course does the opposite. Also the focus on the structural isomers at the beginning was a distraction I think. Additionally, - would have preferred the class response questions to be due at the start of the next class instead of halfway, I often didn't have time for this course when the response question was due, but would have preferred to have spent the hour before class refreshing my mind on the previous class' material. - I was caught off guard by the no-open book midterm and expectations of memorizing the various names of chemicals. Probably my fault for not noticing, but I don't see why this course shouldn't have open-note tests given that any work in this field will be done by referencing various fact sheets, and is not a subject that you would be pulling info from the back of your mind willy-nilly. It's also a ton of work\/huge learning curve to learn the names and terminology, moreso than I think is appreciated by Shimi. Once you learn it, it's very obvious, but the little basic things were such a struggle for me to get up to speed on terminology that it blocked me from fully grasping the material.",
    "In my opinion there are no major aspects of the course that need improvement.",
    "It was a great course. I think I learned a lot from unter student discussions, too especially before exams. Maybe that could be (further) facilitated. Otherwise no improvements come to mind."

    "Took this class because I am interested in urban parks and open space and wanted a class related to water or chemistry in the urban environment - there were basically no water classes offered in the previous 3 semesters, so took this one as a backup. Didn't know the difference between organic pollutants, metals, and dissolved solids prior to taking this course, so really starting at ground zero. Was a terrific course in bringing me up to speed on the terminology of issues with brownfields and i look forward to utilizing this knowledge to identify opportunities in urban reclamation projects and be able to help me identify experts who know what they are talking about instead of flying blind.",

It can quickly become overwhelming, so you need to stay on top of each weeks exercises. The midterm and final are pretty hefty so be prepared to put in some time studying for those. I took this course without an organic chemistry background and found that some of the topics just weren't as intuitive to me as a could've been. But I didn't see it as an extreme disadvantage, as most people had forgotten the organic chemistry they taken years ago anyway.",
    "Learn the terminology of the various compounds early on - try to take the first quiz without notes, it will help you later on. Go to office hours - he sets aside office hours twice a week and the TA has one a week, and these are incredibly useful. They are both so patient and helpful, that it's a crying shame not to take advantage of them. Try and find additional problem sets to run through examples so you have more opportunities to practice the material. Don't stress, just learn what you can!",
