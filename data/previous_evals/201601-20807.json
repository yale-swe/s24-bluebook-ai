   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to major in applied Math, Stat or Economics.",
    "Teaches you a lot of the \"theory of statistics\" as promised, which is useful for later courses if you are trying to learn more stat afterward. It's true that the lectures could have been organized better, but the book is pretty helpful and you will ultimately learn what you took the course to learn.",
    "Not a great class. If you read the textbook, you'll learn fair amount of stat theory, but you don't need to take this class to read the textbook. Makes me feel like Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting when he's talking to the guy in the bar (\"paid $150k for an education you could have gotten for $1.50 in late charges at the public library\").",
    "If you take this class, know that you would not learn anything useful about statistics from the lectures. The psets are helpful, but they are every week (including the midterm weeks). The exams were both easy",
    "Statistics is, I believe, a beautiful subject that reflects noble endeavour to make sense of uncertainty. Unfortunately, it seems that in a typical intro stat course at college, the beauty is not presented properly. However, Prof. Barron succeeds to convey it in his lectures by giving us historical backgrounds and his own attitudes. Though I would not recommend this course to those who are not interested in theory, if you are interested in what is actually going on in statistical tools that I guess you have probably used before, this course is a great one for you. Have fun!",
    "As someone who had no prior stats experience I found this class challenging. I learned a lot but it was demanding and I spent a lot of time on the psets. Eventually, I was happy that I took the class because it provided me with a very solid stats foundation but you have to devote time and effort to get a decent grade.",
    "Very good foundation in data analysis, probably especially helpful with STAT 230.",
    "Easier and more straightforward than 241. A very useful class that covers a good scope of material.",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested in the material. I didn't take this class as a requirement for my major (though it would certainly be useful for anyone in the quantitative social sciences), but rather just because I enjoyed the material. Professor Barron is a strong lecturer, who is also very committed to making sure that students understand the material.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need to take it for your major. It is not to hard and is much easier to grasp conceptually than STAT 241.",
    "Much easier to understand than 241-- keep going with the sequence",
    "Take this class if you need to take it, though the problem sets can take some time they're never overly complicated, and the tests were not hard.",
    "If you took STAT 241, take STAT 242. Similar difficulty level. Professor Barron's explanations in class are often difficult to follow, but if you write down everything he says and cross-reference it with the book after every class, the material is not hard to understand. Homework is very doable, but I would recommend to get started at least a few days in advance of the deadline, just in case you realize you don't fully understand the material. Not a particularly fun or engaging class to sit in but it gets the job done and isn't a huge time commitment.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it for your major. It's definitely a filter class where it tests if you really enjoy and want to learn more about the subject, but Barron is great and the psets are long but you can find the answers online and are fine if you work with people. Love that there are only two equally-weighted tests so that there is no final. And each are 30% and HW is 40%. Overall, it's an okay class.",
    "You're taking this if you have to. Otherwise, take stat 238 if you're just interested in the basics of stat but want more than stat 100. if you're into theory, stat 241 is for you and stat 242 has a bit less of proofs",
    "STAT 242 is a course in the theory of statistics; both the derivation of statistical methods and using them to solve problems are covered. I thought this class taught all of the material really well. The problem sets could be a bit long, but I think they were effective in helping to learn the material. I also really enjoyed STAT 241, but I thought this was a better class.",
    "I find the material very interesting, but the teaching style on the dry side. The lectures are difficult to keep up with, and often seems to deviate from the book. Furthermore, the final section on regression uses a lot of techniques that don't even seem to be used at all in the field anymore. For example, best subsets selection (a technique we use in class) exists only with Minitab, and not any other software at all. Minitab doesn't seem to be a software with much widespread usage. To make things worse, the full version (that actually contains best subsets selection) does not even support Macs.",
    "It's an intensely analytical approach to statistics. Uses probability theory and mathematical properties of distributions to derive lots of the stuff you memorized in intro stat.",
    "Stat 242 was a solid course and I felt as though I learned more than in 241. It is a course that I would describe as more important than fun. Professor Barron does a pretty good job overall and helps you get through the material with a strong understanding to tackle more advanced stats courses.",
    "STAT 242 is an excellent course for developing a better understanding of statistics. While I found its prerequisite course, 241, to be frustrating and poorly taught, I greatly enjoyed 242. Professor Barron is the best stats\/math professor that I have encountered at Yale and his lectures are very engaging. In nearly all lectures, Professor Barron gives pretty rigorous proofs for results; the exceptions are the lectures in April on linear regression, in which some results are stated without proof. As the focus of 242's material is theoretical, it's a great complement to more applied statistics courses like STAT 230 or econometrics.",
    "If you liked 241, the material in 242 is worth learning. That begin said, I would recommend just reading the textbook instead of going to lectures."
