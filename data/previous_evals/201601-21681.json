    "ENGL 120 had some good readings (and some bad). However, the essay prompts were always very fun. However, I don't think that this course has benefited me as a writer at all (I could have done the readings myself outside of class, and the essay grading seemed very arbitrary.)",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. I'm a graduating senior, and I'm honestly so glad I took this class before leaving college. The readings are fantastic, and they really show what good writing looks like. Taking the class with Prof. Wilson was also great. He's really funny and really engaging, and the class always flowed really well. Since it's discussion-based, the class will obviously vary depending on who else is taking the class, but I'd highly recommend taking it with Prof. Wilson. Class time was enjoyable, and I genuinely enjoyed going to class, which is much more than I can say for most other classes.",
    "Take the course! Fun readings, manageable workload, and Andrew was fantastic - funny, caring, and helpful.",
    "Creative writing and personal writing in various forms. Take it! You'll experience writing about basic, mundane things and applying them to life and societal issues. You'll figure out more about yourself in the process and also appreciate other people's work more.",
    "Really enjoyable English class. I'm not really into English, but the reading and writing assignments are enjoyable.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy writing (or want to enjoy writing). You'll get to write about things that interest you and work on honing your skills in non-academic contexts. Highly recommend. Andrew is great if he's teaching it.",
    "English 120 is my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far. Without a doubt I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "English 120 is a decent class. You get what is advertised: you read and write modern NY-times style essays. I wish that more time were spent on revising writing and on writing technique; a lot of class time we analyzed the essays we read for meaning but not for style. Otherwise, the essays and topics were good, and it was fun to be in a class where you get to know the other students well. I didn't love it as much as other people seem to, but I think that's because I prefer classes that make you think in depth about social fabric and the human condition.",
