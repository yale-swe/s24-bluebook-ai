    "Limited appeal as a general course. Better appeal as a linguistics course. Great intro for those wanting to get started in formal semantics, okay for general linguistic interest.",
    "This is a pretty technical class. For somebody who has not encountered model-theoretic semantics, I would warn them that there is more math than they probably expect. I would describe the class as a semester-long effort to build up a formal language that captures the logical facts of natural language. But, as I said above, this particular class was a very thorough and helpful introduction to a complex field. So as an introduction to the field, I wholeheartedly recommend this class."
