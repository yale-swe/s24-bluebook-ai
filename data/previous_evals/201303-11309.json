    "A really in depth history of American silver, its practices and influences. It was a fascinating history lesson from a rather unusual perspective. TAKE IT, and see how great it is!",
    "This class is a really incredible chance to learn about Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silver collection. You literally will spend 2 hours a week holding some of the most important pieces of American Silver. It is really so cool. The workload is light (only 2 short-- but challenging-- writing assignments and weekly readings that are pretty engaging), but just be prepared to memorize a ton of similar looking silver objects in preparation for the final (ours was really fair though, in the end). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a chance to get really intimate with a very specialized and incredible collection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take this class. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it again.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in art history and especially decorative arts.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It offered a really special chance to go beyond the slides in an art history class and get your hands dirty, so to speak. I think you have to be interested in material culture to really enjoy this class, but even for a non-major, I think this would offer a great opportunity to explore the Yale collection in a unique way.",
    "Yes! You shouldn't pass up this opportunity to see so much of the Gallery's collection."
