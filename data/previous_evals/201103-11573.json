   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommended, even for non-economics majors. To be an intelligent citizen in today's world, one must understand the basic forces of the macroeconomy. Professor Nordhaus did a great job tying in theory and observation, as well as relating course principles to current scenarios.",
    "Yeah, take it if you have to as an econ major.",
    "Econ 122 is exactly as advertised. Much more bearable than Intermediate Micro.",
    "Fantastic class. Take it with Nordhaus if at all possible, he is a great and engaging teacher and he obviously knows his stuff.",
    "Great class. Nordhaus is an engaging lecturer and everything we talk about is very prevalent to our current economy. Definitely take it if you can",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! Even if you're not econ major, you should know these stuff about our economy and the world. It provides tools for you to analyze the patterns and trends of macroeconomy. After this class, you'll be able to read government policies and know what they're talking about and what they're trying to accomplish.",
    "Boring class, problem sets and exams weren't mathy enough, but something you have to take if you want to be an Econ major. Overall not bad though.",
    "Definitely recommend the class. Really interesting, engaging. Nordhaus is great..",
    "Typical intermediate course. Keep updated on the lecture notes so you don't fall behind.",
    "Challenging but doable!",
    "Nordhaus is not a bad lecturer, but the material he taught was not really relevant. Other classes were taught different material. I would only recommend taking it if you are an Econ major and have to take it.",
    "Great class !",
    "If you're an econ major you have to take it, but I would recommend this class for anyone who wants an in depth understanding of the economy.",
    "You have to take it if you're an econ major, take it with Nordhaus. Overall good class",
    "You'll have to take it if you're an econ major. Otherwise, don't: really boring and reasonably hard.",
    "Mandatory econ class. If you are going to take it, take it with Nordhaus.",
    "I would recommend taking this class even if you're not positive you want to be an econ major. The opportunity to learn from Professor Nordhaus should not be missed.",
    "You probably need to take this because you're an Econ major. If you're not, this is not some class you can breeze through on- the problem sets near the end take 8-10 hours. Nordhaus, however, makes the class worth it. He is full of insights on the basic models and and on how they apply to today's current events. You can tell that he's passionate about the material. Don't go into it with anexpectation of getting a solid A or your life will be miserable. Recommend! Try to keep up with the readings as it will make your life that much easier before the final- it is a lot of material.",
    "Quite useful in order to get to know why the world is in the way it is now. Take it because you're an Econ major. The psets do take a while however.",
    "I would only take this class if you are an economics major",
    "I think everyone should take this class. It helps you understand the current economic situation while giving you the macro tools you need for further econ studies.",
    "If you are a major you must take it, but if you are interested in the economy at all I think it is a good course to take.",
    "If you can get in to take it with Nordhaus, definitely do so.",
    "Take it if you have a strong inclination for economics. Not an easy course, but very useful for general knowledge. Make problem set groups early because they are quite difficult.",
    "It's really tough so unless you really want to take it or need to take it, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Obviously you have to take it, and its really not that bad with Nordhaus so go for it. You do have to write a paper though, and study for days for that final",
    "Good course, I would recommend it to any students who have interest, although mainly only students who are in related majors can take it.",
    "I would reccommend this class to all Econ majors and people who want to extend their economic knowledge",
    "You have to take it. Don't believe it. Keep an open mind to the vagaries of human behavior, and realize that our economic activity often depends very little about the variables Nordhaus will tell you determines it.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "great econ course, you learn a lot and work hard, definitely worth it",
    "Take it if you need it for econ",
    "If you have to take intermediate macro, I would recommend you take it with Nordhaus. He is really passionate about the subject and does a good job teaching the material. The classes do at times feel pretty long and complicated, but overall not too bad. Reading the book before the exams is a good idea.",
    "Well structured - quite important when it comes to understanding the economic challenges we face today.",
    "Yeah, pretty solid course. Nordhaus is obviously the man. He's is surprisingly quirky, too.Just don't fall behind.",
    "Intermediate Macroeconomics is an excellent course that one shouldn\u0092t loathe taking, especially if one wants to be an economics major. The course covers all of the essential elements of the macroeconomy including financial markets, national accounts, international economic theory, growth theory, and more topics all in the context of both Keynesian and Classical macroeconomic models. This class transcends a standard course in intermediate macroeconomics, going beyond just the standard topics to include risk premiums, debt crises, and current events through a historical lens all taught by the engaging and inspiring William Nordhaus. Overall, the class is very rewarding and is no more or less workthan any other introductory or intermediate economics course except that this course includes a short paper, which was a very fulfilling experience despite the fact that many people complained about it. The exams in this class were very fair and the problem sets were often challenging, but doable and didactic, especially if one had already completed the modest amount of assigned reading from the textbook. Although this class requires calculus as a prerequisite, calculus is used only moderately; however, when calculus skills are not being emphasized, this course relies deeply on economic intuition in models which are much more complicated than those introduced to students in introductory macroeconomics. Models in this class are often dynamic, very complex, and have many more moving parts to them as compared to those from introductory macroeconomics making this class a challenge helping students to partially put together the pieces which make up the still mysterious macroeconomy.",
    "Take it with Nordhaus if you have to. His tests were very hard and unexpected.",
    "A challenging but rewarding class, tackling the most useful parts of the most valuable branch of modern economics.",
    "Definitely! How else are you going to be an econ major? Must take macro with Nordhaus.",
    "straightforward intermediate econ course, take it if you have to or if you are seriously interested in macro",
    "Great lecture and interesting material. The class itself is pretty tough, but it really teaches you macro.",
    "I would recommend Econ 122.",
    "A more in-depth overview of what was covered in intro macroeconomics. We covered many different models on business cycles and economic growth, and we were expected to have a deep understanding of most of them on the final exam. More quantitative than intro, but more qualitative and more like a history class than macro theory.",
    "A bit overrated; it is certainly interesting but it is also hard and dry econ. The final was unacceptably hard, I honestly do not know why any professor would want to test his students' ability to divide hard decimal numbers in a final exam instead of testing the material of the course. Take it if you want to understand the economic dynamics in a country and in the world but if you are willing to put through a hard course.",
    "Pretty good course. Nordhaus makes attending lecture worth your time. He's engaging, entertaining, and patient. Though it's really easy not to do the reading, I suggest you do it to get the most out of the class. The workload is pretty manageable. I highly suggest working on problem sets with a group of friends. Macro tends to be gray in some areas, so extra opinions always help. Also, stay on top of the material regularly. Macro is a bit like math in that it builds on itself. The curve is more or less what you'd expect from previous economics courses at Yale.",
    "Fantastic course. My suggestions for students taking this course is to stay on-top of the textbook reading--it's not particularly necessary for the problem sets or tests, but will allow you to take much more out of the course (and make the problem sets and test that much easier). The additional assigned readings are very interesting so I'd recommend at least a skim of them.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend Econ 122 to another student. It's one of the few classes at Yale where you can learn information that is directly applicable to the real world(sorry for the cliche)",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it for an econ major. If you need to take Intermediate Macro, take it in the fall w\/ Nordhaus. He's incredibly competent and is an expert on Macro. Fairly easy to pay attention in class. Midterm is easy, final was very difficult. Psets were mixed - some were painfully long, others were fine especially since half were ungraded. For non econ majors, I don't think you need this level of detail.",
    "Simply the best economics course I have taken at Yale so far. Nordhaus has a great mind and it shows in all of his lectures.",
    "Yes, take it. Responsible educated citizens should have a functioning grasp of macroecon and 122 with Nordhaus is a clear, interesting, not too hard way to learn intermediate. Go to lectures and do the psets though--you don't want to get lost."
