    "Absolutely take this class if you're interested in reading great works of fiction that you will probably never be exposed to again. I came into this class having heard of only one of the authors, but I would now count several of the novels we have read and discussed as among the best I have ever read.",
    "It's a great way to read awesome books. Not too much work involved. Lectures can get a little bit long and tedious. But, books are really good."
