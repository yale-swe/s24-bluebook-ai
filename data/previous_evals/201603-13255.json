   "comments": [
    "This is a great course to explore the process of different forms of regression. It is probably more geared toward people who have strong background in either statistics or R -- you can learn one easily through the course, but learning both at the same time is challenging. The topics are taught in a logical order, building steadily, and homeworks practice the skills learned. Having (optional) readings on the syllabus would be helpful for those learning R, as would more step-by-step annotation in the lecture notes\/code (though this started happening toward the end of the course). The midterm and final projects were great: they mirrored the process of an actual analysis, and pushed us to think carefully through data management, research question definition, and writing our findings clearly. In general, the course was a challenge, but very glad I took it.",
    "The teacher does not explain things clearly. His professional knowledge is poor. He does not even know some basis things about regression.",
    "R skills are abundantly shown and taught during the lectures. Also covered topics besides regression like random forest. But debugging the codes during lecture is not so efficient.",
    "should be more structured and well-prepared better have a set of lecture slides",
    "The course is very useful for building R programming knowledge",
    "This course makes us more familiar with R programming, which is really great. Necessary theories are also covered in the course, while it would be better if more rigorous theoretical stuff is included into this course.",
    "Strengths: Michael told us very much about practical skills of analysis and coding. I really appreciate his thoughtful ideas. Weaknesses: There was very little mathematical knowledge about regression.",
    "It is a good class",
    "This course is related to real life data. It's very useful.",
    "Weakness: The lecture presentations is really inefficient. Professor Kane just type the lecture notes during each lecture. I have to say this is really awkward and inefficient. Coding and notes preparation need a lot of time before each lecture. The lecture itself should just focus on presentation and Q&A. In this semester, typing the codes during each lecture significantly delayed the course schedule and made the lecture become really messy. I hope Professor Kane could improve the quality of this course in the future by fully preparing the relevant lecture notes and homework assignments.",
    "60\/100",
    "Excellent course if you have any R background. Would not recommend for SAS only users. Overall the professor is flexible in the syllabus and includes topics that the students want to go over. Midterm and final projects you can choose from a list of datasets.",
    "This course goes very in-depth into regression analyses, so you get very familiar with it. There are some pretty advanced math\/stats theory, which is helpful for understanding why the regression techniques work, but thankfully is not required to get the work done in the class. It's great that Professor Kane works through the lesson during class so we can see the thought process, but a little more structure on what the goals are would be nice to have an idea of how things are supposed to go (when they often take lots of detours to get there in class). I really enjoyed the final and midterm, which gives you free reign to look at a data set, clean it up, and analyze it as you see fit--the most applicable use of this class.",
    "The course could have benefited from more structure regarding lectures and course content. There was not always a clear association between lecture content and homework expectations.",
    "It was clear that this was the first time Professor Kane had taught this course. I really appreciated his passion and excitement about biostatistics and how he related everything back to the bigger picture. It would have been helpful to have a more extensive biostatistics tutorial at the beginning of the semester. I felt like I learned R mostly through online sites I found and googling. I appreciated when Professor Kane transitioned to a more powerpoint structure at the end of the semester instead of just coding all class, which can be difficult to follow. The homework assignments increased my knowledge about R and biostats, but some of the problems seemed out of scope for this class and asked questions about things that were not covered in class. This made them difficult to complete at times. I really liked the format of the midterm and final. The final was easier to complete than the midterm because there was more guidance. With a little more structure and a couple more R tutorials, I think this class has the potential to be really great.",
    "Strength: hands on use of R, accessible material Weakness: needs a bit more organization",
    "Ways to improve: having better office hours that would work for all students. Went once to the TF sessions, and it seemed like 1-2 students would corner the TF and it became difficult to even access them. Running through common problems on the board would be helpful in such circumstances.",
    "Great course, a bit more structure would help.",
    "This was a fantastic introduction to the topic - I do not plan to program in R but I have enjoyed learning about the analytical methods and, most importantly, about the way to evaluate the assumptions when performing the analysis and interpreting the results Very good blend of theory and practice, one of the best lectures. I did not became an expert but this is an excellent start for a lifelong learning.",
    "Poorly organized. Need a strong background in R.",
    "The lecture notes could be prepared more to show a clearer lecture"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Clearly knows the subject back and forth, and appreciated when he would talk through exactly what each part of the code was doing (and why he was doing each thing). Good sense of humor, and makes jokes as you work through the datasets. Very understanding and encouraging. Would be helpful to have more resources scouted out for those of us learning R\/stats, and would also be helpful to have him add more notes to the code with what each line is doing, since I couldn't code fast enough to follow him and take my own notes in the .Rmd file in class.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Professor Kane is a great professor. He is engaging and willing to listen\/consider student feedback. He has high expectations of his students, so you have to also be willing (as a student) to adjust to his teaching style, which is predominantly based on trial and error.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0The instructor has poorly knowledge. Sometimes he does not understand the methods we used in our homework. I think it is unacceptable.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0prepare the course framework better teaching more why then how grade the mid term more carefully",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0He is nice and responsive to questions, it would be better to have more organized notes",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Dr. Kane is very patient and kind and the atmosphere in class is always pleasant. His introduction got me started in R programming, which is helpful to me. This course would be even better if we had an outline of all the contents throughout the whole semester and could always refer to certain literature specified by the instructor. And it would be easier for us to preview and review the contents covered in class if there were lecture notes available before class that are completely prepared. Overall, Dr. Kane's lectures are informative and helpful!",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0He is very talented and has a lot of innovative idea.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Professor Kane is very nice and willing to answer questions. He definitely knows a lot about the R and regression analysis since whenever I asked a specific questions I encountered, I would get very good feedback. However, regarding to the course, I would like to know more solid theoretical knowledge about the regression analysis. And if it is possible, I would love it if there is an outline for each lecture. And if there is more explanation of definition and usage of diagnostics methods, it would be perfect. Anyway, thanks for the lecture, it is informative.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0He is a awesome instructor who pay more attention to real world dataset.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Prof. Kane did not have a clear mind when teaching this course. In addition, he did not care about his student. Specifically, the syllabus is out of date, the homework assignments are full of mistakes and typos, the lecture notes are typed during classes. Also, Prof. Kane often missed his office hours and did not reply the email. I hope Prof. Kane could improve the quality of his lecture in the future. This semester is completely a disaster.",

    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Very knowledgeable and passionate about statistics.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Professor Kane was really helpful one-on-one. He was not great at responding to e-mails in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Strength: very enthusiastic and approachable Weakness: again, a bit more organization. If lecture material and partial code or psuedocode is made available before class, then everyone can follow along and try running things in class.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Professor was always very helpful with any questions and problems faced during home works or exams. Thank you",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Excellent. Was able to explain and demonstrate R to students who had never used it before.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable and effective lecturer who makes the analytical concepts approachable to an average student like me. I am not good at programing R and do not plan to pursue it in future but I enjoyed learning the underlying methodology of regression analysis and checking the assumptions when evaluating results. All programming and analyses were done by Dr Kane on the fly in the classroom and made this a truly interactive and valuable experience. Dr Kane makes it clear that this is as much of an art as it is science. One of the best lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Very nice and good in office hours. Does not seem prepared for class.",
    "Instructor: Michael John Kane \u00a0Good, but lectures could be prepared a bit more.",
