   "comments": [
    "The course is excellent and is one that everyone should take before they graduate. It is one thing to read these epics, but it is quite another to understand them. This course allows you to do both without being overwhelmed or bored.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 130 only to die-hard English nerds. It's a lot of reading, for not much more than you would get from reading it on your own.",
    "This was a fantastic class, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who looks at the reading list and, like Molly in Ulysses, says \u201cYes.\u201d Be prepared for a ton of reading, though, because it is a lot. You have to really want to do it for it to be possible, and you have to really do it for it to be meaningful and worthwhile. That said, if you have the drive and desire to do all of the reading, it will be an incredibly rewarding experience, and I promise you that. Personally, I had so much fun reading these great works and then coming to class twice a week to discuss them with Professor Markovits and the rest of the class. These are the kinds of texts that really deserve to be read and discussed with others, and if you\u2019re up for the work, this class really is quite a treat. If she is teaching the class again and you can manage it, I would also definitely recommend taking the class with Professor Markovits; if not, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s totally worth it with the other professors too. So if the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d good luck and enjoy the journey; it\u2019s gonna be epic.",
    "The books read in ENGL 130 are among the most profound and important works of all time. They are certainly works that everyone should read at some point in their lives. However, at times the pace of the reading leaves insufficient time to \"savor\" the literature and process the deeper implications of the each work. Professor Markovits provides an anchor of sorts by coming to class with an agenda of specific discussion points, all the while directing us towards specific conclusions. Deviations from this agenda are permitted, though usually not dwelled upon. In this way, the course was much less personal than the one other English class I took at Yale. Thus I would not necessarily recommend this course if you are not comfortable with 1) a reading intensive course (you can't get away with not doing the readings in this course), 2) just scratching the surface of some of literature's densest books (Ulysses!), and 3) less personal but more scholarly class discussions. Otherwise, go for it!",
    "YES. The work load turns a lot of people off, but it isn't that bad. The reading can be a lot (I especially felt that way about Ulysses) but it is manageable. Completely worth it also.",
    "Make sure you make this your #1 class. We're not kidding when we talk about the readings. They're wonderful but very time consuming, and the worst thing is to walk into seminar with only the sparknotes summaries to consider."
