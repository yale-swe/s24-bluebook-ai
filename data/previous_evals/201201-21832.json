    "This class is a ton of work. On the surface it doesn't have much specific applicability, but if you're interested in urban planning, real estate finance, or urban policy TAKE IT. You will not find another course like this at Yale. It isn't about the academic study of cities, but is instead about gaining practical pragmatic experience to show you a glimpse of what the real world outside of academia is like. Its a complicated course, that requires A TON of work on the two respective projects. The final is mostly the obvious IDs that come up time and time again from lecture.",
    "This is difficult-- though at the end of the semester I was glad that I had taken the class, I was very unhappy with it at several times. If you are truly interested in urban studies, you should take it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "Lots of work and games are tough. Not a lot of direction",
    "The course is very unique among the other courses I have taken at Yale. Combining architecture, finance, and public policy, it seems like something that would be found at SOM, but it is accessible to undergrads. The strengths of this course were the three guest developers who came into the class to share their own work and critique ours. The class is very understandable if the readings are followed. Personally, I am ambivilant about recommending the class or not. If a student is geniunely interested in the subject matter, take the class; they will definitely learn something. If a student is unsure or looking for an easy class, do not.",
    "I think this course has great potential, but as it stands, there is a much greater need for making the course more accessible to students in a more interactive way. The games, while helpful, do not reflect what is actually even done in class! Instead of students being graded or judged on the basis of their understanding of the application of core course concepts, they are instead judged on creativity and highly subjective variables (at least as they related to the projects and free-response portion of the final exam). As it stands, I would not recommend this course to another student, unless the material is changed and the process for educating students on expectations is improved.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for lots of work with the games.",
    "This course depends entirely on how much work you put in. If you're willing to work, then it can be incredible. It teaches you an a staggering amount about ALL aspects of planning.The most surprising thing about the course is that it's just as much about real estate and retail as about the cities.It's really a study of urban planning, not \"the city.\" But this approach actually gives you a much better understanding of how cities operate.And for anybody interested in finance or business, this a great course to take. Lot of emphasis on real estate and retail."
