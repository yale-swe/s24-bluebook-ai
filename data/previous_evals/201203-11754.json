    "Longer than the time allotted, so you have to work very quickly. And learn uncertainty propagation early and thoroughly.",
    "A general lab. Most labs run over the given time limit, but most TA's allow you to stay for an extra half hour or so. It is a good lab for those interested in physics, but for others who need a lab credit, I would recommend 165.",
    "It is a requirement. It sucks. Try and get a good Professor. Your grades will depend on your TA, not on how much work you put in.",
    "This course was a waste of my time. I mean, the labs were well put-together, our TA was fine, our professor was fine. It's just that I learned absolutely nothing in this lab. I guess if you haven't taken high school physics and Intro to Electronics, you may not know how to use an oscilloscope or how to put together a circuit or use LoggerPro or how to use a meter stick. If you don't know how to use those things, then spend a weekend learning how to use them and don't take this lab. If you have to take this lab, then sorry, this class is kind of like the device in The Princess Bride that tortures you by draining your life out of you. The worthlessness of this class is almost criminal in the way it remorselessly squanders hours of your precious young adulthood the way the spendthrift son of a media mogul rolls up hundred dollar bills to smoke.Anyway, at least there is very little work to do outside the lab, and the final lab practical isn't too bad. It's not a hard class. It's not even a badly taught class or a disorganized class. It's just a worthless class.",
    "Labs were amad rush, and almost nobody ever finished on time. I think it would be effective if there were more of an emphasis on quality rather than quantity. This course was not something I looked forward to every week, that is for sure, but to me fair, I must admit that I did learn a bunch, mainly about how to use the equipment. I think if the labs were less rushed, I would have learned more about the physics concepts. Also, it would be really nice if the lab could be better coordinated with the intro physics sequence.Your TA is really important. Some are way more helpful than others, so if possible, go to a few sections and switch if you need to.",
    "It's the most frustrating waste of time I've ever put myself through.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. It is poorly run and the lab manuals are poorly written. For me, it made physics into a frustrating experience rather than the enjoyable one I had always known it to be.",
    "Take it if you have to, but otherwise there are better labs out there.",
    "Physics majors must take this class. The workload is low, the material is very simply, but the lab handouts are simply awful and outdated. My Professor, Jack Harris, was brilliant, as was the TA, Will S. Grading can be slightly haphazard and random. Unlike past reviews for semesters before Fall 2012, class usually got out on time, which was enforced by the Professor. I suspect the content may have been reduced slightly. Overall, low workload, a lot learnt, excellent Professor and TA, but terrible handouts for lab.",
    "Take it only because you need to. Some of the lab experiments were not proportional with the time allocation, because we had to write our lab reports while doing the labs themselves and the lab notes were oftentimes convoluted. Although physics lab is the shortest lab among the other science labs in Yale, 3 hours still seem too draining. Always consult whatever confusion you have in the lab with your TA or your professor. They were really helpful!",
    "I stand by my choice to take PHYS 205 because the lack of lab reports was really helpful. That being said, the three hours that you WILL spend in lab will be very difficult and may be pretty menial.Despite all of this, I did learn quite a lot of techniques and some labs benefitted my learning of other topics in the normal physics class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to take it if you are a Physics major.",
    "Most of you probably have to take this class. It's not too much work, and you do good experiments that you should have seen in higher level physics courses. There is some confusing statistics stuff which you'd be fine with especially if you took statistics but if not, you'd be okay too, it will just be harder.",
    "More direction-following than physics, but a solid introduction to the relevant physics instruments.",
    "Only take it if you need to. Many times, the labs go over the three hours required for the course. Grading was kind of ambiguous and I personally did not enjoy the lab itself-- they were long and tedious. It can be improved by providing clearer instructions of what we actually had to answer, as well as cutting down the length of the lab into something more manageable. Only good thing was that there's no lab reports... but the three hours of lab was something I did not look forward to every week.",
    "This lab was not very fun. No one in my section enjoyed it, including (from the looks of it) the professor and TA. Thankfully, there is little work outside of class. I felt that the time and energy that were often necessary to understand how to use some of the lab equipment detracted from my ability to understand the general concepts during certain weeks.",
    "I liked the fact that we didn't have to write lab reports. It was very straightforward most of the time, but I'd strongly suggest reading the lab handouts, they are helpful. The book, not so much.",
    "The answer to this question depends on your background. I did physics research in labs during summers, and was taking PHYS410 concurrently with this lab. So I didn't learn much physics in the lab. But someone who has less of a physics background might have. Discuss this with others you know who have similar backgrounds.",
    "Have to take it if you have to.",
    "I found to my pleasant surprise that I really enjoyed Physics 205. As labs go, it is a fairly low time commitment: half an hour reading through the lab before-hand and two hours homework for four weeks. Then 3 hours in the lab each week (+ time to get to science hill). And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. No lab write ups. No running overtime. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a bit of time built into the labs when you can experiment qualitatively: playing with magnets and spinning yourself around on a wheely chair holding a bicycle wheel, for instance.",
    "Good lab for pretty much any level of physics, I think. Maybe not 170. But you should be a good fit if you are in 180 or higher.",
    "Take it if you have to, or if you're interested in physics. It's not the best representation of a lab environment, but it gets the job done. Experiments are easy and straightforward.",
    "Take the lab, it's fun but the long hours can be a pain.",
    "There are no lab reports; you simply turn in your notebook at the end of each session. Expect to spend 3-3.5 hours in the lab each time and that is it for the week.",
    "We learned some useful skills: error analysis (especially error propagation), some basic statistics, and some advanced functions of excel. On a positive note, very little out-of-class preparation was required: there were no lab reports and just a final at the end. We had a little bit of homework out of a textbook in the first three labs, and after that just had to take a brief quiz on classes v2 that made sure we'd read the lab beforehand. Unfortunately, the actual class time was uncomfortable and needlessly stressful. There was a strict 3-hour limit on every lab, even though it the labs themselves were generally very long. It was difficult to give concepts in-depth thought when we were sprinting through the whole three hours.It was okay. Probably don't take it unless you need a physics lab. If you're debating between this and 165L, this was less work and less boring but more stressful and more harshly graded, based on what I've heard from friends in 165L.",
    "Yes. Its better than 165L because you do not have to write lab reports.",
    "If you are required to take it, take it, but do not expect to necessarily enjoy your weekly three hours in the lab. Prepare really well each week and you may be able to finish, but count on rushing around and furiously scribbling. However, there is little work outside of class, which is nice.",
    "I would recommend this course to physics majors and also for pre-med students. Although the lab was not always exciting, I feel like error analysis is not something to be glossed over.",
    "Phys 205L was a basic introduction to error analysis via physical concepts. The emphasis was spent on determining systematic and statistical error sources as well as calculating error propagation. Sometimes this was simple and other times it got really ugly. The good thing is that there was no work outside of labs which usually took the entire time. The teachers told us that none of the work mattered until the final practicum which was our whole grade so its a toss up. As a whole its not too bad especially if you get an easy practicum I would recommend it over 165L because its no work outside of lab and you dont need to take many in-class notes.",
    "A good introduction to physics lab techniques. You end up learning how to use an oscilloscope really well by the end, as well as some basic circuits. You get to play with tabletop gyroscopes, and I found many labs \"fun\" or \"cool.\" The annoying part is the lack of organization and the sometimes confusing and outdated lab sheets, which is where most information on the labs comes from. You are required to write up the entire report in class, which makes the 3 hour period sometimes stressful. I've heard it is much better than 185L.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 205L to another student whether they are interested in science or not, because it truly is a very interesting course.",
    "The class itself can be very taxing as you are expected to complete the entire lab report in class. However, a lot is learned by the end of the semester. Take it.",
    "A necessary course for engineering majors, it could really use some work.",
    "Physics 205L is an introduction to physics lab that would be a lot easier with prior physics knowledge. The amount of time you have for each in-class experiment is usually not enough, so each class was a stressful race against the clock. There is a huge stress on error propagation, so stats experience is a plus.",
    "A good lab class. Involved adequate amounts of time and work but it was manageable.",
    "Great hands on course to satisfy a physics lab requirement.y",
    "If you don't have to take it, then don't. I say this because I didn't actually learn that much from the lab, and there is way overemphasis on \"error analysis\" and other stuff that isn't really that related to physics. The concepts are pretty easy, but getting a good grade is not, which is why I don't really recommend this lab.",
    "The ONLY plus side is that you don't have lab reports, meaning you only have to think about this godforsaken lab once a week. Don't take unless absolutely necessary.",
    "It's not necessarily a lot of work, but the grading is so arbitrary. It depends a lot on if you have a good TA. Some of the labs get really tedious."
