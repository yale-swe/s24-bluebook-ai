   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the period, this course will give you a great overview perspective of the many reformations taking place from 1450-1650. Lectures are generally high-quality, though some of Professor Leaman's lectures were disjointed. The class could have been much better if the discussion section were more about discussion and less about reading reviews, but that really depends on the particular Teaching Fellow for the course.",
    "a fine class, but not great",
    "A little challenging at times, definitely not as easy as previous reviews have described. But as long as you go to lectures and study hard for the exams, shouldn't be too much work (especially because the paper offers a relatively easy A\/A-).",
    "A great course for anyone interested in theology, intellectual thought in early modern Europe or the impact of religion. The professors and teaching fellows are all very knowledgeable and dedicated to making the course enjoyable and intelligible. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "The class is pretty repetitive and there's a ton of reading. Professor Eire is great but I was disappointed with Prof Leaman. I wish Eire had taught the whole class",
    "Yes, definitely recommend it.",
    "An interesting and fun class for a history major. Lots of reading assigned but a small percentage of it is actually necessary. Professor Eire's lectures are wonderful, while Professor Leaman's are not worth attending.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class, as I learned a lot; it is interesting from both religious and historical perspectives. However, I would also say to study hard for the midterm and final due to the time constraints and keep up to date on the general readings and trajectory of the class.",
    "Reformation Europe is a great, informational class that is almost like reading a story about an incredibly fascinating part of history. The professors tell stories and tell about the history in a very interesting and engaging way. The 10-page paper is very doable, along with the 1-hour midterm and 1-hour final that is only focused on the second half of the class. I would recommend the class to any history buff, who wants to learn more about a very interesting part of history.",
    "Note, It's Reformations, not The Reformation. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that sometimes it can seem it is only interested in the absurd and the \"entertaining\" in religion. For someone who is a lover of Christianity and the faith it can come off a bit in bad taste. The bad has a way of being more interesting, a fixation with this can lead to missing out on real, great and glorious truth out of what some would call a \"carnal interest in religion.\" There is a sobriety of mind that is requisite in handling some things and I feel like it was lacking in the course so that sometimes I felt like I was playing marbles with diamonds. So it can subtly drive away serious inquirers by highlighting only the ugly in Christianity a lot of which is in false Christianity.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The lectures are enjoyable, and I learned a lot."
