    "I would recommend the class to another student, but with the caveat that L1 and L2 were probably slightly better, and you felt yourself improve more then than you will now. You still definitely get better, and learning the future tense helps, but the class is a bit less structured and a bit more disjointed in L3.",

    "great class, if you do the work you can get a good grade, be careful with the vowels, very enjoyable",
    "You learn the future tense. Shiri is nice but disorganized (I rarely knew what was expected of us). The workload is gratuitous -- the most I've ever had for a 1-credit course.",
    "I would recommend this course, it was a great way to learn the language effectively"
