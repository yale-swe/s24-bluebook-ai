   "comments": [
    "A careful overview of Quantum Mechanics from a theorists' perspective. Would definitely recommend to a student interested in theory, but may be too in-depth for an experimentalist.",
    "This is a standard graduate course that only graduate students and senior undergraduate students would take.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would only recommend the course to another student who has had a very strong background in quantum mechanics.",
    "Excellent, but depends on who is teaching. Goldberger taught an excellent class.",
    "Quantum mechanics from scratch.",
    "PHYS 508 is a very well-organized presentation of a standard first semester of graduate quantum mechanics. You will cover the first three chapters of Sakurai, including an in-depth discussion of quantum mechanical angular momentum. Interesting (and necessary!) for graduate students and a well-motivated challenge for undergraduates.",
    "PHYS 508 is a course on the foundations of quantum mechanics, going into the mathematical underpinnings of elementary, non-relativistic quantum mechanics. I highly recommend the class to anyone how wants a deep understanding on what makes quantum mechanics what it is.",
    "This was a good review and expansion on an undergraduate QM class.",
    "The course is designed to be a review of undergraduate quantum mechanics, so it does not translate well to students who do not have a strong background in quantum. Make sure to review undergraduate material before taking this course to avoid being swept away with the speed of the lectures.",
    "This course is much more group theoretical than the undergraduate version of quantum mechanics. There is not as much of an emphasis on calculating experimental quantities through the use of perturbation theory. It is a fascinating introduction to someone who wishes to become comfortable with the mathematics of quantum mechanics.",
    "508 is the first semester of Graduate Level Quantum Mechanics. For people with strong linear algebra backgrounds it is accessible and rewarding.",
    "The course is challenging but in the end you learn a lot of quantum mechanics, providing a good foundation for QM 2. I would recommend to another physics student.",
    "It is a good class. I would recommend it.",
    "Very good and interesting class. Does require time to go over the lecture notes and answer problem sets.",
    "It is a review of undergraduate quantum mechanics with slightly more in depth discussions and hard calculations. Recommend for the problems you wouldn't do but helpful to better understand the details of the theory.",
    "Yes I would recommend taking it even if you feel you already know the material. This class was a good review."

   "comments": [
    "Gave theoretical understanding of quantum optics to be used in future work.",
    "It gave me a new perspective on fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics.",
    "This course really improved my understanding of quantum mechanics.",
    "It gave me the fundamentals to understand some quantum information research.",
    "I learned a lot more quantum, more in depth compared to my undergrad preparation. My undergrad quantum did not emphasize Dirac formalism.",
    "I learned quite a lot from this course. It is required for my graduate degree.",
    "This course was very helpful in getting a deeper understanding of the material, and the materials covered are crusial for other courses and research.",
    "I better understand quantum angular momentum addition and spin in general. It was lacking in philosophical aspect of QM.",
    "My research is in quantum information so reviewing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics was important."
