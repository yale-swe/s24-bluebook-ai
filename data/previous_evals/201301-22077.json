    "Hindi 120 is a great language class. The workload is very manageable, class is fun, and you end up achieving quite a bit!",
    "Hindi 120 is a fun but challenging language class. You will not only the Hindi language, but about India in general. There are weekly quizzes which are challenging, but it is a worthwhile effort, and you will come away with much more than an academic knowledge of Hindi!",
    "Fun, especially if learning Hindi has extra significance for you",
    "I would highly, highly recommend Hindi to fellow students. It's even more fun than Hindi L1, because you are able to do much more now. I really liked that exams were projects rather than tests, and I even enjoyed the oral evaluation, which is an un-intimidating 30 minute conversation. By the end, you can watch Bollywood movies and know when the subtitles are inaccurate."
