   "comments": [
    "As an architecture student, I wanted to develop an understanding of current research about sustainability and urbanization. I definitely gained that knowledge. While the course curriculum is not focused at the scale of individual works of architecture, I developed skills to find, understand, and analyze scientific literature and apply to it architectural practice. I feel that I now have insights about how an individual building is connected to a network of urban and global systems.",
    "The skill of synthesizing complex information was the most important skill I gained.",
    "I learned a lot about urbanization and all of the ways that the natural world interacts with the urban environment and vice versa. Gained a lot more knowledge on frameworks, global viewpoints, scale, and many other concepts that helped me understand the science better as well.",
    "learned more about land use change",
    "I learned how to ask better questions and make connections between themes, patterns, and analyses of scientific literature. While I do not believe I completely understand what a synthesis is, I believe that I was able to be a become a better writer and learn more about how to properly assess different viewpoints when it comes to topics in urbanization science.",
    "I learned a lot about both the material and the process of conveying material towards a particular end. The course provides a top-notch overview of the state of the field of urban science, as well as gleans trends for where it may go in the future. Karen has an amazing way of distilling this information, and empowering students to be a part of the definition of future trajectories. The synthesis and assessment element of the course was incredibly valuable. Nowhere else have I gotten such a clear framework for disseminating information and creating novel ideas to push inquiry further.",
    "A good understanding of urbanization and its relationship to various environmental challenges across many sectors.",
    "Comprehensive understanding of global urbanization science. Rigorous practice in reading scientific literature and practice synthesizing literature.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the field of urbanization. The course was primarily geared towards synthesis of the various aspects of the current literature in the field and possible communication of this to stakeholders.",
    "This course not only introduces students to the major scientific topics related to urbanization and environmental change, but operates like a professionalization boot camp (in a good way). Students learn how to present their ideas in concise, scientifically rigorous ways that will give them the tools for engaging the science. Then, based on that knowledge, they learn to synthesize the science in ways that will engage the policy makers who control the structures that will enable positive change.",
    "Synthesize and assess the literature.",
    "Really helped develop a great base of knowledge about the research on urbanization! Karen is an amazing resource.",
    "I became better at reading, analyzing, and synthesizing scientific literature.",
    "How to understand scientific literature and develop syntheses for it."

   "comments": [
    "It aligned with my expectations. I didn't have very much experience with the format of our assignments, so they were different than my expectations.",
    "I expected to be challenged and to learn a lot, which did end up being the case.",
    "exactly aligned",
    "It aligned well - there were high expectations, but this in turn made the class engaging and allowed for great discussion throughout the semester.",
    "They aligned well. Karen is the top of the field, and her teaching style matched. The lessons from the synthesis and assessment exercises will continue to inform my future work. Though I feel like I personally have much more I can do in this space, the practice and the knowledge of the S&A structure was invaluable. One of the more difficult parts of the course was crossing scales between global and local trends and impacts. Reconciling these scalar issues is something of particular interest to me, so I am grateful that the course engaged with this.",
    "Met my expectations.",
    "Very well",
    "I was primarily interested in the material itself as opposed to the means and methods of communicating it to stakeholders. While I believe that is a hugely beneficial aspect for those that will be pursuing policy careers, for someone who was simply curious about the material it may not have been the best fit.",
    "I did not expect the course to have such a professionalization component, but it turned out to be very positive. I expected to engage in a bit more debate about the content of the scientific articles assigned for each week, but instead we mostly took the findings at face value and then sought to distill them intro meaningful syntheses. This was very interesting and useful, but I did wonder sometimes how one might learn to evaluate the findings which are reported in the articles we read.",
    "Very well.",
    "The knowledge met my expectations (and may have even exceeded them). The workload was excessive though.",
    "This class was slightly different from my expectations. The weekly syntheses were more focused on developing novel frameworks than developing a deep understanding of the science.",
    "It was a much more intense class than anticipated and I learned a great deal."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course is very strong. One week we had a slightly different S&A assignment, and I thought it was a useful change of pace. I think once students start to develop S&A skills, the course could benefit from more variety in the assignments: in some weeks the assignment may be more closely aligned to a student's area of study and in other weeks the student is challenged to work in a way that's very different than their field of study.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, interesting material, challenging tasks Weaknesses: I would have preferred to have more time dedicated to lectures and less on group activities and presentations. Some of the feedback I received on my syntheses was not very clear and lacked clear guidance on how to improve.",
    "The strengths are the protocols and the lectures from Karen. I also did enjoy the research and writing of the outreach piece. While many of the articles we read were interesting, I thought that writing a synthesis each week was over the top. I never really knew if I was doing them write and we did not receive feedback or grades on them after about the fifth week, so I ended up purposefully not following the original directions and taking my own route because I was so tired of writing them without a clear direction. I think we should be writing far fewer a semester. In addition, while I enjoyed the class discussions, I would have preferred much more lecture from Karen. I took the class to get her knowledge, but thought we didn't have as much as I would have expected. I wanted to hear and learn more from her. Finally, for the final project, I thought the submission of things (AKA the background research paper that we had little to no guidance on) due right before Thanksgiving was a challenging time for something to be due, and the extension that wasn't really an extension unhelpful. I thought the research assignments were not helpful at all and especially doing them on top of a synthesis was insane.",
    "I wish we had gotten more feedback on our assignments; we put a lot of work into churning out syntheses every week and I didn't learn if I was improving",
    "The beginning of the course was very unclear. It was hard for students to grasp how to write papers and while many of us attended the lecture Bhartendu put on at the beginning of the semester, the advice given did not seem to translate well when writing our syntheses. Going through a potential synthesis and pointing out why it is successful may be a great way to make the process less overwhelming. The protocols that invited student collaboration and discussion were incredibly helpful! The class could be organized such that protocols happened first, followed by students writing their syntheses. Additionally, the Bhartendu and Karen were not always on the same page, as to what was to be expected. This made the course a bit confusing at times and made many students feel unsure of how to write or proceed with assignments.",
    "Strength comes from Karen's material and teaching style. When in the classroom I felt the support to explore new topics and the expectation to perform well simultaneously. It offers a great opportunity to test and practice approaches necessary for creating fruitful working relationships. Weaknesses are the lack of timely written feedback about our writing, and specific tips on how to improve on some of the common trappings related to the unfamiliar elements of the S&A. This was a big drawback. Karen and Bhartendu making themselves available was helpful and so much appreciated, but specific and clear written feedback would have been more direct for content or writing style.",
    "More feedback on the S&As from Professor Seto would be helpful. Also, a greater focus on solutions and weighing tradeoffs to develop sound, science-based policy would be helpful.",
    "Strong course content and in class protocols\/discussions. Did not receive feedback on 2\/3 of the written work, which inhibited student ability to improve on S&As.",
    "The material is incredible fascinating, and the experiences and expertise of the professor are second to none. The goal of creating a weekly synthesis of the material was somewhat vague and subjective, whereas there were no clear metrics to inform what the intended goal was and how it would be scored accordingly. As well the pace of a weekly synthesis in conjunction with the work was not readily feasible with an existing course load.",
    "The strengths: The passionate engagement of the instructor. The sense that the topic under study was truly important to the world we live in. The broad coverage of important science on urbanization and global environmental change. The many opportunities to engage with other students in the class. The high energy of the classroom. The numerous activities and approaches to sharing and distilling knowledge. The weakness: Sometimes the emphasis on efficiency and speed seemed to come at the expense of deeper discussion about some of the topics raised in the articles. Trying to solve issues of global warming in 10 minute blocks was occasionally a bit superficial. However, even these moments were inspiring in the way that they showed how much could be accomplished in a short amount of time.",
    "Everything is great!",
    "Strengths -- develop good base of knowledge on urbanization research. Learn about synthesis and how to take masses of urbanization research in a policy world. Weaknesses -- the brutal grades at the beginning really served as a distraction, not an asset. People were already taking the class very seriously, but I felt that the threat of failure caused more people to worry about what Karen wanted, rather than really developing their syntheses. I also believe one synthesis each week may have been too much (as some people had to spend 10-20 hrs per assignment at the beginning).",
    "The weekly syntheses are useful exercises, but there were diminishing returns over the course of the semester. It felt as though it was more important to develop novel frameworks than it was to truly understand the science. Also, we did not receive enough feedback to make improvements. The first few weeks, assignment grades averaged around an F. Then, we stopped receiving grades, but continued submitting assignments every week. This put a lot of stress on students who had no idea how they were doing in a course with very high expectations. It made it difficult to understand whether we were improving and we were not really sure what the professor was looking for.",
    "Strengths: A lot of information covered and understood across the semester. Class protocols were very helpful. Weaknesses: Very little feedback on how to improve."

    "It's a big time commitment, especially if you don't have past experience with scientific literature or scientific writing. But, as someone who lacked those skills, it was rewarding to develop them.",
    "It is important to know that this class requires a significantly larger time commitment than an average FES class.",
    "This class is interesting and you will learn a lot but it will also kick your butt and make you complain a lot and often.",
    "go in for office hours for s&a help early on",
    "Be creative. Karen appreciates thought put into assignments, but also is happy when that thought manifests itself into something that is digestible by all audiences. Be ready for the amount of work and try to do the reading earlier in the week, so as to avoid a frenzy when writing the synthesis.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Be sure to take this class only when it can be a priority. You have to have the time and headspace to work on it for an hour to two hours everyday without failparticularly if you are a slow reader and can tend towards picking through the weeds. If you do not do this you will struggle and not get enough out of the class--and perhaps embarrass yourself in front of a very important person in the field of urban science. Remember to always focus on one of the key points of the courseto make urban science clear and deployable.",
    "Try not to get discouraged during those first few weeks.",
    "this is a time and reading\/writing-intensive course - but well worth it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the policy aspects of how to communicate urbanization to stakeholders. Audit if you are interested in the course material.",
    "You will enter a high energy environment led by an enthusiastic and highly motivated professor who will inspire enthusiasm in you and your fellow classmates. You will work hard, and so will your classmates, and along the way you will learn a great deal and fell motivated to solve some of the most pressing issues associated with urbanization in today's world. You will feel like you were part of something important!",
    "Be prepared to learn a lot",
    "Take this class with a low course load.",
    "This course requires much more work than the average class at F&ES. Take this course in a semester during which you have ample time.",
    "This class is more like a 5 credit class than a 3 credit class and it will consume much more of your time than any other FES classes. If you are aware of that from the outset, it is much more palatable. This class was very stimulating and one of the more intellectually rigorous classes I have taken at FES."
