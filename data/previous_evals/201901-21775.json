    "I have acquired familiarity with various important texts from the discipline which frame some main concepts and thresholds of thought which Anthropology engages with. The course enriched my understanding of contemporary issues and challenged to think about my own research in new ways.",
    "This course was an exploration of the recent \/ contemporary history of the development of the discipline of anthropology, and of social theory. It examined colonialism, nationalism, and globalisation among other important theories in anthropology (such as agency). Consequently, I learnt about the critical history of our discipline through close readings of important representative texts in the discipline."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor's lectures and comments were the most enriching parts of the course. The classmates contributions also provoked making new connections and coming up with new ideas.",
    "Strengths: - Very well-defined syllabus - Seminar discussions anchored by a wholesome lecture that went above and beyond the text - Review of development of critical social theory in these lectures - Well-spaced out and thought-provoking assignments - Detailed, meticulous and, really, inspiring feedback from the instructor Weakness: - the reading load for one or two sessions towards the end of the semester was particularly heavy, and so hard to adequately achieve given the timing of those classes in context of other obligations in the semester. Consequently, my individual reading of these few texts were hurried, and not as satisfying as I would have wanted them to be."

    "I would strongly recommend this course to all socio-cultural anthropology students (it is of course, mandatory). It is a loss, however, for those in other departments\/programs who would be interested but cannot register."
