    "The syllabus gives out topics covered and required readings - if those interest you, then this may be a good class for you.",
    "Interesting course, not too much work. Recommended",
    "Aaaabsolutely! very relevant and necessary class to understand development economics. The strengths of the class definitely lie in the hands of Professor Udry, an amazing Professor and mentor to anyone who asks him. The material covered a broad range of topics and empirical methods in the field. The class notes were pretty comprehensive and covered a lot of important papers. This class will make you a more aware person and will make you so grateful to be where you are. DO THIS INSTEAD OF INTRO TO CORPORATE FINANCE!!!! (i'm going to finance but still Also, this class is NOT a gut. I repeat, it is NOT a gut. Be ready to put in the work, but it will be so worth it.",
    "Great intro to development economics with a great professor! The economic models you'll learn are all pretty easy (even if you only have an intro econ background), but it's nice to cover all of the big topics in the field and to read classic papers on all of them. One midterm, one final, and 6 problem sets. Very manageable and overall absolutely recommend. Also, if you've taken glbl 225, lots of overlap.",
    "Take it!",
    "Chris' lecture is amazing. If you are interest in development... What are you waiting for? Take it! Take it! Just be sure to have taken intermediate micro and econometrics. Although you could do well without taking them, I think you'll take the best of this class if you've already got the basics. Beware, you are going to talk about Africa a lot (also about Latin America and some Asian countries).",
    "ECON 325 was a solid econ class. Udry was a great professor who was refreshingly passionate about the material he was teaching. Some of the Stata on the psets was a little tough though despite having taken metrics last semester.",
    "Take it",
    "I enjoyed this class! Professor Udry is a good lecturer, and the class covers most of the major debates in development economics right now. I really liked the problem sets for this class: they got me to be way better at using STATA and doing actual analysis of datasets.",
    "Yes, great class. Professor Udry was wonderful. The psets were a little tricker and require a strong STATA background.",
    "I took Intro Micro with Professor Udry, and thought it to be a so-so experience, but I enjoyed this class with him much more. This is Professor Udry's life's passion, and it clearly shows in the way he engages with the material. The questions we tackled about the gender gap, education, health in developing nations, and the impact of Internet and communications technologies were stimulating and thought-provoking. I loved digging into each topic and unearthing the persistent causes behind poverty through the empirical studies we learned about. The actual economic models of the class were more difficult to grasp, and a less enjoyable experience to learn about. I also have mixed feelings about the problem sets (there were a total of 6 over the course of the semester) which asked us to analyze and manipulate datasets using Stata. It was valuable and interesting to work with real data that really mattered, but lack of Stata knowledge about which commands to use inhibited my learning and enjoyment. Having clearer Stata instructions within the actual problem set questions while asking us to draw our own inferences would have been helpful.",
    "A good, succinct coverage of basic development economics. It's rooted equally in theory and empirical work. Not a gut at all! Take if you want to be inspired to change the world :)",
    "I honestly expected more from this class. Professor Udry is very nice, but I still found the class boring and had to try very hard to focus.",
    "A great course on one of the most interesting and globally relevant fields of economics. You see a lot of the different facets of the field of economics (data analysis, literature and models). In my opinion, this should be the first elective that an Econ major takes",
    "Definitely one of the best Econ classes I've taken here, due to the combination of Udry's incredibly clear lecturing and TA Jakob's clear explanations in section. Very interesting material if you're interested in development economics - one of the few offered at Yale and more quantitative\/substantive than Karlan's class. The reading is light (lots of cool development econ papers) and the problem sets are really interesting to do, though they do require a knowledge of Stata. We cover several models in class, but a lot of the class is very qualitative. Take it!",
    "This is a really interesting class, with good readings and engaging presentations by the professor. I wasn't bored for a single class. I found the problem sets to be really long and quite hard, occasionally because the instructions were a bit unclear and I had to spend time searching for what data set to use and stuff like that. The exams were difficult but fair and nicely curved. The professor really is passionate about the subject and cares to make you interested in the field also.",
    "I really didn't like this class. I was expecting an engaging, integrated approach on development through news articles and an economic lens - but I really didn't get that. What I got was a class whose focus was data analysis and experiment projection, which seems to be meant to push us into \"on-site\" field development economists, which is fine - but I wanted to get a better idea and understanding of the developing world - which I did not.",
    "ECON 325 is probably the best Economics class I have ever taken at Yale. I did not realize this at the time because I was too busy studying, rushing to interviews, and being stressed, but this class really changed how I view both Economics and Developing Economies. This class is the perfect blend between theory and practice: each topic, you review the basics of the economic model, and then discuss relevant case studies\/papers\/examples that either support or dispute the theories. Beware of the problem sets: they are hard, cannot be started the night before, and you will fail miserably if you try to do them on your own. Find a reliable group of 3-4 people with whom you can work on the problem sets, and start them early! Also, do the readings: you cannot BS in this class, and there will be very specific questions on the readings in the Midterm and Final. Although you will discuss them in class, this is not enough -- Professor Udry is really trying to assess who is paying attention and putting in effort in the class. Midterm and Final are tricky\/hard, but as long as you put in the effort you should be fine. GO TO CLASS. Yes, it's a 9 a.m. lecture. Yes, you're probably a junior with a million internship interviews and other work to catch on. Yes, he posts the lecture slides on classesV2. But if you don't go to lecture, you will be missing out on the opportunity of listening to one of the leaders in the field of Development Economics break down important concepts and teach you them. Professor Udry is magnificent, and he deserves the respect of you attending his lecture. Also, take this instead of Corporate Finance. This class will teach you how to approach problems, build models and think outside the box. As someone who will be going into finance, I am glad I took this class. It will teach you things that otherwise you would not learn\/study\/be interested in. Trust me, this class will change the way you approach Economics.",
    "If you are interested in this subject, I really do recommend taking this course. Professor Udry is an inspiration, and it does give you an easy to understand economic framework for seeing how the poor make decisions in developing countries. Make sure to brush up on your Stata before taking, even if you're just coming in from ECON 131, because this class heavily utilizes that program in problem sets! Make sure you have worked with real data--this class relies on experiential learning to a large extent.",
    "I would recommend the class. The class teaches both quantitative and qualitative skills as well as providing perspective on the current economic situations of the world. Professor Udry especially puts a focus on empirical research to support qualitative claims so the course provides a solid foundation for econometric research and interpreting\/criticizing economic papers. The class was especially eye-opening in its focus on poor and developing countries. This is an awareness every Yalie should have before they graduate regardless of their profession.",
    "I would highly recommend the class and would even suggest it be taught at the graduate level due to the complexity of the topics discussed and the analytical methods used for problem sets. It dovetailed nicely with my previous coursework in statistics and global affairs.",
    "Wonderful class, very relevant and cutting-edge material, useful and purposeful assignments. Where else you would have the chance to take a class with such a knowledgeable and amazing instructor like Chris Udry? A must take for those interested in development work.",
    "I would! Take it since it's one of the better econ classes. Not to mention, development is quite fascinating. The stata and some of the psets were quite rough, but Udry really makes you take on the role of a researcher. It is some work, but quite worth it!",
    "I really liked the course. Professor Udry goes over the topics in detail."
