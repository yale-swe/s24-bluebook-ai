    "elementary Italian -- far more than I ever would have expected!",
    "This class greatly advanced my Italian abilities. I primarily learned how to read, write, and speak Italian, but I also engaged with Italian culture and lifestyles. Intensive Italian is incredible if you wish to truly advance your language skills.",
    "Over the course of the semester, I got fairly comfortable with Italian",
    "I have become totally conversational in Italian after knowing only a few phrases coming in to the course. Prof. Farina went over almost every type of conjugation and our daily assessment of vocabulary was so helpful in retaining information.",
    "I learned basic Italian grammar and vocab in order to achieve an intermediate level of speaking, reading, and writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- very engaging, fun and active class. I really enjoyed the session every day and felt like I learned so much Weaknesses -- quizzes every day that I don't think the Professor graded or looked at",
    "The strengths of this class are the intimate nature and Michael. By meeting every day for two hours, you become very close with the classmates. I truly made some great friends in this class, and we would all meet up and speak in Italian together. Also, Michael made this class bearable. Given that meeting every day for two hours is daunting, Michael did his best to make class enjoyable. It could be improved by better grade transparency. We rarely received grades back, often well after the original due date. However, Michael was extremely helpful and willing to work with you if you reached out in advance.",
    "The course is great and has clearly been well-developed over a long period of time. I think there are no real weaknesses to it",
    "This is a great course!! If anything, incorporating more conversation elements or oral presentations to help students sharpen speaking skills",
    "The strengths were that material was presented in a very comprehensible fashion and there was sufficient time to review grammar concepts in class. One weakness of the course was that's the size of the class limited the amount of practice woth speaking that students could have."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class if you really want to learn italian",
    "Would highly reccomend if you want to learn Italian very quickly",
    "I would recommend this course, but with reservations. Would I recommend this to shortcut the language requirement? No. Just take L1 and L2 separately it will be longer, but it will be much easier. However, if you need the two credits, or if you are already fluent in a romance language, then definitely take this class. The people that performed very well in this class were fluent in either French, Spanish, or Latin. If you knew one of these languages and want to add Italian to your repertoire, go for it. Also, only take this class with Michael. This class is A LOT of work, but Michael is so friendly and helpful. He will work with you to make sure you retain the material. There is a quiz every day (which is brutal), and a test every week (you cover one chapter a week). Grades are weird and basically non-existent, so be prepared for that. But overall, I would recommend this class to someone willing to put in the work. You will learn the language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Yes, intensive Italian is, well, intense, but the course is well-structured and well-taught. Michael is an incredible instructor and I am happy that he was the person I started learning Italian with he is incredibly thoughtful and was always willing to explain things many times over until all of us understood everything. If you are prepared to put in the work, this class will likely become one of your favorite courses at Yale.",
    "YES! Its such a great course! Even though you have to study every single day for the class (it was definitely a heavy workload) it was totally worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who's are willing to put a tremendous amount of time and work information learning Italian at an accelerated rate."
