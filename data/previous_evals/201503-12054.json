    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it, especially if it's taught by Prof. Schneider. The course is very well taught and organized and strikes a good balance between reviewing core concepts in grammar and working on reading, writing and speaking skills. The workload is a bit heavy, but manageable overall and the exams are fair. Prof Schneider created a wonderful atmosphere in the class and honestly I was a bit reluctant about taking French 150 at first (was also considering 140, as I wasn't sure of my level), but it ended up as my favorite class this semester!",
    "It's a lot of work, but it will definitely improve your French.",
    "I would recommend French 150 to anyone hoping to excel their French skills beyond a basic level of understanding, speaking and writing. The class is well-organized and well-executed; you will learn a LOT.",
    "Fren 150 is a good course to solidify whatever material was learned in Fren 130\/140 and there is a manageable workload.",
    "This class is great for solidifying French fluency and improving writing. Get Prof. Schneider -- she's no nonsense but a great teacher.",
    "This class is hard, so don't underestimate the workload. Make sure you have time to put a lot of work into the class. If you do, you will gain a lot."
