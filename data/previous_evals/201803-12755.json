    "in-depth look at current problems facing the environment around the world, liked how the class applied what we learned by looking at different studies",
    "The course title is pretty literal - an overview of watershed cycles and processes!",
    "I learned a lot about hydrology and biogeochemistry. I learned how water moves and how it moves nutrients, pollutants, and sediment. I also learned how to do many different types of calculations to represent physical processes related to water.",
    "-Hydrology -Calculations for groundwater analysis\/management -Management of Everglades, FL -The chemistry of managing water systems",
    "Basic processes. Understanding approaches and research methods and tools. Familiarity with the material to be built on moving forward.",
    "Watershed ecosystem processes and hydrology",
    "An understanding of the science behind the cycles and processes that inform watershed management. Different ways to measure and evaluate foundational things like discharge and residence time were described, as well as supported with specific cases.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the base of knowledge of the professors and the TA. Weaknesses: Following the explanation of equations on the white board during class was challenging. I had to go to office hours to refine my understanding of these explanations. Perhaps, going through sample equations in class that pertain to those in the problem sets would be helpful for future students.",
    "strengths: interesting that it was taught by two separate professors, gave the class a different approach than I'm used to",
    "I thought the co-teaching highlighted each of the professor's expertise. Overall, the course was solid. I thought a handful of lectures were dry and could be improved. in general, I thought case studies offer the best opportunity to deep dive into the topics.",
    "This course provides an extremely useful foundation for students interested in studying water. However, it was extremely challenging at times. Students were often expected to teach themselves how to apply mathematical concepts. This was difficult for many students, especially those without a strong background in the physical sciences. The homework assignments took much longer to complete than the assignments for any of my other classes. The class got better after the midterm and I really enjoyed the lectures covering the practical applications of what we learned. The lectures were also better when the professors did not rely too heavily on the slides. Powerpoints enabled the professors to move too quickly through the material and the whiteboard was generally a better platform.",
    "STRENGTH: The knowledgeable TA STRENGTH: The different expertise of the professors. They complimented each other well.",
    "Jim and Pete are a great team. Mario was really helpful. Good mix of in class material and outside of class homework. Encourage folks to go to TA for homeworks early!",
    "Good course overall",
    "Having the course be taught in tandem was informative at times, because having two professors allowed for different styles in teaching and subject expertise. Sometimes, there was a bit too much of a gap between lecture material and questions on the homework, which led to students feeling like they were spinning their wheels a bit on assignments. Overall, there was a high expectation of students to show up and do their work, which I appreciated.",
    "the course attempted to cover too much information at too high level of detail without sufficient time in class to learn about the material or the basic underlying principles necessary to understand or appreciate the detail"

    "If you have difficulty with math and science concepts, start the problem sets as early as possible. Attend office hours for help with the problem sets.",
    "It will help if you have some background in chemistry and are brushed up on math",
    "Take this course if you're interested in water resource management.",
    "If you are interested in studying water, you should definitely take this class. However, be prepared to put in a lot of work. Be careful to balance your courseload for the semester to ensure you have time to do the assignments and go to office hours. Find a study group early on and work with your classmates.",
    "-Go for office hours if you can",
    "Homework material is based on in class work but requires additional assistance, particularly if not that familiar in R or excel. Ask questions often and early if you have any! No comprehensive watershed computation, just background reading on it. Don't show up late.",
    "Good course",
    "Stay diligent on homework assignments and seek out help from professors and TA during office hours.",
    "you need to have a background in physics, calculus, and computer software for managing data"
