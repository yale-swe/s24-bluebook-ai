    "The seminar gave us a great look at new and emerging research in the field of EHS. I learned so much from seminar! It would have been nice to see a few more professionals in the field working rather than all researchers, but both are valuable of course.",
    "I think that there should be a larger variety of people that come in for seminar. It should not be solely people in academia, but people working in environmental health as well.",
    "Good",
    "informative",
    "Once again, the range and expertise of the speakers brought in was enjoyable and interesting. The room we're eating and presenting in now is good, though it seems rude to make the class after us wait week after week to get started on time.",
    "I enjoy EHS seminar greatly. I really appreciate the opportunity to hear from a variety of speakers in EHS to learn about the variety of topics in our department. However, Journal Club could have better structure.",
    "A diverse and interesting selection of speakers.",
    "The seminars were more likely to be focusing on toxicology or molecular biology, which is not the main interest for a M.P.H. student. Some topics are not suitable for EHS students."
