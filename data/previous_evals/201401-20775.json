    "I highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in contemporary novel. It has it all--great readings and a great professor.",
    "ENGL 401 (\"Coetzee\") is INCREDIBLE. Professor Neuman will tell you on the first day of class that J. M. Coetzee is arguably the most important living writer in the anglophone tradition, and by the end of the course he will PROVE to you that this is the truth. Coetzee's writing is gut-wrenching, at times unbelievably uncomfortable, thoroughly evocative, unforgettable, and ceaselessly innovative. I knew next to nothing about South Africa and its turbulent political history and knew only a little bit about apartheid going in to this course, but I'm walking away from it with a rich understanding, an understanding relayed to me by an expert on Coetzean literature (Neuman) and by a South African himself (Coetzee). You will come to see South Africa, apartheid, and post-apartheid in a way that transcends history--you will experience it with characters who are losing their minds out in the veld, who are dying of cancer, who are burrowing into the earth, who are trying to find an acceptable way to live... The readings you will experience in Coetzee are important, powerful, and timeless, and I promise you that you will be forever changed by the experience of reading the kind of literature that J. M. Coetzee writes. Even if you're not an English major, TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Neuman is a joy, passionate and indefatigable. You will learn to read like a champ, and you will gain an invaluable appreciation for the enigma that is J. M. Coetzee.",
    "Yes, whether you are taking it for fun or for your senior seminar requirement, it expose you to incredibly interesting ideas about how we should exist in a post-colonial world. Also, Professor Neuman is AWESOME! Be warned that the subject material is depressing and disturbing, but you will still learn a lot.",
    "Take this class! Coetzee (pronounced Cut-ZAY-uh) just might be the best living anglophone writer. Professor Neuman just might be the best seminar-leader in the English department. I took this class on a whim and it ended up being my favorite English class so far. The reading load is not that bad, especially since the books are so incredible. A novel a week, usually about 200 pages, and uniformly excellent, fascinating, different. Trust me, you want to read all of Coetzee's books in order with a superb professor. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I always learned more in the discussions than I was expecting to, and came out feeling refreshed and inspired. That being said, sometimes it was hard to pin down exactly what we were discussing.",
    "Close reading of many of Coetzee's works with an eye towards the themes that pervade them all. I would easily recommend it to another student! Do not miss this course.",
    "This course covers nearly all the works of J.M. Coetzee, a present-day South African writer. You read one of his novels (which are very short) each week and then discuss it in class. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student - I had never heard of Coetzee before this course, but his work is so relevant to present-day South Africa, and touches on important issues of race, gender, class, etc. It was a very interesting, worthwhile course.",
    "Yes! Take it, although this is not for the faint of heart.",
    "ENGL 401 is a seminar on the works of J.M. Coetzee, and it is an awesome class. You read one short, fascinating novel a week, and there is a weekly 2-hour (I think?) seminar. 2 papers, one short and one long, on anything you'd like. The structure is relaxed, the discussion is fascinating, and the works will make you think about literature and the study of literature in a new way. Take it!"
