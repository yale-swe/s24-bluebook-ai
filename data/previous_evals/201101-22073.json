   "comments": [
    "Great introductory class to the history of astronomy.",
    "It is tough...don't be fooled by the syllabus. Unless you enjoy doing problem sets for multiple hours each week, DO NOT take this course.",
    "Astro is okay for a gut science. The psets take longer than you think they will, though, and can be really frustrating. Whether or not you should take it depends on how desperate you are not to take other sciences.",
    "ASTR 135 was a good way to get another science credit. It wasn't too difficult, even though sometimes the problem sets were hard. The grading fluctuated between harsh and generous, seemingly at random sometimes. The exams weren't too bad, and the final paper was fun. Section was optional, but I recommend going.",
    "Archeoastronomy sucks. NOT an easy Science\/QR credit. Tech World is MUCH more fun and much easier. This class has required lecture attendance\/readings (one or the other) in order to understand the material (and you almost need to do both in order to do well), weekly relatively difficult problem sets, two relatively hard tests AND a final (6-8 page) research paper, all in all a LOT of boring work just for a distribution credit. Don't take it. Looks cool but its NOT.",
    "I do not recommend this to another student and suggest taking another Sc credit.",
    "If you need a science credit and want to be able to make small talk about the stars at night then take this class. The first half of ASTR135 gives you plenty to talk about when your stargazing; now I can talk about how the stars, planets, moon\/sun and other celestial objects move in the sky. However, the second half concerning ancient culture and astronomy can be incredibly boring though... you are warned.",
    "I took this class because I needed a science credit, but I ended up really enjoying it. It provides a cool perspective on astronomy which allows one to understand the basic fundamentals of observations in the sky. I also really liked how it allowed for a historical and cross cultural analysis. It's not an extremely challenging course, but that said there is a decent amount of work one needs to do in order to do well.",
    "I took this course out of interest since I already had my science credit- looking back it is great if you want to get your SC out of the way since it is accessible for non science majors, but if you are looking for a course with good history or science this one does not quite measure up. The science work is good practice but is very basic as is the history.",
    "Only take it if you can't find a better sc for non science majors.",
    "There are much better science classes, though this one is by no means hard.",
    "Wouldn't recommend it unless you need a science credit.",
    "i would recommend this course if you need a science credit and are really scared of science. although there is more science involved than the professor initially tell you there will be, it is only for half of the semester.",
    "No, you don't learn anything. Completely useless. Boring.",
    "Take this class! It's really fun, and I really enjoyed it. Start your problem sets early because they will take longer than you expected. I thought it was very interesting. This is not a history course. It is a science credit. The first part of the semester is all about how the stars go around the celestial sphere and the azimuths and stuff like that, which is actually pretty complicated, but as far as science credits go, this one was pretty easy. You do learn a lot though. And go to lectures because they're really helpful.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, you spend the semester learning about astronomy before the telescope which is pretty much completely irrelavant to anything today. It's more of a history class, if that's what you're into.",
    "If you're looking for an easy science don't take this class, as the problem sets really take a long time and the tests are not easy. You do learn some cool stuff about observing the sky but a lot of the cultural info is tedious.",
    "i wouldnt recommend it, if you know science at all",
    "Definitely not worth taking. Way too much work. Pset each week (takes around 4 hours each) and the material sucks. Find another science credit.",
    "The course is divided into two main parts: the first half of the class deals with naked eye astronomy and understanding the stars. The second half basically just talks about a variety of cultures and how they related to the sky. I found the first much more interesting and was enthralled by the course up until the first midterm. After that, I found myself not caring as much about the content because I am not that interested in the anthropological aspects. That said, it's not like the work was incredibly difficult...",
    "I would recommend Astro 135 particularly for non-science majors looking to fulfill their Sc credit. The material is really interesting, and the classwork isn't overwhelming (problem sets, midterms, and a term paper). There are many resources to get help if you are struggling, and it's fun too.",
    "first half is learning how to think about naked-eye astronomy and second half is more of a historical class, so the two midterms are pretty different in terms of material. the problem sets take a while but it helps a lot to go to section, which is optional. i felt like i had to try to teach myself a lot of the material because the lecture slides weren't that informative. it's ok as a science credit, but there are probably more straightforward options too that involve less outside work. two midterms, weekly problem sets, and a final paper.",
    "This course is one of those courses that perplexes the mind; how could such interesting material be made into such a poor class? The readings add little to nothing to the minimal amount of material learned in lecture, and most of the material needed for exams can be learnt by simply doing the problem sets. To improve the class, perhaps more effort should be made to focus on the cultural developments behind scientific inquiry, and less on the difficult, arcane and purely useless science of old. Lectures are nefarious and very tedious. You will learn a lot of silly facts about ancient astronomy, but none of that will be particular awe-inspiring.",
    "If you are interested in learning about observational astronomy, various cultures and their ideas of the what the universe meant\/how it was structured--even when those methods or ideas are antiquated--then take it. Be warned: a lot of reading and confusing psets. Not really all that gutty.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS OMG",
    "Average course, you learn some cool stuff but the weekly problem sets are an absolute pain. Even working in a group of a few students expect to spend up to 4 or 5 hours each week on the problem sets. Tests are not too bad, and the final paper is a breeze. Overall I would avoid taking this course, even if you are looking for a science credit, I would suggest looking elsewhere first.",
    "I would recommend it to someone that wants a science credit without a lot of science (like bio, chem, physics) There is limited math in this class, so that makes it easier as well. You basically just need geometry and some trig. However, you have to be willing to do the work and attend lectures. You could probably skip some of the reading, but you have to be on top of the material in this class.",
    "I'd recommend it. More enjoyable, in my opinion, than other Sc credits like Tech World and An Issues Approach to Biology. But it helps if you already have a natural interest in astronomy and how different cultures have practiced astronomy.",
    "This class is not the gut you might expect. It's not hard enough to make you want to put work in, but too easy to let you slide by. The exams are really pretty hard, and the psets tend to be graded with a lot of nitpicking. It's neither history nor astronomy, so don't go into it thinking that it's one or the other. Overall, there are probably better science credits out there.",
    "It's a fun course, taught by a good professor. You cover everything from Stonehenge to the Mayan Long count. The first half is learning astronomy (but not hard astronomy) and the second half is more like a history course. Exams are very reasonable, homework only takes a few hours, and you have freedom with the paper topic.",
    "Listen to the evaluations from past years. Seriously. They meant it.",
    "...it would depend on the pros and cons. If you need a SC credit that has no final and doesn't require too much memorization, this is the way to go. If you don't like tedious weekly psets and tricky exams, no, no nonononono.",
    "If you're looking for a non-science science credit, I would say take it.",
    "It is one of the least painful ways to get a science credit. If you actually go to and pay attention in the lectures, it can be interesting too.",
    "This class appeared at first to be an interesting, anthropologically oriented science credit. It manifested itself to be a petty introduction to a department with insecurities about pedagogical shortcomings.Never take this class. Your time would be better spent reading a book about the subject if it interests you, or taking another science credit if that is what you're looking for.",
    "i would recommend this course to anyone that needs a science credit or likes astronomy",
    "Pretty fun science credit. Not that mathy and not that hard. Still, study for the exams. Not a \"useful\" class, but lots of good dinner party\/stargazing practical knowledge",
    "A great introduction to basic naked eye astronomy and the history of astronomy. I'd definitely recommend this course. Great science credit with tangible benefits to every day life.",
    "You can probably guess from the reviews of this year and past years that you should not take this course. This applies to you even if you are very interested in ancient history or archeology as these aspects of the course are clearly secondary, especially during the first half.",
    "Take if you need a science credit, but be prepared to do, at least, some of the readings. The course can be very annoying.",
    "Nope.",
    "I would recommend this class for non science majors because it doesn't require that much prior knowledge. It would probably be a bore for people who have taken Astro classes before, however.",
    "This is really only worth taking if you enjoy or understand astronomy. It's not a gut science class, and if you are just trying to get a Sc credit out of the way, look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend Astronomy 135 because it really did change my perception of the sky. I feel I learned very practical information that I can apply in my future life, whether I do anything else with astronomy or not.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. not worth the science credit. mind-numbingly dumb.",
    "Interesting class but easy to be casual about it until the midterms. Was still very interesting once people caught on.",
    "No- get a science credit elsewhere. This is terrible.",
    "It's a relatively medium difficulty science credit. Not a gut though.",
    "I would not recommend this course to fellow students seeking Science credits. It's a lot of work -- weekly p sets, two exams, and a paper -- but the course is disorganized and I didn't come out of it feeling as though I had learned anything. Neither easy enough to be a gut nor interesting\/informative enough to be work the work. Take something else.",
    "The first half focuses on learning classical astronomy - how to describe the positions of celestial objects, periodic motions through the sky, conjunctions, and so forth - while the second half focuses on how various cultures, from the Greeks to the Maya, interpreted what they saw in the sky and incorporated it into their cosmologies, mythologies, religions and everyday lives.I would definitely recommend this course - IF you are willing to do your homework and IF you are interested in learning about the material. It's not a gut course (thank goodness!), but most of the work is conceptual. If you want to memorize numbers and facts, this is probably not the course for you, for it requires that you develop an understanding of celestial motions that can be applied universally.",
    "not as easy as you might think",
    "Tries to mix history\/culture with science and ends up being pointlessly hard. You don't learn much that's useful. i had a good tutor for the course, but other than that it wasn't a fun experience: problem sets are graded very harshly, tests (especially the first test) are dissimilar to problem sets, etc.",
    "It be a little underwhelming at times, but if you stay in top of the work and consistently attend lecture you'll find that it all makes sense.",
    "I would recommend this to students who don't mind really abstract and superficial concepts, instead of concrete math.",
    "It's fine at best if desperate for a science credit but definitely look elsewhere if you want something real engaging. At least I can look at the stars at night and know what I'm seeing though. I guess that's kinda cool",
    "Again, this is a TERRIBLE course. I would not recommend it to anyone",
    "If you are interested in astronomy, I would probably take one of the other courses. This one is tempting because it has little math, but the classical astronomy concepts are difficult. The tests are also hard and extremely random, but it is nice to have a paper without a final. Archaeoastronomy is interesting but doesn't seem to have much real life application.",
    "I would not recommend.",
    "Nice class. I learned a lot"
