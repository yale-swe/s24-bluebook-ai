   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to econ majors because it goes over material you won't learn in your intro\/ intermediate classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is pretty easy.",
    "I would recommend the class to people interested in Economics, but not sure if that is going to be their main focus.",
    "This is an interesting course if you are taking an economics\/political science track at Yale, which is quite common. If you have taken intermediate macro, this course is a breeze. The only parts of the course that are difficult for students are the growth model sections of the syllabus, but those are covered in much greater detail in intermediate macro.",
    "Yes! If you are a non-econ major and just want to learn some fundamentals of economics, intro micro is not the class for you THIS IS THE CLASS TO TAKE!!! You will get a broad overview of most important economic theories, but professor Debs teaches it in such an organized way that all lectures are connected and it does not feel rushed.If you are an econ major, you should also take it, you will be reading original texts as opposed to your everyday econ text books, and you will actually understand better\/clarify what you thought you knew.And if you are concerned about workload it is manageable, Readings are manageable(and interesting!), Discussion sheets are quite helpful and exams are doable."
