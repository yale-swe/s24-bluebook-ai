    "I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy to another student. DS Philosophy is the ideal intro survey of philosophy.The engaging seminar format, the high-quality lectures, and the Directed Studies community all help the breadth of information covered take hold. The course really whets your appetite for exploration of specific philosophers and branches of philosophy, and the material I've learned has helped shape the way I view and approach issues in real life. The course is a lot of work, but what you gain is well-worth it.",
    "One of my favorite DS classes so far, highly recommend.",
    "DS is a lot of work, but it's also worth it if you are like me who have a passion in humanities but are not sure which area of humanities you'd like to pursue.",
    "yes.",
    "Absolutely take this course -- a wonderful introduction to the likes of Descartes, Hume, Kant, and Nietzsche.",
    "Professor Della Rocca's DS Philosophy section is great! Professor Dellla Rocca is fantastic at summarizing each philosopher's argument and the class mostly consists in understanding the subtleties of each argument and discussing how each author's thought works. Professor Della Rocca is very open to class discussion and he is careful to give everyone in the section equal attention. This was a really enriching class!",
    "A wonderful introduction to western philosophy in a small section with access to great faculty and great discussions. I would definitely recommend it."
