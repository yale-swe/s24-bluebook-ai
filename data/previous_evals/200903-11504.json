   "comments": [
    "I would caution that EVST 201 does involve some basic physics and plenty of back-of-the-envelope calculations and approximations, so you should be comfortable with keeping units organized, etc. Other than that, however, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the world around them.",
    "It's a fairly straightforward class--about 1\/3 atmospheric science, 1\/3 ocean science, and 1\/3 climate change and energy issues. Definitely has some physics\/chem components to it, as well as a good deal of memorization and understanding of broader processes. I'd definitely recommend it (though it's required for Environmental Studies) for someone who is interested in environmental science--otherwise, there's the possibility it could get boring. Not too difficult to do well in if you study and review for exams.",
    "Yes. The course is great. It is not too hard and the problem sets are actually fairly enjoyable as problem sets go. The material learned is relevant and very interesting, and Professor Smith is engaging, clear, and interesting. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in how common physical processes in the world work. It's really neat to come out and understand why winds and currents blow and flow the way they do, how clouds and rain form, and how storms move. Smith is quite good if not amazing, and he makes a real effort to get to know everyone in the class. Great for increasing understanding ofthe world you see around you every day. Problem sets aren't very bad.",
    "The class is required for the EVST major and certain tracks of the geology major, but I'd recommend taking it even if it's not required. This felt like the most relevant class I'd ever taken--you'll be able to explain things about the weather that you'd previously just taken for granted, and you'll be able to talk about climate change on a much higher level. The first couple weeks focus on some less-interesting material, but trust me, it gets way more interesting after shopping period. (If you want to learn about global warming and you were thinking about \"Earth's Changing Climate\", you might want to consider this course instead.) If you've taken an introductory chem or physics course at Yale, you'll probably find this course to be easier and lighter in workload. The required half-credit lab is pretty useless for distributional requirement purposes, but it's less work than a chem or physics lab and often feels more like a section than a lab. Professor Smith is great.",
    "Yes, yes!",
    "Excellent class. Uses a bit of physics, but nothing more than a high school class. Have to take with the lab, but the lab is actually pretty cool.",
    "It covered topics of climate change, atmospheric motion, ocean currents, and the anthropogenic effect on the world, from a scientific standpoint.",
    "I highly recommend this class. I took it because I am interested in the environment and the way the earth functions, I realize after taking the class just how little I actually knew about weather, the oceans, the mechanics of global warming, and so many other topics. I found it pretty easy although you really have to put in the time or you'll get snagged in small errors throughout problem sets and tests. If you are an Environmental Studies major TAKE THIS CLASS ASAP. If not, still strongly consider it.",
    "It is a fairly simply QR but in the end is a bit more challenging than you first expect. I does a great job covering the materials and you come out knowing a lot more about basic weather and clouds!",
    "Good class. A lot of interesting topics, well-taught. But the book is completely unnecessary for the course. Show up to lecture.If you are taking it just for fun \/ learning the material, you can probably learn at least 3\/4 of it out of a meteorology book and current climate change research.",
    "I would recommend this class as fun and enjoyable science credit. You learn about the weather! Sometimes it's a bit scattered and you wonder what you're going to do with your newfound intimate knowledge of el nino, and there's not as much about climate change as most people in the class desire. The class is an entertaining mix of EVST majors and athletes, so that was interesting. The problem sets aren't too much work, but the tests are harder than you'd expect.",
    "The Atmosphere, Ocean, and Environmental Change was a great class. It's true to its name; we covered the structure of the atmosphere, processes like cloud and storm formation, winds, the ocean, ice formation, and evidence for climate change. The problem sets were informative and good practice without being too challenging. The exams were difficult, but not impossible to do well on. Professor Smith was wonderful; lectures were interesting, and he took a lot of time to answer questions in class and at the review sessions. I learned a lot from him and am proud of my new understanding of weather and climate. Whether you need it for your major or just to fulfill distribution requirements, you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it both to EVST majors and to non-science majors looking for a science or QR. It is a legitimate science class with some really interesting and important material.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Very interesting material, although as it is 100-level, you do not go as far in depth into the physics of these systems as you could.",
    "It's an intro course so we never go into great depth into anything, but it's a great survey of the atmospheric and oceanic processes and of climate change. I found the lectures very interesting.",
    "its really slow at times if you have a math \/ science background.",
    "Environmental Studies 201 will be one of your most challenging, but most rewarding courses. It is a class where I am keeping the book. I would definitely recommend it to other students. I would recommend over preparing for every thing and getting a tutor right away. This class will make you appreciate New Haven's unpredictable weather.",
    "This class is a really brief introduction to all topics of meteorology. It teaches you enough to understand basic weather patterns we see every day, but doesn't go too far in depth. Great class if you're interested in the outdoors at all.",
    "I would recommend the class. If you study it's not too challenging, and everyone should get to know this material.",
    "This is a good, basic, introductory course. Not incredibly interesting but it does provide information for the most fundamental aspects of our environment.",
    "very strong course. ron smith is a great professor. he made something as complex as the climate system approachable. i now feel like i can think for myself about the earth-system.",
    "If it's required for your major (evst) take it. Don't let this be your first or deciding course in the environmental major - the rest are better, for the most part. Go to class, take good notes, study the problem sets for the tests, but you'll also need to know some sporadic definitions and stuff. Do the problem sets early in the week, some of them are confusing or won't make sense until after the wednesday lecture, but getting started early helps keep away the suicidal thoughts.",
    "As a required course for the Environmental Studies major, EVST 201 is very solid, and gives you a strong scientific foundation for much of the work that is done in the major. I would definitely recommend it to another student, in order to gain a stronger understanding of the processes that are at work physically on the planet, and in the environment.",
    "absolutely. this class is great for anyone because the math is not too hard and it is a class that is completely applicable to daily life."
