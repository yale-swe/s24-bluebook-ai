    "It's a lot a lot of work. I took it credit\/d which was a mistake - you really need to do all the work to get everything you want out of it. but still enjoyed the class!",
    "Music in Theater was a really great experience. A huge range of material was covered, but somehow it never felt as though we were being overwhelmed by too much information to process because each week was a distinct period in time. We were really pushed to put everything we were studying into context, and while maybe it would have been great to be able to spend a little more time on more recent musicals, I would not have given up any of the other pieces that we studied to do so. Brian was an amazing seminar instructor. It was always completely clear that his goal was for us to learn the material in whatever way would work best for us at that moment and if something wasn't working, he would immediately come at it from a different angle. He was so passionate about the material, that it would have been hard not to learn and enjoy.",
    "This class is a general survey of theater through history and, more specifically, is an examination of the evolution of the relationship between music and theater over time. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in theater. If you aren't going to put the time into the class and are not invested enough to do all the reading and listening, it might be worth reconsidering or taking it Credit\/D. The listening test is really hard if you don't put time into it throughout the semester, but it's so interesting that it's worth the work.",
    "Music in the Theater is a fascinating seminar that delves into musico-theatrical works, from ancient greece through Renaissance Europe and through all of American history. We jump back and forth across the Atlantic covering American early Broadway works as well as European Operettas, before landing firmly in New York to explore the depths of Broadway through the 20th (and 21st) century. It is a whirlwind journey with a lot of amazing material.",
    "A love of both musical theater AND history is required to truly appreciate this course. It is not sitting down and talking about how neat Wicked is. It is examining the development of the musical theater work throughout time.",
    "I would recommend this to another student because you get to talk about a lot of plays and musicals in depth."
