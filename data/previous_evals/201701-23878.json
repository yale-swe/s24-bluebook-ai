   "comments": [
    "The syllabus was very clear.",
    "Again, Erich is always clear with dates and expectations and grading. Assignment dates changed but he let us know when they did. The one criticism I have is that he can be squishy with deadlines - I think it's out of an understanding of student schedules, but it can be frustrating for those of us who like clear, rigid timetables."

   "comments": [
    "I think there was an expectation of some basic computer programming knowledge that some of us weren't ready for - maybe a handout before that class or some targeted reading would help. Other option is to slow down a little to allow time for note-taking and questions. Very well-organized, though."

   "question_id": "DR378",
   "question_text": "How well did lectures fit within the boundaries of the course?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were nicely balanced with practical labs. Lectures were good for presenting concepts, but the only way to learn this topic is to do it. Erich did a great job of not bogging us down with too much theory before getting some practice."

   "question_id": "DR379",
   "question_text": "How appropriate was the workload?",
   "comments": [
    "The workload is really as much as you make it in choosing the scope of your projects.",
    "You dig your own hole in this class - it can be tough to work around production assignments, but with proper planning (and sometimes restraint) you can actually do quite a bit in the time you have available. I felt that it was enough of a workload to encourage stretching new skills without demanding too much. The one thing that gets frustrating is learning how to work a program in class and then not remembering how to do something and not having a written reference when you're doing your homework the next day. A photo guide or something would allow people to play with the functions of the programs more instead of fighting to re-learn how to perform basic functions that precede any actual programming."

    "Erich is incredibly accessible whether in person, email, or texts and this was really helpful at points.",
    "Erich is around quite a bit and is always willing to make time to answer questions or help troubleshoot. He is arguably the most available faculty in the building and it's a HUGE deal for students in his classes who are learning what are often radically new skill sets for us."

   "comments": [
    "What we produced in class is highly specific to the effects we were trying to produce, but the process and best practices of building a show control system would be useful if a production or effect came up that needed this. I'm certainly excited to try and take on a project that calls for show control.",
    "I feel very much like I can speak intelligently about options for show control and understand what a more experienced, soft-ware running\/programming technician is saying about those processes."
