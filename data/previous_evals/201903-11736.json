    "I have gained a great wealth of historical knowledge regarding early modern South Asia.",
    "I learnt the complex history of the Indian subcontinent, with an emphasis on the evolution of communal tensions between Hindus & Muslims from the 13th century to the modern era. My writing ability and research skills were greatly improved, as were the soft skills required to thrive in a seminar setting.",
    "The course explored the historical relationship between South Asian Hindus and Muslims. Special emphasis on themes like the historical roots of the relationship and of some of the sources of religious conflict, historiographical narratives and their connection to political ideas, areas of intersection and reciprocal influence, etc.",
    "I learned so much about the history of Hindu Muslim relations in India, but also became a better writer, reader, academic, and student. This was by far my favorite class of the semester, and perhaps my time at Yale, and Dr. Gandhi makes all the material extremely relevant and fascinating for her students."

   "comments": [
    "The class was wonderful in every sense. I loved the readings, interacting with the other students, and how Professor Gandhi weaved the theoretical with the practical, as well as historical narratives with present issues. It is hard for me to think about how could this be improved.",
    "Strengths: fantastic readings, lively discussions in class, lots of learning about the history of Hindus and Muslims in India, and questioning everything you know about categorizing religions Weakness: often felt a little unstructured, but it wasn't a huge deal",
    "Professor Gandhi is an amazing teacher who brings together different topics and sources to illustrate broader themes in the class. I especially liked the weekly discussion posts before class because they challenged me to think more deeply about the readings beyond simply reading the text.",
    "The main strengths of the course were the instructor, the excellently curated readings, the caliber of fellow students, the extremely relevant issues discussed the list goes on. The course has no weaknesses.",
    "The course was well-structured, allowing for detailed discussions of the most important themes in the relationship between South Asia's Hindu and Muslim communities and the events that have defined the relationship. The primary and secondary source readings were helpful and in-class discussions were engaging and productive. I wouldn't change anything.",
    "No weaknesses! A strength of the course was how everything is also tied to the fascinating modern events transpiring in South Asia, including informal weekly presentations by students on something in the news related to the class that interested them. Another strength is Dr Gandhi herself, who is extremely knowledgeable in the field and genuinely cares about her students' development and mental health."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, I would recommend this course to anybody interested in South Asian history.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in religion in India (which is extremely relevant to current events), you should definitely take it. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely--the themes discussed are as relevant as ever, the professor is amazing, the readings are engaging, and the discussions are challenging yet stimulating. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale and it's a must for any student interested in religious identity\/history in the Indian subcontinent.",
    "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend taking this class to any Yale student (level of familiarity with South Asian society & history no bar). Its the best humanities class Ive taken at Yale, with weekly readings that are never overwhelmingly long, and that are so interesting\/lucidly written that they often feel indistinguishable from pleasure reading. From the political maneuvering of Mughal emperors who murdered brothers to win the throne in medieval times to mobs demolishing ancient mosques in the late 20th century, this course truly has it all!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in South Asian history and culture.",
    "I highly, HIGHLY recommend this course for anyone and everyone. It is accessible for people who aren't very experienced with South Asian history at all, and has a very manageable workload. It is a genuinely fun class that is taught by an incredible professor."
