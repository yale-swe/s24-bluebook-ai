   "comments": [
    "So much easier than 150\/151, or any other full-week Chinese class for that matter. Also Zhou Laoshi is the best.",
    "154 is a good course to take. You get a good introduction to some current issues in China and some new cultural context while continuing to move forward with vocab and grammar. Zhou laoshi is very reasonable and very approachable. The class starts off slow but will pick up as time goes on.",
    "Yes Yes Yes. Plz take it. You can learn a lot while not being too stressed out about the material.",
    "CHNS 154 is the class that will maintain, and slightly improve, your already advanced Chinese skills. It is low-stress, meeting only three times a week (instead of every day) and having less homework than lower levels of Chinese. It is a class you will look forward to, because Zhou laoshi is so nice and ebullient and the class activities, such as discussions, talk shows, and individual presentations, are all worthwhile.",
    "Unfortunately CHNS 154 is just a class you have to take if you want to gain access to the upper level Chinese courses. All of the intro Chinese courses are a bit of a grind, but it's alright, you need it to prep you for the later courses!"
