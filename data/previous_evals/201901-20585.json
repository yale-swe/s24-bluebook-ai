How to give a public talk? 4. How to give a professional conference talk? 5. How to give a job talk? 6. How to present your work in a professional poster? 6. Tips and ideas about how to write a paper. 7. How to do outreach? ... etc. These topics are really useful for graduate students and I hope they can be incorporated into the course."
