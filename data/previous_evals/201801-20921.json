    "After completing this class, I feel pretty accomplished having read all those large books. I was asked to consider obscure elements of the text that I wouldn't have noticed on my own.",
    "I learned a lot about the intersection of different texts over time and the development of the epic and novel formats.",
    "Learning to see themes throughout different literary eras; writing a well-structured essay; critical literary analysis",
    "I became a better reader and interpreter of text. This course gave me access to an area of literature that I had little previous experience with, particularly the intersection between the epic and the novel. I was able to develop my writing skills, recieving specific feedback on my papers that allowed me to respond on each subsequent essay. I was given the assistance I needed in order to truly delve into intimidating works like Ulysses.",
    "I learned about the tradition of literature (epics specifically) in Europe."

   "comments": [
    "The reading and conversation surrounding the text are intense and very in depth. If you have trouble speaking in seminars, you can still learn a lot just by sitting and listening.",
    "Strengths: reading selection, professor, class discussion, interesting papers Weaknesses: a ton of reading but its honestly necessary to be able to read so many great epics",
    "I thought the class structure was very strong and I thought the workload was manageable given the amount of text we were reading.",
    "It is a great course - would not change much.",
    "The strenghts of this course are the texts that it examines and the assistance provided by seminar style discussion. The works were engaging and fun to read, and the professor was extremely well prepared to help us through the readings. Nevertheless, discussion flowed realtively freely which was a refreshing departrue from the lecture style classes that I took this semester. The main weakness of the course is the lack of time that we have to give to the readings. I felt that I could not give huge works like Ulysses the time they deserved, particularly given an otherwise busy schedule.",
    "Strengths: Great discussions. Great feedback on papers."

   "comments": [
    "If you have a great interest in literature, I would say take this class. You can learn a lot just by sitting in on the discussion.",
    "100%",
    "Yes. While difficult, Markovits was a great professor and the material is engaging. I feel like I have a much stronger basis for reading later works and for further exploring these texts on my own.",
    "YES. Prof. Markovitz is amazing and her course is superbly organized. You will feel a sense of great satisfaction after taking the course, as you will gain a greater understanding of the general trajectory of European literature throughout history.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student: it was engaging and valuable, and I feel lucky to have had access to these amazing works. That said, it is a large time commitment, and although I have appreciated the books that we read, I feel that I haven't had enough time to fully grasp them, and I hope to reread some of them this summer.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and great background for reading literature in the future. My essay-writing skills improved too.",
    "Best course I have taken at Yale. I think that engaging seriously with these works is life changing both intellectually and spiritually. Professor Markovits is an excellent instructor."
