   "comments": [
    "If you get into this class, take it! It's a great way to meet other students who enjoy science. If you have a good discussion group (as I did), the class becomes incredibly engaging, and a lot of the lecturers present very interesting material, even if it's sometimes too advanced. If you're interested in learning about real research, meeting scientifically minded students, broadening your scientific horizons, and getting support (both financial and emotional) for research, you should take this class.",
    "It's either a hit or miss. The class alternates between lecture and seminar (10-15 people). The seminars were highly unstructured, which at times you appreciate but at other times you hate. Many of the lectures are quite interesting and the homework load is hardly anything, but a lot of people are in it just for the money for the summer research. You can probably take this class in addition to whatever other courseload you were considering, as it really isn't that much work.",
    "The main motivation for people to take this course is the research money at the end. The guest lecturers are sometimes interesting, sometimes boring. My discussion section was usually the most boring part of my week - it felt as if we were all just forced to stay in the same room and nobody actually wanted to be there. Ninety minutes of straight lecture\/discussion is inevitably painful. It does however give you some interesting exposure to other fields, and the research money is the main plus.",
    "Gateway to science research at Yale. Do it only if you are going to do research-there are other ways to find out if scientific research is not the thing for you.",
    "Perspectives is the perfect course for anyone considering the career of a scientific researcher, especially those who have not had much, if any, research experience before college. The process offers the appropriate guidance for real science people, while also being a ton of fun! The necessary workload is low, but there is ample room for supplementing the course with outside research.",
    "Take it! You'll make great friends, learn about cutting-edge scientific research at Yale, and get a great summer research opportunity!",
    "If you are interested in the sciences and potentially research, this course is perfect for you",
    "Take this class for the research opportunities over the summer. The lecturers are usually interesting, but it varies a lot week to week. The discussion are really a drag because they are so long and no one knows enough to make great insights. It can be a mixed bag, but I'm glad that I took the class.",
    "It is important to realize what PSE is: it is a class centered around learning about the research that Yale faculty members conduct and discussing this research. You will then be expected to conduct your own research in the summer after your freshman year. You should not take this course if you are uninterested in research but would rather learn about cutting edge topics in science. There are other courses at Yale better suited for this topic.",
    "It is a great course for people who want to be exposed to cutting edge research on a great variety of disciplines.",
    "So if you're looking at this evaluation, it means you got into PSE. Well, I say, take this course. Yeah, it is obvious that you are not going to like all the lectures becaue all the lectures are so comprehensive, and you are BOUND to dislike one of the subjects (for example, I wasn't particularly fond of the geophysics lecture). But overall, it's a relaxed course that gives you awesome funding for summer research (something very very useful).",
    "It depends. The lectures could really bore you if you are only interested in a particular area of science. If you're not willing to make your discussion section interesting, it won't be. If you're just in it for the research money, the course will feel like a drag.",
    "It's a survey course for students interested in science and engineering, but unsure as to which field they should pursue. For the most part, I think students have an idea as to which sciences they like and which they don't. All in all, it's not worth taking.",
    "If you want to do summer research, don't want the burden of searching for funding, and would like to learn new, cool things in a broad number of scientific fields, this class is for you. Sometimes the discussions can be dull, but it depends on your section. Keep in mind that some students like to wind down from the week on Friday afternoon, and that you're giving part of this up.",
    "Yale professors give fascinating lectures on their research. You write some short-answers, then go to discussion. No one else wants to be there, either. Some students \"lead\" the \"discussion\", helped by a pair of teachers. Then you leave, an hour and a half older, your newfound love for the material in the lecture destroyed, or at least sickened.Actually, the real point of this class is to be a gateway to sumer research, and you spend the spring semester writing your research proposal. I can't comment on that part of the class.",
    "Take it if you get in! The lectures are absolutely fascinating. The problem sets are nothing.. they take almost no time. This class is definitely worth the small amount of work. And we get to do great research during the summer. A great class from all respects.",
    "I found Perspectives to be a very interesting class. I love hearing about different types of science, and all of the lectures this semester were great!! The discussions are absolutely pointless, but hey, the summer funding will be worth it.",
    "This class will help you learn about different areas of research in science, and hopefully help you figure out what you're interested, if you're willing to stick it out through some of the boring lectures, cryptic problem sets, and sometimes less-than-stellar discussion sections. The problem sets are graded in some arbitrary way that I haven't entirely figured out yet (is Excellent the same as Very Good? who knows), so that can be frustrating. Leading a discussion is fun, but make sure you're prepared because the discussions are, in fact, 90 minutes long. The real light at the end of the tunnel is the $4000 research grant each student who finishes the whole year receives, which is pretty cool. All in all, if you got into this course, you like science--just decide whether or not the research grant is worth it to you or not.",
    "The lectures were usually interesting, although I found the ones about biology very difficult to follow. Our section had great discussions, although they frequently focused on relevant social and philosophical issues rather than the substance of the lectures. The workload is light, though the course is only worth 0.5 credits. I recommend Perspectives for the research opportunities and contact with professors that it provides.",
    "I would recommend this class for the summer research opportunities it provides. Although I've learned a lot about different sciences, often the lectures are too in depth to be comprehensible before discussion section. Overall this is a good class, but I would not have taken it if it weren't for the summer research money.",
    "I would definitely take Perspectives if you're unsure which scientific\/mathematical\/engineering area you're most interested in. I found that some of the lectures were really interesting, and I could see myself being involved in similar kinds of research, while some were less interesting to me, and taught me an equally valuable lesson. If you already know that you love physics and hate biology, this class might be less fun for you. The discussions are what you make of them. They can be boring if no one prepared and you're really tired on a Friday afternoon, or you can try to stay awake and participate a lot. Don't take this class only for the summer research money, because there are plenty of other ways to attain research funding, but being in Perspectives is nice because it makes you feel like part of the scientific community at Yale,",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering was a lecture based class that explored a different Yale professor's field of interest every other week in lecture, and discussed in more depth the material covered in smaller discussion sections every other week. I would recommend the course for a student with little to no true idea of which direction he or she wants to take in science; however, if one is already passionate about a particular area, the course may be unappealing to you. Yet the opportunity for summer research is enticing.",
    "Science 198 is a series of lectures and discussion sections on various topics across science. It introduces students to a lot of fields and research going on at Yale which they might otherwise have no interest in. I would recommend Science 198 to another student just because the lectures were so interesting and my particular discussion section was fantastic. The summer research was also a great opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for a half-credit with a light workload and an opportunity to do research of your own in the summer.The time slot was bad: Fri 1:30 to 3 is terrible no matter who you are, but you didn't have to pay that much attention unless you wanted to.",
    "Yep, I would take it even without the monetary incentive, but the $4,200 check they give you at the end for 10 weeks of research is nice too.",
    "the lectures every other week are hit or miss, depending on the speaker and topic. the discussions are pretty relaxed, and workload is also really light - a 4 question problem set due on discussion weeks that takes a couple hours to complete. of course, the summer stipend is the main perk of this class.",
    "It is a great class if you aren't sure what area of science you would like to explore.",
    "It will give you a survey of some of the topics science professors and researchers are working on at Yale. You listen to a lecture by a researcher every other week and then have a dicussion section that is student run on subsequent weeks.",
    "If you're interested in more than one area of scientific study, take this class. If not, you'll just be bored and the research money isn't really worth it for that. On the other hand, I enjoyed the lectures a lot.",
    "I originally took the course since I wanted to sample different types of science, since I wasn't sure which type interested me. However, I felt it hard to get overly motivated about biology since I'm not really interested in biology and it was quite complicated. If you are motivated enough to fully immerse yourself in each topic, you will enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend the course if someone is interested in sciences in general and would like to do research",
    "Science 198 01 is a great course for prospective science majors, especially if you're not sure exactly which field you want to delve into. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to broaden their horizons about different science topics and gain a research opportunity (Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a program that gives money for summer research) along the way.",
    "I would, because it provides great opportunities for freshmen that most of other courses cannot.",
    "It is a lecture series in current topics in science research. I would definitely recommend it because it gives a broad scope of different current research areas and allows students to be exposed to various projects and areas that would otherwise be unknown.",
    "The lectures can be interesting, but the discussion sections are a bit forced.",
    "PSE is an interesting course- know that I've only taken the fall semester thus far, so I only have so much perspective on the course as a whole. That said, I think it's for a very specific kind of student: one who really is very open to performing research within a VARIETY of scientific disciplines, and enjoys DISCUSSING applications, extensions, and future directions of current research (in various fields). Overall, I enjoyed the semester, but I felt it could've been structured differently so that the students got much more out of it. The discussion sections mainly focused on reviewing content from the relevant lectures, whereas I anticipated getting the chance to use these sections to more deeply discuss intriguing aspects of the research in question, or to discuss ways to further enhance, extend, or develop said research. I personally found each lecture interesting enough, and the workload was extremely minimal this semester, so I wouldn't say that I simply \"sat through\" it, as others might say, but I must admit, it wasn't the most engaging course in the world, and considering that THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO PURSUE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT YALE (say that to yourself several times- let it sink in), it might not have been the best use of my time.",
    "If you like TED talks then definitely take Perspectives. The lectures span a wide field of topics from the Higgs Particle to Lung Regeneration. What's great about PSE is the fact that you get a working knowledge of the subject after one hour and a half on an area of science that's not even in the textbooks yet. The lectures are also pitched at the right level for college freshman, which is great! If you tried looking for information on Lung regeneration online for example, the material is either too hard or too stripped down, but PSE lecturers present the material at the right level in an interesting way.People often complain about PSE discussion groups, I guess the engagement level of discussion groups really depends on who you get. Some discussion groups are more exciting than others because of higher participation and enthusiasm.",
    "Some of the lectures are very fascinating; the downside of having a course that explores so many areas of the sciences is that, unsurprisingly, not all of the lectures may capture your interest. The group discussions and homework are generally tedious, unless a particular talk motivates you to do a lot of outside reading. Otherwise, they are structured in a manner that encourages mere analysis of the lectures and supplementary material. For students who are not very knowledgeable on a particular subject, this fact means reciting memorized information without real understanding. However, the opportunity for a view and participation in a lot of areas of research may be worth the less interesting points."
