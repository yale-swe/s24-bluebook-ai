    "The course is an advanced course, and very useful for PhD students especially for the ones who want to pursue programming languages related research. However, I think the course is not suitable for Master students and undergraduate students. Thus, I will recommend the course to PhD students whose research interests are programming languages and formal methods, and the undergraduate students who want to do some programming languages related researches in the future."
