   "comments": [
    "Learned knowledge of economics, and learned the theory behind them better",
    "Macroeconomics!",
    "I learned so so much from this course. I both gained skills in logical reasoning, considering implications of policies and incentives, cause\/effect, etc, and I also gained a really important knowledge base: why recessions happen, why some countries are richer than others, how banking works and why it failed in the US financial crisis, how inflation works, how GDP works, how unemployment works, etc. Additionally, all of this was taught through real examples in the world today, so none of it was arbitrary.",
    "Basic understanding of macroeconomic concepts and some fiscal policy details.",
    "During this course, I gained an understanding of how the world's economy works. I may have thought I understood this material before, but I found myself coming out of each class better understanding things like the payment system, banks, money, and recessions. I honestly feel like this class should nearly be mandatory - so much political discourse revolves around the economy that I feel like it's really important to have an informed view.",
    "This course helped me understand not just the whats of macroeconomics, but the whys and hows. I initially planned on skipping this course because I took AP Macro, but Im really glad I ended up taking it. AP Macro, for example, teaches you that investment in capital goods can outwardly expand the production possibilities frontier but after taking this class and looking at both the Solow growth model and recent Nobel prizes in economics, you discover that capital stock can only lead to transitory growth for sustained long-run growth, technological advances and (most importantly) institutions (antitrust and anti-insider trading legislation as well as intellectual property protection) are necessary. Furthermore, instead of just learning about bank balance sheets and what insolvency means, this course teaches you what circumstances lead to insolvency, particularly in cases of large-scale collapse (i.e. 2007), and what the consequences are (i.e. 2008). This course teaches you to truly think about the consequences of macroeconomic phenomena, and is undoubtedly a necessity for anyone pursuing an economics major at Yale.",
    "Big trends in macroeconomic theory; finance and banking; the history behind the Great Recession; thinking from the perspective of banks and the Federal Reserve",
    "A broad introduction into the field of macroeconomics: GDP, the Solow Growth Model, AD, IS, MP, PC curves, etc. The course was taught within an international context, and Marnix frequently brought in real-world politics and economic crises to explain the theory of the course. Much of the second half of the class focused on the 2008 Recession.",
    "I learned a lot about how the economy works. I deepened some of my understanding from intro micro.",
    "I learned about the fundamental concepts of economic models that inform GDP, a country's developmental trend, banking and recessions, aggregate demand-supply models and the intuitive simple mathematical relationships.",
    "I learned a lot about the macro economy.",
    "Learned ALOT about macroeconomics in the grand scheme of how the world works- businesses, the financial crisis, international development, etc",
    "I learned a lot taking this class! It was very topical and I feel like it helped me a lot even in day to day life",
    "I began to understand the interaction between private, corporate, and government actors in the economy.",
    "Gained insight into the Macroeconomic trends of the world",
    "I learned a lot about macroeconomics and how life works with money! (apologies for this writing I got surgery today) We spent a lot of time on the 2008 recession, which I liked. I also got better at reading graphs.",
    "I learned the basics of macroeconomics. I also learned, generally, how to approach problems as an economist might (i.e., not through a political lens)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: learned a lot of cool economics Weaknesses: not enough feedback on homeworks",
    "Overall it is a very good course, and I will always prefer a seminar to a lecture, however, sometimes it felt like we were learning the material so fast that it was hard to keep up. Also, the book is way more important than we are believed it to be since the weekly quizzes and psets come straight from there. Highly recommend reading through the book chapters along with the class lectures to adequately learn all the information you need to know.",
    "I really loved this course. The seminar format means students can ask questions throughout class, which is critical as the content is nuanced and we go fast. Additionally, it means students can get personal feedback in office hours and responses to emails, which is a great benefit as compared to lecture courses. I also think the concepts are extremely interesting and applicable, as compared to micro. I like that psets are graded for completion and there is no pressure to understand things perfectly at the time. I'd appreciate if quizzes\/psets were linked up with the pace of the course a bit better, though, because psets would come out on Friday and the material of the psets wouldn't be covered until almost a week later, the day or so before they were due. Instead, I think the released pset should cover the material that was just learned. I also felt readings added to our understanding. The only other improvements I can think of are polling students at the beginning of the semester to choose topics based on student interest, and maybe having an opportunity to work on an applied project or have a dinner outside of class where economics is discussed more informally and in relation to current affairs rather than just theory. I appreciate that psets were returned promptly.",
    "This class was great. Its a mix between a lecture and a seminar in the best possible way. Professor Amand really works with everybody in the class to uncover the material and concepts instead of just lecturing about it. My literal only problem with the class is that Professor Amand assumes you know some things going in (like what bonds are and how they work) which I didnt, so at times I felt a little lost.",
    "The course is strong - it's not particularly difficult, and we learn a lot. Sometimes Marnix answers a lot of questions and doesn't get to some of the material, but I can't really complain about that.",
    "This course is excellent it gives you a great overview of the field of macroeconomics, and then delves into certain topics (i.e. growth trends, financial sector benefits and drawbacks, the money supply, the short run vs. the long run, etc.) to teach you how and why everything happens in the economy. It really prepares you to think like an economist in future courses and in life. I really liked the fact that economics was emphasized as a science from the beginning economists should be free from political biases when developing models and should instead validate them empirically with prior data. Hopefully, this will lead the students to take economics seriously instead of cherry-picking economic concepts to advance their sides when all the poli sci majors inevitably run for Congress. As far as weaknesses, while there were some things I learned in AP Macro that werent covered in this class (i.e. marginal propensity to consume vs. save, spending multiplier, production possibilities frontier), I feel like these concepts were deliberately excluded because theyre too theoretical and have no realistic application, so I dont think this is that much of a weakness, but it wouldve still been nice to gloss over the concepts and say this stuff you learned in AP Macro is all false\/unrealistic on the first class. Other than that, I thought the class was great.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material; information-packed slides Weaknesses: some material on exams are on the slides but not taught in class- can make some concepts difficult to master",
    "Strengths Marnix is obviously an incredibly intelligent professor. His contextualization of the course material in the real world makes the class interesting and feel incredibly relevant. He's a good instructor, but where I think the weaknesses lie... Weaknesses Marnix assumes you know a lot. He isn't as accepting of incorrect answers. He often prefaces questions with \"Come on, this isn't that hard..\" or \"You guys should know this, it's easy...\" in a way that's pretty discouraging to the student who doesn't feel like an economics expert. The nature of 'incredible participation may raise your grade' really felt like it created one of the most gunner-present classes I've ever had at Yale. I didn't feel comfortable speaking as students who had clearly had prior macroeconomics knowledge dominated the class (though I don't believe this is specifically Marnix's fault, but maybe the nature of the class). Marnix is also very quick to explain things, and truly assumes you have completely read and studied the textbook before beginning lecture. This wasn't an explicit expectation, and it took me a bit too long to realize this.",
    "Great professor, good pace, good psets and a grading system that reduced stress to focus on the material. No weaknesses.",
    "It's a good introduction to macro and will tell you pretty quick whether or not you want to continue studying economics.",
    "Strengths: seminar style lecture is great because you can ask questions during the lecture, lecture moved at a good pace (not too fast nor too slow), interesting material, pset a graded for completion not accuracy so not stressful but helpful Weaknesses:",
    "Strengths: Prof. Marnix, the PSET workload, the lectures and slides were all comprehensible, case studies were interesting reads. Weaknesses: Definitely difficult to assess what your grade is exactly the entire semester.",
    "I think this is a great course as it is. Marnix is a great professof",
    "Strengths: The professor was very engaging and skilled at communicating material. The quizzes and homeworks assisted the learning process but were graded based on completion, meaning that I could try to understand without undue stress about the grade. Weaknesses: the final exam was longer, more difficult, and meaner than the course prepared us for.",
    "Strengths: material was explained really well, especially explaining trends\/patterns through analogies made it really easy to understand Weaknesses: exams were quite different from psets (hope to have more exam-like questions on psets)",
    "Strengths: professor knew a lot about what he was teaching, he was also from France so he knew a lot about the EU economic problems as well, which I found interesting. He also knew a lot about economic history and gave a very in depth teaching of 2008 recession. I liked how PSets were graded on completion and effort not correctness because it really took the stress off of them and he put the correct answers and why when they were given back to me which I thought really helped. Same thing with the Canvas online quizzes, however, I wish we were reminded more often about them because I forgot to do like 3 of them on time. Weaknesses: Harsh grader on tests. I got wrecked on the midterm, and probably the final too (although I don't know yet because I have to write this review before I can see my grade! >:( He doesn't really give any partial credit for parts of questions or efforts, like you must have exactly the write answer to get points. I did not really know this before going in so yeah, huge wreckage occurred for me when I got the midterm back. Also the professor called on the same people over and over again each class, even when others raised their hands, which really isn't too nice because he also grades on participation. He was also pretty dismissive and ridiculed some of the oral answers that students gave in class if they were not correct, which kind of made me scared to answer questions. (again had surgery today so still a but loopy, but I want to see my grade)",
    "Eh, a lot of the discussions\/lectures in class go off course often and the P-Set questions are rarely like the exam questionsfor example, you had to know some specific name of a policy instead of just analyzing the results of that policy, which was frustrating."

    "Yes definitely, I learned a lot",
    "Even if you aren't an economics major, this course is really helpful to learn more general trends about the world around us. I'm not majoring in economics but I learned a lot of information about banks, interest rates, and how situations like the Great Recession happened. The information is interesting, so I definitely recommend this seminar.",
    "Absolutely. Dr. Amand is a fabulous professor and the course content is extremely relevant to all people, regardless of major and learning style. You will learn a ton about basic things regarding how the world works.",
    "DEFINITELY. I had such a better and more pleasant experience in this class than my friends who took the seminar. If you want to better understand monetary policy when you hear about it on the news, take this class!!!",
    "I would fully recommend this course to other students. It's not a lot of work besides 2 midterms (the psets are not hard and graded for completion) and it's really good stuff to know. When you see a class that's not that much work and you learn this much good stuff, you ought to take it.",
    "I would absolutely, without a doubt, 100% recommend this course to every prospective econ major, even those who got fives on AP Macro, love econ, and think they already know everything the intro course is going to cover. They dont. If youve taken econ in high school, youll probably be ahead of the curve (figuratively and literally, it is a curved class), but youll soon realize your prior knowledge is dwindling and theres a lot in this class that no high school econ teacher could dream of covering. Youll learn how to get analytical with a lot of real-life economic events, stay up-to-date with the latest economic developments and research, and treat economics like the science it is (or at least should be).",
    "Yes, this class has fascinating material and will help you better understand how the world functions. Youll learn about the financial sector, the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve, and other events and institutions that usually seem so far off from the average person. Prepare for some self-studying throughout to keep up with the material.",
    "I mean, yes, if it's a required class (which it is for most who take it), or if you happen to really want to understand basic macro and the 2008 Great Recession.",
    "If you liked micro and are not sure if you want to continue with economics, this is the next step. You probably already know this, unless you're living under a rock.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the material and found Professor Amand to be an engaging lecturer.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because if you want to enter any form of politics or international relations, there is so much policy that rely on economic challenges or economic issues. Macroeconomics under Prof. Marnix is also great because he brings so much clarity into the 2008 recession and rudimentary comprehension for non-finance students about banking and the central bank's relation with banks.",
    "It is probably a pre-req so you have to take it anyways but you will learn a lot from Professor Amand.",
    "Yes I would even if you arent an Econ major. I think that it is just useful knowledge",
    "Yes, but with caution. The final exam was the most traumatic experience of my time at Yale up to now. The professor did not prepare us for the length or difficulty of the exam; not only did I witness another student crying, but I myself nearly had a panic attack in the last fifteen minutes.",
    "Yes, if one is interested in getting a better sense of economic news\/trends in the world",
    "Yes if they are okay with maybe not being the best in the class, or are good at interrupting to get that participation credit (which I am very polite and don't like to do that) Also if they are just like really into macroeconomics like maybe if they're an economics major. (again a bit loopy)",
    "Not really. I regret not taking the lecture version. I felt confused about what we were supposed to know for exams and learned much more reading the book than by going to class."
