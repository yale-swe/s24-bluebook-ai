    "I would say it is a great overview of distributed systems theory, and recommend it to anyone interested in a theoretical CS course.",
    "Very theoretical and very niche, but interesting. Aspnes draws fun illustrations and is a really great person. The work load is pretty light but the material is not easy. Overall enjoyable. I'm also not really sure how this worked out this semester since I haven't seen the grades yet, but I have heard that Aspnes curves grades down, and I wish I had heard that before I took it.",
    "Esoteric and Very Hard. I would recommend having some fundamental knowledge in this area before taking this course. That being said, the instructor is very good and you will learn a lot in this area."
