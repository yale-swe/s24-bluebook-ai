    "The new skill building assignments are helpful. Otherwise, depends on your adviser.",
    "This semester a lecture portion has been added to the course. It adds a lot of busywork, but if you're going to be doing research anyway, you should probably take this course at least once. Take note though that the largest assignments often come around the same time you're probably trying to do more work for the research itself, so you might find yourself having to choose the coursework over getting ahead more in your project. The skills lectures are somewhat dry, material-wise, but overall useful, and Beth Bennett is great.",
    "The class component of the project is a bit annoying. There are a lot of random milestones due, when you want to be focusing on your project.",
    "Requirements include a midterm presentation and paper, a technical poster, and a final presentation and paper, with various other updates and checkpoints throughout. This class gives you some good insight into the world of academia. Keep in mind there's an actual class component with lectures, which didn't used to be the case, so you need to build that into your schedule.",
    "I mean you have to take it...",
    "This is a senior project course that should of course be taken by senior Mech E's (regardless of it is required).",
    "I would recommend 472 because some of the skills you learn are actually quite useful and interesting to do for the first time. However the course becomes very tedious, and lectures that are delivered in 75 minutes in class can be read on classesv2 in 15 minutes with the same quality. You will probably not go to all these lectures, neither should you because you can probably be more productive reading them online and spending the rest of the time actually working on your project. However, actually doing the milestones is useful, so in that way it is worth it.",
    "You gotta take it so take it. Do a design project- they're infinitely more work (which everyone knows), but also infinitely more fun. Make sure to interact with Glenn, Kevin, and Nick as much as possible as they are by far the best resources on campus for building anything you can think of.",
    "Definitely, take this class and work on a project that excites you!",
    "If you can find another way to complete your senior requirement, I would probably choose that. Otherwise, you kinda have to take this so recommendations don't really matter lol.",
    "Check early on if you actually need to take this course!! Things changed this in terms of major requirements, so be sure to ask. Pretty boring in-class material, but that is because the focus should be on your project\/research.",
    "This course used to be fine because there were less assignments, now it sucks because the assignments prevent you from researching and doing cool things. What's worse, is that this is more like a writing course than it is science because of all the assignments.",
    "If you need credits, then go ahead and take this class. Perhaps consider taking the other engineering majors' equivalents. If you dont need credits, try to get paid for your research, because this class is a huge time sink. Just lectures and lab meetings alone consumed 5 hours a week of my time. Add assignments and you will have very little time to actually work on your project or conduct research. Your experience will be largely dictated by your advisor and your project. If you are majoring in mechanical engineering, please do yourself a favor and take MENG 489. Although MENG 489 can be annoying, you will learn a lot skills that are otherwise absent from your Yale engineering education.",
    "Independent research with a twist - you gotta go to class! The assignments keep you on your toes as it is easy to lose track of time when you are working on a research project. The classes are useful obviously to complete the assignments, but if you cant make it to them then you can still be ok by following the notes online."
