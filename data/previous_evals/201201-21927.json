    "It's a whirlwind tour through some strange plays without much work.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Biggs is incredible, he really facilitates excellent discussion. I didn't know most of the works on the syllabus but almost all of them were fantastic reads. Play a class, 3 papers, and a presentation. Very manageable class work-wise, if you like theater.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student if they like plays and if they are willing to do the work. The class is not a heavy load, but you do have to read all of the plays to have a meaningful experience. I had no trouble reading all the plays. Some of the other students had more background with theater and plays than I did, but it did not hinder me.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in analyzing less commonly explored plays in a unique and detailed way while focusing on a certain set of questions that unifies them.",
    "I enjoyed this course. Some of the plays are more entertaining to read than others, but overall it was a nice selection. Kind of wanted there to be more \"controversial plays\" as in plays that were controversial at the time and upset people. Instead it was mostly plays that were somehow structurally confusing. Murray is knowledgeable and passionate.",
    "Great survey of some of the best and most thought-provoking plays out there. Suitable for those who know little about theater, as well as those who know much more. This is one of the courses where I was actually excited about writing my essays before I even wrote them. Professor Biggs is quite personable and a great person to get to know. He meets with each student to discuss their essays and more before returning each one. Definitely a course to take to augment the \"Yale experience.\""
