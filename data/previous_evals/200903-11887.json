   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want a better understanding of econometric techniques. The jump from Intro Econometrics to this can be quite big; be prepared to rely on a textbook.",
    "take this course. it's going to give you a good overview over econometrics, and leave you with some tangible, useful skills. not too hard, although i had to struggle to avoid a B+",
    "A good course. Econometrics 1 is in my opinion not enough and this should be a required course. Exams were quite easy. Project may seem daunting at first. Overall rewarding but not too easy",
    "Take the course. It can be a bitch, but take it. Knowing advanced econometrics is really critical to being an econ major, even if it's not required.",
    "If you are not in the 87% of Yale that can't handle these kinds of \"hard\" classes, take it! It's fun!",
    "Yes if you want to pursue a senior paper in the economics major. Unless you have an interest in economic research, this course will be difficult, mathematical, and tedious. But if you are interested in research, it will help you understand how to approach economic modeling.",
    "This is a great class to take if you're thinking about writing a senior essay or plan on pursuing more advanced economics classes that require you to interpret econometric results. This is far better than the first econometrics class-- you really get the intuition behindwhat you're doing and you get the chance to practice using STATA with an empirical project. The professor is also great as well.",
    "This is absolutely essential for anyone who wishes to do some economics research, say for a senior thesis or in grad school. I personally feel this is where the real tools of economic analysis are taught. But if you're not that hardcore about your econ, then perhaps it won't be worth your time.",
    "Hard to say. I thought the problem sets were pretty hard (exams were manageable though), and I'm not sure how much I really got out of it. Then again, I might not be quite as comfortable doing mathy stuff as most other people in the course, so others might have gotten more out of it. I never really felt like I understood what was going on in the class, but the exams ended up being manageable. But, definitely a hard course. I never took Econometrics I (took intro stats instead), so I can't compare it, but it was definitely WAY harder than intro stats. All in all I probably hoped to get more out of it than I actually did.",
    "This is a great course, but be prepared to put in the effort and visit the TA or the prof at office hours.",
    "Econ 132 is an intermediate econometrics course. It gets harder as the class progresses, but it is an excellent class - definitely better than Econometrics I. I think that students should take this who actually want to learn and to understand econometrics. There are six problem sets, a project and a midterm\/final, so the workload is not light. At the same time, though, you finish the course with the ability to use econometrics in your senior thesis and to actually be able to read and understand an academic paper in economics. This has been one of my favorite classes, so if you are willing to do the work, then take it!!"
