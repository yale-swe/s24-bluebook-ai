    "Daily lessons consisting of new lessons and lots of scenario talking. Frequent quizzes and tests. The homework consists of book work, practice for listening, and studying. Personally, I spent around an hour and a half on homework for this class every day.",
    "This class is amazing. If you have any interest in actually learning a foreign language while at Yale, then you should absolutely take this class. The very first day is pretty intimidating, but don't be scared off! It really gets better and better as the class goes on. It's taught by four instructors who rotate around pretty frequently. I really liked this because it gave us the chance to hear different voices, which ultimately helped improve command of the language, and helped to train the ear. Nightly homework assignments are fairly voluminous. A typical night will have about an hour of written homework, half an hour of listening comprehension homework, and then CC memorization. CCs (core conversations) are short dialogues that you have to memorize for each class, and on which you are tested for memorization. Most of your grade in this class involves participation, so it's in your best interest to go to class every day and do the homework every night. I thought this system was great because it took the pressure off of tests somewhat, and focused the attention on actual learning. To summarize, this is an amazing class that you should take if you feel that 1.5-2 hours of work per night is something that you can handle. It's an extremely rewarding class that will leave you shocked by the amount of Japanese you can understand and speak by winter break. Also, the sensees are all really supportive and will help you out as much as you need.",
    "Lots and lots and lots of speaking. Need to be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the grammar in your own time.",
    "hard, but worth it entirely",
    "This is a great introduction to japanese. It is definitely not easy and the workload is very heavy but the class is so entertaining and fun. Take it!",
    "I would recommend it as you can actually learn a language through this course.",
    "If you have ever had any inclination to take Japanese, I could not imagine a better program than this one. However, please be forewarned. The pace and rigor of the class is extremely high. Daily assignments can take hours to complete each night. If you are willing to dedicate the time and effort to this class, you will be rewarded.",
    "Yes highly recommend it if one wants to learn japanese",
    "Yes - if you are interested in Japanese obviously, and if you are aware of the intensity and pace of this class. It is demanding, but very rewarding."
