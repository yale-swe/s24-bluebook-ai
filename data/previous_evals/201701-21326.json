    "The number of kanji I know absolutely went the roof over the course of L4, and I also learned to grapple with more complex topics within the bounds of the intermediate conversations we were already having in L3.",
    "All aspects of my Japanese improved tremendously: reading, writing, and speaking. I loved the variety of materials the teachers used in preparing the lessons.",
    "Thanks to this course, I not only gained familiarity and confidence with Japanese language skills but also learned about Japanese history, culture, and society. I also learned about foreign language learning on a larger scale and how to put myself in the shoes of a native speaker.",
    "the ability to speak and write well in Japanese",
    "Learnt a lot of Japanese! I liked the cultural emphasis as well, where we learnt about Japan's history \/ folk tales \/ the history of the language etc."

    "The dedication of the teachers and their efforts to constantly involve each student are the strengths. There are no weaknesses.",
    "The strengths are the wonderful and experienced instructors and the variety of the curriculum. The weaknesses are that the course does get a bit repetitive about midway through the semester, so its easy to get burned out from the daily quizzes and similar exercises.",
    "the course is really good. I cannot think of any weakness",
    "Strengths: the senseis are extremely dedicated and helpful. They are patient, understanding, and they really desire you to grow in your grasp of the language. :) Weakness: I feel that the Japanese curriculum at Yale doesn't emphasise natural speaking as much. Even after taking 4 semesters of Japn, I realise when I went to Japan that my conversational skills are very weak. That is probably because the kind of speaking practices that we do in class are not 'natural conversations' but specific Q&A. The tutorial sections are not helpful either. The TAs aren't very good at helping us improve."

    "You should absolutely take this course. If you've come to the point of completing Yale's language requirement through Japanese, you've already been through the ringer. Don't lose the language skills you've worked so hard on so farbring them to new heights with L4!",
    "Yes, I heard previously that Yale's Japanese program is better than any other top school, now after enrolling in Japanese for a year I am truly convinced.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in taking their Japanese to the next level and gaining a firm grammar foundation. It is one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, it's a great way to expand your current knowledge of Japanese.",
    "Definitely."
