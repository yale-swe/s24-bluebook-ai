   "comments": [
    "I learned how to CRISPR\/Cas9; VERY COOL!",
    "Nothing",
    "I learned helpful lab techniques like pippeting and PCR.",
    "We mostly performed molecular techniques, like qPCR, transformations, and nucleic acid quantification. I think that I gained valuable experience with these skills",
    "Relevant and standard molecular biology methods",
    "I learned about how to develop an experiment, various methods in molecular biology that I can use in lab research, as well as how to write a science paper for a journal.",
    "You learn how to conduct basic as well as more complicated laboratory techniques as well as how to write a research paper.",
    "Developed basic laboratory and research skills",
    "This course was my first introduction to any kind of benchwork. I came in not even knowing how to pipette, which we did a ton of. We were introduced to qPCR, making cDNA, doing a ribosomal pull down, etc. This course was definitely challenging but part of it was because students were confused about why they were doing what they were doing during lab. It was only at the end of this course when we had to write our paper that all the techniques and steps started to make sense. Regardless, I came out with stellar pipetting skills and was exposed to the concept behind an experiment and how it is carried out.",
    "Although lab experience is definitely recommended, if you want a crash course in lab techniques, this course will definitely meet that requirement. Understanding the work done through writing the final paper helped substantiate the actual lab work, and this course offered a taste of actual lab work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Students could be allowed to do more things.",
    "The course provides great opportunities for data analysis and experiments but was poorly planned and often a lot of time is wasted waiting around for the TAs to prepare something which could have been done before.",
    "The strengths were that the course gave us a sense of independence, which allowed us to learn a lot. The weakness was how long lab would sometimes last",
    "Really relevant methods and topics. Nelson was also really engaged with the students. Understandably, the lab classroom just moved due to the renovations, so things were all over the place. It would have been better if the reagents and other supplies were better equipped and managed, so people are not asking what to do or where things are every now and then. Should be better next year, I think\/hope! Also, I hope there were better feedback with lab techniques!",
    "The fact that we did 3 projects at the same time got very confusing. I feel like having only one (which was the case in the second half) would have helped avoid most of it. The way that problem sets were worded was a bit obscure, and most of the time we needed clarification on things. But other than that, it was a well-structured course.",
    "Strengths: developed a lot of lab skills, learned about lab techniques and relevance of each step\/reagent in a protocol, cool that we got to work on a project that is inspired by real research at Yale Weaknesses: not enough reagents to go around so everyone was always scrambling for them and getting in each other's way, no feedback on any assignment, such long hours",
    "There were so many people in the course who needed to do all the same things in lab that often it took much longer to complete a lab than it should. A lot of the lab was waiting for a centrifuge to become available or waiting for materials to become available. The lab was not efficiently run. The PSETs did help me understand what was going on in class, and personally I thought they were graded fairly. But a lot of the material on the PSETs seemed to be beyond what we covered in class. I appreciated the lectures and explanations Professor Nelson gave and how willing he was to help students.",
    "The biggest improvement would be a bit more clarity along the way of the steps taken in the lab. While these were explained in a pre-work lecture, a bit more guidance certainly would have helped out as well, from both the TAs and Professor Nelson."

    "Take it if you don't have much lab experience.",
    "Chill lab for MCDB premeds",
    "A good course, especially when compared to other bio\/chem labs. Prof. Nelson is a relaxed guy, and the small class size gave an independent feel to the class. In this setting, I also made some new friends since it was often more efficient to work in groups. I recommend this course",
    "Relevant molecular biology lab methods. A good taste of how labs work and tackle problems\/experiments, while also under the organization of a class structure. Great experience! And Ken Nelson is great.",
    "Yes-although it was a bit confusing at times, I still think it's one of the best ways to fulfill your premed bio lab requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is not afraid to spend a lot of time in lab, and who wishes to obtain more lab experience.",
    "I guess I would recommend it if you have a light semester. I guess one redeeming quality of this lab was that it is 0.5 credit for a half semester. The lab hours were so long, and we usually left in the range of 5:30 to 7. Although the lab work itself is not too terribly difficult, being in the lab for SO LONG is so draining and there are not enough reagents to go around so everyone was always scrambling for things and a lot of times a lot of people didn't know what was going on. With that said, the research topics were pretty interesting and I did learn a lot about lab research and the logic behind different protocols. There's not much feedback in the class concerning our PSETs or lab notebook and there is only one big paper at the end, so I'm not sure how my grade will turn out.",
    "This course was my first introduction to any kind of benchwork. I came in not even knowing how to pipette, which we did a ton of.

It was only at the end of this course when we had to write our paper that all the techniques and steps started to make sense. Regardless, I came out with stellar pipetting skills and was exposed to the concept behind an experiment and how it is carried out. Be aware that meeting twice a week is very time consuming. It is great that you can complete your 1 year bio lab requirement for premeds, but it is quite tiring (I was exhausted after 342L and that was only half the semester). That said though, I learned a great deal and Professor Nelson is a dedicated professor who really his students to learn. It might be challenging for someone coming from a non-bio background as myself but the TAs were extremely helpful in answering my questions. Furthermore, the final paper was challenging not only because of its length but also the depth of understanding that is required. While this course is much less work than many other bio labs, I certainly gained a lot from it.",
    "If you want a more intensive lab course that pushes a bit more of a challenge than many other lab courses, this is definitely a place to start looking. However, the course is best suited to those who have some lab experience already, and shouldn't be too challenging if that's the case (given you have familiarity with the methods)."
