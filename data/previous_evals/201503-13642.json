   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is very useful and helpful.",
    "Great class! You read and write reviews of a bunch of distributed systems papers, give a presentation on one, and make a final project. - You end up understanding a lot of the seminal systems (LFS, GFS, BigTable, Spanner, Dynamo, MR, Chubby, etc) well since you write reviews of them - Mahesh has a ton of industry experience working with these systems and is great at cutting through the bs of these papers and letting ya know whats actually up. - Since the idea of the class is for it to be a journal style thing where students present for most of the class, you have to listen to fairly uninsightful babel for a lot of time. But it's all worth it for the 10 minutes of Mahesh's thoughts at the end! - How to improve: More Mahesh talking, less kids talking",
    "Good for a student who want to have an overview of a bunch of system designs.",
    "Yes sure. It will describe every aspect that a distributed system would involve. The discussion is really inspiring.",
    "This course covers most major topics and seminal papers in distributed systems. Organized as a paper reading group, the course involves writing paper reviews, presenting papers, and a term-long project. Mahesh is a fantastic professor. His teaching is logical and his explanation of major concepts are very intuitive. With a rich background in distributed systems (esp. in industry), he provides invaluable perspectives on the history of the papers and fun anecdotes.",
    "The final project is being really helpful",
    "Cloud Computing has been my most interesting CS class so far. That being said, I don't think it is a class for everyone. The class is based on reading a lot of papers from academic researchers and industry professionals. You can skim through the class without doing a lot of the reading, but it is probably not worth the credit if you aren't interested in learning on your own. The work consists of reading a paper and writing a one paragraph analysis for each class and making a final project. Mahesh Balakrishnan is a great new professor and I am glad that he is in the computer science department now. He is a very relaxed professor and is interested in talking to and meeting with students. Additionally, he seems much better at gauging what students are interested in learning about than most CS professors. One important note is that I thought there were way too many long student-given lectures. However, he received this feedback well and the format is likely to change in the future."

   "comments": [
    "This course involves many aspects of designing distributed systems and cloud computing systems, which are directly related to my research.",
    "Not bad.",
    "Distributed system is very essential to computer science nowadays.",
    "Papers combined with a final projects is good for grasping general concepts and details",
    "This course was an extremely interesting introduction to cloud and distributed computing. I feel like it was very helpful for me to identify other areas of study that I would like to learn about over the course of my studies at Yale."
