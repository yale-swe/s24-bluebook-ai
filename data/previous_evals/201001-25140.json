   "comments": [
    "Absolutely; the readings are generally excellent (do be prepared to spend good amounts of time on them), and listening to Oppenheimer gossip about his former journalistic colleagues is always a trip.",
    "Really fun class. Interesting conversations and cool people and a cool professor. We should have more seminars with this type of discussion in the PoliSci dept.",
    "I would recommend this class for an interesting and chill seminar with a great, fun environment.",
    "You read a collection of the best journalists in history -- the reading list was one of my favorite parts, so even if you can't get in, email him and ask for the syllabus so you can do it on your own. Then, you discuss each writer for a bit thanks to papers everyone has to write, and you spend other time talking about particular magazines or the future of journalism. This was less of a \"here is the history of trends in political journalism\" and much more of a \"here are the legendary contributors and contributions to political journalism.\" A great course.",
    "The reading list is excellent. You\u0092ll either love or be irritated by the professor\u0092s strong personality and the way he leads discussions.",
    "yes its easier though if you know something about american politics",
    "You read great works of political journalism and talk about them. And write two papers. If you like reading political articles and magazines, then it's great",
    "A \"great books\" course for political journalism...a fun course to take.",
    "This class is a blast. It's a brief run-through of great hits in US journalism, and has great reading. More importantly, class discussions are very fun, informative, and genuinely enjoyable. Much of this is due to Prof Oppenheimer, who is as knowledgeable of journalistic and political scuttlebutt as he is willing to share it. This past year, it also had a great cross section of students with different areas of expertise. I'd definitely recommend it. Only one word of caution: the grading does involve lots of comments on style, not just content.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. This has been my favorite class at Yale. Never before have I actually looked forward to doing the reading for the week."
