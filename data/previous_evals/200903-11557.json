    "This is the standard intermediate level language course - but much much better than one of the more common languages, all because of the small class size and Maria. If you've taken L1 and L2, definitely take this! I'd say in general it's easier than L2 because you have more of a command of the language.",
    "TAKE GREEK TAKE GREEK TAKE GREEK. Wonderful course, Maria is the best woman ever and its just a fabulous course on the whole. Definitely up there as one of my favourite classes at Yale. (Its also just four days a week...)",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn a foreign language. When I went to my first Greek class, I didn't even know how to say \"Hello\", or \"thank you\" in Greek. Now I can have all sorts of conversations in Greek. So, my advice, take it.",
    "YES definitely recommend it! It is a great class and cool language to learn. You will have a great time and Maria really wants you to do well in the class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to a fellow student -- the environment is relaxed, the teacher is wonderful, and you really do learn the nuances of the Greek language.",
    "It covers a new set of vocabulary and slightly higher level of grammar. I would recommend it.",
    "Take it."
