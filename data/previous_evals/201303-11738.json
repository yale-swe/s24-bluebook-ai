    "Take it only if you're interested in the topic. Workload is pretty light too",
    "Highly recommended. Fun course (a lot of reading, but skim it.. you don't actually HAVE to do it) with lots of pertinent information on how our current economic system works. Lots of food for thought",
    "Great class! As an Economics major, definitely got a chance to learn about a completely different way of looking at social issues and evaluating them. Professor Wherry is awesome and suuuuper helpful in understanding some of the complex ideas, and even giving direction when it comes to additional readings or career advice.",
    "SOCY 321 is a social analysis of markets and deals with how markets are created, propped up, and made to function based on individuals, social norms, and government agencies ideas of what the market and the social should look like.Would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in how markets work beyond the crazy numbers and X graphs that made you drop intro macro."
