   "comments": [
    "I learned how to complete readings in a timely manner and to understand them along the way. I also learned how to participate in discussions on the readings and material related to them. I learned how to correlate humanities and medicine (Science) something that I thought was almost impossible to do.",
    "-understanding objectivity as an unattainable aim in medicine -humanity of medicine and doctor's role -cultural context of medicine -importance of expressing uncertainty -legal effects of uncertainty",
    "I developed the ability to knowledgeably talk about the interaction between medicine, the arts, and the humanities in a way that is both approachable and intellectual.",
    "I learned how to consider the role of humanities in medicine. Definitely enjoyed the in class demonstrations of how music is important in being a doctor, and also how art and paintings show you more than what you think you see.",
    "This course increased my understanding of both historical and contemporary gaps\/issues in assuring certainty in medicine. It also provided a fairly broad historical basis for different medical traditions and offered a way for us to talk and think critically about the flawed system in which we live - what we are inheriting, and what ways we can troubleshoot it to be more sure about the ways providers affect patients. My own confidence in discussion-based environments increased, and because the readings were often really interesting, I was excited to engage with them each session.",
    "A great deal about medical texts that were more focused on the humanities side of medicine than the scientific and clinical side.",
    "Knowledge of medicine and medical humanities"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked the readings and extra things we did in class apart from what was expected, including going to the museum and having speakers come into class. I think having more of a variety of readings as well as longer readings throughout the course would have improved the experience as well.",
    "Amazing speakers and class trip to Art Gallery.",
    "I think the strengths of the course was the readings selected and the demonstrations of programs to connect medicine and the arts, in particular (Duffy intervention, Center for British Art, etc). I think the weaknesses of the course were the amount of time spent on Arrowsmith (too little) and perhaps the fact that the day-to-day structure of the class was quite similar.",
    "Strength: GREAT balance between the professors. One was a psychiatrist and the other has a PhD in comparative literature and a background in psychology. I enjoyed the wide range of texts we read, and hope to see them repeat many of these readings for their future classes. Feedback on papers is outstanding. They each give annotated versions back to you of your essays so you know exactly what worked and what didn't. I loved the intimacy of the course too! They take time to get to know you outside of class. We had pizza together at the end of the year outside of class! You really feel like it's a family. Weaknesses: The idea of reading a book little by little outside of class (Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis) wasn't very effective and was time consuming.",
    "I absolutely LOVED this freshman seminar. I'm premed but am majoring in two humanities-related subjects, so I definitely came to the class with a vested interest in the subject, but I think that this seminar has the potential to appeal to a wide range of people. I especially liked visiting the YUAG and listening to visiting lecturers (doctors from Yale New Haven, Columbia, etc.)",
    "The readings and the general topics they fell under were interesting and engaging to read, and the discussion usually provided provocative avenues of thought. Sometimes the technicalities of figuring out who was to speak next during discussion interrupted the flow of thought, but that isn't unusual for a small seminar full of eager students! I think the semester-long reading project (Arrowsmith) is a good idea, but perhaps would be better executed with a more relevant\/contemporary text and more frequent check-in style assignments to keep students on track. Generally, though, the freshman seminar program is a true strength of the freshman liberal arts experience - I was really glad to have the opportunity to participate in such a focused experience so early on.",
    "More clarity and guidance for the assignments",
    "Great insight into medicine, no real deep engagement with readings."

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was a very interesting subject, especially but not limited to students interested in medicine. I think it made me think of medicine and science in a new and different way.",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in pre-med, science philosophy, and policy. It's a unique class on an important subject matter. Readings are interesting and the class goes to the art gallery and has really exciting speakers.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even one not interested in the pre-med track. I found the connections between medicine and the humanities so engaging and thorough, and I really enjoyed our discussions in class!",
    "YES TAKE THIS. Whether you're premed or not, this is very well taught (and we were the first year this was taught!). I expect it to improve in subsequent years because they really took time to listen to our feedback individually at the end of the year.",
    "This class is fascinating - definitely take it if you are interested in intersection points between medicine and the humanities! William and Moira are so lovely and genuinely care about their students, in and out of the classroom.",
    "I would recommend the freshman seminar program in general to give a good basis for future study in the liberal arts - we're lucky to have the opportunity to engage with professors and other students in the seminar environment so early on. I would recommend this course in terms of the two-professor format and its interesting readings and thought-provoking discussion. It also isn't a very large workload, although it is not a consistent reading load across weeks. Generally, if offered again, this is a great course to give a humanities lens to the studies that are very important to pre-meds - but I would also encourage people who are not pre-med at all to take it, and provide a different viewpoint to discussion!",
    "Yes, I think the instructors are very determined to work out any kinks that were present in this class's first run, and I learned a lot. I found the material very interesting and discussions were very engaging.",
    "Yes if interested in medicine"
