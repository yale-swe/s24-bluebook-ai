   "comments": [
    "Taking this course teaches you the fundamentals of one variable differentiable calculus. I learned how to balance psets with my other work, as well as how to prepare for long tests.",
    "I definitely learned how to work hard in a class and the importance of office hours and understanding your problem sets.",
    "Calc 1",
    "The class challenged my calculus skills, and taught me calc 1 in a very rigorous course.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of limits and how to derive derivatives from first principles.",
    "I acquired a basic, but intriguing introduction to calculus, which I had never before encountered.",
    "I learned Calculus, although I found myself doing much of the learning on my own.",
    "Basic calculus 1 skills",
    "I learned to better understand how calculus relates to the real world.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the fundamental, key concepts of calculus one and its applications in real life.",
    "Developed a solid foundation in calculus.",
    "Abilities in calculus.",
    "I learned how to think crtically about calculus 'and how to problem solve in a new way.",
    "I had already taken calculus courses in high school, so I was prepared for this class. However, my ability to apply my knowledge to any kind of situation certainly improved. In high school, it was very repetitive and mechanical, but at Yale, MATH 112 forced me to apply those mechanics to many different situations. I feel much more prepared to use my knowledge in the future. That being said, I also definitely learned some new concepts as well.",
    "While refreshing and adding to my previous Calculus knowledge, this course most importantly gave me insights into taking a college math course.",
    "I learned the basics of calculus and gained a deeper understanding of math. Tis course will help me in the future if i decide to take math 115."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is not actually taught very well, and insight is only gained through practice problems. People who had not previously taken Calculus struggled a lot.",
    "I felt like they expected everyone to have at least some base knowledge of calculus before going into this course (which I did not have), so it felt like I was trying to catch up from the beginning.",
    "I think the way the textbook and psets were structured was quite helpful, such as those that contained questions that were not pulled from textbook. In terms of organization overall, I think everything was adequately spaced out to give me enough time to learn everything. The only issue I had was that there was a difference in learning level among the students during the class, so the division of time between certain topics was a little scattered (i.e. I wish we spent less time on taking derivatives and more time on differential equations).",
    "Remove web assign",
    "Strength: The teaching style, combining online homework, in class work, and psets. Weakness: Material at the beginning was taught a little too fast under the assumption everyone understood it, as most in my class had already taken AP Calculus.",
    "The course could use more work on making the in class work more on par with the tests. I found myself having to teach myself lots of things I was expected to know without learning them in class. Tests were far more difficult than problem sets.",
    "The online homework is a strength, immediate feedback is nice.",
    "Web-assign was a weakness of this course, as it ultimately served more difficulties than advantageous work. Another weakness of this course was the lack of teaching in class. The class was focused mainly on practice problems, which are ultimately helpful, when instead it would have been more productive to actually learn the material in class after reading the text.",
    "Too fast, confusing. But the expectation of the course is clear.",
    "The online part of the course felt unnecessary. I learned a lot doing the written psets, the online ones felt like an excuse to assign more work.",
    "The strengths are that it is clear the curriculum is set up to give a comprehensive introduction to calculus. The weakness is that the course seems a little rushed because they attempt to pack so many topics into one semester.",
    "It was a very well taught course. The only weakness that stands out is that trying to understand the concepts solely through the textbook at the end of a WebAssign assignment was difficult and frustrating. Other than that, it was a very strong course.",
    "My instructor was Daping Weng. He was very energetic and a better than average teacher (although I had already taken Calc AB in high school so the class went a little more smoothly for me anyway), always had a great attitude and was always willing to spend time out of class to help me understand certain topics I was having trouble with. The class as a whole sometimes did not seem well organized, as we'd learn topics in class with simple applications and then got much harder problems on the tests that I felt we weren't prepared for. Workload is not bad - one problem set a week (couple hours) and WebAssign (online, annoying)",
    "The strengths of this course lied in the many different help sessions available between peer tutors and instructor office hours. My biggest problem is the inconsistently of problem set grading. Some weeks, the problem sets were graded more leniently with the emphasis only being on the final answer; other weeks, the work was meticulously grading, more in following with the syllabus' grading policies. While this inconsistency was not detrimental, it was somewhat annoying to work hard on neatness and detail when the p-set was given a cursory glance by the grader.",
    "I think that the course does not do a very good job of explaining the concepts in a way that makes the rest of the material accessible. I think more time could be spent in class working on practice problems."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it is important that people have a strong background in math and should definitely try to take intro courses such as math 112. The workload was not bad and the material is accessible.",
    "NO",
    "Only if you have some knowledge of calculus beforehand",
    "I think this course is a great way to ease into learning math here at Yale.",
    "I'm pretty neutral about this. I think it was helpful in building a foundation for future math classes, but if I could place out of it, I would. However, if you have never taken a higher level math course, this class is a requirement anyway.",
    "If you dont need calc I definitely would not recommend this class.",
    "If the student was interested in starting to learn calculus, yes.",
    "If you have not taken Calculus before, this class is very difficult.",
    "Yes if you like math it's a good QR and preparation for Math 115",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who has not taken calculus before, but i would recommend to anyone who wants to reestablish their previous foundations in the subject.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. Otherwise, not at all an exciting course.",
    "No. If you need to take it, try to find the best TA possible. Most of them are subpar teachers and you will have to learn most concepts on your own.",
    "I would receive mend this class to anyone who has to take a quantive reaoning credit ornis interested in the basis of Calculus.",
    "Yes. Having a basic knowledge of calculus is vital to success, especially in college. Taking this class will successfully allow you to absorb that knowledge. A high school background in calculus would certainly maximize the potential of this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it functions well as a basic introduction (or reintroduction) to simpler calculus principles.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in calculus."
