   "comments": [
    "This is not a good class - it is relatively easy, and shouldn't add much to your prior knowledge from Math 230-31 or Math 250. In addition, the class is 90% definitions which didn't appeal to me. Our take-home final was, to say the least, unreasonable. If you take the class, prepare for a lot of heavy calculations and few actual concrete ideas to extract from it.",
    "It was alright. Moncrief used an undergrad book for most of the course, so it wasn't extremely difficult. The last two weeks are so are a lot harder to understand, but he didn't assign any homework for those lectures. The midterm was open book and the final was take-home, but were very time-consuming. While I can't say I was truly inspired by this course, it was a decent elementary introduction to the topic.",
    "I would recommend MATH 430 if you are interesting in learning about the properties of curves and surfaces in space.",
    "Take the course if you're interested in geometry and topology. It's pretty fascinating stuff. The course is an interesting blend of classical and modern differential geometry, split into two halves: classical diff geo and modern diff geo. The first half of the course was very well done. It was structured nicely, flowed well, and taught us a lot. The second half of the course was not nearly as well done (though it was certainly more interesting on an intellectual level). I found the second half to be structured rather shakily (as if we were making up which direction we were headed in as we went along), there was no homework assigned to help us learn the new material, and a lot of the material felt extremely rushed (indeed it seems that some of the concepts we touched on would require a single course (or even yearlong sequence) to be dealt with in any appreciable way, not the 20 minutes of class time that we were given). The first midterm was a reasonable open-book exam taken in class, which should've been negotiable (I messed it up but that's my own fault). The second midterm was a take home exam that was brutally difficult. Most of the students gave up on trying to answer some of the questions in detail. That said, it should be noted the exam was take-home because some of our classes got snowed out. It probably wouldn't have been nearly as difficult or long if it was an in-class exam. The homework was pretty reasonable, though it basically disappeared in the second half of the course. Most people would consider this a good thing, but the second half of the semester dealt with some really challenging topics and I'd have appreciated some exercises to solidify the knowledge.",
    "This class is very loose. Professor Moncrief lectures densely out of the textbook twice a week, and you turn in some relatively computational homework once in a while. That said, the actual class meetings are not particularly engaging, and the homework doesn't really help you learn the material. The content of this course is mostly easy enough if you meet the prereqs, but the exams were very difficult (at least this year). If you choose to take it, I highly recommend taking this as a sophomore, after Math 231 or 250. It's good reinforcement of Vector Calc and analytic geometry, but I didn't think it was very interesting in its own right."
