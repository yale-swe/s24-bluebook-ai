   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a much-needed and not widely available background on Latin American Gender debates, questions, movements, as well as with knowledge of Latin American history, politics, literature, intellectual history, and cinema. This is one of the most solid courses I ever had in my student life, as an undergrad or graduate student, and now I feel I am able to write, do research and address crucial topics not only for Latin American but on a global scale.",
    "I learned how to analyze the deeper meaning behind social interactions, films and stories. I learned a lot about the political climates in several Latin American countries and honestly feel my eyes were opened to viewing the world differently. We got to talk to people who lived through different, important events and analyze gender politics in real time",
    "Amazing understanding of both theory and real world examples of Latin American feminisms.",
    "It feels difficult to answer this question because I gained so much! It was incredibly refreshing to take a course on Latin America that was actually taught from a Latin American perspective, and the fact that it was in Spanish not only greatly expanded the possibility for material but provided one of the best Spanish-speaking spaces I have ever been in at Yale as a native speaker.",
    "In taking this course I gained an understanding of the history of various women's and gender movements in Latin America and how they differed with those of North America."

   "comments": [
    "I cannot detect a weakness in this course, and, in fact, I do not think the course had any. Consequently, the course had many strengths that could fill many pages. However, I want to focus on some of those strengths that, in my opinion, are among the most important ones in any class, regardless of the level, the institution, or the topic. First, this class was a safe space where each of the students could share thoughts, ideas, opinions, without being judged. Second, as a result of the latter, instead of having just a regular class, we had a community, a group of people that supported each other and therefore, engaged in meaningful conversations and enriched each other with our experiences, thoughts, suggestions, and knowledge. As a result, strong friendships have been born out of this class, something that is not usual at Yale, at least during my experience here. Third, the knowledge was constructed in a dialogical way, an interchange where no one had the last word or the whole truth. Away from academic poses and highly rigid hierarchies, this class was fruitful, precisely because we thought together, and we built knowledge together, in a horizontal experience. Last but not least, this course provided us with analytical skills, through an up to date theoretical lens, crucial for understanding the complex social and politic processes and issues we were discussing and studying. A set of skills that are the most valuable addition to any education and that will remain with us for the rest of our life.",
    "It was really great at keeping us engaged in lecture. We always had a set topic to talk about and people would share either personal experiences or their thoughts over the works we read. We had a diverse class so we got to hear a lot of different perspectives. We also often had visitors who would share different insights into certain countries political gender climates",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Dr. Fradinger, who apart from being incredibly knowledgeable on the subject from both academic and life experience is a brilliant and exciting instructor. The syllabus was already fascinating on its own, but she allowed us to alter it according to our own interests which was absolutely wonderful.",
    "The strengths of this class were the quality of the sources assigned for reading and watching, as they were all very varied and interesting and would have been difficult to find if one were doing research on one's own. Moira's dedication to the subject and the class was also a strength, I have never had a professor who was so excited about the material and about fostering a sense of community within the class. However, this class struggled with being open to both graduate students and undergrads. The majority of the students were undergrads, but often the discussions were only directed towards graduate students with very little room for participation from anyone else."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to future students, especially those who work on or are interested in Latin America in general and in the region recent politics, gender debates, feminist theory, transgender writings, and many other topics that are not simply at hand in the United States, or least not with the deep knowledge and impressive knowledge of the region history, of feminist tradition, of the recent situation of the continent that Professor Fradinger has and shared generously with us.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students! I learned a lot about political climates in Latin America and had fun doing it. This was especially helpful for me, having grown up in the United States to parents from Latin America but feeing a little out of touch with the history. Professor Moira gave me avenues through which to continue to stay educated!",
    "Yes! If you're at all considering this class you absolutely must take it. The professor is incredible, the readings are mind blowing, and the assignments are flexible and interesting.",
    "100%. If you are interested at all in Latin America, this course is a MUST, in fact a requirement. Even if your Spanish isn't completely at an academic level, this course is fantastic and you will leave it a different thinker.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another undergraduate student unless they had a very particular interest in the material being covered. It is not a class in which you will be able to practice your oral spanish skills or participate in discussion unless you have background knowledge."
