    "I would recommend Spanish 586 to a fellow graduate student in Spanish. Although the course only focused on one of the many works we are expected to be familiar with in the field of medieval literature, several of the texts we used to approach the Libro de buen amor (particularly theological\/philosophical works and medieval poetry) are also applicable to other texts.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 586 to another student. I think it is a great course if one is interested in learning about medieval literature and in having the opportunity to read closely and think deeply about the text.",
    "A detailed analysis of Juan Ruiz's Libro de buen amor. Yes, I would recommend this class to another student interested in medieval Spanish literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided a very in-depth approach to the Libro de buen amor as well as a point of departure for other medieval texts. I feel that this course will be helpful in preparing for doctoral exams, for both specialists and non-specialists in medieval literature.",
    "This course helped me to get an introduction to medieval Spanish literature. I think the close-reading skills I developed during the course will serve me in my dissertation and further research. I learned a lot about theology during this course as well, which I anticipate will help me very much in the future."
