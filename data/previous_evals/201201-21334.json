    "it was a pain, but helpful in the end... i guess. you could probably do the class without it",
    "This section just goes over material in lecture. There is no work, it's pretty easy you just show up.",
    "Sure it's annoying to devote an hour a week to an additional section but it's well worth it to have a forum to discuss questions and review complicated material. I was so glad to have switched down from chem 114 at the beginning of the year so that I could have more one-on-one time to discuss the concepts covered.",
    "Much better than 114\/115",
    "This is a good supplement to the lecture course and it will really help you get through the class. Take advantage of the TAs, because they're a lot more approachable than the professor!",
    "It's a helpful supplement.",
    "Standard general chemistry course, not too thrilling, but take it if you need to.",
    "I would not recommend it. Too much work, not enough help, too hard.",
    "It is definitely worthwhile taking because problem solving is an important life skill, and I found it interesting",
    "This was the problem solving section for CHEM 113. During the section we went over concepts learned during class, did some sample problems, and sometimes covered information that wasn't covered during lecture. You're required to go to two sections for CHEM 113. This one is the night section. The other section is in the afternoon and during that one, you go over problem sets and sometimes review concepts learned during lecture. Having to go to two sections is kind of tedious, but it's part of taking General Chemistry with Problem Solving. If you don't want to go to two sections, take CHEM 114\/115+.",
    "The extra practice and clarification this section gives is great, especially if you have a TA who runs it well."
