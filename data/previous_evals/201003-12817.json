   "comments": [
    "Good class. You get to brush up on a lot of the principles from L1-L4. A good class to take before trying out some of the higher level discussion classes. As always, it depends who's in the section.",
    "This class fills in some of the gaps in grammar and is very focused on the needs of the class. We learn some good vocab too and have interesting assignments, like watching Israeli commercials",
    "For anyone who has taken L4, I highly recommend this class. It is very interesting and will bring your Hebrew to a whole other level",
    "Fun and interesting class, good practice with practical skills like reading online newspapers, talking about real-world things. Not a lot of structure in terms of learning grammar, etc, so probably better for someone who is more confident in those areas and wants to learn tools for speaking better.",
    "great class! if you've made it this far, you probably know the hebrew department--super sweet, wonderful teachers, really care about you and about the class, tailor the class to the level and interests of the students.",
    "Hebrew 150 is a logical and effective continuation of the grammar component of the Hebrew program. Although I may have wished for more intensive grammar study, it was very helpful and I had ample opportunities to practice my language skills, especially in writing."
