   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class if you have time in your schedule for the reading and if you are on board with spending a good chunk of class time discussing character. The reading was definitely heavier than most other classes I'd taken. Sometimes I had to be careful about reading ahead one to make time for assignments in other classes the next, but it never felt impossible to finish what was assigned.",
    "Outstanding, rigorous senior seminar. Yeazell is brilliant and wonderful and knows everything there is to know about James; the readings are a mixed bag but well worth having done (especially the second half of the semester). Heavy reading load but not too much of anything else. James was not an obvious candidate for me to spend a whole semester on but Yeazell made it worth it.",
    "The first thing that needs to be said--although you might think it would be obvious--is that you read a lot of James in this class. A lot. A novel a week is no joke. If James (and late James!) is not your thing, you might want to think twice about taking this.That having been said, as somewhat who does not particularly enjoy James I still enjoyed this class. Yeazell is a gifted discussion leader and this class seems to attract interesting, highly intelligent people (who are genuinely engaged with the material and not just showing off). That was the case this year, at least. Yeazell is rigorous in her evaluations of essays but also quite helpful in planning for them, and the short paper\/abstract\/long paper format of the course helps you do some advance planning for the final work. A well-designed and intense senior seminar.",
    "\u00e2\u0080\u009cHenry James,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as far as I can tell, is exactly what an English Dept. senior seminar should be: a rigorous, comprehensive introduction to the work of a single author, requiring extensive reading of primary and secondary texts and a thoroughly prepared final paper. The course focuses on James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novels, rather than his stories and tales, his travel writing, or anything else, so the reading load is very heavy, and the prose only gets denser as you wend your way through his career. So beware: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot, and the course won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be particularly rewarding if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\/don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do at least most of the reading. That said, it can be tremendously rewarding if you do; James is a capacious, fascinating subject for close reading and critical analysis. Prof. Yeazell is one of the best: warm, shrewd, witty, perceptive in her commentary in class and in private, genuinely interested in students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thoughts, an internationally respected expert on the material.",
    "I would take this class just for Ruth Yeazell, who leads great discussions and reads papers with a lot of rigor and care. On that basis alone (regardless of how you feel about James), this is a great senior seminar. On paper, it's about half a novel to a novel a week, but it's not reading that can be picked up and put down easily; completing it requires several quiet uninterrupted hours. James is not an easy read, but the course is incredibly satisfying, and a lot of fun. Single-author classes are tricky, but definitely shop it (and shop the classmates, who made all the difference this semester).",
    "This class was a ton of work, but it was so worth it. Prof. Yeazell was a delight. She was truly an expert in her field, and it showed in the level and quality of the discussions. She was incredibly able and willing to help students with their papers, and always open to meeting with me about my ideas. I would recommend this course to be the hardest course in a person's semester, but if you have the time to put into it, you will get so much out of it.",
    "Take it. I love James and loved this course. Often didn't quite get to the end of books--there was just too much to read. But the class was so good you will wish you had. A hard class to take with 5 credits."
