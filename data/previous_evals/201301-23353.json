   "comments": [
    "good in-depth look at different energy technologies. whether you know nothing or a lot about energy you can get a lot out of the class.",
    "Yes. Great class. Hopefully the reading can be cut down and it can be made more discussion based.",
    "I'd highly recommend the seminar to anyone who's interested in energy economics.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a crash course on all issues of all energy sources.",
    "Professor Kessides is a knowledgeable and kind professor. The coursework has a fair workload, with one policy paper and research paper, and Professor Kessides makes an incredible effort to make himself available to help you work through any concerns you may have. The class tends to be taught more as a lecture than as a discussion. I recommend this course!",
    "It was a great class with a very knowledgeable economist from the world bank. He is not a professor by profession so he was new, which made the course inevitably confusing at times with the pace and assignment. But being interested in the topic of energy, I still got a lot from the class and thought it was interesting.",
    "Really good class, not tons of work (two big papers.) Professor is good.",
    "Yes, as it gives a great intro into a topic and is taught by someone with a more practical policy perspective than other energy econ or engineering classes",
    "It is an excellent survey course of energy issues and great if you want a broad idea of the energy sector. Take it!!",
    "Good overview of energy topics for someone who is interested in the topic and looking for an introductory course"
