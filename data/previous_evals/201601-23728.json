    "Honestly, I found almost all of the topics intriguing, having learned little about agriculture in the past. The nitrogen cycle was a bit of a review, obviously, but then the aspects of soil beyond that were completely new. i thought overall this course was a nice survey of different sustainable agriculture topics. I'm really interested in agricultural poilcy. We spent a lot of time in the literature of people doing extension work and soil work and research, and talked a bit about how this translates into action, but learning more about agricultural policies in various countries would be really constructive - and how international trade policies affect it all, too. --> (You could have a whole class about agricultural policies! I'd totally take that class next fall.) -->Also, a module about agricultural research itself. Or again, a whole class! That could have a cool research-in-New-Haven-based component. --> Agrarian history is also really important to understand, from political and scientific and social perspectives. Whether it's about a specific region or tries to describe overarching changes globally, I'd love to take a class about this. (is there one?) Assignments: I think the synthesis at the end of the week is a really good idea, but free-write lends itself a bit to monotony. I'd suggest the synthesis be: you pose a question, and using what we've learned in that week (and the preceding ones), we try to answer it.",
    "Interesting readings, which I think are really helpful for students interested in sustainable agriculture. I think this course would have been stronger if it wasn't so strictly a discussion course. Most of us came into the class without much knowledge on these topics and wanted a professor to teach them to us rather than talk amongst ourselves about things we don't know.",
    "Steve is very knowledgeable in this subject area and answered questions thoroughly. That being said, it would have been nice to have a brief lecture in the beginning of every class to make sure everyone is on the same page with the topics that were covered the readings and then launch into a discussion of bucketed questions. Think it would have been helpful to have the discussion be more structured by Steve so that we could make sure all the relevant topics were covered. I think he should have incorporated topics related to livestock management and impact here in the U.S. Besides that, I felt like we covered topics related to sustainable agriculture well. I think it would have been fun and useful to have one of the final classes be a way to sum up what we've learned in the class throughout the semester- we could have had small groups take on a topic or a question and then have them present that back to the class and then Steve could sum up in the last 15-20min of class. Presenting over people's paper's was a good idea, but it didn't go so well because it became very boring for all the students in the room listening to one person present someone else's paper for 5 min (and people ended up speaking for much longer than 5 min). It would have been a great learning opportunity for students to present a little bit on their own work and then have a Q&A and discussion after.",
    "The few times that Dr. Wood lectured were great and the class would benefit from more lecture, less discussion.",
    "What topics were most interesting? All topics till week nine What topics were least interesting? n\/a What topics should be included that werent? Role of large scale industrial Ag (politics) in weaving the narrative of food insecurity How would you change the assignments for the course? n\/a How would you change the presentation of the materialmore lecture? Yes. Have a small presentation before the class to spur discussions What types of food and ag classes do you think are needed at Yale?",
    "I found the soil science and pollinator topics to be the most interesting ones. I think the weekly syntheses became incredibly difficult to complete towards the end of the semester and I would have appreciated a few weeks off from the syntheses to focus on the final paper. I also think that the course would benefit from some more lecture based teaching. There are so many topics covered in this class that it is nearly impossible to have a full understanding of all of them and this makes it really difficult to go straight into discussion most of the time. Perhaps beginning the class with a short lecture and then finishing with a discussion would be a good way to start conversation and provide the background needed for a deeper discussion.",
    "I really enjoyed the material we were assigned in this course. The breadth of topics covered was very relevant to my interest in understanding sustainable agriculture. Due to my lack of foundational knowledge on the topic, I would have preferred a more lecture-based class, where I would have gained more knowledge on certain topics than through discussion. A field trip would have been great!!"

I was less familiar with the natural sciences related to ag, and there are few opportunities at FES to cover these topics (except for soils, perhaps). I understand it was scratching the surface of some of the topics, but it was helpful to get a grasp of what the current conversations are surrounding some of these topics (climate change, soils, biodiversity, etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes class discussion needed a bit more structure. On the days that we had lectures before we started the reading, I felt like I learned the most, but this did not always happen.",
    "More input from Steve. Organized courses with lecture components. More emphasis on specific agriculture techniques rather than broader ideas and social aspects.",
    "There should be more instruction\/lecturing by the professor. The class was conducted in more of a seminar style with discussions every class. It would have been great if the professor gave a lecture on the topics before each discussion (he did this for some but not all topics)",
    "More structured facilitation as noted earlier",
    "I would recommend a bit more lecturing from Steve to frame the topics that will be discussed. I'd suggest that there be about 4 readings per week, and have the first day of the week be primarily a framing lecture, and the second day of the week be more discussion-based. Alternatively, the course may work better as a once-a-week class for 3 hours to allow for a short lecture at the beginning followed by discussion. I think the discussions will be richer when all students feel they have a reasonable understanding of the material rather than simply having read the papers. It seemed that at times we spent most of the discussion addressing questions about the technical aspects that may be better covered in a brief lecture.",
    "More lecture or primer-type readings are necessary to get more out of the class",
    "As said earlier, I think this class would benefit from a little more lecture to balance the discussions.",
    "There should have been more lectures woven in to provide foundational knowledge of the topics at hand. Perhaps a longer class once a week which could have been part lecture, part discussion would have been a better format. It was also weird to have such a short class period twice a week for a seminar formatted class.",
    "I think the format of the class times could be switched up a bit more. Sometimes I found that having class discussions twice per week were not as fulfilling, especially during times of the semester when it seemed that fewer people were doing the readings. I'm not entirely sure it should switch to lectures format, maybe here and there. I think it was a good idea to have a student lead a portion of the class discussion. If not the entire class discussion, at least once per semester. It was mentioned but we didn't end up doing this. Alternatively, it could be led by pairs of students, so the responsibility wouldn't fall solely on one student during each class."

    "I am an undergraduate and I am interested in food systems and human health. This course was a good way to explore various aspects of agriculture, and such courses are very limited in number in Yale College (and at FES).",
    "My main area of interest is in sustainable agriculture but I have not had any academic training in the subject. This course was therefore a great introduction to sustainable agriculture from an academic perspective. It would be great to have more courses on food an agriculture at FES.",
    "Focusing on agricultural issues at FES has been a bit of a challenge -- while there are a few courses, it is great to have a broader overview that looks at a lot of issues. Since there are not many agriculture courses, each that I have taken here runs into the problem of trying to be both an introductory and advanced course at once. I would recommend that the existing courses, or additional courses be re-organized slightly so there is at least one course (preferably offered in the fall) that is clearly an introduction to agricultural issues. That would help other classes build off that foundation and allow students in them to start from a similar base of knowledge. I think that once challenge this course faced was that it was organized a bit more like a discussion section, but many of the students were just being introduced to the topics for the first time, which makes it hard to have a meaningful discussion. That said, this course fit well into my program because it introduced me to some of the social and economic dimensions of sustainable agriculture, especially internationally, that I am less familiar with.",
    "As someone who is interested in sustainable food systems, this is one of the few classes offered at Yale that perfectly aligns with my interests. I really appreciate this course offering and would love to see more agriculture and food classes at Yale!",
    "I'm so glad a class like this was offered, as my focus is sustainable food systems. I was really seeking a course that provided knowledge of the agricultural aspects of sustainability, and was really grateful for the opportunity to learn from Professor Wood this semester and get an introduction to soil, biodiversity, geopolitical issues, and others related to sustainable ag.
