    "Reading critically texts in linguistic and cultural anthropology in combination with philosophical texts.",
    "I learned a new framework for thinking about the materiality of the world. Because this was a linguistic anthro course, we got very concrete theoretical understanding for talking about something that otherwise would have been difficult to get a grasp on.",
    "I discovered a love of ethnography and an appreciation for critical theory.",
    "The course went over important theoretical texts on the construction of meaning. It provided good insights into how meaning is constructed and how materiality plays a role in that process. We went over some examples of these theories being applied to ethnographic examples.",
    "PIERCEAN TRICHOTOMIES",
    "I developed knowledge into linguistics, physics, time, language, and social interaction. I learned how to take better and more thorough notes in reading, and I learned serious insights into the role of technology in language and linguistic interaction \/ interpretation"

   "comments": [
    "Material was very engaging and the reading response format helped me to think through the readings. Would have liked to have more discussion in class.",
    "I loved the material, and Prof. Kockelman is a great speaker, who is committed to our learning. However, there was zero class discussion, and I thought this was a seminar. I don't know why, but no one spoke, and then it became routine that Prof. Kockelman would just talk the entire time. I didn't even learn anyone's name in the class.",
    "I thought student participation in the discussions was really weak. I was never sure if any given moment was a good one for participation.",
    "The strength is that the material is very interesting and that it can broaden the theoretical frameworks useful for analysis of social phenomena. Professor Kockelman taught us very well these theories using digestible terms. The weakness is that it did not include that many examples of the application of these theories. It would certainly have been more helpful to go over more examples to see how we can each apply to our own topic of interest. There were also very few letter grades being given to the class over the semester, and we had no idea how we were being graded.",
    "All strengths, no weaknesses... maybe just a bit more context for some of the readings."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to students in anthropology or philosophy or those generally interested in social theory. The readings are very much not grounded in real world examples and it would be a class for people who enjoy these sorts of theoretical debates.",
    "This course is excellent, addresses fundemental questions most courses skim over.",
    "you get a fair grasp on the theoretical frameworks used throughout different points in time to talk about the core \"materiality\" of the world. No class discussion, which is unfortunate, maybe that will change in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wishing to gain different perspectives for analysis of social phenomena. It covers a wide range of topics, and it was certainly useful for me. The texts are quite theoretical and abstract, and if you don't enjoy such texts, it could sometimes be too much. Professor Kockelman's explanations are very good though, and in the end, I feel I have gained a good understanding of some of the most important concepts in linguistic anthropology.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. I found Paul Kockelman's approach and knowledge of linguistic anthropology to highly related to all other fields of interest. The course blended the best parts of philosophy, physics, anthropology, and history, into complex and worthwhile ideas."
