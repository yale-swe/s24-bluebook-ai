    "For someone who wants basic lab experience, wants to think in an interdisciplinary manner, and have an independent project, focus is science though art lens.",
    "This class is really incredible-- a chance for non-science majors to spend a semester engaging in real science research. I was not a science major, and still loved it. Take it if you loved science in high school but haven't had a chance to be in a lab at Yale yet. Be prepared though-- the lab sessions are long. I would say absolutely take this class, it is an incredible experience to engage in science research, especially for non-science majors.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. As a science major you'll learn a lot about art and garner a cool new experience with an independent project. If you're a humanities major, you'll learn a ton about science. Cross pollination sure to occur.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Whether you are a science student looking for a fun chance to design your own project or a humanities major interested in gaining laboratory experience, this class will broaden your perspective in a fun, low-key environment. The premise is that you design a project that uses phage display, a molecular biology technique, to identify a material used in art and produce a chemical tool that can be used for art conservation. It sounded a bit daunting coming into the class, but the four professors - whose experience ranges from Alzheimers research to painting conservation - guide you through the process and make sure each student comes out with an interesting, meaningful project. This is one of those Yale classes that lets you utilize all of the university's amazing resources to their full potential: you get to sequence DNA in the biology labs, see famous paintings up close in a conservation lab, and talk to some of Yale's top art conservators. Also, you get an iPad for the semester. This is one of the best classes I have taken in my Yale career - please take it!",
    "An excellent introduction to two very different disciplines. Despite being a crazy amalgamation of art history\/conservation and molecular biology, the professors went to extraordinary lengths to make the class cohesive, meaningful, and personalized to each student's interests.The first half of the class is a combinations of lectures about conservation, art history, chemistry, and biology, and tours of the Yale University Art Gallery to concentrate on applications of the lecture content to specific artworks. The class is worth it alone for the extensive access to the YUAG's collection with extremely knowledgeable professors (including the YUAG's head of art conservation).The second half of the class takes place in a molecular biology lab where students conduct original experiments to identify the molecular composition of various art materials and mediums.TAKE THIS CLASS. I have never had more dedicated professors, let along 4 of them going to extreme lengths to further students' interests.",
    "This class is amazing! Take it if you are ready to learn a ton and like to take ownership over projects. This was an incredible learning opportunity: as a non-science and non-art history major who originally took the class for a science credit, I got so much more out of it than I had expected. Do plan to feel overwhelmed or confused sometimes, but know that the instructors are really accessible and want to help. This class can take as much or as little effort as you want to put into it, but you will get more out of it if you can put more time in.",
    "This is an exciting class unlike any other I've taken. In short, you have a few weeks of lectures about the chemistry\/physics of how art is created and ages, followed by the rest of the semester in lab doing work on a unique project in art conservation. The cool part is that these projects are truly unique, meaning that if your experiment is successful it could eventually lead to something that you could publish.In terms of whether or not you should take the class, here is my advice: First, don't worry about major when applying. Almost everyone in the class had a different major and that's what made it cool. Second, make sure that there's something in art\/art history that you find interesting enough to spend a lot of time on. You will almost certainly have to spend time outside of class to get through everything that you want to before the end of the semester.All in all I would highly recommend this class. Although I likely won't be working in a lab anytime in the near future, I feel like I learned a way of thinking that I can use in the future. The chance to guide your own research is a great learning experience, and this class is a cutting edge and unique way to approach lab work for the first time.",
    "Take it. Take it Take it. Take it. TAKE IT! Whether you love or hate science, whether you love or hate art, so long as you like learning, and developing relationships with your classmates and professors, you will thank yourself a million times for taking this class. The best thing about this class are the professors and classroom environment. 12 students:4 professors - is that ratio a joke?! This class made me feel genuinely cared about as a student and as a person more than any other class I've taken at Yale. The professors are extremely brilliant and successful, and yet they created an environment in which students felt comfortable to have real conversations with them. They respected us for our own ideas, and offered advice without making you feel dumb. They are so so enthusiastic about this class and making it the best possible experience for students, and everyone benefits.Some specifics\/things to be aware of to help you make your decision:Time: This class is time-consuming IN class, but not so much outside of class. I'm not sure if the class will have a different schedule next semester, but for us it met twice a week for 2 hrs each time, and often we had to stay late or come in on non lab days. The professors did not hold it against you if you couldn't stay, but it was nearly impossible to get everything done within the allotted time. So be aware of that, and don't plan anything for at least an hour after the class is supposed to be over.Workload: At the midterm, you will have to give a 10 min presentation (ppt) to the class proposing your project. A ~5 page paper is also due. At the end of the term, a final presentation and final paper are due again, basically the same just better\/longer\/more detailed etc.Content: This class IS a science class. And even though it's advertised as appropriate for non-science majors, at the end of the day, it is a lab course, and you're going up science hill, wearing lab protective gear, pipetting, mixing solutions, being asked to understand amino acid interactions, the whole shebang. The professors are GREAT and VERY APPROACHABLE to answer any\/all questions. But just don't be mistaken - it's a lab course. That being said, if you think you hate science, please do not be turned off by this!! I think this class beats out science-for-non-science majors classes, because you do relevant hard science in an environment where it's okay to have a gazillion questions."
