    "Take it. The course work is manageable, the instructor is simply awesome, and German is a fun language to learn!",
    "This is a pretty good class. It moves faster than I'd have expected, and I actually learned a fair amount of German. Sometimes class can be quite boring--Professor Niesz usually just reads the textbook out loud. He has a very clever system for watching movies in German without English subtitles, but he then asks many questions about the movies, which is helpful for learning the vocabulary and plot and practicing grammar but can get quite boring. There's not really any homework, which is nice.",
    "Anybody wanting to get started with German should definitely enroll in this course.",
    "not helpful",
    "If you want to start German, TAKE THIS CLASS with Professor Niesz. You will have a great time!I never regretted the 9:20 start time every single day, which is saying a lot!"
