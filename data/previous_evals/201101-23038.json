    "Yes, a great class. Be prepared for a lot of reading on an interesting subject.",
    "If you are lucking for a well-spun narrative survey this is not it, if you are looking for a syllabus and a professor with incredible knowledge of Iran, this is for you.",
    "The Making of Modern Iran is a great history lecture course that teaches you pretty comprehensively about Iran since the rise of the Safavid dynasty (1501). Professor Amanat does a good job of balancing political, social, and cultural history, and is just as comfortable discussing 18th century tribal warfare as he is explaining the causes of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. If you have an interest in Iranian history, or just want to understand better what's going on in that part of the world today, this class is a must. That said, the readings for the course are pretty disjointed and the lectures sometimes don't get through all of the material. Also, keep in mind that the workload is quite heavy for a lecture course: weekly reading responses, two exams, and a paper based on original research. Don't take the class lightly.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is too meticulous and very difficult without fascinating lectures or readings.",
    "As a sheer trove of historical information on Iran, this class provides a lot - if not always in the most digestible portions. The multifaceted approach is a useful way to approach history, though it occasionally contributes to the difficulty of finding a specific focus amidst all the material.",
    "This course is very manageable for someone with no prior background in Iranian or Islamic history. Professor Amanat, though kind of dry at times, really knows what he's talking about. I'd definitely recommend it. Don't be intimidated by the reading list--there are a lot of things on it, but some of them are hardly dealt with at all.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of Iran. If it is just a passing interest, you might get bored of this class, but if you are genuinely interested in Iran, this course has it all.",
    "I would take the class if the material appeals to you from the onset. You don't need to know anything about Iran before taking the class (although it can be helpful), but unless you are actively interested in learning about Iran the material can apear a little dull or irrelevant.",
    "Good survey on Iran, however, difficult if you don'r have an MMES background,Also, lectures, are somewhat dry."
