    "The Age of Goethe is an excellent class for anyone who might have even a little bit of interest in German Romanticism. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the class is not only about Goethe (not like that would be a problem, but it might be a bit boring for a survey class.) It is not a particularly hard class, but it is VERY interesting. Sometimes the reading was challenging. Both Kirk Wetters and Elisa Ronzheimer are very fair graders. There were ample extra credit opportunities, and one could choose their own topic for each essay (there were three, two short papers and one longer final paper.) Long story short, this class is great. I would recommend it.",
    "It was a good course, but very theoretical and niche -- ought to be approached with direct interest in Goethe and his contemporaries!",
    "I would recommend this course. There are a lot of interesting readings from many different authors and in many different styles and formats. We read plays, short stories, poetry, fragments (written as such) as well as theoretical works closer to philosophy or literary theory. I loved the stories we read, and learned to appreciate the other works. Professor Wetters clearly put work into the class and always had interesting information to add to the readings. Class discussion got to the heart of the readings quickly."
