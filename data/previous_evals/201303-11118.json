    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is extremely interesting. It covers a wide rage of grassroots movements from all angles. While the reading is heavy, there are not many graded assignments and written work is manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Professor Klein is an awesome professor to take a class with. It is a great US history class, in which you study post WWII America from a different angle. The discussions are very interesting and helps you think about American life in a different way.",
    "I would definitely recommend a course with Professor Klein. She is a great thinker and will challenge you to answer difficult questions. She always keeps a section discussion lively, but be prepared to speak up in class!",
    "HIST 191J essentially ties together women's history in the United States with major US themes\/events since World War II. Through this course, you are able to study the evolution of feminism, and how that evolution shaped American society. The course also analyzes subjects of race and class. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
    "I would not recommend the class to another student, especially to a non history major. I was very interested in the topics but did enjoy them in the historical context. Take a good look at the syllabus before taking."
