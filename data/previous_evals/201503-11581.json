    "This course was amazing! The structure of the course is great: it starts you out with the basics, moves on to prompts which guide your photos, and then gives you the opportunity to pursue a great independent project. It will take a lot of time to shoot, edit, and print, but all of that is definitely worth it. You also spend a lot of time going over the different canons of photography and viewing different artists work, which gives you a great background of the medium and informs how you approach your own work. At the end of the course you will have produced a lot of work and have a great understanding of photography as a medium.",
    "A++++",
    "Would highly recommend. Know that there are extra costs besides the $150 materials fee, but definitely worth it if you are willing to work hard.",
    "A must-take class for anyone remotely interested in photography. Teaches you to see the content and form of the world in new ways and capture it. Shows you the work of great artists through slide presentations, art gallery and library visits, and a trip to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Builds fundamentals like using Photoshop and Bridge, shooting with manual settings, and printing. Weekly assignments and prompts for photos, five critiques where every student shows and discusses work, and a longer-term, more fulfilling final project. Only drawback is the need to buy a camera and accessories.",
    "Beautiful, life-giving class take it even if you have a heavy course load. It refreshes you. It teaches you how to see differently. You also get introduced to all the cool things that happen around the art school. It is very expensive but it's worth the investment. You get what you put in.",
    "I highly recommend it. A class that truly shows you what art is and how to appreciate it trough the eye of a photographer. The hours spent looking at amazing photography were life-changing. The class is not that hard as long as you are passionate about photography.",
    "Yes! A good intro to digital and happy I have a baseline in Photoshop",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I was so glad to be able to take an art class at Yale. It's definitely a lot of work-- there are a lot of hours to be spent out with your camera, editing in the lab, and printing in preparation for critiques. It's also an expensive class, which people should be aware of. Ka-Man is great, very knowledgable, and approaches photography from both an artist and activist standpoint. If you can, take it!!!",
    "I would recommend the course to people, that are really interested in developing an artistic eye for photography. This course would not only improve your know-how of all your camera functions, but also it will increase your ability to identify more ways to analyze and look through a photo."
