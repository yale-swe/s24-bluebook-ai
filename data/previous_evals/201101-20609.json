   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to history students, whether they study colonial America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, or Europe.",
    "Comparative readings in the history of Atlantic slavery, covering North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Readings embrace an array of cultural, quantitative, and qualitative modes of analysis. Great exposure to major historiographical debates in the field re: agency, creolization, African cultural survivals, etc. Highly recommended for any student not just doing an entire orals field in Atlantic history, but for whom Atlantic slavery enters on her\/his orals lists.",
    "Rugemer's syllabus is thoughtful and comprehensive; it covers key debates and problems in the field very well."

   "comments": [
    "The comparative approach is incredibly helpful. It allows graduate students to engage in the history of regions (Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti) not otherwise taught within the department.",
    "I think any US historian needs a command of the historiography of slavery, and this course delivered that to some degree. But I think that my graspover the field might have become stronger if the discussions had been more focused.",
    "did not directly contribute to my research as my work is more contemporary, but provided excellent preparation for orals reading and exposure to major historiographical debates.",
    "While it might be tempting to turn this class into a lengthy study of North American slavery, I appreciate Rugemer's comparative emphasis. Considering slavery without Africa, the Caribbean, Brazil, or Europe would be undesirable and out of line with new directions in slavery scholarship."
