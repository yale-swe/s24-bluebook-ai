   "comments": [
    "I think there are two types of students that would take this class: underclassmen, prospective art majors, and upperclassmen outside of the art major who want to paint. Although these two types of students will have a very different experience with the course, I would recommend the class for both.",
    "If you are serious about improving your work, absolutely take it. If you're concerned because you heard other students say the workload is enormous, know that it is a huge commitment, but that those people are just complaining. The amount of work is absolutely necessary to developing your skills and if you are willing to really put yourself into your work, he will make it worth your time.",
    "It is tough, but you come away feeling like it was worth it. The vibe among the students is really important, and worked out really well. Sharing studio space is so key. It is so cool to walk away from the semester with a giant roll of things that you produced with your own hands, and in which you can see an actual timeline of how you gained a new skill.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in growing, and ready for the workload.",
    "This course may or may not change your life, but it will change the way you view the working process. No matter how resistantyou are to Reed and his eccentricities, you will put your heart and soul into your work, and you will work harder than you ever have (unless you've gone to Auvillar with Reed, that's a different story entirely). You'll enter into a community and exit with some kind of insight about who you are as an artist and as a person. Not everyone will have as positive experience as mine, but even if it's more negative you'll come out of the experience better off from having done it. There is no possibility that you are wasting your time in this course. You will not come out of it going, \"meh, that was alright.\" The course is an important one on some level for everyone who encounters it. Robert Reed takes you seriously as a creative person, and as a result, you start believing in yourself as an artist.Obviously, I recommend it.",
    "do it if you're die hard when it comes to painting. bei prepared for 12 hour stints in the studio with little recognition from te professor. the course is entirely self rewarding. i recommend this course to anyone who wants to push their limits as a painter and realize their potential.",
    "If you are thinking of taking this class, be prepared. I say that in the Lion King sense of the phrase, BE PREPARED. This is not a class that you can simply skip to every couple of days and paint pretty pictures in. It requires your full attention to do well and nothing but your full attention will be accepted. You're gonna have to buy a lot of things, paint every single weekend for an extended period of time, and put up with a lot of strangeness on Robert Reed's part, because that's the way he rolls. In the end I think it's worth it. You come out of the class with a whole bunch of work, a good work ethic, and an entire classful of new, good friends. The other students in the class are what will make it special and something not to be missed if you are interested in even just a semester of studio practice. But if you're lazy, don't put yourself through it.",
    "The course is tough, no doubt, but manageable. I would recommend it to another student if he\/she is willing to work hard and push themselves to not only to grow as a painter but also as a person in terms of learning about the process of working through problems and producing work.",
    "It's a butt load of work, but that said everything is doable. I've heard plenty of people complain about Robert's teaching style. He is demanding, but only because he puts faith in his students to dig deeper and deeper into their investigations.Not for the faint-hearted, but definitely doable to every Yale student.Can't draw straight lines? Don't think you can do color? Not \"artsy\"?Dude, I'm a straight up engineering major and I still took this. And loved it. And found it more useful than all my engineering classes combined.",
    "This class is a gift to anyone considering painting as part of a life. Professor Reed is committed to the attempt to get the student to paint from a place that is meaningful. He is committed to helping you achieve more than superficial satisfaction with your work, and the relentless focus on one subject throughout the semester will end up sparking your excitement. Go to the class open to its structure and Professor Reed's personality, and don't be intimidated--he is always there to talk and offer guidance. Your classmates are also a gift--sharing a studio with a group of intent painters is exciting and was by far the warmest, homiest, most encouraging place I spent time this semester.",
    "this is an extremely challenging, work-intensive studio course that you will probably enjoy and break your heart over, much to the detriment of your other classes. but it's amazing. the camaraderie and work created is entirely worth the suffering.",
    "This class is what you make of it."
