    "I learned a lot about international law, in particular about the law of armed conflict. Also acquired a somewhat different framework for thinking about cyber conflict in the law and in general.",
    "I learned about the different types of Cyber Conflict, the different ways in which countries are invoking international law to deal with such conflict, and the current state of legal research on the subject. I also gained some interesting technical knowledge that was a good supplement to the cryptography course that I was taking concurrently, although I'm not sure how valuable it would be if I didn't have that course for context."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure. This was a trial run, and definitely felt a bit like it. I don't know that that was entirely a bad thing, and on the whole I think I liked the course. Crucial challenge: having both computer science and law students in classroom means that basics of either field will be necessary to one half of the class but boring to the other. I do think it's really valuable to have the students together, though, so I'm not sure how best to remedy that. I'm really looking forward to the practicum portion of the course, for what that's worth--I think I found a topic I'm really excited about.",
    "I think the course was somewhat disorganized -- there were weekly readings and a handful of reading responses due throughout the semester, but one of the primary goals of the course was to give the law students enough background to do some significant technical assignments, which didn't happen. I think part of the problem for this was a lack of any real, hard deadlines for anything in the course. Certainly, the law students could have used more support in learning \"how to program\" with absolutely no experience, but the reality was that there wasn't really incentive to do so. This was true for the reading responses too -- students regularly turned them in after the deadline. The format of reading responses might be improved also -- 1200 words (~4-5 pages) is pretty substantial for a writing assignment that doesn't assume any sources outside of the weekly reading. Perhaps a better system would be to have shorter (2-3 page) writing assignments, to assign more of them, and to require that students finish x reading responses by a first deadline, y by a second, etc. This would likely improve the quality of the reading responses and ensure that students don't write reading responses all for the last 2-3 classes.",
    "The class was structured poorly. A flipped-classroom version where the seminar time was dedicated *solely* to discussion and clarification would have been good, but as it was there was too much plain restatement of the readings."

    "I'm not sure. If you're a computer science student like myself, you may lose patience with some of the technical parts (though it may fill in a bit of your knowledge gaps about the internet, depending what elective you've taken). There was a pretty interesting and not too difficult programming assignment. But you will learn a decent amount of law, and Professors Shapiro and Hathaway are pretty cool people to know and talk to. I think the real payout of this course will be in the second semester, because I'm really excited about my topic."
