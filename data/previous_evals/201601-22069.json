    "Don't procrastinate. It's okay to change your topic. It's not going to be fun trying to write 50 pages on a topic you don't care about. Choose a topic that you can get excited about and would read a book on in your spare time for fun. Those topics draw out the most creativity and critical thinking as well as produce the best essays. This course can be very rewarding, but you have to start doing your work early on and not fall off the horse. Get at it, and don't rest on your laurels.",
    "Required, but definitely the most enriching (and challenging) part of the history major. The flexibility and support can make for a fantastic experience. Important to prioritize the senior essay early and often",
    "Unlike other Yale College classes, I actually know my grade already before I started filling out this evaluation. So...No but actually, even though I didn't do that well, I think I'm a better writer for having this experience. It really is what you make of it. And now that I'm writing my final Yale papers, 10-20 pages seems like nothing. Sometimes you just have to do it if you learn anything. I know that if I were to attempt a thesis again I could get the A I wanted. (This zen attitude is something I'm working on developing now that I have a job and don't need to worry about grades anymore. If you're applying to grad school after a gap year or something, there probably is still some grade inflation, but you'll really need to work. Start now!)",
    "Writing the History Senior Essay is a fulfilling, yet honestly quite difficult, capstone project. A year-long, independently-driven research project is no easy feat. But producing an original essay at the end of the year is quite an accomplishment, and worth the time and effort. In terms of finding and advisor - more important than academic expertise is your personal relationship with the professor. Also, while everyone will tell you to pace yourself in the writing process (which is sound advice), I actually found it easier to set aside about 10 uninterrupted days to hammer out an entire draft (I did this over spring break). Keep in mind that this is a process; there will be ups and downs, moments when you're thrilled by the direction of your research, and other times when you have no idea what you're writing about it. Embrace that, and trust that you will end up writing something you can feel proud of.",
    "Do it!",
    "You write a senior essay.",
    "Great experience",
    "The senior essay",
    "Rewarding!",
    "Future history majors may have the choice to do a one-semester senior essay, but take my advice: do the full-year essay! It is such a rewarding experience and you come out with a real piece of serious capstone scholarship that you will be proud of. Be aware that most advisors want a full rough draft before you leave for Spring Break, so do writing as early in the semester as you can. The hardest part of the spring is simply getting words on the page, but youll be glad when you do. Plus, the final essay is due in early April, so while the weeks beforehand will be busy, the rest of April and finals period will be very light.",
    "The senior essay has easily been the best academic experience I've had at Yale. When you hold that printed and bound copy in your hands in early April after months of research and writing and reflect on the journey that has led you to that point, it is a wonderful feeling. Now that history majors will have a choice, I highly recommend the full year senior essay. A one semester project will not allow you to produce a work that is even close to being as deeply researched or personally significant as the full year senior essay.",
    "This was the hardest and at times the most frustrating thing Ive done at Yale, but also the most rewarding. A perfect capstone to the major, it will make you a better researcher and writer and give you a sense of what its like to take on a project of this size. Its difficult, but well worth it (all easy to say in retrospect, I know). A few pieces of advice: think about your topic early, talk about it with other people, consider what kinds of questions interest you and what kind of evidence youd reasonably be able to marshal to answer them; dont expect to stumble on some kind of miracle in the archives; keep up a line of communication with your advisor, even when things are going badly, even when you feel terrifyingly behind schedule; reach out to someone who knows your topic well (even if theyre not at Yale) for secondary literature suggestions; and give yourself some time for the writing itselfyou have the opportunity to tell a story here, and you should try to do so compellingly and elegantly.",
    "Be sure to start early! It took me a while to get my research together (partially because it took me longer than expected to narrow down my topic). If you put the work it, the senior essay can be very rewarding.",
    "Stay organized",
    "Start as soon as possible!!",
    "The history senior thesis is extremely rewarding.",
    "Lots of work but worth it in the end.",
    "It's fun, but pick a great advisor. Otherwise, it won't be fun.",
    "I absolutely recommend the year-long thesis. It is an important capstone to the history major and an enjoyable learning experience.",
    "Obviously the senior essay is worthwhile endeavor. However, one must find the right advisor and can be hurt by the grading system where one person who is not an expert in the field of the paper grades the essay,",
    "Students in the future will have the choice to write a shorter thesis don't do that. Write the year-long thesis. It's the only way to write about anything interesting or even approach a conclusion of significance.",
    "This was the best senior essay writing experience I could possibly have asked for. Prof. Gilmore is the most helpful, hands-on professor I've ever had. I frankly don't know what I would have done without her.",
    "I loved writing my senior essay, even though it took over my life. I had the flexibility to end all my other commitments though and had an incredible faculty advisor who met with me every other week to discuss a new outline or section of writing."
