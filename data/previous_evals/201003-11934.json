   "comments": [
    "Yes. This class will enhance your knowledge of current and past policies and issues and help provide new outlooks on solutions and problems with each.",
    "Good seminar. Every week is a little bit different. If you're interested in the environment and want a class that has little reading, this may be the one for you. Workload: a few group presentations and a 5000 word paper due at the end of reading week.",
    "Wargo is nice, accommodating, and knowledgeable. He facilitates discussion well. Readings are very manageable and Wargo is happy to help students through the final essay. Class was always pleasant. You\u0092ll learn about the topic you write on, and otherwise learn in proportion to how much of the reading you do.",
    "Take this class! Professor Wargo is a great instructor and the readings are very interesting. The 5000-word paper is long for some people but if you write on the right topic it won't seem that bad.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes! Wargo is the best!",
    "This is almost a completely student-driven course. Class discussions make up most of the class time so the atmosphere can really change depending on the students. The readings consists of research and government documents and some occasional laws, which can be a bit dense and jargony at times. Professor Wargo always willing to help by offering his time. He's very knowledgeable, so you can learn a lot from talking to him. The part you'll need the most guidance on is the thesis for the final paper. Many people tend to change their topic as they did more research on their subject area or as they find a new interest.",
    "I definitely reccomend this class. Getting the chance to work in a small environment with this amazing of an instructor is a chance you can't pass up."
