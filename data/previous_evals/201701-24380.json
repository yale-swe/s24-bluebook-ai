    "I gained insight into the functioning of social enterprise and impact investingpossibilities for our economic system to better tackle social issues. Our learning involved many case studies and ranged from improved philanthropy, companies that served the bottom of the period, co-creation, etc. It was a phenomenal course and extremely beneficial to me an everyone else in the course.",
    "I learnt how firms and the individual can do well and do good.",
    "I learned a lot about how businesses are structured, how to maximize social impact (and how to define social impact), and also how to think about leadership.",
    "Perspectives (esp global) and discussion on aligning business and profit",
    "Knowledge about impact investing, insightful conversations with practitioners, and an understanding of the philosophical debate about doing good and doing well.",
    "Learned a lot about socially responsible businesses. Helped clarify my own idea of what social impact means."

   "comments": [
    "Class is shaped to indulge discussion which was such a strength.",
    "I think this course was fantastic in pushing me outside my comfort zone and diving headfirst into business case discussions and thinking critically about how to best create impact through investing. I did feel a bit unprepared for this, however and especially compared the business school students, as I have never read a case study or discussed many of the aspects of business and the terminologies that we ended up using frequently in class. I think next time, it would be useful to make sure that everyone is up to speed. I did not like the first paper topic (about how to do well while doing good) which felt out of place and difficult to write and tie in the course readings to. Nonetheless, I really value everything I learned and am very happy I took this course.",
    "The strengths 1) are the broad range of topics it covers 2) insightful and inspiring practitioner guest speakers 3) depth of knowledge from the professor and level of discussion and engagement from students 4) prompted personal reflection on how the learning and class materials apply to our lives 5) nice mix of business cases and theory readings Improvement areas 1) None really",
    "The readings, speakers, structure of the course was perfect. My only critique is that Blair was a little too rigid with reading discussion in class - I would have enjoyed more freewheeling class discussions."

    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely phenomenal course! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in tackling poverty or other pressing social challenges. The course balances philosophy, case studies, and business frameworks. It also can appeal to many people from many different backgrounds. The students in the course ranged came from Yale College as well as many different graduate programs. Some people had already worked in companies we learned about in the course and others were learning about the material for the first time. This is a great introduction to the concept and can help anyone who is interested in the field truly understanding all the different moving pieces.",
    "Yes a great class and will help you think a lot about impact.",
    "Yes, highly recommend.",
    "Yes. Great seminar course",
    "Absolutely. This is an inspiring and practical course that helps students wrestle with the complexities of achieving business success while creating impact.",
    "Yes. You do learn about the business and social enterprise world. It is overall an engaging class.",
    "If you want to learn about social impact from a professional expert, I Would highly recommend this course. Blair's content is on the cutting edge of what is relevant in society today - her speakers also add immense value."
