    "For a seminar course, the class style was all lecture. He would ask questions to open discussion but the questions rarely seemed on topic or answerable given the readings for that lecture. The readings did not seem helpful in class, and the lectures did not clarify the readings. I felt unsure as to why any of the materials were strung together the way they were. I think changing the structure of the class to a lecture course, and thus tweaking the readings to match that set up would make the experience of this class a lot more valuable. I think I learned a lot, but not in a way that was productive in class. While the information I learned may prove useful in other classes in the future or in papers etc., I did not find this class to be, generally speaking, what I had hoped it would be."
