    "Average seminar with weekly responses, a presentation, anda term paper. Professor Slap had some interesting stories from his experiences in state government.Readings ought to be improved, and presentations\/class discussion were painful at times. Like most seminars, see who else is in the class.",
    "This class is the Platonic form of the struggle bus.",
    "Take it.",
    "Very interesting class if you are concerned about the intersection of media and politics.",
    "The class is easy and essentially no work. You can get away with barely doing the reading, since all you need to do is a one-page double-spaced reading response each week and your other major assignments (presentation and final paper) are not based on the reading. But be warned, this was the most boring, useless class I have taken at Yale. I sat in that room checking the time every two minutes for the entire two hour period, and to make things worse, it was at 7 pm on Wednesdays. Nobody cared very much about the class, as evidenced by the fact that literally every single student was sitting on Facebook\/Twitter\/Buzzfeed the entire time. Professor Slap definitely meant well, but the class was structured poorly. He's a chill guy though.",
    "Great course with very interesting material, not too much reading and a very light courseload.",
    "This class is about contemporary journalism and its role in the political process. As is, I probably wouldn't recommend the class -- because of the inattention of students (Facebook was a'callin...), the random discussions that took place during class, and the lack of commitment by other students in the class.That said, I'm sure it can improve. First, ban laptops!! Second, eliminate the Sunday Review section of the readings -- or at least downscale dramatically. That is the reason classes were so off-topic and random, usually. If we just stuck to the books, I am confident everyone would have learned more. And third -- although I've never said this before -- if Prof. Slap were to establish himself as a tougher grader early on in the semester, people would definitely take the class more seriously.As I said, this class could definitely be great -- it's just not there right now.",
    "Great class, take it.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter, why not? This definitely wasn't one of the better seminars I've taken, but I still feel like I walked away with some practical knowledge that can be applied in the real world. The work load isn't terrible. There are weekly presentations that take up a lot of the class though, so you will have to present and be ready to sit through ~16 student presentations. Also, Professor Slap taught with a powerpoint which made it easy to know what was going on, but much less of a discussion-based seminar.",
    "You should take the class if you're interested in looking at media biases within the context of political news coverage.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially Political Science majors with an interest in journalism. These two topics really appealed to me, and the class did a great job of blending them together. Discussion is always interesting in class, and the workload isn't too bad at all - weekly reading responses, only about 80 pages of reading each week, one 10 minute presentation, and a final paper between 15 and 20 pages long. The set-up makes for a very enjoyable seminar experience, and Professor Slap is great - the anecdotes he gives based on his experiences working for NBC Connecticut and then now on the other side at the Connecticut State Senate really heighten the conversations."
