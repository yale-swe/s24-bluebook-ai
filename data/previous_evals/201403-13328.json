   "comments": [
    "This class aims to introduce students to thinking about World War I in a global way. Each class focuses on a different theme, such as economics, military strategy, gender and sexuality, occupation, revolution, and more. We also spanned many different countries. Each person had to do an in-class presentation, a mid-term paper, and a final paper. The readings were often quite heavy.",
    "Good class to take, but unfortunately Dr. Purseigle was only a visiting professor. Gained a new appreciation for WWI.",
    "Professor Purseigle is a nice guy, and really knowledgable, but I wouldnt recommend the class. The seminar discussions are all over the place, and the reading only slightly helps. You really needed to come in with a pretty complete knowledge of the War in order to get much out of the class. That being said, very few people in the class did have that, and somehow it was still sort of enjoyable to be there. I said I lot of stupid stuff in seminar though, because it was so hard to prepare. The papers are serious work though, so youll really get experience writing genuine college history papers. And hes a good grader and helpful at critiquing your writing. Maybe I just wasnt passionate about the subject enough. Still, probably not recommended.",
    "A solid introduction to the events and social history of the war. Less military history, more cultural, economic, and social impacts of the conflict upon various regions of Europe. An engaging seminar: you get out what you put in if you're willing to do the work and read thoroughly."
