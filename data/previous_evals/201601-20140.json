   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Ms. Gonwa was a disappointing TA. I didn't feel like we accomplished much in our sections. Some of her tactics--she uses notecards to limit how much we all can say--was a little silly, actually annoying. It felt a little like first grade. Moreover, she often seemed hesitant and didn't do much to drive conversation very far. Nice person, but she may want to hone her teaching style a bit.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is a wonderful TF! She's approachable, knowledgable, and has a great presence when teaching. Was pleased to be in section! If I had one suggestion it would be to introductions on the first day. Even by the end of the semester, I think I only knew the names of a fraction of my classmates in section.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was incredible.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0A great balance of discussion and lecture in the sections. Really appreciated having Janna as my TF!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0I had Janna as a teaching fellow last semester for Systematic Theology, and when I saw that she was one of the T.F.'s for Medieval Theology, not only I but also several of my friends made sure that we all landed in her teaching sections. And like in Systematics, Janna was a joy to work with. She is clearly passionate about teaching theology, and she clearly knows a great deal about the discipline. This passion and ability allows her to run her classes in spontaneous, creative ways that keep her students engaged and allow for many different styles of learners to succeed at absorbing difficult material. Beyond the classroom, however, she demonstrated repeatedly that she deeply cares about her students not only as academics but also as people as she would go out of her way to help many of us in our learning processes. She is both a wonderful teacher and a great human being.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was very adaptable concerning assigned reading and what was covered in lecture, which made learning in section much easier. She was good at facilitating conversation between all section students. I learned the most from her when she would instruct us from the white board -- whether on the monk's spiritual ladder or the similarities and differences in theologians.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0I gave her feedback in section but she aided my learning by teaching at our level and helping us to engage with the material in creative ways. Thank you Janna!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna's passion for the subject matter is palpable. And she is quite skilled at making complex ideas accessible to people not as well versed, which kept conversation open and appealing to all. She has a fruitful career ahead of her! It was truly a pleasure!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna helped to give this course much needed structure. She facilitated discussion and was thoughtful and intentional about our time together.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was fantastic, I learned\/retained much more in Janna's sections than I did in Turner's lectures.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Kind. Smart. Ran a good section. Too much material to cover in 50 min. She for people to speak. Not sure people's understanding of the vast material was deepened.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Weaknesses: rarely displayed a good attitude in section and was never available for feedback outside of class. was not pleasant in section.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine taught her strongest classes when she facilitated class discussion instead of conversing with the class.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine did a great job. She changed the format of the sections after taking a survey mid-way through, which was perfect.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine means well, but she treated us like undergrads. Our discussions were stilted and frustrating, and as the semester went on I could see how everyone stopped caring.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0The range of her expertise seemed limited, especially when it came to the more philosophical of the texts, but was able, generally, to get at what seemed the essential points. The students in the course were less than helpful in sections.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0I really enjoyed having Justine as my TF. She was organized, open to questions and different ways of discussing the material, and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0I thought that Justine was adept in leading my discussion section. I also appreciated that she gave out two surveys--one at the beginning of the course and one in the middle--to get our feedback about how we wanted section to be structured and what we thought could be better.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0While Justine's skills as a medievalist made her a valuable resource, her lack of familiarity with historical theology and the immediate subject matter made it hart to rely on her expertise with any kind of consistency. Often, she approached the week's readings along with us and for the first time. This in turn affected her ability to provide meaningful feedback during our section. Furthermore, her pedagogical approach during section showed a lack of familiarity with teaching graduate students.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine brought a well balanced and critical eye to our section revisions of Medieval theology texts. She kept a close eye on the groups needs, and supplemented our sessions with visual printouts that were in tandem with the topics or authors of the week. Sessions were interactive and everyone had a chance to contribute. As the semester progressed, it was evident that Justines level of comfort with the topical content of the course was in crescendo (this is owing perhaps to her background in History as opposed to Theology). I especially appreciated her candid approach to the complex themes and her transparency when indicating that she needed to further check before responding to certain views or questions that would come up from the group. Justine was committed and engaged well with the group.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine was terrific, especially considering she was press-ganged to TF this course at the eleventh hour.",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine is really helpful (proposal comments, explanations in her sessions, etc.).",
    "Instructor: Justine Angelique Walden \u00a0Justine did a great job.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam is a great teacher. He is accessible, honest, and understanding.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Strengths and weaknesses are a subjective matter-- and I'm not sure I'm qualified to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of another human being. I think the course itself was difficult to gauge... in that Prof. Turner seemed to approach lectures with a 'go with the flow' mentality... which is his style, but as a Teaching Fellow I think it would be difficult to jive well with such whimsy. I intuit negative feedback for Sam for a few reasons... 1) He's abrupt, to the point, and can tell when students do\/don't do readings, and 2) He doesn't smile a lot. And it's not fair, because he did teach us a great deal. And I think it's sad how oftentimes TF's are subject to these types of reports when they really are trying their best... and I just really hope everyone is kind. I learned a great deal in section with Sam, and I should hope that everyone approaches this comment section as PURELY for feedback on his teaching style. Just because someone isn't Pollyanna, doesn't mean they aren't friendly... maybe they just don't want to smile. He was great. Let's all be nice. Everything is great.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0I really enjoyed Sam as a TF. I like that he mixed up the teaching style every few weeks (debates, written work, etc.) so that it wasn't just discussion the entire time. It helped to incorporate more voices into the discussion and make people feel more at ease speaking and asking questions. I also found that he was very available to the students for assistance with paper topics and the like and that he had valuable advice to give for sources and focusing of a topic.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam's enthusiasm was great. I felt like he really wanted to be doing this stuff with us at an early hour. He was good at group exercises - the debates were among the best. He encouraged participation and was available when needed.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam did a great job overall. I think with practice, he could do a better job directing discussion and guiding students in particular directions.Early in the semester he did a good job attempting to involve everyone, but those efforts tapered off toward the end, though it was never too bad.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0i really enjoyed how Sam ran sections. they were low-key, but he made us focus on the material closely; this usually involved focusing on a specific bit of text. i remember several times we drew diagrams on the board. Sam is a natural teacher.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0He provided structure and organization to what was a very disorganized course.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0I feel like Sam did as well as could be expected given the relative disorganization of the class. The activities he created in order to make the material interesting helped with my comprehension of the texts.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam was effective in facilitating discussion and in using a variety of methods (sentence-by-sentence commentary, writing for a few minutes at the beginning of class, debate, regular discussion) to allow students to approach the material in different ways. He was helpful in shaping the final papers.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Diverse pedagogical methods attempted. Respect for different opinions demonstrated. Ensuring a standard of understanding of material somewhat deficient.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam was engaging and innovative. The mock debates were extremely helpful and the sections themselves were stimulating. I always felt encouraged to speak; and when I was too tired to do so, I was not made to feel uncomfortable. Sam made it a comfortable and encouraging learning environment. I hope to have him again for another class.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0He tried out different method in his section from brainstorming to debates. Sam was easy to talk to and understood the material.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0SAM IS THE BEST! Wonderful guidance and creative section activities. He's also very knowledgeable. And orthodox. This is good.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam did an incredible job communicating course material with a variety of creative methods.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0I was glad to have such a enthusiastic TF for this course. Each day Sam was open, encouraging, and well-prepared for the session. I also appreciated his sense of humor. He genuinely encouraged discussion and response to the material, and I think exploring additional strategies to have more participation by all students would strengthen the class. Sam incorporated the midterm anonymous feedback into his teaching method well. I appreciated how available he was to discuss the upcoming paper. He also did his best to communicate what the assigned reading was for the upcoming classes.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Jentry Martinez \u00a0Sam has a great way of engaging the class and leaves ample room for discussion. Enjoyed his leadership. I would only suggest leaving more time for teaching of the subject matter."
