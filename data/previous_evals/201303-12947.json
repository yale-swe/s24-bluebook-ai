    "Listening to Adam talking is great, and when each piece began to fall into places, that is fun.",
    "A critical analysis of the present day - and the trends for tomorrow.",
    "Definitely not, unless one enjoys wasting one's time and money",
    "I would recommend this course. It's an interesting seminar that provides a good overview of a number of current issues, particularly those affecting the United States, Western Europe, and China. However, other than China, not much time is spent on the developing world, which is a serious drawback for a required class in a Global Affairs program.",
    "History of the Present is a course that covers a lot of ground from Malthus and Marx to environmental change and the economic crisis. If someone wants to discuss those large topics in a discussion-type class, I would recommend it for them if they are prepared to read and talk a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course without any reservation. This was hands-down my favorite course this semester.",
    "I would recommend.The course is helpful to get an overview of global main political issues, and it's a good preparation for those who would like to decide a specific focus after this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student.I would summarize the course as follows: It is an innovative approach to the study of the history of some of the most important issues of our time (e.g., climate change, global population growth, geopolitical power shifts), but with an evidently Western focus.",
    "I would recommend this course for those who want to learn underlying principle of history.",
    "This course is mandatory for global affairs students. It covers some essential theories but classes are very unstructured. It felt like a 3 hour word\/thought association. This can be a good thing but takes a while to get used to."
