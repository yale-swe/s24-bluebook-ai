    "I probably wouldn't. Things aren't well explained, too many people have programming experience, the teacher isn't great, it's hard to find help if you don't understand everything, and it becomes very difficult very quickly towards the end. Plus, by the end problem sets took absolutely forever!",
    "Great intro to programming, I recommend it whether you have a background or not. Lectures are a little boring but homework and exams are fun.",
    "you probably have to take it, so yes. it was decent. started out easy then got crazy hard at the end. pretty intense for an intro class but go to his help sessions cause marshall long is very helpful",
    "Yes, it's a good introduction to programming languages especially if you've never programmed before.",
    "if you want a basic introduction to programming, it is definitely a good course to take. i'm happy i learned these skills and i feel like i have a basic idea of what to do and how to do it. the progression of the course and the assignments was very logical. it can be pretty boring at times but it gets the job done well for an intro course",
    "It was an amazing course. Yale should offer many more of these intro-level practical programming courses. This opened a whole new world for me and made me change my major as a second-term sophomore. DON'T LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING THIS COURSE.The professor is bad though.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, it's a great break from other science classes in that it requires very little memorization - all you have to learn is a simple language and then the rest is all problem solving. It's basically all about problem solving and keeping track of all the different variables in your head - if you like puzzles you'll like the class.",
    "Not unless required.",
    "The course is very straightforward. The first few weeks are Fortran, then a week of Mathematica, a week of Matlab, and the rest is C++. Overall the course probably isn't very difficult until C++. The course isn't exceptionally thorough, but it is probably sufficient for claiming to have programming skills after finishing.",
    "Class time isn't the most productive, but it's CS, so the only way to learn is to practice and work on the syntax implementation until your program works. Not a mind-blowing class, but probably better than CPSC 112. Be warned problem set length and difficulty really picks up toward the end of the semester.",
    "If you're interested in getting your feet wet in programming, I would recommend this class. It goes beyond teaching specific programming languages; it also teaches algorithmic thinking, active problem solving, and some amount of basic computer knowledge. That being said, thecurrent format of the course is rather skewed. You will spend way too much time on Fortran, and not enough time to truly feel comfortable with C++. Marshall Long is an adequate professor, but he is certainly not the greatest. Problem sets get pretty challenging towards the end. However, getting a high average in the class isn't very hard because 70% of your grade is the problem sets. I don't know what the distribution will look like for letter grades, but be warned, there are many people with programming experience in the class. Overall, take the class if you're interested in the subject; the teaching seems better than that offered in the computer science department. Be ready to devote a fair amount of time for this class towards the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material we learned is useful and applicable for physics and engineering research. The course work is light-to-fair in the beginning, with problem sets becoming more involved in the later C++ section. The problem sets are interesting challenges and I found the class particularly rewarding.",
    "This class was very easy. Not a lot of work, but still learned a lot about Fortran, Matlab, Mathematica, and C++. Take it!",
    "Yes, useful overview. Starts out easy with Fortran, then rapidly picks up and blasts through c++.",
    "Starts out fairly easy, but C++ became difficult at the end. Be sure to use\/manipulate the sample codes to ensure you understand it.",
    "Super easy if you've programmed before, hard if you haven't.If you've programmed before you really won't learn much from this class--take a higher level.If you haven't programmed before, take cs 112. You'll learn everything much better than in this class.",
    "It is a good intro course for people without programming experience. The problem sets can be frustrating at times but it is necessary. The midterms are reasonable and the final project was not too difficult. I recommend it for students without programming experience.",
    "ENAS 130 is a really good intro to programming. It assumes no prior knowledge and gets you all the way to building pretty complicated programs in C++. Starting with Fortran is a good way to get started with programming, even if it isn't the most widely used language nowadays. We don't get to do too much with Matlab or Mathematica. The lectures are useful but not captivating; the homework assignments are where all the real learning happens. I really enjoyed doing the assignments and found myself learning the material quite well from working through them. Professor Long is really friendly and easygoing. I would highly recommend this class to those who want to start programming and have an inclination for mathematical problem solving",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning the basics to programming. You have to be willing to put in the time, especially towards the end of the semester, but I really enjoyed the class and had a lot of fun learning this.",
    "well it's a required class for many majors so you gotta take it!",
    "I would recommend the course if you are interested in learning the Fortran or C++ programming languages. The course pretty much covers everything you need to know for either language and it is great to be able to program.",
    "Very good introduction to C++. Getting a book on C++ is helpful, but the professor has everything you need to know in the PowerPoint slides. Also, even though it's hard, pay attention in lecture. It's extremely helpful later when you're banging your head against a wall because your program won't work.",
    "Good intro programming course, but a lot of the programs are about problems in physics. The transition from FORTRAN to C++ is kind of tough, and the course definitely picks up near the end. I learned a lot though.",
    "I would recommend having some type of programming experience before taking this course. Nobody I knew, who hadn't had programming experience could complete the later problem sets on their own; we all had to make multiple trips to the tutors. It moves extremely fast and if you cannot designate at least 10 hours a week to working on the programs I would not recommend taking this course.",
    "This is a really fun programming course, that isn\u0092t too much work (one problem set per week, 2 midterms and a final project (basically a longer pset)). You really learn how to program in C++ and Fortran, while getting some basic rudimentary knowledge on Matlab and Mathematica. The onlything I would recommend is for us to have just done C++ the whole time, since the 1 week devoted to Matlab and Mathematica did not let you learn much if anything substantial, and learning Fortran only makes you realize how much better C++ is.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who either has a specific interest in learning Fortran and C++, or who does not feel self-motivated enough to learn how to program on her own. The homework assignments start out easy for every language, and increase in difficulty and time required throughout learning each language until reaching a fairly intensive point. C++, which is the second (big) unit of the class, is much harder conceptually and practically than anything in Fortran, Matlab, or Mathematica. If you're like me, and had no previous programming experience, you'll likely need to work with friends who do. Lectures were somewhat disorganized, and most of the learning is through friends or self-driven. Overall, not a bad course, just one that I thought I could take as a 5th course and found dominating my life a bit by the end!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in applying compsci to science or engineering study or research. Problem sets take time but are very worthwhile, and Professor Long offers lot of help. Exams are open computer. If you have some programming experience, you may be able to skip this class and go directly to CS 201.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It's a lot of work, and I just did not find it gratifying.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have had previous programming experience. The course is fine until C++ and then it viciously accelerates. If you are interested in programming I would recommend trying Intro to Computer Science. It this is a requirement I am sorry because I do not think many valuable skills are learned. MATLAB should have been taught the entire semester.",
    "I chose ENAS 130 over the CPSC class because I thought C++ would be a more useful language to learn than Java. However, because we only spent half the semester on C++ (the rest on Fortran and a week each on Mathematica and Matlab), I don't feel like I got as deep of an understanding of the language as I could have if we had spent the entire time on it. The CPSC psets sound a lot cooler than ours because in doing C++ we went over a lot of basics again so it really takes until the last few psets for things to get more complicated and for us to write cooler programs. Even in these he helps us a lot by giving us stubs, so I wasn't totally thinking for myself. The lectures are helpful for going over the sample code, but I felt like he spent a lot of the time reading stuff aloud that we could've read on our own rather than trying to teach us how to approach problems, which would have been more useful. I would look into the CPSC class a bit more, but learning C++ was definitely useful for me. I just wish this was better structured.",
    "Its an intro programming course in which you will become vaguely comfortable with C++ and a few other programming languages. Take this course with the knowledge that the problem sets may take some time if you come in with zero programming background.",
    "You will learn a lot about writing programs. The work stars easy, gets a little harder, and gets a little harder, then BAM. So make sure you're schedule is pretty easy the last few weeks of class.",
    "If you have never programmed before, you'll be fine in this course, but there probably will be experienced programmers taking it anyway, so try not to worry about them. Professor Long was very flexible with extending deadlines for problem sets. Problem sets were fairly straightforward, as were the two exams. It definitely helps to have friends\/ people to work with during this course. Problem sets didn't take too much time except for some of the longer ones at end. Lecture isn't really that interesting and it's hard to pay attention all the time, but you'll get a fair amount of practice with the homework assignments, which is more useful anyway.",
    "Good class, you learn a lot. The workload is manageable.",
    "This is a decent introductory course. You will spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get a squiggly line displayed across your screen, but you will have basic programming tools on your computer, know how to use them, know how to learn more, and understand many of programming references on xkcd.",
    "not that hard but not a good class especially since professor long isnt a great teacher. also, the first half is much easier than the second.",
    "This class is a great way to get your feet wet in the world of programming. Fortran is, despite its antiquity, a great place to begin your programming career due to its simplicity and ease of use. Professor Long does a good job of giving his students a solid foundation.",
    "If you want to learn how to program, I strongly recommend you check out a class in Computer Science instead. When taking this class, take care. The problem sets are pretty easy at first, but get much harder later in the semester, so don't delay working on them.",
    "Its a good class that covers FORTRAN, C++, MATLAB, and MATHEMATICA but do not expect to get very proficient at any of the languages. The lectures are fairly boring but you can mostly teach the material to yourself. The homework assignments get pretty difficult by the end of class so make sure to visit the programming tutor for help. Other than that it is fairly easy to get a good grade in this class but you have to put in a decent amount of work.",
    "This class has been described as very easy in the past; this semester, it was not. Not an enjoyable experience. Concepts were poorly explained. Work got significantly harder in the C++ unit (such that you could be fine for the first one or two assignments, and then feel really stupid floundering on the 3rd and 4th). The sudden ramp-up of work\/more advanced concepts left you with no recourse - it's quite hard asking for extra help during the last two to three weeks of the semester. I wish I had taken CPSC 112.",
    "If corey o'hearn is teaching *take it*, it'll be a gut and you'll know what you're going with a computer. With Long, less of a gut because of how quickly it accelerates (p sets will take 2-4 hours until the last 3 which take like 6-7 each) at the end but it's a great class and you'll really know linux, c++, fortran, and kinda know matlab and mathematica (not really though... mathematica is never actually taught at Yale). ENAS 130 Goes way beyond cpsc 112 in terms of material covered but you can go in knowing nothing unlike 201. IF you really want a foundation in compsci 112 might be better though. I have no idea the diference in bitlength of characters vs float vs integers but I can make a 3D graphing program in C++.",
    "This course varies greatly with which professor teaches it. We had Marshall Long, and the first 2\/3 of the class were very relaxes, but the last few weeks were a lot of work. I felt like we learned a ton. You'll definitely leave with a working knowledge of c++.",
    "Students taking this course should be prepared to work hard, as it is not an easy class. If a student has trouble, he or she should go to the professor's or the TA's office hours and get a helpful programming book.",
    "Buy the textbook for C++ and read the sections as he presents them in class, even though it's not required. It's the only way I understood C++ in the end. Googling concepts as I needed them was not enough for me.",
    "This class is not particularly well taught, but I'm very glad I took it, because fluency in computer programming is imperative not just for a science major but I think in general, given the huge role that computers play in our lives. That said, lectures are not too useful, although I would recommend going. Professor Long usually drops helpful hints about the problem sets, which, by the way, get very difficult towards the end. I would very much recommend buying a textbook for C++ (it's optional), because Professor Long can be hard to follow. I had never programmed before, and the class is meant for people with no programming experience, so no worries there, although it wouldn't hurt to familiarize yourself with some background information before taking the class. Although problem sets can be fiendishly frustrating, they are also incredibly rewarding.",
    "It's hard to evaluate this course because at least for me, the only way to learn the material was to learn it from online tutorials or a book\/on my own, not really in class. Professor Long definitely knows what he is doing, but he sometimes just skims over the basic things without really going in-depth, and then talks about the more complicated stuff before you even get the basics. Expect to spend a lot of time teaching yourself how to program. In any case, I think the skills I got from this class were useful.",
    "Yes, for someone with no or little background in programming, this class is fun and provides practice and understanding of basic programming.",
    "This is an introduction to general programming. You should take this class if you would like to focus on C++.",
    "A great intro class to both fortran and c++, this class is exactly as advertised. Professor Long is clear and concise, and his problem sets are both entertaining and informative.",
    "Time consuming class but problem sets are rewarding and even if you're not going to be a programmer, it teaches good lessons in problem solving.",
    "A fun class if you've taken andy sort of computer science before. A little bit hard near the end for those who haven't. The assigned books are useless. Get a study group and work together.",
    "Good intro course. It's doable. Just know that it's not very well taught.",
    "If you want to learn programming or FORTRAN\/C++ I would definitely recommend this class. You still learn all the basics of programming while using real-world languages.",
    "Easy, well-paced intro to FORTRAN and C++. Nothing scary if you're a logical thinker."
