   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. You explore so many different facets of Black identity and whether or not you are Black, will find yourself somewhere along in the process. It is hard to say how to think of the class in the future since Professor Allen will not be teaching it, though.",
    "An introduction to the diversity, multiplicity, and validity of all Black identities and visions of freedom. This is not an African American history class, it is an introduction to the radical Black imagination, and despite your racial background, provides a invaluable perspective applicable to all aspects of your life.",
    "A welcoming space to talk about being Black.",
    "You want some good AFAM readings? Take the class. You want to have a fun class where you can learn? Take the class. You want to spend time in class with other engaged students? Take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another person. It was fun and engaging and really insightful to learn about Black cultures and identities outside of a very American context. We read works by Black Europeans, Africans, and Caribbean scholars. It's a nice introduction to radical politics that gives you much more depth to Black revolutionary thought than many people's superficial education about the civil rights movement.",
    "Amazing course that opens your eyes not only to historical freedom struggles and what it means to be black in the United States but also a class that encourages you to think critically about your own experiences!",
    "I could not more highly recommend a course* (unless you have trouble with freeform schedules.) Jafari Allen might not be teaching the course, but at least show up during shopping period, because if the teacher is anything like him, the course will be a semester-defining one.",
    "It's church. Take it (if Pastor Jafari returns). We all need our daily bread.",
    "Take this class. It was life changing.",
    "Incredible class looking at Black Lives LIVING",
    "AFAM 110 is a necessary class if you want to take another step towards becoming a decent ally to the Black community. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "An excellent introduction to Af-Am studies and, in some ways, WGSS. Excellent foundational texts and resources.",
    "An absolutely integral course that considers what makes \"Blackness\" as an identity and experience. Everyday in this course was a gift. You need this class. A full full shame that Professor Allen is leaving but hopefully this course will continue. Matching it with any other teacher will be hard, though.",
    "In this class you will discuss the significance of Black texts from a variety of sources. You will leave with a better understanding of Black culture academically and physically.",
    "If only Jafari was here. We need more classes like this"
