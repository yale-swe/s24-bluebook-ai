    "This course has a lot of relevance to my research interests so I found it very interesting. The lectures were thoughtfully presented and provided a lot of useful information. The Thursday sessions were engaging... maybe could try out different formats of discussing articles (maybe have students present or work in groups to analyze a study)."

    "A course with potential applications to your future real-world practice - evidence-based practice is quite important and this class does a good job of teaching the core concepts. Learn how to do a meta-analysis!",
    "Evidence-based medicine is a cornerstone of medical science.Dr Bracken is a leader in this field and in many facets of clinical, genetic, and neonatal research today.Dr Bracken also happens to be about as good a thinker and communicator as you can find -- in any school or field.He's also very wry and trenchant -- so do the required readings! You'll never be sorry you did the required readings.This course should be required for every faculty member and student in YSPH, in Yale Med School, and in the Yale School of Nursing, but then of course that would ruin it.",
    "Excellent course for advanced epidemiologists or clinicians with a public health interest",
    "This is a course where you learn how to do a comprehensive literature search and write a systematic review. I would recommend it to any student who wants to learn searching and review techniques.",
    "I think this course is very useful - I think I have a more discerning eye towards the literature and feel a lot more comfortable conducting reviews."
