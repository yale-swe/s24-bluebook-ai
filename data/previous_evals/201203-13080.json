    "If you're interested in photography at all, take this course.",
    "If you're an adventurous person, take this course and you'll love it. The homework is to take pictures.",
    "I would definitely recommend ART 138. If you get in, you HAVE to take it. It is such a great break from the paper writing and psets but yet you are still putting it a lot of work and learning a lot.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "it's a great class, i would say definitely take it. photography is a skill that you'll be able to use no matter where you are or what you're doing. i feel like i've improved a lot this semester.however, keep in mind it's something you have to be constantly thinking about. you have to have your camera with you at all times. getting ready for a crit is not like cramming for an exam, you can't leave it to last minute or it will be a stressful nightmare.be ready to spend some $$$",
    "YESSSSS. I loved this class and would take it again if I could!! It will make you so much more appreciative of your surroundings, you'll be happy you documented important things in your life and you'll have this skill for the rest of your life! I can already see that I'm taking way more photos now and enjoying it a lot more. On top of it all, Dru is such a chill, wonderful teacher!"
