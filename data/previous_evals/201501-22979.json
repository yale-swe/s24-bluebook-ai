    "A fascinating, low-pressure course; something that is really refreshing to take on the side of harder, more time-consuming classes. Expect about three or four hours of homework a week - easily doable.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student interested in music, even someone who has just played an instrument in the past.",
    "I expected this to be an easy course just cause I've been playing an instrument for 15 years but that didn't help at all. It was a bunch of work to have assignments due every class and quizzes, but we did learn all the material well. Tahirih was great. Rondo Alla turca starts with a B section and nobody will convince me otherwise."
