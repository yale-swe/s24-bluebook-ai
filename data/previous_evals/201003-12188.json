    "This class is a nice intro to the diversity of fishes. Tom Near is a great lecturer and does a wonderful job sharing his enthusiasm for fishes. We ran out of time to cover all the lineages at equal depth, but we definitely covered some of the cooler fish facts out there.",
    "TAKE IT. IT'S GREAT. Basically, you survey the diversity of fishes (i.e., all non-tetrapod vertebrates), mostly at the level of the extant orders, though there are plenty of examples of interesting families, genera, species, and fossil clades. For non-majors, this class in totally approachable. The EEB majors will find the \"what is a species?\" and the \"what is sexual selection?\" lectures a little boring, but vast majority of the class focuses on really cool stuff that there's pretty much no way you could have seen before. Start your paper *early*, no, seriously, and if you can, take the opportunity to get to know Professor Near (Tom) -- he's totally approachable and has lots of fascinating things to say.",
    "take it. you have to take it- it's amazing.",
    "Definitely. Without question. It was my favorite class.",
    "Loved the course! Got a little repetitive learning about all of the different fish species, but Professor Near kept things exciting! Great lecture environment. Loved how comfortable everyone felt in asking questions and commenting during lecture.",
    "Definitely recommend it. I have literally zero science background (never even took Bio in HS), and it was fine. There were a couple things that went a little over my head, but they were very few and far between and weren't tested on.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot about fish. Professor Near is a \"bro\".",
    "decent class. take it for a science credit.",
    "This course examines the evolution of fish. I would absolutely recommend this course. At least two whole weeks are devoted to sharks!",
    "Fairly interesting class. Learn a lot about the diversity among fishes. Midterm, paper, and a final; pretty standard.",
    "It's a survey course of fish, and I would recommend it to you if that sounds appealing.",
    "This class is a great science to take whether you are a science major or just looking to fulfill the requirements. Professor Near is a lot of fun in lecture. Most of the material is so interesting, but when it gets dry he really tries to keep things fun. There is a midterm, paper and final. The tests cover a lot of information, but if you remember all of the evolutionary themes of the course, you'll be fine.",
    "Great course!!! A bit dense, but manageable!",
    "It's a relatively interesting way to get a Science credit. But the level of minutiae is annoying.",
    "take it. very very enjoyable. makes you appreciate fish and think about their significance more",
    "This is a great class. Professor Near is a good lecturer and the course material is interesting.",
    "Overall, I thought the course was interesting...I definitely learned more about interesting things about fish than I ever thought possible! However, I would have to say that you pretty much need to be self-motivated to do well or get a lot out of the class. With only one midterm and one final, and a term paper due the last week of class (not that I'm complaining that there's not a lot of work), there aren't many assignments to keep you up-to-date with the material, and when you get to the final and realize that (1) it's cumulative and (2) there are 32 PDFs and over 1600 slides to study for, you wish that you had been more on top of things all semester. It's a class that's really based on a lot of hardcore memorization, and though it's not the toughest stuff to understand, you definitely have to put in the work. All in all, it's good stuff, but may not be the best choice if you're just looking to fulfill the Sc requirement.",
    "This is a great class. It's not too much work (just concentrated patches around the midterm, final, and paper), and Professor Near is really wonderful. Also, if you're worried that \"fish\" seems like too narrow a topic, I feel that I learned a lot about evolutionary biology in general as well as some pretty cool fish. Take it.",
    "To those of you planning not to take the lab:Either you need to set aside some time each week to review the material on your own or you should be very good at cramming for this class not to be stressful. It is doable as a non-science major but not as gutty as the popularity would suggest.There is nothing due for non-labbers besides the midterm and final, and though neither is out-to-get-you, they're not curved. So study.Material is totally fun.",
    "If you only take one course in the EEB department, take Ornithology. I think ichthyology focuses a bit too heavily on phylogeny. You'll walk out of the class feeling like you know more about the tree of life than you do about fishes. It's also not terribly concept driven. You're asked to learn a lot of taxonomic relationships that you're unlikely to remember after the final exam. If we learned more about comparative anatomy, sustainable resource use, or biochemistry, the application of the themes might be more universal (even for non-science majors).",
    "I LOVE THOMAS NEAR. He's so precious. This class was really interesting and really fun, great for non-science majors (especially if you have a good memory). Do it. Do it now.",
    "This class is baller. Through sheer force of personality and sweet powerpoint video clips Prof. Near manages to take one of the most objectively boring subjects (at least for a non-fish-fanatic like me) and turn it into an engaging lecture. I ended up not only becoming really excited about fish but also picking up the important points of evolutionary biology and phylogenetics on the way. Prof. Near is a great guy who is committed to his students, and can make a 70-person lecture feel like a seminar. If you need a science credit and aren't terrified of a little work (or sharks) then this is the class for you.",
    "This is a great class to take if you 1) love fishes 2)love Animal Planet 3) need a science course that is more interesting than most.",
    "Take this if you want a phylogenetic-based survey of fish diversity. This is much more of a 'what kinds of fish are there' class than a 'what do fish do and how' class.",
    "Great science class for anyone interested in fish. Not too hard, but not a gut by any stretch of the imagination. Lots of fun.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The tests are hard, but each day, you walk out of the class with new knowledge. Plus, we watch crazy youtube videos that you will want to share with all of your friends over dinner.",
    "Ichthyology is a great overview if you want to learn about fish. I would recommend this class to other students. Make sure to understand the material throughout the semester instead of just at the midterm and final or else it will be overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Prof. Near makes everything interesting and managed to make a large lecture feel like a seminar a lot of the time. He welcomed our participation, questions and comments.",
    "This is a survey of all the different kinds of fish with a focus on the evolution, physiology and morphology of fishes (it is fishes, not fish as I learned in this class). You learn a lot about all different cool kinds of fish. I would recommend EEB 264 to any student looking for an engaging and interesting class about a group of organisms that people don't usually think of as a particularly enthralling group of animals. But you will come out with a newfound appreciation for them. The class is not very difficult but not a gut either.",
    "Great class",
    "ICHTHY is awesome. TAKE IT. It's a complete survey of all lineages of fish mixed with wonderfully enlightening evolutionary concepts that shape one's entire perspective of the natural world. But if not just for the fish, take ICHTHY for Prof. Near. He's a real gem at Yale. He cares about his students, he makes time for his students outside of class, he lectures well, he encourages questions during class (which results in questions -- and interesting ones, generally), he seems to know everyone's name (and there were ~60 people in class!), and his enthusiasm for fish is contagious. The tests can be challenging, and there's a 10-page paper, but Prof. Near will help you if you're struggling. Moreover, he cares if you're genuinely interested in the subject matter and want to learn.In sum, ICHTHY is one of the better lectures at Yale.",
    "This is a good class for people either fascinated with Ichthyology, or who are mildly interested in fish and have practically no background in science whatsoever. I belonged in the latter category, and I found this course very manageable. You will have to put in a decent amount of work, especially toward the end of the semester as a result of having both a term paper AND a final. Nonetheless, the professor is fairly engaging, and there are truly gems of information to be learned. If you think learning about fish for 3+ months sounds terrible, however, obviously do not take the class.",
    "Like Discovery Channel's Shark Week?TRY PROFESSOR NEAR'S FISH CLASS!!!Great class for science major.Perfect class for non-science major.Not too gut, but definitely not hard.",
    "A survey of fish evolution and phylogeny. Take it if you're interested in fish, this is as good a class you'll get on the subject.",
    "This course was amazing, and, yes, you should take it. I had only a mild interest in fish, and since taking this course I have bored the pants off so many of my friends talking about it. Fish are seriously cool. Shop it and you'll be convinced.Prof. Near is also the nicest. He has an extremely dorky sense of humor that's very endearing, and is passionate about his work - this passion translates to his teaching.Also, as my \"easy\" class for the semester, I felt completely fine skipping class (regrettably) quite a bit towards the end of the semester. Lecture slides are posted online, and they're really all you need for exams.Exams have a lot of detail that you do need to know, but it's interesting material. The paper can, literally, be about anything you choose. There are no minus grades.Basically, you should probably take it.",
    "Fish are fascinating! It's like an extended episode of some show on the Discovery Channel.You do not have to purchase any textbooks save the paperbacks. Go to lecture (they're fun!), do well on the midterm, study for the final (flashcards!) and find an interesting topic to write about for the research paper and all will be well.Incredibly interesting and entertaining thanks to Professor Near, who is only professor (or human?) in recorded history to ever recommend \"Joe Dirt\": \"If you ever just don't want to think, you should watch it.\"",
    "This class was very interesting as a non-science major. However, I felt a little overwhelmed with the amount of information and the level of knowledge from the science majors in the class.",
    "Take it, especially if you need a science credit. I know \"the study of fishes\" might not be on your radar, but Professor Near is AWESOME and makes the material come to life. He really is a fabulous professor--the kind that Yale needs to have more of. You'll find yourself being genuinely interested in things that seem unbelievably boring to the objective observer. And, of course, it's a nice and easy science credit for all the humanities recluses. Oh, and Professor Near doesn't believe in minus grades, so it's pretty easy to do well (seriously, he doesn't give out minus grades).As for logistics, there's almost no work. DON'T DO ANY OF THE READINGS. Seriously. I aced both tests having not even purchased any of the text books. Because of this, there is NO WEEKLY WORK TO DO. That said, if you're going to skip the readings, make sure to GO TO LECTURE AND TAKE GOOD NOTES. He posts the lecture slides online, but if you want to really do well on the exams, you need to understand the details of what he's saying. Finally, STUDY REALLY REALLY HARD FOR THE EXAMS. The midterm is 25% of the grade and the final is 50%, and it's all about how much you cram. The tests are pretty detailed, but if you study hard, you can do well. There's also a paper that's worth 25%, but you can literally write about anything you want that's tangentially related to fish (actually this is a pretty cool assignment).To recap: all you have to do is go to class and study hard for the exams (as well as write the paper). And TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Near is AWESOME, fish are surprisingly interesting, and it's an easy science credit.",
    "you learn everything about fish more or less, starting with things that aren't really fish in every day conception and ending up with more normal fish. lots of cool things to learn because lots of fish are weird.",
    "Ichthyology was a moderately interesting class. Prof. Near is a dynamic and interesting lecturer. Although a major portion of the class is a survey of all the lineages of fish, Prof. Near also taught about other aspects of fish biology and ecology. These lectures were the most interesting; the survey lectures tended to be much more boring, but fortunately Prof. Near would tend to emphasize interesting stories about each lineage of fish; rather than just giving us their characteristics.",
    "A good overall survey of fishes if you have no background in organismal biology. A little bit oversimplified for science majors. It's rather unfortunate that the tests focus on relatively specific details rather than overarching concepts, so be sure to memorize things like the numbers of species.",
    "This is a great class! If you are a fish enthusiast, science major, someone trying to fulfill a science requirement, or pretty much anyone with any interest in fish, you should take this class. Professor Near is interesting and entertaining, and the atmosphere is laid-back yet very informative. Two thumbs up.",
    "Great class. Very interesting topic for pretty much anyone--science major or not."
