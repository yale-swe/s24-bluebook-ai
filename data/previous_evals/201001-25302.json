    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. Every morning at 9:30 for an hour and forty minutes may kill you.",
    "Lots of work, moves at a fast pace. A good way to learn Spanish quickly.",
    "This is a really intense class--2 hours of class a day, 1-2 hours of homework every night, plus many quizzes and tests...however if you have time in your schedule, it's a lot of fun and your spanish will noticeably improve. It makes more sense then taking L3 by itself since L3 is basically just a review. Pilar is great!",
    "If you ever took a foreign language class in middle school, you know what to expect from this. Activities straight out of the book, useless grammar exercises, students thinking it's funny to butcher the language, and corny, made-for-Americans-learning-Spanish soap operas. I dreaded class each and every day.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who's serious about improving their Spanish. If not, just take the regular Spanish courses.",
    "Take it if you are content on continuing Spanish. Before you sign up, make sure you can make it to a two hour 9:20 class ever day!"
