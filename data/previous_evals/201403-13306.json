   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely rewarding for those interested in intellectual history and\/or U.S. foreign policy. It offers a macro-history of American engagement with the world from the Federalist Papers to the end of the Cold War, mostly from the perspective of policymakers and intellectuals (very little \"history from below\"). I would definitely recommend the course, because it helps with primary source analysis as well as historical writing. Not to mention Professor Cohrs is a brilliant cosmopolitan who makes himself available to students and leads an engaging, if challenging, seminar.",
    "Yes. The class offers a broad overview of the ideas and ideologies of the United States from the Founding Fathers period up until the end of the cold war. The primary sources are a unique feature of the class. While the readings for many history classes that I have taken are heavily based on secondary literature, the one for this class was the opposite. And that is what I believe the study of history should be about. Class discussions are often very productive, thanks to the small size of the seminar. Professor Cohrs was consistently well-prepared for class. He never failed to urge us to think deeply about the motivations behind the primary sources, as well as about the larger questions of the class. He was insightful, eloquent, demanding, but also generous. I enjoyed his ironic humor as well. Overall, this was a very good class. Take it!",
    "Recommended. It traces thematically the genealogy of US foreign ideas and ideology from \"City Upon the Hills,\" Federalist Papers, isolationism, all the way to twentieth-century interventionism and exemplarism. What I found particularly helpful are the first-hand reading materials with a great diversity, from public addresses, congressional speeches, private letters, etc. by the key historical figures themselves, to let students listen to their own voices. They are supplemented with optional secondary interpretations. But it may require a little more understanding of international politics when the course enters the twentieth century."
