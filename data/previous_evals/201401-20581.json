    "It is just like French 110 in structure, but I enjoyed it much more. I felt like something finally clicked in my head regarding French. If you are feeling discouraged after French 110, don't fear. It gets better in French 120.",
    "Although it is one of the more intense language programs, French is actually great and a lot of fun. It is taught incredibly well and the story line that you follow is great. Professor Vysosias is very organized and uses a bit more English than some of the other professors - which is both good and bad. She is, like all the French professors, a great teacher who will hold you accountable for all the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! It is a lot of work and the pace is quick, but you learn a lot.",
    "It's great",
    "I love French! This second semester was slightly less work than the previous semester, or perhaps it felt that way because I got used to it. French at Yale is not for the faint of heart in that there are potentially multiple hours of work every day. However, my time investment paid off. I feel comfortable speaking French, I listen to some French music, and I find myself easily reading French social media posts. I very much recommend this class as my French classes have been my favorite classes for the past year.",
    "French 120 is definitely rigorous but you learn a lot. I am excited to move on to L3 with the basis provided by this level."
