   "comments": [
    "This was a good over-view of European Union policies, challenges, and opportunities.",
    "I learned a ton about the EU, its development, history, issues, from whence it came. Pretty interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about EU politics.",
    "This course was AMAZING. David Cameron is awesome and really knows everything there is to know about the EU.",
    "In this course, I developed an understanding of contemporary policy challenges facing the EU, such as the Eurozone crisis, migration crisis, Brexit, Ukraine crisis, etc. This began with examinations of the institutions and treaties that comprise the union.",
    "I learned so much about the European Union, from European democracy to the refugee crisis. The seminars are designed so that we would cover one aspect of the EU every week. It's usually fun and engaging.",
    "The EU is a highly complex institution with many challenges facing it. This class taught me a lot about how it functions and interacts, both as a Union and with the rest of the world. I learned a lot both about the EU and comparative politics and the final paper was a good introduction to thesis work.",
    "This class contexualized current events impacting the world through an EU lens. I learned about the complexity of the EU structure, the impact of external forces on the EU, the rise of euroskepticism and xenophobia, and the prospect of additions to the EU (as well as many other areas).",
    "This class was a great introduction but also an in-depth analysis of the European Union. As promised, the EU delivered.",
    "This class certainly helped develop my qucik reading, critical thinking, and debating skills. I really was forced to learn new ways to approach thinking about the EU and it's many problems and challenges."

   "comments": [
    "The topics covered by the course were interesting, but the seminar meetings were a bit challenging, as it was difficult for students to get in to talk. Professor Cameron often monologues on issues, or asks questions but then doesn't give students a chance to answer.",
    "Strengths: learned much more than I anticipated Weaknesses: The professor tends to talk a lot, which can be interesting but he asks really long questions.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Cameron: he is an incredibly accessible professor, and a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge. The genuine enthusiasm that he displays during seminar makes coming to class more fun. Additionally, the wide range of topics covered in the course allowed me to understand the EU in a variety of new and different facets. Professor Camerons seminar style, however, is mundane and unengaging. Instead of allowing students to engage in conversation with each other, the way he moderates discussion is by posing questions, calling on individual students to answer them, engaging in back and forth with that studentand then simply moving on. Students were rarely asked to pose their own questions, making the content of seminar less privy to their interests, and more in line with those of Professor Cameron. Additionally, because Professor Cameron calls on individuals students and has discussions one at-a-time, it is easy for the students he doesnt call on to disengage from conversation and even difficult for students with things to say to interrupt. Another weakness of this course is the way in which Professor Cameron provides feedback. While it is admirable to have weekly responses, Professor Cameron rarely wrote more than a one or two sentence comment upon returning each response, and the majority of the time they were limited to nice comment or excellent discussion. As a result, I, along with my peers, had a difficult time parsing how we were doing in the course, and felt as if our scholarly work was not critiqued, and hence not elevated. A way around this, perhaps, would be to cut the amount of assignments in half, and then really critique each comment, and have students rewrite or respond to the professors comments. Lastly, while there are interesting readings over a variety of topics, the course lacks a variety of perspectives over each topicapproaching issues with a large integrationist bent. To make matters worse, every single reading was written by a white authorand 90% of the readings are done by white men. This appears especially problematic considering that some of the topics covered are about migrants and xenophobia. Professor Cameron, of course, provides a variety of alternative readings about each topic in the syllabus, but none of them are required. The result is that the intellectual diversity within the room only comes when people go above and beyond to make it happenand sessions are often cookie cutter if not.",
    "The course is well-structured, but I think taking a break in the middle of the afternoon seminar might encourage students to focus and participate more throughout the class period.",
    "The course was well structured: first outlining the major institutions and bureaucratic processes of the EU to give a basic understanding and then delving into the issues and challenges facing the EU. The assessment was fair and the discussion always interesting. The course could be improved through more dynamic debate during class time.",
    "Professor Cameron is by far the best seminar leader I have had. He challenges students to address difficult questions during class, assigns fascinating reading, and gets to know his students. There was so much material to cover and I wish we had more time to cover it all.",
    "Very in depth about the things it chose to focus on. Huge diversity of readings with a great deal of depth and wonderfully informative additional readings. Only critique would be lack of guiding questions to guide our critical analysis of the weekly readings."

   "comments": [
    "If you are particularly interested in the legal structures of the European Union, less so in the geopolitical and social workings, this is a good course for you. The focus is much more on legal structures and frameworks than on-the-ground political reality. The readings are wrapped up in legal and political theory rather than practice much of the time, and seminar is often a bit dull when Professor Cameron gets monologuing. Still you do learn about various EU structures and develop a decent baseline of knowledge on EU systems.",
    "It was a good course and I did learn a lot. Would recommend",
    "Well...I'd recommend the course if the EU is still around the next time it is being offered. Professor Cameron is really nice and the material is clearly interesting to study at this particular moment in time.",
    "Yes, if you want to know more about the EU, this class is the way to go. You might find that a lot of the other students in the class know more about it than you do, but DC is such a great professor. He really tries to include everyone in discussion in a considerate way.",
    "I would tentatively recommend this course to another student with hopes that Professor Cameron improves his pedagogical style, increases his feedback on assignments, and shortens and diversifies the readings. As is, the course is not badbut just nowhere near living up to the potential that Professor Cameron has to offer. The biggest strength of this course is Professor Cameron: he is an incredibly accessible professor, and a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge.

    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have any level of interest in the European Union, economy, or political science.",
    "Professor Cameron is the best. He is incredibly knowledgeable about Europe and is great at leading discussion in class. The material is very interesting and the discussions are engaging, though some of the reading is a little slow. If you are interested in Europe and politics, this is a great seminar to take.",
    "If you are interested in the EU then you should definitely take this course. Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable and the topics are very interesting.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to another student. Professor Cameron is a fantastic seminar leader, the material covered is extremely relevant to what is currently taking place in the world, and you will leave having a very solid understanding of EU affairs.",
    "Take it if you are legitimately interested in learning about the European Union. Professor Cameron is extremely passionate about the subject matter and covers anything and everything concerning Europe, the EU, and current events affecting the region.",
    "Yes but make sure you have a deep interest in the subject as many of the readings are very detailed and narrow."
