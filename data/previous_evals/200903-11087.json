   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course as a very interesting and stimulating seminar with a great subject material. I only wish that we could have had more time, as some of the themes would benefit from more time devoted to them. This is wishing for the impossible, however, and I did thoroughly enjoy the course. Professor Cabanes is a great instructor, very friendly and professional and always open to student input.One minor caveat would be that the nature of the course relies heavily on the students participating. This worked very well with our class, but be aware that your enjoyment will rely on the engagement and activity of fellow students even more so than in other seminars.",
    "Any student planning on engaging with the topic of war in his or her work will find this course invaluable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it is a very interesting course and also important in that it examines how a normal person can sometimes commit such horrible actions.",
    "An engaging and unique class. Be forewarned that the material is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are genuinely interested in the human and also the environmental impact\/aspect of warfare. Material and coinciding perspective were excellent and unusual and invaluable--but also intensive. Absolutely I would recommend this class. I would recommend it to fellow theology majors especially-- those who are working in pastoral care because of our perpetual engagement in warfare and our weakness in dealing with the trauma of war. I would like to see a joint class with the theology department(s) because this area is not addressed adequately and should be."

   "comments": [
    "It certainly opened my eyes to a range of approaches to the study of war and conflict outside of my regular field. I enjoyed the interdisciplinary approach, drawing on literary studies, anthropology, sociology, political science and etc. and Professor Cabanes' frequent references to other works on the topics outside the reading list has been most helpful in exploring some themes more in-depth.",
