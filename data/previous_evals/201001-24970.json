   "comments": [
    "Easy, Decent mcdb elective\/5th class. I hear the lab is good. Credit\/d would be an absolute breeze.",
    "It was pretty good. especially for somebody who is looking to go to medical school, since Micro is important in medicine.",
    "Yes, totally. Take this class if you're interested in Biology at all. If you are a real person. If you've ever been sick. TAKE IT.",
    "This is a good biology class, and I learned quite a lot. Both professors were good speakers, and I also liked the fact that they were both women! The exams are not too bad, but you definitely have to study and know your stuff. Take the lab too if you can as many of the bacteria that you work with there are used as examples in the lectures.",
    "Yep! A fun course where you learn a lot of stuff you wouldn't elsewhere. They go a little team-teaching crazy, but hopefully they'll tone it down. I have a feeling that Professor Bascom-Slack is going to be a great teacher of this course with a little more practice; she was already pretty good. Christine is, of course, amazing.",
    "Microbiology is a good class. I learned a lot, but it never felt like an overwhelming workload, because the lectures were often easy and enjoyable to follow, so I learned a lot in class and the amount of material learned for each test never felt like as much as it was.",
    "Pretty good bio class. Not as hard as some other bio classes. But the first test is really hard - don't be deceived! The later tests are much more manageable, though. Overall, pretty good class.",
    "A solid intro to microbiology. Make sure you have a solid biology background as some of the concepts covered can be challenging",
    "Yes I recommend this class it is more specialized and smaller class with great opportunities to interact with professors and to learn about research happening at Yale. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. it was useless.",
    "It's interesting and not to work heavy. Take it.",
    "Challenging, but a good course.",
    "This is a very good class to take for an introduction to microbiology. The class has its ups and downs in terms of interesting lectures. The guest lectures tend to be too basic and, depending on the guest, not very engaging. However, you do learn about many different diseases and the importance of microbes in everyday life.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another person if the curriculum remains the same. It was dry for such a potentially interesting course. The lecturers were fine, but the material covered were just too simple. The topic is very interesting, but this course just was not in depth enough.",
    "This class isn't that difficult. A lot of topics are covered on a basic broad level and they can get a little dry by the end of the course. The class and lectures notes are organized and clear. Microbio isn't the most interesting of classes but it's a decent MCDB course to take.",
    "Take it. Small class, interesting material. Professor Jacobs-Wagner is amazing!"
