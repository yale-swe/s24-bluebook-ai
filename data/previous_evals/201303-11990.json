    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in the brain\/how it works.",
    "It was a great senior seminar but it was also a ton of work, so be prepared!! Class was always extremely interesting though.",
    "Absolutely. If you are motivated and devoted, and interested in neuroscience, you should take this class.",
    "Definitely if you have done some prior research, so the course load does not overwhelm you. Prior background is necessary so you can actually critically contribute to the discussion in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I really enjoyed it and feel like I learned a lot through taking it.",
    "100% take this class. I found myself actually thinking about my decisions day in and day out. Fascinating material. Great professor. What every Yale course should be.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot about different aspects of decision making like valuation, temporal discounting, and risk.",
    "Decision Neuroscience is an excellent, enjoyable seminar. You read about 5 scientific articles a week, which can seem daunting at first, but by the end of the semester you have covered a lot of the fundamental material that tries to answer the question of what goes on in the brain when we make choices. The workload for the course is very reasonable. You have to write a response paper to the article that you read for class (reading + writing = about 5 hours), and twice a semester help lead the class, which turned into people bringing candy and cookies for demos. I think this was a good way of keeping the class engaged. Good times. You also do a final paper. Professor Samanez-Larkin is the man, and really knows a lot about the field. He helps guide the class discussion and makes sure the key points are covered. Overall, I'd highly recommend the course.",
    "Fantastic neuro psych senior seminar. Very interesting topics. Weekly reading responses meant you always had some work to do, but it also made sure we were all engaged in the material and ready to discuss in class. Some of the best scientific discussions I've had were in the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Professor Samanez Larkin is the best, he's a very fair grader and super open\/approachable. The class is extremely interesting, and if you take it you will learn a lot and enjoy the semester.",
    "Definitely, absolutely, of course take this class. The reading is challenging but fascinating, and you will learn so much about the brain. Most importantly, though, GSL is AWESOME and as fascinating as the readings are, he's really what makes this class great. Take it if you can get in - you'll love it!",
    "As far as senior seminars go, I think this is one of the best you'll ever find, but it was a ton of work. Prepare yourself for multiple scholarly neuroscience articles EVERY SINGLE WEEK. You'll get really good at know what parts of the articles are important to focus on and what other parts to read less intensely because the authors are just being esoteric. By the time you get to the end of the semester you'll actually be impressed with yourself and how much you've learned over the course of a few months.",
    "Take this course, especially if taught by professor Samanez-Larkin! The material was dense at times, but professor SL really made it understandable and connected what we were learning in class to real-life applications."
