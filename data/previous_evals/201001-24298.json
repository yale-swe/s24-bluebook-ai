    "Take this course if you're:1) A native speaker looking to learn more about Chinese diasporic literature. It will be interesting and not too difficult for you.2) A non-native Chinese major looking to learn about Chinese diasporic literature and improve reading ability and speed. It will require enormous amounts of time and work, but if you're a Chinese major, it will be helpful for your senior thesis.3) A grad student with high developed Chinese skills interested in the subject.If you're interested in the subject, it's a great course and in the second half, you get to read really great literary pieces.",
    "It is a great class. Professor Tsu is charismatic and the class discussions are always interesting. For the first part of the course, the class focuses on translating traditional texts more, while in the second part, the course goes into more literary analyses. The reading is light but all very interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "If you want to improve your Chinese conversational skills, DON'T take this class. If you want to learn about different writings among diasporic communities of Chinese writers, improve and critical reading and translation skills, you definitely should take this course. It offers a good variety of Chinese literature, and will give you a different perspective on Chinese communities as well."
