   "comments": [
    "If you are not a fan of reading dense philosophy and discussing highly abstract theory (even if you enjoy contemporary political theory), this course will not be very enjoyable for you.",
    "Definitely take it. Kapustin is an excellent professor you don't want to miss out on!",
    "Everyone should take this class, whatever major and whatever life plan and whatever WHATEVER. Our society is collapsing and the world is ending and this course will tell you why.",
    "A bit boring because there's not much participation, but that's fine because just hearing Kapustin talk teaches you more than you'll learn anywhere else. He's quite brilliant and really illuminates the deep structure of each thinker's work and how they connect to each other.",
    "EP&E 215 asks students to think critically and deeply examine the ideologies of various philosophers. There are two major grading points--the first is the take-home midterm exam, and the second is the final paper. 20% of the grade is class participation, which I believe is not too rigorous, and asks students to participate consistently. I would definitely recommend EP&E 215 to other students, not necessarily just ones interested in the EP&E major, but anyone interested in intellectual exploration and critical reading of political philosophy.",
    "This class is incredible, no doubt about it.",
    "Great seminar and amazing reading list. Professor Kapustin is so knowledgeable and you learn so much just from hearing him speak. There was less student discussion than most other seminars, but I was fine with that because Kapustin is amazing. Take it if you get in!",
    "I would Classics with Kapustin if I were an EP&E major, or if I were looking for a solid foundation and overview of the literature.",
    "Legendary class! I would take it again if I could.",
    "Yes!",
    "Classics with Kapustin is an amazing experience. His readings of traditional texts are lucid and, in many ways, different from some of my other exposures. Kapustin understands political theory as historically efficacious and powerful, and constantly pushes the class to test theory in history. Overall, an amazing experience with one of Yale's greats."
