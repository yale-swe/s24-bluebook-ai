   "comments": [
    "Not a life-changing course. The course focuses on a pretty narrow range of approaches to what could be called toleration, and doesn't address in any depth questions about long-term cultural evolution and change, without which I don't think there can be much insightful discussion of toleration. If you have some exposure to political philosophy, take a careful look at the syllabus and see if the readings excite you. Professor Sabl is fairly solid--he cares about students a lot and knows the material--but I didn't get as much as I had hoped out of the course.",
    "A challenging upper-level seminar but one with highly relevant topics and themes. Taught in Liberty Fund style format, which moves discussion along better than most classes at Yale but is therefore mostly student driven and depends on student engagement even though Peofessor Sabl is nonetheless extremely knolwdgeable about the texts.",
    "The course should have been called \"Toleration: In Theory\" because I felt like all we ever did was discuss the theory, while largely skimming over (or ignoring) all the practical application of what we learned. I don't understand why we didn't discuss the recent Charlie Hebdo attacks. To me, issues like that are much more interesting that theory alone. I would also add that the enjoyment of the seminar will largely revolve around the other students in the class. Take this into consideration while choosing the class.",
    "I will probably never take a more intellectually rigorous course at Yale - if you are up to the task, make sure to shop the first two seminars and get a sense of the class dynamic.",
    "Great seminar if you do the reading. You have to show up prepared and ready to contribute, but it helps you crack open the seemingly straightforward topic of toleration to see it in all its real complexity and difficulty, both as a concept and as a practice nations struggle to put into place."
