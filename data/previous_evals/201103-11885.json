    "NOTE: THE FIRST 3 OR 4 PROBLEM SETS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE EXAMS OR THE OTHER PROBLEM SETS......At first the course seems easy--it is NOT. The problem sets get very very hard, as do the exams. You will spend tons of time on them (easily 8-16 hours per problem set, sometimes more, unless you have a real knack for programming).You really don't need to go to lecture as long as you do the reading and read the lecture notes afterwards (the lecture notes are just a program that the professor writes which has to do with the reading for that week).In sum, this class is FUN and CHALLENGING, but absolutely not a gut. Take it if you're interested!!",
    "Lots of little intruiging mind puzzles disguised as p-sets. Lectures are tedious; TAs are helpful. Take this course if you enjoy tinkering with things and thinking about organization.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in learning about programming! I highly recommend it to all. Workload-wise, there are 8 problem sets that take substantial time, but that's about it.",
    "This class is the perfect introduction for anyone who hasn't programmed before. I was a bit unsure myself about whether to take the class, but I'm so happy that I have - especially now that I've gained such a useful skillset. It was clear that Dr. Abadi invested an incredible amount of time in planning out an organized structure for the course to be taught in, and he made it a priority to make sure no one was left behind. Eight times we had the option of going to an \"enrichment\" lecture, in which an interesting topic in programming was covered (that we did not have to know for the final), or a review lecture. The workload was reasonable (eight problem sets, the first of which took less than an hour), and the grading was very organized and generous. They told us howthe points of each problem on the midterm were given out, so there was no \"arbitrary\" grading whatsoever. It was fun to just do problem sets in groups and bounce ideas off each other - really good bonding times.I give the class my highest recommendation.",
    "This a great class for learning basic programming concepts. The problem sets are hard though.",
    "This is a great class to learn a little about programming.As the professor says on the first day, it really is an important skill for any major or area of study.Although I do not foresee myself pursuing computer science much further, I am glad to have taken the class.The only weakness is the size of the lecture, but there are plenty of TAs to help if you need them.Be ready for some long PSets, as they all build on each other.The first PSet takes about 30 minutes, but the last ones take upwards of 6 hours.",
    "I would definitely recommend Computer Science 112. It is a great course that teaches an applicable skill to students. The problem sets are certainly challenging, and take quite a bit of time as the course progresses, but they are definitely worth the hours spent. Take this class!",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to another student unless they are VERY, VERY, VERY interested in learning about programming. This class will suck up all of your time and there doesn't seem to be much of a reward for it. When you work over 20 hours on a problem set just to get a 17\/20, does that really seem worth it? The course is way more difficult than an intro course needs to be. You will find yourself dropping it on the last day of classes just like anyone else in the class without programming experience.",
    "DEFINITELY YES. I'm not a math person in the slightest, so this was the perfect QR for me. The problem sets are quite time consuming and there's one almost every week, so don't think this class will be a gut. Once you get the psets though, the grading is very fair and you have a pretty good idea of how you're doing in the class. Prof. Abadi is a great lecturer, I actually looked forward to this class even though it was in the morning. Take it! It made me consider being a CS major even though I despise math and numbers of all kinds.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have not had any prior experience, if you have this class will move far too slowly for you.",
    "Yes but they shouldn't take it unless they have somewhat of a knack for the subject matter and are willing to pour hours into weekly psets. They take foreverrr",
    "Take it, but be prepared to work if you have no background. Not out of this ballpark work, but definitely substantial work.",
    "CPSC112 is an introductory course in Java programming. I would definitely recommend this class to a friend (and have done so), but I would warn anyone taking it that it doesn't give you enough knowledge of Java to really do anything outside of the class; you would need to take more CS courses to be able to write a legitimate program.",
    "Solid textbook, awesome content. Lectures are extremely fast and hard to follow, course is very different from any other I've taken. Knowing this stuff is very important, but the class is not especially conducive to helping you out. You're almost better off reading the textbook on your own, and you should definitely stay on top of the reading throughout the semester, as the psets build on each other. I'd say take it, but beware of the workload, especially if this stuff isn't intuitive for you.",
    "I would only recommend this class if the student has a strong background in logical thinking and developingo algorithms.",
    "Not necessarily the most practically-oriented of classes, but it's still a cool introduction to a really interesting subject, and I feel a lot more confident about learning more about programming at this point. I think we get a good foundation from this.",
    "I tried really hard to enjoy this class, but as the semester progress, the class just got more and more unpleasant and tedious. I suggest you learn what this class teaches, skip it, and move on to CPSC 201 or ENAS 130. The professor tried to sell this class as forcing you to think in a \"different\" way. I disagree. You learn how to type various things in JAVA and then you put them in the right order to make your programs.",
    "I recommend it. Looking back at what I learned, this was a great course. I started with no idea what to do and I finished with a working knowledge of java and the ability to make a program that I could give as an xmas gift to my brother--pretty sweet deal. It wasn't perfect, of course; most of the problem sets required several clarification emails throughout the following week, and the midterm involved interpreting and writing code on paper, which I felt was very different from the work we had been doing all semester. I hope the final is better...",
    "I had no idea going into this class how time consuming it would be. I would highly suggest to take the course only if the rest of the student's schedule allows time for it. With varsity sports and two other problem set-based courses, I had no time for problem sets that took upwards of 10 hours to finish. The material is ridiculous to keep up with if a person has no experience with programming or a very logical mind.",
    "I had zero experience with programming before this class. The problem sets do take hours to do, but if you pay attention in class, start the problems sets on time, and go to office hours if you need help, you will definitely be more than fine.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "It's a pretty good course and not too hard.",
    "Great introduction to computer programming! We work with Java but the class is designed to teach you how to think like a programmer. Problem sets can take a while but if you start early you will find that it take less time to do them because you can think more clearly and come back to it if you have to instead of cramming the night before.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interesting in gaining some experience in computer programming. It is certainly not for everyone, and I had some friends who disliked the course, but I did enjoy figuring out the problem sets. The tests were not too difficult, testing mostly on the understanding of the concepts. There was also a lot of extra help available if needed for homework.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of very frustrating homework, very enjoyable, though short classes, and you will be able to tolerate, if not enjoy this class.",
    "A good, tough class. I took it credit d fail, which I have mixed feelings about because the difference in workload between a d and a c is enormously greater than that between a c and an a, so it's not clear whether it's really worth it to take it easy.",
    "Yes! It was a great class. It has a fair workload, but thr assignments are fun. Lectures aren't very informative but they do help you review.",
    "I encourage students to take this course--especially if they're looking to explore various interests. Even if you have no intentions of majoring in Computer Science, I recommend you to take the course. It's an a class you get a lot out of.",
    "Not a bad course, nothing too difficult, problem sets always sounded a lot more intimidating than they actually were. Programming is pretty fun if you're into that sort of thing. Not too much work, and easy to learn from the book. Abadi's a good lecturer, but going to lecture is also not necessary to doing well in this course (I think).",
    "This class was definitely a lot of work - I had a lot of QR classes this semester, so I had many problem sets to do and ended up working on the program assignments for this class pretty last minute. The assignments would take at least several hours, a couple took me upwards of 15 - this wouldn't have been so bad if I paced myself throughout the week - time management is definitely essential in this course. The material itself isn't very challenging - I came into this course with no programming experience at all, and I really, really enjoyed it, and am even considering majoring in computer science. If you have any experience, the problem sets will probably be way too easy and you'll get bored in the class. The lectures early on in the class were really useful, but towards the end of the class, the textbook was more informative than the class. Overall, really liked the class although it was a lot of work - Abadi was a decent\/good professor - I recommend it!",
    "CPSC112 is essentially a puzzle-solving class. This makes the problem sets rather fun at times, and keeps interest levels high among the students. Furthermore, the problem solving is done in a language that is decently useful in the \"real world,\" making you feel as though you come out of the class with some real tangible knowledge. I took this class as a Junior with no prior programming experience and found it immensely educational and not too difficult. I would certainly recommend this class to anybody and everybody.",
    "This is a good course that introduces you to the Java programming language. The class is taught well and some of the TAs were great. However be aware that this class will mostly teach you how to think like a programmer; the programming language is secondary. Also, be prepared for p-sets that start of easy and then become quite time consuming towards the middle to end of the semester.",
    "An extremely difficult (without prior experience) intro programming (java) class. I would only recommend this class to computer majors as the workload gets very tedious very quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn something new and interesting, I certainly learned a lot! It's suited perfectly for beginners who have absolutely no experience. I had no experience at all and didn't find it extremely difficult to follow along or learn, and by the final I was surprised at how much I knew. Some of the problem sets are super frustrating, however, if you haven't had prior experience and don't have a knack for problem solving per se. You can get stuck easily not understanding the problem or being unable to come up with an algorithm or debugging. But the good thing is, the TF's are all extremely helpful, so definitely go to Office Hours if you find yourself struggling! Another great resource is making appointments with the peer tutors, who can give individualized help too. They are a huge time sink though. The midterm was difficult for me because of the short time constraint, but the final was much better. I'd definitely take this class if you want to get some experience or learn what programming is all about.",
    "This class was great-I came in knowing nothing about programming, and now I can actually program (basics) in java. The problem sets take forever--start them early--but it's the best feeling when you create a working program that passes all of the required tests. Making your programs have personalities was really fun as well. During class he mostly just creates example programs that illustrate the concepts in the textbook, which is pretty helpful, but the textbook itself is awesome--read every single section that he tells you to, and you will learn how to program in java. Tests are open note, which is awesome as well. Take it!",
    "I took this class to fulfill my QR and because I was interested in learning to program. I had some background in HTML but I don't consider myself a natural math\/science type person and I'd never done any real programming. I ended up really enjoying the subject--it's so satisfying to write a useful program that works. But I did sometimes wish the course was a little better organized--I didn't find lectures very helpful so I basically taught myself most of the concepts out of the textbook. If you like learning foreign languages and grammar, this might be a good QR for you, since that's actually quite a bit like programming.",
    "Great course. DEFINITELY take. Learning a programming language is just a nice experience and gives you a great skill.",
    "Really cool class! I'd recommend it to anyone because it gives you an insight into how computers process information. Definitely helpful no matter what field you go into, and you come out feeling like you've learned a concrete skill.",
    "Great class. Start the psets early (Tuesday for a Thursday pset is pretty reasonable) and you will learn a TON and, if you have the right prof, you'll have fun doing them.",
    "If you're not a comp sci major, take this course.If you're thinking about it, take this course also.It's a fun course - simple as that. I'm not sure just how representative it is of the major itself (I'm sure you can talk to people about that) but all in all it's well taught, the workload is light, and best of all, you come out having Java experience!",
    "I guess I would recommend this course. I think that programming is a really valuable skill and so I would encourage anyone to take this intro. class as early as possible in their college careers. That being said, I wasn't the biggest fan of Abadi's lectures and we did not get through as much material as I would have hoped. This is a class that you can do well in by not going to lecture and just reading the book, in my opinion. If you have the time to spend on problem sets and a general interest in learning about programming then take it. The TA's are very helpful and there are lots of weekly office hours, so you can always get help if you are struggling.",
    "If you are interested in computers, or just need a QR, take it. If you dislike things like First-Order Logic and puzzles, don't: you'll hate it.",
    "This course was incredibly difficult and time consuming. It should not be advertised as a must take to people pursuing all majors. It is not a class for someone to take to just get a hint of what computer science is. Rather it is a rigorous class for people who know they are already interested in programming. And, it is a class for people who expect to continue with programming. The class went enough in depth such that it is not appropriate for people who just want a taste of what it is like (a survey course on java) and it used java such that it is not sufficient for people who really want to program. The TAs and QR tutors were great and accessible. It was really helpful to have so many office hours. Abadi was great, however, he talked too quickly. It is a well taught class, but you should be sure you want to take it. DEFINITELY NOT A CREDIT D F class (you spend way too long on problem sets for that)",
    "I recommend learning a bit of programming for anyone who is interested in improving his or her ability to think logically and solve problems. However, if you are not a math person (as in, someone whose strengths lie in learning a set of rules and applying them to solve problems), this class might be quite difficult due to the subject matter and the lack of resources available (office hours are very, very bloated after problem sets are posted). Also, there will be a lot of people gliding by in this course with ease because they have previous experience in programming and are taking this class for a good grade, which is frustrating.",
    "Intro Programming introduced me to java programming. Our p-sets were fun to do, and satisfying to complete, but often felt meaningless in a bigger scope of things.",
    "There is great value in getting some sort of taste in programming, however I would really rethink taking this course if you are not a compsci major. This is also not a very good class to take Credit-D as it still requires a fairly large effort to ensure that you can properly complete problem sets.",
    "Yes. It was fun, and, for a non-mathy person, it was a fun, accessible way to think differently than I usually do. A fun way to switch it up. Be careful, though, as some problem sets could take unnecessarily long. Most I was able to handle pretty well.",
    "I recommend it because it is useful to have a working knowledge of programming.",
    "I good introduction for someone who has had no prior experience in programming. (seriously no prior experience)The lectures are low key but useful, the textbook is actually helpful, the problem sets take a long time to complete but are kind of fun.I'm not sure if i learned enough to be able to try programming outside of a class (which is ultimately what I want to do) but the introduction couldn't have been anything but helpful.",
    "Computer Science 112 01 is a very good introduction to programming. You will learn about control structures, programming logic, data types, etc - all the fundamentals. The workload is reasonable, and if you get started on the PSETs early, they are fairly fun.",
    "if you like logic and problem solving this is a great course for you. You will look forward to the homework each week.",
    "A lecture based class. Can understand major concepts just by attending lecture but reading the textbook definitely helps. A good class though the problems sets are INTENSE in terms of time.",
    "Take it if you have time. Problem sets are actually fun materials, if you have time. It becomes stressful if you don't have time but still have to finish the problem set.",
    "Yes yes yes yes. This class has made me want to be a computer science major. Just try it",
    "It was a pretty cool intro class. It definitely took up a lot of my time this semester, but I'd say overall it was worth it. Abadi was nice and took off the top portion of the class in calculating the curve for the midterm. Definitely start the problem sets early and read the textbook before going to lectures. I'd say take it but be willing to put the time in.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's a great intro to programming if you have no experience. If you begin your problem sets over the weekend, you'll enjoy the process of finishing them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Programming itself is very fun. It teaches you to think in a way that you probably haven't before. I know some people instantly find it easy while some struggle through it, but even if you find it difficult, it's something worth learning. It also relates directly to everyday life - for example, we made a calculator and a sudoku solver this semester. Professor Abadi is really nice about making programming fun for everyone.",
    "The class is a very straight-forward introductory class, perhaps a bit too easy, but not uninteresting. Even those with no computer programming experience will probably not find it difficult. A programming assignment is due every week, but constant office hours with TFs are available for any help necessary, and most assignments can be finished in a day or so.",
    "This class was wonderful! It provided a basic introduction to java programming, and moved at a good pace throughout. The class is structured in a very organized manner, making the class easy to follow. Although some of the problem sets can take a good amount of time (like 4 - 7 hours), they are enjoyable to do. If you have a chance to take this class with Professor Abadi and are remotely interested in programming, I'd highly recommend shopping it.",
    "A must-take if you have any interest in programming. Workload is quite manageable in Abadi's class, especially if you are quantitatively oriented.",
    "If you're on the fence about this class, take it! Problem sets can actually be enjoyable, and even if they might take a long time, it's extremely satisfying to finish them at the end. The class teaches you the very basics of Java programming, but not much in terms of taking your programs and applying them practically (on the internet, etc.). If you've never programmed before, you really should take this class and learn this new way of thinking.",
    "CPSC 112 is a good introduction to programming. I came in knowing absolutely nothing about programming, and I feel that I have developed a good foundation. I really enjoyed the puzzle-solving nature of the course. Don't worry if you have no programming background; the course is very manageable. The expectations on the problem sets and midterm\/final are very fair. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone looking to learn a new skill.",
    "I personally found this class slow paced and boring. I stopped attending lecture toward the end (except the very end, go to that). It's good for teaching you how programs work, but you learn fairly little about the language in the class. It's good if you just want to see if you have an interest in Computer Science or get a basic understanding of how programs work. However, if you are at all considering the Computer Science major or have any programming experience, I would recommend 201. I had no experience, and still found it pretty easy. Not to say that the problem sets don't take much time, they do. Just that I didn't take too much away from the class.",
    "Yes, and utilize the TFs and the peer tutors!",
    "It will teach you whether or not you think algorithmically. If you don't, the problem sets will probably cause you undue stress, but if you do the class is ridiculously easy (the exams are as well).",
    "I'm torn--on the one hand, I feel I gained a strong rudimentary knowledge of Java and got a solid overall introduction to the principles of programming, the mindset you have to be in to do it effectively, a little bit about programming and computer science's uses and applications. Abadi is a very clear, informative, patient, upbeat lecturer. On the other hand, I'm not sure I learned at all enough to do much of anything with, unless I take more computer science classes, so if you're thinking about taking this one class so you can get a QR that's \"practical,\" I'm not sure you'd get what you're looking for. It is a pretty straightforward QR without any real math.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to put in the work. After taking this course, not only am I interested in Computer Science, but I feel that my problem solving abilities have increased significantly. The course was at times stressful and at times you feel as though you are unable to study for the test because no problem will be thrown at you twice. But the rewarding feeling of completing a difficult problem is priceless.",
    "You learn some java, but few specific programming skills; more focused is the general way programmers think.",
    "Yes. The class is incredibly time consuming and even frustrating at some points, but overall it was my favorite class and I absolutely recommend it. It established an incredible base of computer science knowledge."
