   "comments": [
    "This course allows for people to get a final chance to truly increase their fluidity in speaking and their writing (unless you are going to take L5). This course, while sometimes conflicting with other classes and tasks, was a good class that I enjoyed.",
    "I would recommend this course because it definitely pushes you to improve your language skills, but you will have to put in work.",
    "Yes! You do so much reading and writing that is really helps improve fluency",
    "Pretty much what you'd expect. Content-wise I'd say it's a little easier than L3, but the standards are a bit higher. I had a really positive experience with Professor Cividanes.",
    "Take it with Prof. Cividanes. You presumably don't have a choice in taking it, but still. It's tougher but more fun than L3.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 to another student if I thought they would get a lot out of it. Though I enjoyed the course, I was perhaps particularly well suited for it. I got a lot from the course because for me it was more remedial than instructive. I took several years of Spanish in high school and had seen much of the material presented in the course before. This time around, I got the chance to sure up the areas where my command of the language was weakest. I'm not sure what the course would be like to a student who had never used a conditional clause before, for example, so I'm not sure how I would respond to one if they asked for my ernest opinion.",
    "I would recommend Span 140 to another student. I personally don't love Spanish, but I didn't dread going to class and Professor Cividanes did a great job of making class enjoyable. It's also nice because you get to know different kids in the class because she makes you speak with different people.",
    "It is a great class to learn and improve your Spanish and to practice your oral skills.",
    "Take only if necessary."
