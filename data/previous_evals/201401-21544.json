    "go to class! people are doing very interesting things and you're lucky you get to hear about them. also everyone is helpful about what kind of paper you're writing or how to get an IRB, etc.",
    "The colloquium's pretty fun!",
    "You have to take it, not hard at all. Only thing to do is write the senior paper.",
    "Definitely. Cog sci is a great major and the senior project can be very rewarding.",
    "Take it to graduate. Pretty nice course.",
    "The teacher is available for questions about the senior essay, and students present to one another about their work. An interesting survey! I recommend using it as an opportunity to practice your presentation skills and your coming up with interesting question skills.",
    "There is no point to this question. If you're looking at this review, you must take this course, and it's good that you have to.",
    "Kate is great and really will help you with your project and paper if you're not getting much feedback from your advisor.",
    "Your basic thesis work presentations every week from everyone in the class. We give feedback\/questions afterward, and we update each other on the status of our thesis. Kate is really great--she's really easy to talk to and very helpful so definitely go to her with any issues you're having. She's very open to suggestions about the course and is helpful in holding you accountable in a generous way.",
    "Well, you know if you have to take it, so take it!",
    "I mean, if you're cogsci you have to take it, and if you're not cogsci you can't. Not bad though."
