    "History of Housing in America was an engaging and interesting course of insightful readings, challenging assignments, and thought-provoking discussions. I would certainly recommend it to any students interested in urban history or American studies. My only criticism is that it attracted some self-righteous students who felt the need to use baseless jargon to make what I found to be sophomoric arguments nearly every class. This minor annoyance aside, AMST 289 was an excellent course for American Studies majors and non-majors alike.",
    "\"History of Housing in America\" takes the cake for trippiest moment I've had at Yale. We were reading and engaging with a pretty damning critique of the university's role in New Haven on Yale's dime. I took this course in order to understand my personal background and the history of my city a little better, and I stand by it. The history and ideological currents contained therein are important, even if the style of the course which felt a little like a lecture at times, and wasn't always very lively wasn't always engaging. We need more courses covering urban studies at Yale, so it's a shame that Professor Taft is leaving.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to get a broad overview of housing trends in America. The reading was repetitive at times, however, the discussion was always interesting.",
    "I would recommend AMST 289 to another student interested in taking a closer look at something we take for granted, and contextualizing modern problems--especially inequality, poverty, and institutional racism--in a historical lineage.",
    "This is not a history of housing, it's a history of exploitation. If that's your thing, take it. Otherwise skip it, seminar leader at the time this was offered was not super enthusiastic. I was super hyped about this class and then it just kind of fell flat.",
    "History of Housing is an amazing course about what is seemingly a niche topic. I t goes into the early foundations of housing policy in the United States and its conception as a social construct. It was very interesting and one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and within the American Studies major.",
    "Good class on U.S. history through the lens of housing and urban development. Good set of literature for class readings and not an unreasonable amount of work. Not super in-depth but interesting general look of housing in America. Worth taking if you're interesting in the topic\/looking to learn about U.S. history.",
    "Good class to take if you're interested in housing in America. Less of a nuanced grasp on the 19th century but increasingly interesting the closer to present we got.",
    "Yes, but not if you are a junior or senior who has already taken an urban studies course. Then it may seem rather basic, as it is introductory in level.",
    "Yes!",
    "It should have been better than it was, I was disappointed overall. This really should have been a lecture. The class was too big and the material often wasn't conducive to meaningful discussions- I often felt I was just listening to the same people who enjoyed the sound of their own voices. I do think it is a very interesting\/important topic that is absolutely integral to understanding American culture, particularly race and class in America. There were three long reading responses, a presentation, two papers, another final presentation, and a final exam, which seemed like a lot of assignments."
