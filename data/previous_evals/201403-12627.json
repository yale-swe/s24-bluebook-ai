   "comments": [
    "I would definitely take this course-whether or not you are a science major. It is totally doable for the humanities-inclined among us. I urge you to take this course for your science credit instead of wasting time with one of the known gut classes. You'll even learn some often stuff along the way that will make you appreciate the world around you.",
    "Would recommend it if you have a physics background\/are good at quantitative word problems!",
    "Take it. It's a good core class and even if it's not required it is a fairly well taught QR course that you'll learn some cool stuff in, whether or not it is relevant to your field of study. Be aware that there are problem sets and budget time carefully on exams.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It involves enough math and physics to not be a throwaway QR or science credit, but not enough to really scare away a non-STEM student who wants to learn about a particularly accessible and interesting field of science. On the other hand, it is not so conceptual as to bore an intense STEM student. Overall, this class does a great job of introducing students to the structures and mechanisms of the global atmospheric and oceanic systems, while leaving them with interesting and very relevant knowledge about what drives daily weather and global warming patterns.",
    "G&G 140 is a great class to get a basic understanding of the function of some earth systems. I would definitely recommend it to another student, but I would suggest that they have taken chemistry beforehand.",
    "An interesting, frequent lecture with a lab component. Weekly psets.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit that involves some high school level math and that introduces you to the fundamental workings of our atmosphere, take this course! Professor Smith cares about the material a great deal, and although his lectures are formulaic (and available on Open Yale Courses), the depth of his knowledge shines through. The tests are tough because of short timeframes, but the PSets make up for any rough tests. Take this course if you get the chance!",
    "Are you and EVST major? If you are this is a required course so find a friend to take it with you and try to survive.",
    "Take the class and learn a lot about weather.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for EVST\/GG. Definitely won't be your favorite EVST course but they have you in a vice with no options so you have to. Be prepared for a lot of work and to not know what your grade is.",
    "I really loved this class, and it got me interested in Environmental Studies. Professor Smith is a great teacher and very approachable and helpful. I like that he always encourages us to ask questions, and his lectures are very clear. The class has good structure and I like the interconnection of all the topics, and how throughout the semester we're building on previous things we've learned. It's a very comprehensive overview of the environment and teaches you the foundation of many topics that allows you to figure out which you're interested in further pursuing. One of my favorite classes, and definitely worth having to take the lab for. Even though it's at 9 am, I never found myself bored or falling asleep. Just pay attention to lectures and you'll be solid for the exams. With a lot of background in math\/physics, I thought it wasn't too hard, but I know a lot of people struggled because of that. However, just stay on top of it and you'll be fine. Class composed of ~ weekly psets (which don't take more than 5 hours) and 3 exams (which is good because it helps you stay on top of the material, and it splits your grade up nicely, each 10%) and 1 final exam. RECOMMEND IT STRONGLY!",
    "Yes if you're EVST or G&G, otherwise, this is def not a gut.",
    "Very good course. Learn a lot about how the world works. You don't learn a ton about environmental change, but that's okay, because you leave with a great understanding of the planet. The lab is really annoying.",
    "Great class! It was really interesting stuff, and exciting because you really can see how it applies to everyday stuff like weather. I would totally recommend it, either for an EVST major or someone who needs a science credit. There are problem sets, but it's not that hard or that large of a work load.",
    "Lots of work,graded unfairly, awful class. Do not take it.",
    "I loved this class! Ron Smith is great and I learned a ton from his class about meteorology, the atmosphere, the ocean, and the environment. This is the intro class for Environmental Studies, which I am not majoring in but most of the people taking the class are. If you're good at physics this class will be quite easy for you; otherwise, don't assume it's a gut class. The problem sets (8 throughout the semester) always took me a while and the tests (3 midterms) could be challenging. Also the lab is required, which is a bummer (although it's pretty easy.) If you're interested in the weather and environment, take it!!",
    "Yes, great class! A solid foundation for anyone interested in learning how the earth works, broadly. This course is a survey of earth-system scale processes: the structure of the atmosphere & oceans, and how they move, mix, interact. You come away from the course with a broad understanding and a toolkit of introductory quantitative skills for describing & calculating everything from how pressure decreases in the atmosphere to how much ice will melt or freeze in a given time period to how much energy a wind turbine can generate. The class is excellently taught and well organized, with a pretty standard workload: weekly problem sets, a few midterm exams, a final exam. The pace is very manageable. At times, problem sets were assigned with only a few days to complete them, which is not ideal (typically professors allow a full week), and the midterm exams were often too long to complete thoroughly in a single class period. But overall a good class. Ronald Smith is a wonderful professor -- clear, helpful, and thorough -- and a good storyteller.",
    "The course overall was great. A good balance of the topics presented in an engaging and interesting manner. The only issue I had was organizing the huge number of different (sometimes related, sometimes not so related) topics and trying to clarify them all in my mind. The topics themselves were a combination of fascinating and practical, but they were all presented in a manner such that everything came together near the end.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about how weather and climate influence their lives and the places where they live.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the science behind climate change. It is a bit physics and math heavy, but nothing that isn't manageable. Really interesting material.",
    "I would recommend this course to people majoring in a related subject and not! You learn things about how the Earth works that are good to know anyways, and the material is all presented in a very accessible and organized way. Great course!",
    "EVST 201 is a general overview of the the atmosphere and oceans systems from a more physical perspective - it applies math and physics concepts using simple equations. Definitely a must take for someone looking to go into climate science.",
    "201 provides a basic introduction to climate science that doesn't require calculus",
    "Great intro to atmospheric science and a really interesting class - the material is extremely relevant and practical, and Professor Smith is great. Only drawback is that the midterms can be challenging and the lab is required to take the lecture.",
    "Basically a meteorology and earth science class, with a lot of math\/physics involved"
