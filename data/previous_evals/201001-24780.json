   "comments": [
    "Overall, this course was very, very good!! Prof. Freedman is a fantastic lecturer and really makes medieval history a relevant and fascinating area of study. The class did, however, sometimes get on people's nerves, mostly due to its lack of cohesive structure in some places, some excess of reading material that could have been better streamlined, and a lack of synergy among the TAs and the Professor who all seemed to exact different standards from their students -- thus making grading an often bizarre and unpredictable process.All in all, however, this class has the potential to be really wonderful because Prof. Freedman's lectures are really, really great. If the reading were better trimmed to highlight the key elements, and TAs better arranged administratively, the course could be awesome, but you should definitely take it anyway!!",
    "Take this class, history major or not.",
    "If you like history and are interested in the middle ages, take this class. Its fun and you'll learn a lot about Europe's roots.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale. You will gain a strong grasp of the period of history. You will be fascinated by the lectures and readings. The professor and TA are great. Everyone was teary-eyed when the class ended this semester. I am happy for everyone who gets to take this course. It was a tremendous experience.Tip: Adjust your course schedule to accommodate for the heavy reading load. It's manageable, but you should prepare for it by not taking too many other intensive classes.",
    "HIST211 is a solid survey course regarding medieval history. I'd highly recommend it for the professor and the material. Of course, because it's a survey course, not everything can be covered, and certainly not to the degree that you might want a topic to be explored. However, the two papers are not bad to do, including the research paper. Midterm and final are solid as well, though I'd recommend doing all the major reading for them. Overall, highly recommend it if you need your pre-industrial credit or just are looking for a not-too-difficult history credit.",
    "Take it if you are a history major. It's a great dinner conversation class.",
    "I'd recommend this course. Sometimes the reading is dry, but the class and time period are interesting.",
    "It was a fun and enjoyable course. However, unless you have a specific interest in the time period, I would perhaps suggest another class, because the materials learned in this class are not very transferable.",
    "yea- it's a nice and interesting course.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Fairly easy but very interesting.",
    "Great for both history and non-history majors; nothing is terribly in difficult; sometimes the reading is light-moderate and sometimes it can get heavy when you have to read a full text for a week. Midterm was not hard; final (non-cumulative) was a little harder.",
    "I went into the class without much thought; I needed a west and the wider world credit and the title of the course seemed interesting. Throughout this course I got to think about a period that I had never really thought about, the middle ages, and how it could be the beginning of modernity. Rather than the specific events of the historical period, what I got from this course was a concept of medieval scholarship and how history is done. Sometimes the readings get a bit too much (likewhen you have to read about some random count who was murdered in flanders) and you start asking yourself what is the point of learning this, and the work is kind of a pain because it requires more attention to detail than most classes, in the end the impression I got was that I learned a lot. I would take it cr\/d\/fail if I could choose again.",
    "This course is a fantastic lecture! The reading list is engaging and the historical questions are fascinating. Professor Freedman is brilliant, funny, patient, generous, endearing, just a little bit dorky, and presents the material with the right balance of whimsy and seriousness for maximal learning and student engagement. You won't be disappointed. The workload is typical of a history department lecture course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It has very cool and interesting subject matter, and Prof. Freedman is an entertaining lecturer.",
    "Great lectures - always entertaining and made what is someones a boring period fascinating.",
    "It was not as fun as previous evaluations made it out to be. The lectures were interesting, but the readings (for the most part) weren't. Discussion sections were unbelievably boring. Exams were okay, but the papers (especially the second one) was not well defined and ended up being a pain. Not one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. This was a great pre-industrial class. I highly enjoyed Professor Freedman's lectures; he's sharp and has a wonderful sense of humor. I had trouble justifying completing some of the readings (and hence didn't do those ones), but the ones I finished were interesting, and most readings tied in directly and strongly to the course. The workload is fairly standard for a history class. Nonmajors should also consider the course. It was a really good overview of Medieval Europe, and the class made the period vibrant and engaging.",
    "Great overview of the Middle Ages, Freedman is an entertaining lecturer, the two papers are short and fun to write.",
    "Fantastic course, great lecturer and really interesting topics. Not too difficult even though it deals with 500 years of history. i would definitely recommend others taking it.",
    "Survey of all the Medieval events that you've heard of but never known that much about: pope\/king conflicts, the Holy Roman Empire, the crusades, famine, black death, chivalry, the norman conquest, England v. France, commerce and Italian trading... loads of wonderful things.",
    "It's interesting. If you're a history major, you'll enjoy it. If you're not, you might want to shop it. It's nice, but it's not that worthwhile. If you're poli sci, it gives good context for state formation.",
    "A fantastic class on an interesting subject with very little work - one of the best History classes I've taken and what an ideal Yale lecture class should be like.",
    "yes i would recommend it",
    "I recommend it if you have any interest whatsoever in medieval history, be it chivalry, economics, warfare, art, literature, or whatever. The class is a great survey of that period, with enough specificity to entertain.",
    "The reading is a little bit tedious, but not too much, around 80 pages a week. The lecture is great. Just take it. This is the best class I've ever taken here.",
    "if you like middle ages, this class is great. courtly love, knights, medieval economy it's all here. i looooved it. prof freedman's lectures are interesting and very useful, and the readings are usually not too overwhelming.",
    "I would recommend it as a good overview class of Medieval History.",
    "The class is an interesting introduction to the Middle Ages; and yes I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the time period.",
    "A must-take, whether or not you have the slightest notion of medieval history. I braced myself for a dull, dry preindustrial course, but there was more wit and humor in this course, both in the lectures by the brilliant Paul Freedman, and in the centuries old reading, than I ever would have expected. The students that take this course (at least in my section) came in with little background knowledge but fully engaged with the material, making for the best section experience ever.",
    "I would recommend History 211 to everyone in Yale college. The topics covered in the course address the foundation of all things modern, including math, science, history, literature, and political science.",
    "a balanced survey of western europe between 1000 and 1500. lectures are the best part-- professor freedman is a real treasure-- so don't miss them!",
    "Take it.This was my first history class at Yale, and I absolutely loved it! Paul Freedman was amazing: he was engaging, knowledgeable, approachable, funny. I was really happy to have him as a professor.The material itself was enthralling. The Middle Ages was such an interesting time, and I leave the class with a very good grasp of what happened! I understand medieval in an academic and precise way, but I feel that I also understand it socially and culturally. Paul Freedman did a great job of interweaving his topics to make a detailed historical map of the time. I hope to remember all of this for decades and decades past college, and I am sure I will.It was sometimes difficult to follow the class from a time standpoint, because the lectures jumped around between centuries, and I found it difficult to piece everything back together chronologically. That said, I realize it is impossible to teach a history class chronologically because there are so many things happening!If, two years ago, you had told me I would consider history as a major, I would have laughed in your face. But then I took this class, and I seriously considered taking history as a major. That's saying something, folks."
