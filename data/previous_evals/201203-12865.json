    "Yes if you're interested in Islam. Otherwise you might find it a bit long and dull",
    "yeah i would recommend it. taking the course and doing an introductory survey of islam makes a lot of things you see in newspapers make sense. very interesting to go through historical study of islam. if you want a course on contemporary islam, take the other course offered by religious studies department.",
    "Most of this course is filled with incredibly interesting material. The last section of it is decidedly less interesting. Unfortunately, the whole course is presented in a relatively uninteresting manner. Also, while the readings for the course were very interesting, they often did not directly line up with the lectures, which left lingering unanswered questions about the lectures.",
    "Only take this course if you really need to learn about Islam. During Shopping Period, you will find that Prof. Bowering is very dull. This doesn't change. You will struggle to pay attention in class. What kept me going was our fantastic TA, Stewart Moore. If he is TAing again, you might want to take this course just to learn from him.If you do take this course, take it with a friend. Hopefully between you and your friend, you will get all the lecture material down into your notes. Prof. Bowering does not publish lecture notes or any guides, so it's up to your listening ability.On the plus side, the tests are not hard. There were no surprises."
