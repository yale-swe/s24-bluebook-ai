   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if it is required for your major.",
    "It's a pretty laid back class, and is quite fun if you are into math. Lectures are not as bad as it may sound - I actually quite enjoyed it. Professor and TAs are both extremely nice and willing to help.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Have to take it. Signals isn't the most interesting thing in the world is pretty difficult if you're not mathematically adept. Exams are open book, which is nice but are still tough regardless.",
    "You're probably taking this as a required course. It's not too bad. I wasn't that interested in course material but feel better that I know it since it's definitely practical information. The psets are manageable. Ask the TAs for help. Allen is amazing so go to his section. Zach is also great but does fewer examples. The exams are open note BUT the midterm is a time crunch even if you know the material. Final is chill tho",
    "Not bad at all, especially if you're interested in signal and image processing. However, if you have no interest in these topics, you may end up finding it a little dry. You'll learn how Fourier transforms actually work (yay) and ways to work with continuous and discrete signals (double yay). Exams are open-note and open-book, and you'll know exactly what to expect on them (yay again).",
    "The class is an introduction to biosignals (Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, sampling, a little image processing). There is no reason to take the class if you are not a BME major. If you are a BME major, the class isn't that bad, tests are fair (open note, open book) but some of the homework problems are hard (the problem sets are not long though). Go to the TA section since they will teach you the things necessary to do the homework.",
    "Biomedical engineering majors are required to take this court, but i would recommend the course to students who are interested in signal and image processing. It is a good gateway course to the world of bioimaging.",
    "Overall, a good introduction to signals and images. Mandatory for BME majors (few other majors opt to take the course). I did feel at times that the course reduced to identifying which formula \/ Fourier transform property to use, (since analytic evaluation is often virtually impossible). Section is useful for the problem sets, which in turn are very well-reflected in the exams. As such, most people do well on all three.",
    "BENG 352 is a required class for BMEs, so you probably don't have a choice on whether or not to take it. It can be boring at times, but isn't that hard and the latter part of the semester is more interesting. The midterm and final were both open note, so not terribly difficult.",
    "This is a required class for all BME majors, but even if it were optional I probably would have taken it. Learning the basics may seem a little dry at times, but you really do get a newfound appreciation for the theory behind signals\/images. Weekly psets and open note exams make this class very fair, but challenging enough to make the important concepts stick.",
    "A straightforward course. Professors and TAs give you the material to succeed",
    "This class is quite clear, and the professors are very helpful. The lecture notes are posted, and the midterms and finals are open note. The class goes out of its way to make sure that you learn the material, and it was relatively low-stress. I would recommend this class (though if you are looking at it, it's probably because you have to take it).",
    "BENG 352 is an allright class. Unless you're really into convolution, I wouldn't take in unless you have to. This class is basically all about convolution and fourier transforms, first in 1D then in 2D. Not that exciting to be honest. It's not that hard though, even though the material is super complicated. Everything is open book and the problem sets make sense as long as you go to section.",
    "This is a solid course for an introduction to imaging. It is an above average course and You can use Your notes, the homework, and the lecture notes for both the midterm and final. The homework follows the lectures, but I recommend doing it in a group, as this was really helpful for me.",
    "Pretty interesting course, even if it wasn't a BME requirement I'd consider taking it. It's a lot of math.",
    "BENG 352 is a difficult class, especially if you have never really thought about signals. That seems obvious, but I didn't even consider the relationship between biomedical data and input and output signals before this class. That being said, the class is very useful, especially if you are considering the imaging track or are an electrical engineer."
