   "comments": [
    "Enlightening, moving, scary, thought-provoking, interesting, engaging.Take it. If you are at all interesting in slavery, American History, the Civil War, or even modern issues with human trafficking and modern slavery, take this seminar.",
    "Yes, the class was excellent and fair.",
    "This is a great freshman seminar that is well worth taking. Professor Rugemer is a committed, intelligent and well informed teacher. The books are interesting, content fascinating and the course is well balanced. It features fun shorter assignments and a longer paper, but is taught at a very manageable level for freshman.",
    "Take this seminar! There's a lot of reading, but the vast majority is very interesting and the class discussions are really fun. Professor Rugemer is really nice and incredibly knowledgable. He is truly enthusiastic about his students and the history.",
    "This was a great class for those interested in American slavery throughout U.S. history. I adamantly believe everyone should have a good knowledge about such an important topic, and this class with Professor Rugemer does a thorough job at just that. The carefully chosen reading list gives you a deep view into many apsects of the origins of slavery and U.S. slavery throughout time. It is a pretty easy writing credit (3 short papers and a moderately challenging 10 page research paper with primary sources), and he is a very fair grader. I would highly recommend this class for those who want to be knowledgable about this subject. I loved it.",
    "Great introduction to a history class. Friendly atmosphere and academically stimulating.",
    "It is a summary of Slavery in regards to the Americas. It also discusses the aftermath of American slavery and slavery today.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a lot of work, but I feel like everyone needs to take a freshman seminar at some point, and I really liked this one. You will learn so much about things that are important in our country's past and current history.",
    "A great freshman seminar class to take in order to learn more about a subject that has shaped American history far more than most people realize. I thought I knew a decent amount about slavery's history before taking this class, only to discover just how in depth you can go on the topic. A lot of reading but no tests and only a couple papers, so the workload isn't particularly bad. As a result I would definitely recommend it, as it's a fascinating class on a great topic, and the discussions in class make it well worth the time to read the interesting books assigned.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Three very short papers (about 500 words each), and one final paper, so the class isn't that much work. Lots of reading assigned, but the only way he checks if you did the reading is based on the in-class discussion, in which you decide when to participate. Great, great course. Highly recommend it - the professor is extremely personable and always willing to go out of his way to help you, and the visits you get from visiting professors are invaluable. Please take this course - it'll broaden your horizons, and he grades pretty easily. Amazing course.",
    "A great introduction to slavery's history and to all of the amazing resources that Yale has to offer. I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone. There were only 13 of us but it was one of my favorite classes all year. Prof Rugemer is excited and passionate and so informed. I learned so much about slavery. The class is what you make of it. You don't have to do all of the readings and will still be fine, but do them if you can because they're very informative."
