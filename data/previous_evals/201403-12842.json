   "comments": [
    "Depending on your French level, this class could be easy or hard. For me, it was very challenging. It was a HUGE leap from French 120, and I wasn't expecting that. There is an incredible amount of work involved which is very tough and time consuming. It was rewarding when I received the outcomes I thought my effort deserved, but very frustrating when that did not happen. Overall, it was a struggle, but that depends on the type of student you are and the level of french that you have.",
    "An initially challenging introduction into French literature alongside a fairly straightforward review of grammar concepts learned in L1 and L2.",
    "This course is a study of grammar and vocabulary through film and literature.",
    "This course is demanding as befits an L3 language. I would recommend it to finish your language requirement and hone your French skills.",
    "Madame Burton's section was an incredibly enjoyable experience. It was nice having a class meet every day, and it was especially nice that we got to engage with complex works of literature and film while learning basic grammar and comprehension skills. Class was in constant motion forward, although it never moved too fast. Madame Burton did a lot to make class interactive and different each day, which was really important to making class interesting and something to look forward to. This was, in general, just a really solid, enjoyable class.",
    "It's a lot of work, but your French improves a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, particularly if you can take it with Mme. Burton. Professor Burton is a wonderful professor, very knowledgeable, organized, and thoughtful. You will learn so much from her in one semester and you will see your hard work pay off."
