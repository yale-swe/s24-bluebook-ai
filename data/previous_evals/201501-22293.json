    "Absolutely take this course. If you have any interest at all in the Middle East, Judaism, Islam, history, historical scholarship, analyzing primary sources, or meeting one of the nation's great scholars, Jews in Muslim Lands is a no brainer. I am a highly-secular Jew (i.e. utterly unreligious and wholly ignorant of any matters theological or scriptural) interested in the modern Middle East and history, drawn to discussions of Israel and Palestine but knowing, at the course's onset, next to nothing about the history of the region. I assumed I'd be at an automatic disadvantage, given the incredibly complicated and extensive history of these matters. I was wrong. You need no background whatsoever for the course. Prof. Marcus, an absolute genius, impressive scholar of tremendous erudition and humor, and general all-around boss, makes the course incredibly accessible. In fact, the course's emphasis on primary sources - which is as fun as it is fulfilling - almost encourages neophytes to the topic. Really, you can't go wrong taking this. It's taught as a lecture, though with Marcus's lecturing - one of the best lecturers I've ever had the privilege of seeing - there might as well be no one else in the room. It's just that captivating. Definitely take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you have a particular interest in Jewish History.",
    "I would recommend this course. If you come to class and pay attention, you will learn a lot.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Be prepared to work, though.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the Middle East, Jewish history and how Islam and Judaism influenced each other.",
    "This class is a study on the history of the Jewish people who lived in the Middle East from the 7th to 16th centuries and how they responded to those in rule (most of the time Muslims). It focuses on historical accounts, primary sources, and religious beliefs."
