    "This class is not for everyone. If you don't enjoy small intimate discussions about biology, or if you are not interested in scientific research, you should not sign up.If you think that biological research is in your future, you should absolutely take this course. It will be one of the best preparations for grad school that you could possibly have.I personally loved this course, and I would call it one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. Having a project of your own to work on in tandem with the class gives a whole new level of motivation. Use it to pick up or perfect skills, like scientificwriting, or programming in R. The professors are very helpful, both in class discussions and outside with project revisions.Professor Stearns especially is wonderful. His straightforward personality and style of teaching are very refreshing and he will say exactly what is on his mind without sugarcoating.",
    "You really need to take this course. If you want to go into academia especially, it was especially helpful in understanding how the field works and how to get from A to B. You are surrounded by some of the most brilliant students and you get to basically run class however you want, all with the guided insight and expertise of some of the biggest professors around. Compared to the spring semester, this semester is more work because you have to write up your summer research.",
    "This was a fantastic learning opportunity - by far my best course at Yale. Students have the opportunity to engage in conversations with leading scientists, participate in summer research, and become part of a close community of scholars from different disciplines, all of whom are equally committed to learning this material.Classes involve reading and discussing primary literature; homework involves planning summer research and doing write-up of results in fall.This is an incredible experience and I would absolutely recommended taking this course if you are interested in the material."
