   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I took HSAR 110 with the intention of getting a HU credit out of the way, and I ended up falling in love. This course teaches you some essential knowledge to which most people are oblivious. For example, what's the difference between porcelain and other ceramic wares? Why are some billionaires paying a million dollars for this chair? What should I buy when I have a million dollars to spend on a chair? You know, the usual problems that Yalies will one day face. In all seriousness, this course is the epitome of \"exploration\" in your college curriculum. The workload is low if you read selectively (but high if you want to read it all, and you will be rewarded). In terms of the teaching, Professor Cooke is a gem. He is passionate about a subject that is novel to many of his students, and he relates decorative arts to newcomers in a easily understood manner. He comes prepared to every lecture, and he always has insightful interpretations of the material for each lecture. He assembles readings that are valuable and engaging. I recommend HSAR 110 wholeheartedly.",
    "Yes, good intro. Take it Cr\/D to take the pressure off from the many small but irritating assignments.",
    "HSAR 110 looks at the history of objects and material culture--from weaving to pottery to plastic. The lectures are always interested and well-organized, Professor Cooke is a gem, and you get to have section each week in the art gallery! The assignments can be tricky (4 museum labels, 1 catalogue entry, midterm, and final), there is a lot of rote memorization involved in the midterm and final, but it is well worth it and you'll learn a lot!",
    "Solid class, I think it's more interesting than the traditional art history course because it involves materials and objects we use on a daily basis.",
    "A good history of art class if you would like to learn about trade movements and materials but lacking in cultural information.",
    "This course is unique among other art history courses in its study of objects rather than painting. It emphasizes a non-Western centric perspective and offered a thorough analysis of the way objects work in our lives. The workload was very manageable. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "Take it with a friend. First half is more interesting than the second hal",
    "Great class - some of the memorization felt a little needless (names etc) but you'll learn so much and more importantly learn the tools to analyze and understand new dec arts you encounter.",
    "Take! Even though this is an entry-level survey course, it introduces students to an art historical perspective that is frequently overlooked, yet one that should be studied seriously.",
    "This is a fantastic class to give you a new perspective on the things we use in our daily lives and take for granted. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. If you need a 5th class or a credit\/D take it! Prof. Cooke is great, and you really do learn a lot about the subject. Plus you get to have section in the art gallery every week which is fantastic!",
    "This was my first bona fide art history lecture at Yale, so I was taken aback by the amount of memorization necessary to do well on the tests. From others' comments, though it seems less intense on that front than some of the other HSAR intros. A really great approach to art history, through the lens of these understudied media (relative to painting, sculpture, etc.) The highlight is definitely getting to handle objects in YUAG and the furniture study for section. This class didn't necessarily change my outlook on the world or on objects, but I think that's a function both of my preexisting faith in material culture and on the effort I put in, so that's not to say those claims you might see in other evaluations are off-base.",
    "I 100% recommend this class. Decorative objects is an amazing introduction to art history for anyone without an art history background. There's a lot of Econ, psych, and other non-humanities majors in this class and Professor Cooke teaches with an awareness of his audience. Some of his lectures, especially in the second half of the course, use more flowery\/vague academic language than I would have liked but they're still accessible and interesting. As I was reading through my lecture notes before the final they read more like a novel than academic notes because Professor Cooke is a really wonderful storyteller who kept me hooked throughout every lecture. The workload is extremely manageable with three 500 word museum labels, a 750 word catalogue entry, a midterm, and a final. Before the exams Professor Cooke gives slide decks for all the object identification questions which helps a lot. The objects are fascinating. And in section you get to go down to the basement of the art gallery and TOUCH THEM. I got to hold an ancient Chinese bronze (with gloves) and it was so beautiful... We studied and touched objects from all over the world but Cooke is especially interested in East Asian (China and Japan. No Korea, unfortunately), American, and Indian art so if you're especially into any of those you will have an incredible experience.",
    "A really great course that you should take. Nothing too serious work-wise, though the exams take a bit of preparation. But seriously, take it; it's amazing just how much significance stuff can get with the lens of this course.",
    "The class is a good balance between looking at the production of objects and the use of the objects in different social settings. The second half of the class is particularly fascinating (although the first half is definitely critical). Sections in the object study classroom are fun and also help cement the topics discussed in class. As stated in the first lecture of the course, this class is intended to challenge the established definition of what constitutes \"art\" by exploring quotidian objects. At the same time the class still very much ascribes to a regional hierarchy, heavily privileging Europe, Asia and the United States. Japan, China, India, England and the United States dominate the thematic examples. Latin America is addressed only in the context of the Galleon trade, and even then only as a layover for objects as they travel between Asian and Europe. Africa is addressed more in terms of production than in theory. It is understandable that certain regions are highlighted because they provide a recurring framework for the courses themes and because they are the focus of Professor Cookes work. At the same time, diversifying the syllabus would be a worthwhile consideration. That being said, the class is very well done and Prof. Cookes lectures are tremendously engaging",
    "Great class. You should take it if you're at all interested in ceramics and\/or furniture.",
    "Decorative Arts is a really great experience, and one that anybody interested in the subject should take! It's not overly difficult, but I found that I wished I had more time to dedicate to it. You can absorb a ton of new and interesting information just by going to lecture and section (in which you get to see and touch the objects, sometimes dating from 400+ BC!), but I think doing the readings would be an extra layer. The class is about looking at material culture and everyday objects in a more informed way, and it's definitely given me a new perspective on our society. I don't think there's any other class at Yale like this one, and Professor Cook and the TAs he chooses are terrific!",
    "The lectures got rather boring after a while, but you could either go and not do the readings or do the readings and not go to lecture. It didn't seem necessary to do both. There were a handful of short writing assignments (making your own wall label) and a longer \"catalogue entry\" assignment at the end. The midterm and final were standard and fair. The section definitely made this class. We got to handle objects, some of them thousands of years old. It was a really cool and effective learning experience. Overall, it was about what I expected and I think it was worth it."
