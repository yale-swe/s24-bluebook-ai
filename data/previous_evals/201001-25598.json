    "This course was a 10 day silviculture and forest management workshop in the Bavarian Region of Germany. Most of the above questions are not applicable. It was a great time. We learned a lot about Bavarian silvicultre and the trip was well run.",

   "comments": [
    "I know most of the students taking the class are not planning to become field foresters, but more emphasis on the quantitative side of silviculture would have been useful. Memorizing tables would not have been helpful, but exercises using tables provided in texts or from case studies would have left me with more confidence in analyzing a silvicultural scenario, and would have made it easier to write a more substantive term paper.",
    "Students ought to meet before the trip to go over German nuances as it pertains to foreigners. For example, how does one order a beer and what does each beer name mean. Like for the Southern field trip, students should give a presentation on the different aspects of culture, history, and forestry so they will have a greater appreciation for the country and the forestry once they are there."
