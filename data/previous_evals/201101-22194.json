   "comments": [
    "Great history class. Take it.",
    "Take it you will learn alot",
    "Yes if you are interested in architecture. Take is Cr\/D because all the arch majors will be taking this course. This half is better than last semester because it's really about \"architectural design\"",
    "Required for the arch major. A poor shell of what Scully used to teach. The art and architecture departments need to work more closely in the future to develop classes.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in learning about modern architecture. Lectures aren't incredibly dynamic but the material is interesting. And it's the only course Yale offers in the area (though, to be fair, shame on Yale for that).",
    "Good material- had to take it",
    "Lecture tended to be a bit dry, reading is a must if you want to learn about the architects.",
    "Introduction to the study of architectural theories\/canons, and what it means to be modern",
    "Too new, needs 3 more years before it's a good class.",
    "You probably have to take it. It's definitely very interesting, and you learn a lot. It gets to be boring at times, but it's not that hard.",
    "This class is very interesting, although lecture can sometimes be dry. Very glad I took it, learned a lot.",
    "I believe this class is essential for any architecture major. I learned so much about architects and buildings I always here about but don't actually know anything about. The first couple of lectures seemed unconnected and seemed to have no overall theme making it hard to understand and learn the material. The last couple of lectures on the other hand were great. Once we got into the modern era, the class became so much better. It is a lot of work, but the TAs have been in constant communication with the professor to make it a more reasonable work load. The group and guest lecturers were great. Eeva's Aalto lecture was also great. I think next year the class will be much better. The TAs were also great.",
    "I would recommend this course to architecture majors and non-architecture majors alike. Though an interest in architecture is necessary -- the class is spent looking at buildings and architects and movements in architecture. I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
    "It\u0092s a wonderful class. I\u0092m not an architecture major and still loved every lecture! The workload is totally manageable and the tests are very, very fair.",
    "The class does not provide the most interesting lectures, but it provides a good basic understanding of the History of Architecture. I feel like I am much more knowledgeable about history and the field in general after having taken the course. A good survey if you are interested in architecture, whether or not a major, but not if you are not sure how interested you may be.",
    "A survey of architecture from 1750 to the present. If the syllabus isn't altered, expect much more work than you would from comparable survey courses. On top of reading for and participating in section, there were four 3-5 page reading responses, a 12-15 page research-based term paper, a midterm and a non-cumulative final. (Both exams only lasted fifty minutes were primarily based on proper identification. This meant that you actually have to study a lot to memorize exact dates, places and names.) Some of the weekly readings were way too long, so just skim when necessary. Readings, especially from the textbooks, are helpful; they provide more context, so try at least to do those for your own sake. Other than that, it's a good class that covers an important subject. It's crazy that it's taken Yale so long to offer a permanent class on the history of architecture. If you're genuinely passionate about architectural history, you'll enjoy the class. If not, you might find the lectures a little boring or dry. And if you plan on being an architecture major, you'll have to take it either way.",
    "The syllabus had me drooling. Pelkonen did it justice once she got the hang of lecturing (this semester was her first time). Highly recommended.",
    "Yes do do do. Eeva Liisa is a wonderful professor, even if at first she may seem shy or reserved. The lectures improve as the material becomes richer, and the 19th and early 20th century lectures are really quite well done. The guest lectures were not very good, but the class was wonderful overall. It focuses less on Modernism than some people liked, but it gives such wonderful roots it makes the rest of your classes at Yale in modern architecture much more grounded. You have to spend more time on earlier works because we know them less than LeCorbusier, Wright or Gehry. Take it take it take it it will change your life. Maybe not, it's not a total OMG YALE IS AWESOME course, but it is really well done. The focus on Scandinavia was especially great, and there were some odd choices in works to cover that I think turned out really well. Take it!",
