    "long hw, but excellent content, relevant material to experimentalists",
    "Heavy on work compared to similar classes, but useful if you are interested in AMO or related fields.",
    "Great course for applying modern quantum physics. Lays down the foundation for understanding most techniques of AMO.",
    "Atomic Physics is a great class. It is really interesting and you will learn tons about the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics. Even if this is not exactly the field your research is in, this class is generally very helpful in understanding how quantum mechanics is used to perform experiments. Be warned though that this class is a lot of work.",
    "I would urge every student to take 522 even if their sub-field is not AMO. Prof. DeMille is an expert in his field and knows how to present the important parts. Given the importance of quantum information techniques and atomic physics techniques, this class provides crucial background information for all physicists.",
    "Yes; I found the method we learned very useful in understanding papers in my field."

    "Portions of the course were extremely helpful for my understanding of background as well asmy own research, while other parts do not seem like they will help at all. If the course has not gotten so specific at times, that could have been prevented.",
    "This course helped me understand the practical aspects of quantum mechanics.",
    "After taking this course, I feel more confident about reading articles on my research experiment and following conversations have become much easier.",
    "It was really helpful and deepened my understanding of the methods used in physics."
