    "Yes, it is an interesting class. Normal amount of work but never felt overly taxing since the heaviest reading assignments were interesting, good reads.",
    "definitely interesting material, and an interesting professor, but unless you're a \"go with the flow\" kind of student, the unstructured quality of the class might be a bit stressful",
    "Definitely not. This was an awful, disorganized course. Assignments and weekly readings are given out by whim without significant thought. So forget having a syllabus or knowing what your week-to-week assignments will be. Seminar \u0093discussion\u0094 is actually just two hours worth of rambling by Professor Weiss. The only perk is a light workload and easy grading. If you do decide to take this class as a gut (which I would NOT recommend), make sure to show up to class even though it feels pointless because Weiss will notice if you are absent.Class summary: random readings which you don\u0092t need to do until Weiss assigns a 4-6 page \u0093reading response\u0094 (he assigned us 2 of these), a 30 minute presentation and a 12-80 page paper (yes, he actually said the responsible maximum for the final paper was 40 pages, single spaced with size 10.5 font)"
