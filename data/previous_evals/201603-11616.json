    "I learnt the basics of conversational Russian. I can now haltingly discuss in multiple tenses and cases, and know vocabulary pertaining to various everyday situations such as clothing and food.",
    "I was able to develop the foundation of the Russian language I feel will help me greatly moving forward with L2. I learned how to construct sentences in Russian, have a conversation, and translate from English to Russian and vice versa. I also learned quite a bit about Russian culture, which was very interesting."

    "Great course! Ekaterina was very invested in making sure we succeeded in learning the language. I loved that the class was very small. I think 6 people is the perfect size for an L1 language course. I would have appreciated more worksheets in class with answers online.",
    "Strengths: the force with which we were drilled in Russian made it an effective course for learning the basics of the language. Even if I had chosen not to engage every day, simply being in class was a decent immersion in the language. Weaknesses: There is a lot of material, and some of it was presented as opposed to taught, making it difficult to follow, and if you missed something important early on it was incredibly difficult to recover. There was also not as much chance to correct pronunciations and other things as I would have liked, given my written Russian is much stronger than my verbal Russian.",
    "Lots of small group interaction, very intimate setting."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved Russian. I was fortunate that I switched to this section, as it had less students than either of the other two.",
    "It is a great course. The professors really want you to succeed and it is such a nice break from other classes because it uses such a different part of your brain.",
    "To me, learning Russian is not just of fancy but great personal significance, so I believe the course was worth it. It is worth noting, however, that it is far from an easy class. If you're looking for a L1 class to take and be done, go for Spanish or something not Russian. You're going to have to be willing to invest a crazy amount of time outside of class (I spent more time on this than all my other classes combined), and, depending on your grasp of the language, you may feel totally idiotic. I also sometimes felt that when I did not understand things, the professor, instead of explaining, just assumed that I was a) an idiot, or b) not doing my work, both of which are not true. The \"it's obvious to me why isn't it obvious to you\" attitude was a lot to deal with at times, but I do feel like I've come out of it having learnt something, even though it was not the most enjoyable experience going through it.",
    "A great intro class with a typical amount of work for a language. Russian is great and the community you form even better.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Russian can seem like an intimidating language but the way it is broken down in this course makes it a lot more accessible and exciting."
