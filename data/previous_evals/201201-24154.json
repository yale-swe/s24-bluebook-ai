    "Excellent survey of German Expressionism with a focus on literature. This is a great introduction to German Expressionism and covers a lot of material.",
    "Of all of the classes at Yale I've taken, this class probably has the best balance of amazing, challenging material and a totally do-able workload. I loved this class as a German major (but the only one in the class) - the content is wonderful and surprising and interesting, and really influences your perception of other art of the time\/that came after it. There are also few classes at Yale that are so interdisciplinary (literature\/visual art\/theater\/music\/film\/philosophy\/media theory) - so refreshing! Needless to say, Jan van Treeck is an awesome instructor. Would heartily recommend it to anyone, especially anyone studying any part of the humanities.",
    "If it's still being offered, take this class!!! Jan is an absolutely wonderful teacher, passionate about the subject (especially literature) and he connects really well with the students. It doesn't hurt that he's super hip. The subject itself is fun--prepare yourself for creepy, sexy, and just plain weird readings (they were very short and available on classesv2 to boot). There are also some great films in here, such as Nosferatu and Metropolis, as well as painting and background history. Grading was half participation, half papers (3 short ones and a final). Overall, excellent.",
    "Yes! Even if you don't think the subject interests you or you think the field of study is too narrow--jan connects everything to over a century of european history and thought, which should fascinate anyone."
