    "The power of linear regressions in predicting and establishing causal relationships in economics; programming in R; the marriage of statistics and economics.",
    "The class provides a decent introduction to probability and statistics as well as an introductory foundation for programming in R and doing economic research. You have to learn a lot of the R on your own (or with Tutors) and if that is your goal, you would be better off taking S&DS 230. That being said, there are some cool economic applications of regressions and stuff that this class explores.",

    "Learned how to use R, relearned a bunch of stat\/AQA stuff, and then learned some interesting regression models at the end",
    "Very basic knowledge of programming in R. Knowledge of basic statistical concepts.",
    "I learned statistics in more detail and I learned to analyze data, especially using R coding, which was extremely helpful.",
    "how to set up economics research and analyze data",
    "Econ papers finally make sense after this class! Goes over probabilities (quant problems with coin flips), statistics (central limit theorem ftw) and lots of linear regression.",
    "The course was a good introduction to Econometrics.",
    "I learned a lot about statistics and how one can use R to evaluate data.",
    "We learned skills of data analysis needed to understand and answer important economic (or statistical) questions. A big part of that was gaining skills of probability, statistical frameworks, and tools of regression models. We also, gained a pretty broad understanding of R.",
    "I gained many statistical analysis skills.",
    "I learned how to analyze data using probability rules, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and linear regressions.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of statistic thinking, a good amount of skills with R, and some economic intuition. It is mostly a stats class in a fairly standard sense. All of the test cases are related to economics, which is what makes it econometrics as opposed to just stats, but I would say you will get the skills of a standard intro stats class (which isn't a bad thing, I learned a lot).",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Teaches really important skills for the economics field for anyone interested in doing research, but it covers things really fast and there's not much practice\/engagement with the materials of the course before exams. Quizzes are open book and not that difficult, but the midterm was a lot harder and there wasn't that much practice material given beforehand to prepare.",
    "lectures were incredible. psets actually helped me understand the content.",
    "Strengths: quizzes suck to take but it was structured to kind of keep yourself accountable Weaknesses: the slides are really convoluted sometimes and seem really theoretical, hard to see the big picture, not a lot of material reinforcement happening",
    "The class needs more practice questions for the material in lecture slides. I also feel that the lecture slides need a text companion. It would really help to keep up with the material.",
    "I found the lectures to be very slow, but I understand that it is meant to cater to people with a variety of statistics backgrounds.",
    "I thought the emphasis on probability was really awesome and I feel like I learned so much in that part. I thought the statistics and econometrics parts could have been slowed down a bit. I thought I learned a lot in those parts, I just think I could have absorbed it better if it was a little slower. I LOVED the R part of class and psets. I have even used R for fun after learning about it in 131. Loved that part.",
    "This course is a great intro into the world of data analysis. Because the course tries to teach two things at once, however, oftentimes I found myself lost with the statistical portion of the course. I wish someone held my hand more with that section - oftentimes section focused exclusively on R.",
    "The concepts were presented methodically and in a clear manner. The organization was very good. More outside resources for programming would be nice.",
    "Strength: breadth of the material. Weaknesses. You do not spend much time on the statistics and probability and the economic applications are not particularly easy to grasp.",
    "This course focused way too much on complicated theory that we didn't have to know, which ultimately took away from our ability to actually learn the important\/necessary concepts in class. Material was presented in a much too theoretical way - statistics needs examples, which we would not get until the end of each lecture. Also, this course could use a textbook, the lecture slides are not comprehensive enough as a substitute.",
    "This class was above and beyond what I expected. Hated the idea of statistics, and I didn't really enjoy programming. Taking this class, learning econometrics, and working with R I had the best time.",
    "The TAs are very helpful and the exams are fair and similar to the questions in the problem sets and the online quizzes. However, lectures can be very confusing, do not make clear what you need to know, and make topics less intuitive than they really are.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive overview of many important statistical concepts often seen in research papers across all fields. The Psets make you analyze data from actual econ studies. I really liked this as other econ prereqs at Yale were more theoretical, while in this class we can actually apply what we learned to analyze real world data. Weaknesses: some concepts could be better explained. They're not hard to grasp, but it just needs to be explained more clearly.",
    "It's very organized. I really enjoyed the course and highly recommend it.",
    "TA's were really good and available",
    "Strengths: problem sets helped you understand what you need to understand from the material Weaknesses: the lecture slides are hard to follow\/understand so not many people went to class",
    "Strengths: course material relevant to the real world. Applicability! Interesting problem sets that use real data to make calculations about interesting topics (socioeconomic makeup of university students, inequality of access to higher education, voting statistics, etc.) Weaknesses: tests never checked our understanding of R. While this means the tests were easier, it feels weird to have such a distinction in the material covered on the exams and the material covered in psets (which were usually about 2\/3 R, 1\/3 hand-calculations). I also think more time should have been spent teaching student how to use R; many psets relied heavily on students using functions we've never heard of to answer questions we don't understand.",
    "This course spent a lot of time mentioning the statistical theory, but not actually teaching it. I believe another (lower) level stats course should be required as a pre-requisite, as the class doesn't have enough time to elaborate on all the math.",
    "Less math\/theory, more stat please",
    "Lectures were really boring and difficult to engage with. Sections were even worse. In theory, the things we were looking at should have been really interesting, but they were certainly not.",
    "Its main strength was in how accessible it was for students like me who had no prior coding experience but were excited to use R for data analysis. It was also very clear in its descriptions of statistical concepts. Its only real weaknesses were in two areas. First, I would have liked if there was a much stronger focus on economics concepts. Aside from the specific research papers we used for raw data, this course could have simply been called Intro to Statistics rather than Econometrics. Secondly, it could have been more interesting with a stronger focus on using R.",
    "I found the course to be really difficult. While Professor Humphries cared a lot and tried his best, I think, it was really hard to understand concepts in class, and attending lecture didn't help me much more at all than just reading the slides. I think it's kind of an unnecessary course for the major, and I especially thought the fact that we had to do coding ridiculous.",
    "Lectures can get a bit hard to follow but the class forces you to keep up with quizzes and comprehensive psets.",
    "The lectures were a little boring but the content was good.",
    "It was very good, but sections were kind of odd.",
    "This class was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. Professor does not know how to teach, he just reads off unnecessarily complicated slides. The material was presented in a way that complicated rather simple concepts. If you have a background in Statistics you automatically have a huge advantage in the class because that was basically the only thing the first midterm tested. This class does not facilitate learning at all. Horrible experience.",
    "The course could be improved with a more put-together professor.",
    "One strength of this course is that in addition to learning about probability rules, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and linear regressions, we also learned how to code in R (a programming language for statistical computing). Most of the pset problems were about the topics we learned in lecture, but we had to use R to solve them. Computer science is such an important skill to know in the 21st century, and is used in almost every career field. We did not have to memorize how to write code for the exams, but we did use R for the homework. I also liked how at the weekly sections with the TAs, the TAs would go over useful R functions for the week so that we were very prepared to do the pset problems. For example, at a section, we might go over how to construct a confidence interval using R. For our pset, we would then construct a confidence interval by ourselves.",
    "Very bad teaching. Not really coherent",
    "The material was inherently pretty boring so if it could have strong economic ties, maybe more students would've come to class",
    "The class material was often very complicated. When looking over some of the material in the slides, it was often very difficult to understand. However, it was rarely tested in its purest form. I would recommend emphasizing the basic concepts more, doing more sample problems in class, making sure there were more test style questions on PSets, etc. and only then focus on the more difficult material. I think that would have given me a better foundational knowledge of stats. For strengths, I think the class material was always very interesting. Prof. Humphries is a really nice guy and always willing to help. I thought the PSets were actually fairly useful. If you actually give the class your focus, you will learn a lot about R that can be very useful in internships, etc.",
    "Its a really packed course, if I would say to reduce the number of topics and lessen its breadth.",
    "Well, it taught me econometrics. I felt like the examples used in class were valuable and useful in explaining the topics.",
    "The strength of this class is that it used data from papers that are currently very relevant in academic today, and it kind of took us into the minds of the researchers by teaching us how to come to the same conclusions that the researchers did using their data.",
    "This course covers a huge amount of material in a short time. As a result, the professor skips from slide to slide extremely quickly in lecture, going through about 45-60 slides a lesson, which makes it difficult to follow. Furthermore, since many of the PSETs are focused on developing R-skills, which are not tested in exams, there is little practice of the actual math material which is tested during exams.",
    "Strength was the level of engagement Mr Humphries had with the class. He would answer questions diligently and work hard to make sure we understood the material.",
    "The lecture was a sort of information overload and was often very confusing. Professor Humphries was very prepared and caring but it was often hard to know what material was essential.",
    "The course does poorly to teach students. The topics seem rushed."

    "It's required if you're an econ major, so...",
    "yes. fun math.",
    "If you have to take it, then take it. Otherwise there are similar stats classes at Yale that you can take instead that are clearer (even though they don't teach R- like STAT 103 with JDRS)",
    "You have to take it and Humphries is a good teacher. Highly recommend doing the independent project with him -- he's very responsive and it turns into an interesting experience.",
    "It's required. If you're econ, this is much easier than 135.",
    "It is a requirement, and I don't think it is going to be offered again.",
    "I think Professor Humphries was a really good metrics teacher. He clearly cared quite a lot and put a significant amount of effort into the course, which made it worthwhile for me",
    "Having never taken a stats or programming course before I learned some serious tools that will serve me well as an Econ major. R is a great statistical programming language, and I'm glad a now have a good foundation in it. Having some introduction to stats is incredibly helpful in this class, but totally not required. This course is a great intro into the world of data analysis. Because the course tries to teach two things at once, however, oftentimes I found myself lost with the statistical portion of the course. I wish someone held my hand more with that section - oftentimes section focused exclusively on R. As a class it is very fair: the psets are reasonable, the quizes are good, and the tests aren't bad.",
    "Everybody should know econometrics. This is a data-filled world, you cannot escape it.",
    "If you must, but I think that you would learn more from doing a S&DS sequence. S&DS focus more on the coding as a skill and the stats as foundational knowledge. Econometrics doesn't really perfect either. However, Prof. Humphries is a good teacher and you cover a huge range of topics in just one semester.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for the Econ major.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that was interested or wanted to learn about R or statistics.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for the major and if that's the case, you should take it with John Eric if possible.",
    "It's required for the major. If you're not an econ major, you can also take this to learn stats + R. I heard it covers more material than the similar-ish class in the stats department. There are 7 psets, each takes at least 2-3 hours, with the longest taking 6-8 hours maybe. Lowest pset grade is dropped. There are also quizzes, but you have a 24 hour time allowance + open note, so it's pretty chill. Tests are fair, and you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet. Make sure you have a solid grasp of the concepts, as that's what shows up on tests\/quizzes, while Psets are mainly coding based. The coding really isn't hard, and he goes over what you need to know in class\/it's all on lecture slides, so you can figure it out pretty easily.",
    "Yes.",
    "Honestly if you have to take it, just take it",
    "Only if you have to for economics major",
    "I would recommend this to another student, sort of. If you're an Econ student, you don't really have a choice. Don't worry, it's an interesting class that I found \"fun\" to take. If you're not an Econ student, I'd recommend another statistics class. It's not that this is a bad class (I really liked it). However, I think you could get a better statistics background by taking another statistics course.",
    "Yes -- You have to take it as an Econ major. Take it with Humphries, he was a good teacher and provided a lot of resources.",
    "You should take this",
    "Nooooot really. There are better classes to learn statistics. Don't take unless you have to.",
    "Yes, it is interesting and it satisfies a requirement for the Economics major. I felt that I gained real skills applicable to a job environment in this class.",
    "I don't recommend unless you're an Econ major.",
    "Definitely take this one if you're an econ major (as opposed to 135). Learning R will probably be one of the most useful skills you'll learn at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you have to for the Economics major.",
    "Yes, it was definitely useful, even if it was a slog at times.",
    "No I would not. Only take it if its a requirement for your major.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student studying economics (you don't have a choice).",
    "I would recommend this to a student in the economics major.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in statistics or you need the class for the econ major. Most of the topics that we covered were also covered in my AP Statistics class in high school. It's basically a statistics class that uses economics-related data. The topics that I had never seen before were linear regressions, Two-Stage least squares (2SLS) regression analysis, and Difference in Difference. I didn't find the class to be very interesting only because I am not that interested in statistics. If you are interested in statistics, then this is a good class. You also learn how to code in R, which is a very useful skill. There is not a lot of econ content.",
    "Not unless you need it for your major.",
    "You kind of have to take this if you're an econ major",
    "You probably have to take this class, so I think the decision is usually whether to take it a certain semester with a certain professor. I Humphries' econometrics was a good experience and I enjoyed the content I learned. I think you have to take advantage of the course. Yes, lectures are pretty math heavy (the content is useful but maybe not everyone's favorite thing). If you go to office hours, look over the slides thoroughly, write the paper, etc. then I think you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "Yes because it teaches valuable skills.",
    "Yes, I thought overall that I learned a lot in this course and it was not that difficult To stay on top of the material throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, but only because it is required for the major.",
    "Look, econometrics is not exactly a fun class, but Humphries makes it about as good as it can be. He really cares about you actually learning the material and will help you out in any way he can. Take it if you have to and take it with Humphries.",
    "Absolutely- this class will give you skills that are directly transferable to today's job market.",
    "I would not recommend it, since this course attempts to cover so much material in so little time that taking a more focused course would probably be more useful and rewarding.",
    "Only if required",
    "Not unless you need it for the econ requirement.",
    "Probably the best version of this course so far, thankfully now in R instead of Stata. Humphries seems genuinely interested in teaching the material, which he structures nicely with his lectures and notes. Straightforward, even mild, problem sets centered around very recent papers, which makes homework all the more engaging and relevant. Take it with Humphries if you can."
