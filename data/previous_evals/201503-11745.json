    "lots of work but it's only 3 times a week so nowhere as bad as L1\/2 or a summer program. also therefore it's not as intense either and I didn't find myself improving as much when I took L1\/2 last year. but it's good practice and you get to read and watch a lot of authentic material, which is fun."
