   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "How to work with a professional director in the context of theatrical design process; the process of developing a new musical",
    "I learned about the process of making an original musical and gained a lot of perspective about creating a character from scratch.",
    "How do I even begin to describe the academic, emotional, personal, and professional growth that this class inspired in me. It's hard to quantify just how much of a better person I am now that I was at the beginning of the process. I'm more confident in myself as a performer and even more confident in myself as an academic who performs. The blend of theater and academia was something truly novel to me and offered such a profound depth to the piece that was just so beautiful. I'll never think of the relationship between the two in the same way again. Ultimately, this course was a once in a lifetime experience that has touched my heart and soul and will stay with me forever.",
    "I believe I developed a greater aptitude for collaboration. I learned how to be a better actor when it comes to trying out new material, and helping a composer\/lyricist gain insight as to how to move forward with their work. I also think I became a sharper, more devoted performer.",
    "How to craft a musical and be in a professional environment--hugely important for the real world of theater",
    "Never has a class taught me more about how to create a collaborative, productive, and supportive environment where art can be made. We learned to work hard, work efficiently, and work together in the service of something we all believed in.",
    "I grew immensely as a student, a performer, and as a conscious, theater-making artist. The course combined the demands of a typical academic course with the demands of developing and mounting a new musical to create an experience more enriching and fulfilling than anything I've experienced at Yale thus far. I developed a strong historical lens in relation to creating biographically inspired theater that deepened my understanding of the sacrifices and compromises made historically in order to create a compelling piece of theater. Through that process, I strengthened my skills as a performer, a singer, an academic writer, a dramaturg, a critic, and a professional. There was a great deal to be gained in a course like this.",
    "Because of the unique nature of this course, I learned both theoretical and practical knowledge. I learned about the ins and outs of crafting a new musical, particularly on the life of a historical figure, and the delicacy with which you have to approach such a process. Our collective knowledge came together to bring this show to fruition, and that was a thrill to witness!",
    "I developed incredible insights into the production of a musical, which is an understatement. I experienced a hands-on, collaborative, and engaging project that I never thought I would get to do as a freshman at Yale and I'm so thankful for it. I learned about the sacrifices that need to be made for art to thrive, and I learned about the crucial intersection of art and research, particularly for this production. Academia informs our artistic choices so much that it's crucial to be well-informed before diving into art.",
    "Too much to write up here. Suffice it to say I believe this class had a major role in my artistic development, and I am extremely grateful it was offered in an academic setting with the opportunity to pair the development of an aesthetic project with plenty of time for academic reflection and research.",
    "Can't even get into it now! So much was learned about collaboration, how a show comes together, the role of research in theater, you name it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were no weaknesses. It was a wonderful experience in learning to work with collaborators and friends, to trust in one another, and to use the collective intelligence of the whole to improve the final product.",
    "Every person who wants to work in the musical-theatre professionally should an experience like this course. It made strong use of its students time, the teacher was excellent, the dramaturgy and academia elements made our piece fuller. It was a truly wonderful, once in a lifetime experience.",
    "Everything professor Jolles did was amazing and we were so lucky. I would say though that papers shouldn't necessarily be required when we are required to put in more work to this class (by nature of the act of putting on a musical, even without the papers) than any other class",
    "The class was an incredible chance to meld the academic rigor of the research behind original theatrical work, and the practical effort of crafting it. Occasionally, the course could have been structured so that the product--as fantastic as it was--was perhaps emphasized in a way that made the process a little more stressful than it could have been.",
    "The material, the instructor, and the students were all incredibly strong. This kind of class only works when all three of those factors meet a high standard and this class did that.",
    "No weaknesses, all strengths. Guided through the process of creating a new work by an expert professor. Blends academia with hands-on experience -- crucial to anyone wanting to pursue any creative career.",
    "To be frank, there was no place I could see for any improvement. The class worked so smoothly, and the show we produced was exactly right for that moment in its life, and it was exceptional. Basically, this class was perfect.",
    "There are too many strengths to list for this course, but I will try: an unmatched collaborative environment, hands-on experience in creating a musical with a time restraint, conversations with every member of the team in order to ensure a well-oiled machine, accessibility to academic resources for the topic, an incredible idea to worth with, and of course, and incredible director who is professional in her field and who had a hand in every member's contributions to the show. If I were to express any weaknesses, I would say that at least the music team felt a little disengaged from the writing process of the show, and it made orchestrations, and knowing the arch of the show, much harder."

   "comments": [
    "If anyone has the chance to do a production seminar, do it! It's such a worthwhile experience especially if done with intelligent, talented people.",
    "If you would like to do musical-theatre or theatre at some professional level, this is a place to be. It might not be with Annette and it surely won't be with Julian Hornik (he is graduating), but I think the format of the experience is incredible enough to try it. You get credit to focus on your art, to engage with incredible musicians\/theatre-makers, and to make something beautiful and new.",
    "Yes--the best pre-professional experience as a theater maker you can get at Yale",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely. Shen production seminars provide the epitome of what the curriculum has to offer, combining all of the elements it teaches into a practical creative setting.",
    "Yes absolutely - there need to be more courses like this offered by Yale College that allow for coursework at the intersection of academia and production because there is something to gain for every single student with an interest in theater, no matter which side they approach it from (performance, design, directing, writing, etc.). The ability to collaborate with your peers and work with a seasoned professor in this capacity is like no other experience at Yale - curricular or extracurricular.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course or a production seminar akin to this course to another student; it promotes theater creation at a high level while also giving us learning opportunities not available elsewhere at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Because of the unique nature of this course, I learned both theoretical and practical knowledge. I learned about the ins and outs of crafting a new musical, particularly on the life of a historical figure, and the delicacy with which you have to approach such a process. Our collective knowledge came together to bring this show to fruition, and that was a thrill to witness!",
    "Absolutely. If you are someone interested in composing, arranging, orchestrating, directing, acting, then this course is a great intersection of academia and art that is crucial in the real world! But know that it is a huge time commitment and it should not coincide with other musical productions or intense extracurricular engagements.",
    "Yes, and I hope they continue to offer it moving forward!"
