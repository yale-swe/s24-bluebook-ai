    "fun class, really easy, take it if you need an easy science credit or just really like dinosaurs\/prehistory",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE! WARNING, THIS IS NOT A GUT, THE MIDTERM IS HARD AND THE MATERIAL IS BORING.",
    "This class is great for an easy science credit.",
    "NEVER ever take this class",
    "It's an okay way to get your Sc done, especially now that other favorite gut courses are disappearing. Watch out for professor Jacques Gauthier, though. If he's teaching the last part of the course, I don't recommend taking it. His lectures are painfully boring and disorganized. This stands in sharp contrast to the other part of the course, taught by Derek Briggs- that part was so awesome!!!!",
    "This class was really interesting. You learn the major changes that happened in evolutionary history, and in the history of the planet. The first half focuses on the \"way back\" things (slime colonies, evolution of shells and skeletons) and the second half is more modern - modernish mammals and the like. As far as subject matter goes, I liked the first half better, but they're both good. Who know elephants were related to tiny little vole-things?",
    "No, too boring",
    "I don't think I would take this class again looking back. It was stuff you'll never learn anywhere else, but not as cool as I thought.",
    "Take some other science.",
    "History of Life is a basic class. The subject matter is interesting but a lot of memorization that overshadows the lessons on the tests. Brigg's lectures were good and I felt like I learned a lot. Gauthier lectures weren't...but you can probably still learn a lot if you study the notes closely.",
    "I have very mixed feelings about this class. First of all, the lecturer determines a lot. Our first half was with Briggs, and he was wonderful, but the material was a lot more...remote (pond scum, little squishy things scooting around the floors of ancient seas). Our second half was with Gauthier, who was a terrible lecturer. I always left class incredibly confused, and there was no textbook to consult (they recommend a book you can buy as a supplement, but they don't teach out of it \/ it doesn't really correspond to the course), which meant I basically learned all the material on my own for the first time during reading week for a final that was half the grade of the course. You essentially have to memorize his lecture notes verbatim, and he throws out advanced terms without explaining them that you need in order to understand the larger concepts. The material from this half of the class is a little cooler -- you finally get into dinosaurs -- but some of it, too, is arcane. The paper was generously graded, but the tests require a LOT of studying and memorization, so be prepared. Don't take it as a gut. The nice part is that there isn't weekly reading, though perhaps this is a hindrance in some respect, since it might help you learn the material sooner. Also, it's a huge hike past the Peabody Museum, so be sure you are prepared for that. There are \"laboratory\" sessions at the beginning of the course where you get to see fossils up-close, but many are just models of fossils and with so many people in the course, it was too crowded and hectic to really appreciate them. The TAs were very helpful in general, though!",
    "Don't take this class unless you're REALLY into fossils and the phylogenetic tree. The class description is misleading; we barely even touched on dinosaurs. Looking back, I learned a lot of really cool stuff that I'm glad to know now, but I did not have funlearning it; the class is a lot of memorization, all of words I'd basically never heard before, and the exams are tough. If you're just looking for an easy science credit, this isn't it.",
    "Don't do this to yourself. Each lecture proves harder and harder to drag yourself to. And the exams are tough, and graded harshly. A fake gut.",
    "Not a lot of work, but frustrating exams.The paper's easy, at least, but it's not worth as much as the two exams.",
    "Take it if you want a science credit with no reading. It helps if you go to lecture, but if you don't, you can still survive. Try to study more than a day before the final. Tons of material to go through.",
    "I do not recommend this course. Although the first half of the course with Derek Briggs is good, the second half with Gauthier is not. Just to give you an idea of the difference - there were about 90 people present per class when Briggs lectured, and about 40 when Gauthier lectured.",
    "I would not recommend History of Life to another student. You'll pay for it later unless you read the lectures BEFORE you go to class, take notes in class, and then make a master set of notes later. Without a textbook, everyone is cast out on a limb. So, only take this class if you know you're a great note-taker and don't mind reviewing and memorizing a TON before the midterm and final. If you're a science major who's used to the responsibility of memorization, this class could be a dream (no problem sets). Bear in mind: If you're not, the amount of work you'll have to commit to the final will feel disproportionate to that which you'll commit to the rest of your classes and will throw you off. For me, it was a below average experience.",
    "It's a science credit with only two exams and a paper, so it isn't much work. There is a ton of material though, and people were surprised by the grading standards on the exams. I have no idea how I will do, since the final exam (50% of our grade) was out of left field, and everyone felt the same way.",
    "Do not be deceived by the simple midterm-paper-final format and the lack of homework \u0097 this is NOT a gut. The tests are frustratingly difficult and the material is both dull and daunting. It was neither rewarding nor enjoyable, and I would not recommend it either to someone seriously interested in biological evolution or someone just looking to fulfill a science credit.",
    "It's a good science credit, and stuff you really should know. Just one of those types of classes... not always pleasant--the lecturing can be a bit dry--but you get the overall idea, and gain from it.",
    "Very mildly interesting. You learn a lot of the basics about the development of animal life on earth, much of it from the professors who actually came up with the theories. It's kind of unclear what's important and what isn't, but if you're looking to fulfill an Sc credit and don't mind walking all the way past the Peabody twice a week, this one works.",
    "Amazing. Amazing. Take it.",
    "This is a fairly good class that provides a lot of information in a relatively short time. It involves a lot of memorization.",
    "Absolutely not. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Many of us take this class because we are humanities majors in search of a science credit. If you are willing to actually go to class and do the work well, this will fill that need. If you are going to skip every class, like many did in History of Life, then you are wasting your time and will (deservedly) do poorly.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this class to a fellow student. The good thing about this class is that the day to day work is nothing--there is actually no homework and no reading. However, this means you HAVE TO go to class because the tests are based purely on lectures. The bad thing is that when the midterm and final come around, you are kinda screwed because the material presented in class is sometimes incomprehensible. Lecutres are often very difficult to follow. That said, the material has the potential to be very intersting if the professors work on making lectures a bit easier to follow. The class is taught by two different professors. The first half of the course is taught by Briggs, the second half of the course by Gauthier. Although they are both super famous in their respective fields (google them) Briggs was a better lecturer than Gauthier was. If you really need a science credit and can't find another class, then I would say take this one. Just make sure that you review your notes every so often so that when the midterm and final come around, you aren't struggling trying to commit to memory everything that was said (yes, this class is about memorizing the lectures). Also,its very helpful to take this class with friends or form a study groupd in which you can review your notes and try to make sense out of them.",
    "First half with Briggs is excellent.I wish they had told us the format of the midterm exam, though.Instead of a wishy-washy \"come to review with your questions, because we have nothing planned\"Second half with Gauthier was hard to understand. When I look at the lecture notes posted online, I say \"this is what he was saying in class?\"The midterm and final test you on pure recall of facts.",
    "Take it if you want an easy science credit (do be aware that you should go to lecture, though). Don't take if if you want a fascinating science class.",
    "This class starts out bearable with Professor Briggs but becomes a total nightmare once Professor Gauthier starts teaching. Gauthier focuses almost exclusively on phylogeny--that is, how an animal should be classified and why--and manages to impart almost no information about it despite emphasizing it in every single lecture. Do not take this class if you are interested in dinosaurs, animals, or life in general, because this class will teach you nothing about any of these things and will also make you want to kill yourself. Non-science majors, find another science credit. I promise you it's not worth it.",
    "Midterm was tough. The final required tons of cramming. Briggs is a great lecture... Gauthier not. Took it only for the science credit, but it is not as easy as you might have heard.",
    "Took it for a science credit. Wasn't great but was ok.",
    "Did not learn except while studying. Very hard and not very fulfilling. Unless you want to go into this stuff I would not recommend it.",
    "The course is an interesting explanation of how life got to the way it is today.The strength of the course lies in the fact that it is really interesting material, if presented the right way. It might seem odd that primordial scum is interesting, but the way Professor Briggs presents is short of blowing your mind. There really is no weakness to the course itself besides Professor Gauthier. To go along with what everyone else is probably going to write about him, he's TERRIBLE. I mean, I'm sure he's a great person and all, and seems tohave a sense of humor, but his making an idiot out of himself during lectures imitating lizard runs isn't amusing when you're stressed out about the final. It's actually really sad that he's the professor for that portion of the course, which contains amazing material in comparison to that of Professor Briggs's section.. I went through most of the second half of the semester completely lost, but when I settled down to study for the final, I realized we had covered some really amazing stuff.HOWEVER, DO WATCH OUT FOR THE TAs!The TAs are terrible. Basically, they just attend every lecture, pretend to lead a couple of lab days and then stand at the front of the class during review sessions while answering every question with \"It's all in the notes\". Either none of them are very competent in their field or are just like Gauthier in the sense that they lack any proper skill communicating information. There's also, obviously some tension\/awkwardness within the group...I can tell who finds who annoying and the like by their simple interactions...I'd expect Yale graduate students to be a little more professional, at least when it came to their education.Basically take the course for Briggs and for the credit. It's worth putting up with the rest of the incompetence.",
    "Its boring, but I guess its a good science credit because there is no quantitative component",
    "If you need a science credit but aren't a science major definitely take it.",
    "not as great a class as it comes off during shopping period; not a lot of work though; a decent science credit",
    "No, I would not recommend it. The first half is good, but it really falls apart in the end when they switch professors, and it's not worth the frustration.",
    "Great understanding into how life on Earth developed and evolved. Good science credit, but by no means a gut",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This might be the worst course at Yale. They are completely disorganized, test you totally out of the blue, and the lectures are incredibly boring. This is not a gut science class so don't be fooled. Take something more interesting and less difficult than torturing yourself in this course.",
    "if you want a gut science.",
    "History of Life has a midterm exam, a final exam, and a paper in the middle of the semester. There is no required reading. That being said, however, be ready to take notes in all of the lectures---the second half of the semester is especially tedious and difficult to follow as the professor is kind of confusing (monotone, unclear, etc.). The subject material is, or can be, rather interesting, though.",
    "Take it. That said, here's a caveat: it is NOT, by any means, a gut science.",
    "Take it if you are legitimately interested in fossils, evolutionary biology, or rambling undisciplined pedagogical styles. It's fairly accessible, but easy to fall behind due to the lack of homework.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you need another science credit. It is not too hard to understand but requires that you do go over the coursework pretty diligently to remember everything.",
    "It was such a bad experience... Take other science courses if you don't have much interest in fossils and evolution. The classes are not interesting, and you'll have to spend a lot of time studying for the midterm+final.",
    "I would recommend this course as an easy science course. You may have to study hard for the tests to get a good grade, but there is no reading.",
    "You think its a gut? So did we... I think that the professors got wind that it was considered a gut, and so they made it harder. Good luck",
    "No",
    "If you LOVE the material, take it. If you're looking for an SC credit, search elsewhere.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Try to find a Sc credit that is more coherent.",
    "The subject matter is cool but be warned, whatever you may have heard this class is not just about dinosaurs. It is, as the title states, about the ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF LIFE. That means from single celled Eukaryotes down to Humans (and Birds and Dinosaurs). And yes, you have to memorize that, plus all the specific synapomorphic changes along the way. I really liked it and would recommend it. But it is not a gut; be prepared to study your ass off. Also the second professor's lectures are a mess."
