   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it!! Whether you're a pro at MatLab or still traumatized from early coding experience, you'll learn a lot in an open-ended, interactive environment. Professor Campbell is amazing.",
    "Do take it! If you're a BME major\/ if you are not- no matter which part of the curve you're on, this class is pretty self-explanatory and you will learn a lot along the way. This is one of those rare classes where you will learn a lot but the work will not be prohibitive or weigh you down. Make sure you keep up with the lit reviews on time and it will be absolutely a solid, fun, but extremely important class to have!",
    "This is a great course-- taught me the basics of modeling as well as gave me an appreciation for the utility of modeling. Stuart Campbell is a joy to learn from and the stuff he does is actually quite impressive. Take this course. There are 6 doable and fun problem sets and a very fun final project that, while takes a long time, is how I learned the most.",
    "Take this class. You'll be exposed to a whole breadth of fascinating concepts in biomechanics as well as a whole host of useful skills in mathematical modeling. Furthermore, the professor Dr. Campbell is kind, engaging, and has a love for the topic that is infectious. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you can! Prof Campbell is awesome, and it's a great introduction to multiscale modeling. BENG 249 and other core BME classes go over the basics of MATLAB, but this class extends that knowledge to show how powerful computational modeling tools can really be. Overall workload is very manageable, but don't procrastinate on the final project."
