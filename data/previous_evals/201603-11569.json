    "Opened my eyes to a lot of different perspectives on the topic and really made me question some things I just assumed to be true despite not having any evidence.",
    "There is no free will and we as as society should understand that to create a better world for all.",
    "Learn all of the different types of scientific approaches to the free will question.",
    "Having a background in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, I learned to integrate the diverse skills and knowledge I gained from my experiences and courses in the respective disciplines to interpret the texts we read in this course. I really learned to think about neuroscience from a philosopher's perspective and the concept of free will from a scientist's perspective. The seamless integration of these two disciplines is the highlight of this course, alongside the ample reading and writing opportunities we had in writing a reading response each week which helped develop and maintain my writing and organizational skills.",
    "In this course, I learned an immense amount about a topic I had not given much thought to before. It changed my perspective on a lot of issues and found it to be very interesting.",
    "Free will is something we all grapple with. I gained a more reasoned approach to these questions by taking the course."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. I learned a lot about both psychology and philosophy, and the reading response, while a lot of work, allowed me to extensively explore the concepts I found most interesting. I also thought the professor was effective and well-versed in the subject. My one major criticism is that I wish we had gotten feedback on our homework assignments. I would have liked to see what grade I got, how accurately I was explaining the material, and what the professor thought about my arguments.",
    "Professor great, content great, really wouldn't change anything.",
    "I enjoyed the content of the class very much. I think the only annoying part about this class, was that it felt as if you had to compete with other students based on your weekly response length. Which ends up being 4-6 pages double spaced every week. Overall, course was awesome -- best I've taken.",
    "The strengths of this course lies in the depth of the analysis of the three texts we read. We read the assigned readings on our own, but then talk over each new concept, philosopher, or scientist during the weekly discussion section. Through this course, we were able to thoroughly analyze the stances of the main proponents against free will. However, the weakness of the course can then be in the breath of the material covered in that we did not get the chance to read a variety of texts from different authors on their stances on free will.",
    "One weakness of the course was the amount of writing we had to do, which was more than both of my writing credits. If this course was changed to a writing credit, this wouldn't be an issue. A strength was the information, which was extremely intriguing and interesting.",
    "Strengths: reasonable reading load, engaging lectures, good professor, interesting content, fair exams Weaknesses: readings are a little homogeneous, a lot of writing"

    "I would recommend this course to another student. Even though this course isn't cross-listed in the philosophy department, it is a fantastically interdisciplinary class that taught me a lot about both philosophy and psychology. The subject matter is very interesting, as are all of the readings.",
    "Definitely. Loved this course...would recommend even if you do not have a strong psych or neuroscience background!",
    "Yes, it was an interesting subject to discuss and I liked the discussions in class. There is quite a lot of writing every week, but the readings were fun and the workload was still light.",
    "If you like philosophy and neuroscience, and always wondered how the two influenced each other, this is the perfect course to take! There is quite a bit of writing if you want it to be (and we heard rumors that this may be changed into a WR credit for those who do), but otherwise it's just a reading response (graded for completion) each week, two exams (only from material in the lectures), and a final paper (basically on any topic you want that could relate to free will). Professor Brown is super kind, knowledgeable, and wonderful and really likes to have good conversations during the discussion sections, so if you liked talking during sections, take this course! All in all, it was a great experience for a fall semester senior who traveled quite a bit for interviews. I really learned a lot from the course, had a few existential crises (because there really is no free will), and ended up talking about this course more than I expected during the course of my interviews.",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in Free Will. It was an extremely informative experience and Professor Brown is great. It really changed my perspective on a lot of issues.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Brown is nice, the exams are fair, and the content is very interesting. Although it may be intimidating to write a 3 page single-spaced response every week, it is totally doable and it is not graded harshly. If you don't get in right away, keep attending. MANY people drop the course."
