    "This a great class...not too demanding work-wise and actually interesting to attend every week. One short paper, and a midterm and a final both essay question style, it's not hard to do decently in this course. Also, Latham is a great lecturer! You are missing you if you don't take a class with him",
    "Good class- a little repetitive after a while if you know anything about law\/ bioethics. Grading is harsher than you'd expect also...",
    "Take it!! Great class, great professor, and great material! The class is awesome and is only a midterm, final, and short paper.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "REALLY GREAT CLASS; A MUST-TAKE AT YALE. sooooo interesting, so relevant to our lives. professor latham is one of the best lecturers ever. it was even worth waking up at 9:20 for! seriously, this class was amazing. i give it my absolute highest recommendation.",
    "must take class.",
    "I would summarize it as \"a decent lecture, relatively engaging if you're interested in the topic, but it would be helpful to have a little bit more structure to it.\"",
    "A really great course, one of my favorites at Yale! Definitely take it if you're interested in medicine. It will give you a much better view of what being a doctor is like and teach you more about medical issues than any of the pre-med requirements. Professor Latham is very engaging and a great lecturer and the TAs are also very knowledgeable.",
    "Overall, this class is pretty enjoyable. Stephen Latham is a great lecturer, which makes getting up for class at 9 bearable. Remember that its bioethics and LAW - you read interested cases and discuss medical ethics within a legal framework. Interesting, practical...take it.",
    "The class examines biomedical topics from a legal perspective. Definitely a class you can take without any prior knowledge in either law or medicine. I would absolutely recommend it to another student-- it's fascinating stuff!",
    "Definitely. Take it.",
    "Yes - definitely take this class if you want to learn more about the history and current law in Bioethics. Essential for learning central to current issues such as abortion and stem cell research.",
    "Interesting issues. Not exceptionally hard but definitely not easy to get an A.",
    "I would really recommend this class. The reading is fairly interesting and not too involved, and the lectures are pretty good - Prof Latham makes this class worth it. I'm pre-med and felt that looking at these bioethics issues (especially from a legal standpoint) is so important for prospective doctors.",
    "A great introduction to the legal treatment of very interesting topics",
    "solid course that people should take if they have any desire to look at law",
    "take it for an easy political science credit; i took it credit d fail and didn't really have to go to the lectures or do the reading--just got a set of notes from someone and was golden :)",
    "It's a well taught course about important issues. Professor Latham is a wonderful professor who knows his material and does a great job of teaching his students. The workload is not very heavy, and if you put in the work, you will really feel like you've gotten something out of the course.",
    "Absolutely recommend.",
    "Yes, Bioethics and the Law is an interesting and thought provoking class. We learned about issues that are everyday headlines in the newspaper. It was a great class to take.",
    "Yes! Take this course. Great for anyone interested in the law. The medical terminology and casework is used as an application of the law and is not hard to understand. Great!",
    "I loved Bioethics and Law! It was a great class, and although it was at 9:20am, I got up every Tuesday\/Thursday (more than I can say about my other early classes). Stephen Latham is a wonderful lecturer who is easy to listen to. We covered a wide range of materials and got a brief history and talked about the laws surrounding the issues. The book was kind of intimidating, but that shouldn't discourage you. There was a midterm, paper, and a final. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any premed or prelaw student, or just a student interested in bioethics in general. If you're looking for a bioethics course that is more grounded in case law and less in philosophy and open-ended discussion and unanswered questions, this is it.",
    "HIGHLY recommended. Very engaging lectures, fascinating topics that are changing and in the news, just the right amount of reading and work. Draws from a very wide variety of people--classmates were into law, medicine, ethics, science, and more.",
    "Take this course. It is amazing!! Not too difficult and very informative.",
    "This class is amazing. I really liked it. The material is interesting and relevant.",
    "It'd say it was an incredible class.",
    "Definitely take this class, because Latham is a great lecturer. The reading and class material are engaging and generally pretty easy to keep up with from week to week. The format of the class is a lecture with no slides, but the way he talks is very conducive to clear note-taking. Sometimes it will turn into discussion when he poses a question to the audience. All the cases are at least engaging, if not very interesting.",
    "Good class for political science majors.",
    "Good, pretty easy. Actually doesn't deal a whole lot with law - mainly the bioethics issues that you kind of already know about. Great to take credit\/d - no worries at all.",
    "Probably yes. This is a good survey course on the law's approach to bioethics. Prof. Latham is a very good lecturer, and the reading is generally interesting. Grading was harder than expected, and sections were not very useful, but a solid course overall.",
    "This class is a great class for anyone interested in this subject, especially science majors needing distrabutional requirements. It was great to go to class and enjoy the lecture.",
    "Latham is a fine lecturer - very, very clear and understandable, knows his stuff -- and I felt like I learned a lot about very pertinent issues about the current healthcare system. As a freshman, it's a bit intimidating to be around a lot of political science majors who really know their stuff, especially in section, and to compete with them for grades, but I think it's also true that you don't have to have any political science background to take this class and understand the concepts. Readings have less importance than you'll think -- tests are mostly lecture based and lectures are a good summary of readings anyway. This class makes me feel more aware of current issues, and it's interesting material with a great professor. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes. Good course, containing things everyone should know",
    "A great class that I would totally recommend. The reading is interesting and Professor Latham is very engaging. I think the fact that about 85% of the students showed up to a 9:20 class says a lot. I really wish there were more classes like this at Yale.",
    "Great, great class. Definitely take it, but shop around for the best TA. The material is so intresting and the professor is so engaging and a great speaker. It is one of those classes that you can actually apply in everyday life.",
    "Bioethics and Law is the perfect course for anyone interested in the American legal system and medicine. Latham is a great professor who is a great lecturer. Not only is he friendly but he just talks in front of the class, but also is very organized. The class requires a lot of reading but it all was really interesting. I always actually looked forward to doing the reading and the section leaders really know what they're doing as well. This is a class well worth the work just for understanding things about a healthcare system we all use.",
    "Take this class. Do it. You will learn so much material, so relevant to political and legal questions on bioethical issues that have been addressed since the beginnings of the modern era. It's a great way to get into court case decisions which you might not otherwise be doing. Latham is an inspiring teacher.",
    "Great course, absolutely take it. Do the reading. Mid term, paper, and a final",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone, especially someone interested in law or ethics.",
    "TAKE IT if you are at all interested in bioethics. I'd already taken David Smith's course, but this is - as promised - much more law-based than that one (as in, it felt like a different course, not a repeat of that one nor of Akhil Amar's con-law.) Professor Latham is GREAT: funny, smart, and clearly very knowledgeable about both the practical and theoretical aspects of the field. The reading was an average amount, and the actual cases from the case book have been heavily edited so the reading is pretty interesting. Section was fairly useful, and the exams are very very fair in questions and grading, especially if you study. Focus on the lectures for your studying, and you'll be fine!",
    "A great course. I think EVERYONE ought to take some bioethics course since bioethics touches on so many of the most essential, fundamental questions of humanity. Law just adds another interesting layer (or limit).Strengths: very interesting topics (well-selected, well-organized), great textbook, great lectures -- informative, interesting, organized and thought-provoking, reasonable workload, good midterm& final questions.Weaknesses: none. The best a survey course can get.",
    "An interesting, not-too-difficult class. Don't be put off by the \"law\" part of the class--people unfamiliar with law didn't seem to have any trouble keeping up. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in healthcare policy.",
    "Absolutely wonderful course. The lectures were always interesting even at 9:30 in the morning. Professor Latham and the TAs worked very hard to make the course very interesting and relevant.",
    "This is a good, interesting class. However, this is not a gut class. The exams and papers are graded pretty rigorously.",
    "A very interesting and fair class. No real weaknesses. The professor is great.",
    "Yes, the course material is interesting and it's pretty cool to see the law's views on public issues because they're not always what you would imagine.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the subject or simply curious about law or bioethics.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend this course.",
    "A great course for anyone looking for an interesting credit in Political Science or just in general. Lectures are informative, reading is manageable, and section(take it with Noorain Khan!) is the best I've ever had at Yale.",
    "yes i found it really interesting and the topics were very applicable",
    "Yes, absolutely take this course. Great prof, material is really easy to understand. Section isnt worth anything. Interesting material, pretty light workload.",
    "Definitely take it! The workload isn't too heavy, and it is a very interesting course. You don't need any prior experience with law or ethics, but it addresses many contemporary issues and gives you a base in both subjects.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Very enjoyable lectures, very little work, no need to read, test questions are 3-4 essay questions that come from lectures, and the paper is short and easy to write as long as you can support your point of view.",
    "TAKE IT! for a class that does not require that much work, you will learn so much. THis class challenges you to think about difficult ethical problems and you get to learn the law behind these problems. Wonderful class.",
    "It's a pretty good class - Professor Latham is a pretty engaging lecturer, the workload is pretty light, and all in all it's pretty enjoyable. I would only recommend choosing your TA wisely - section can sometimes get pretty painful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; the subject material is very interesting and relevant, especially with the ongoing decisions being made about national healthcare. If you think you might be interested in law, it's also a good opportunity to read cases.",
    "A good class to learn about a topic that you can't get many other places, with a great professor. Maybe, if you can take the 9:25 time-slot, take it credit-d and just go to lectures.",
    "Fascinating material, awesome Professor, not a lot of work. A Yale gem that shouldn't be missed!",
    "Take this class! I cannot say that enough. You don't need to have any experience in law, and the workload is completely manageable. This class focuses more on the law side of bioethics; there are very few arguments over whether something is ethical or not. The discussions mainly deal with how the law would solve a specific case. But I actually liked this format much better, and it was definitely a class I would love to take again.",
    "Yes, it is a great class to take! What you learn in the classroom is really applicable to the real world and something everyone should have some kind of background knowledge in. Professor L is awesome and the lectures are very engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone thinking about law school and wanting to familiarize themselves with reading case law in an easy, digestible manner.",
    "This class is not only incredibly interesting with a great lecturer and an easily accessible law text but it is also very fair. Stephen Latham is a wonderful professor and his lectures are engaging and relevant. The text, Bioethics and Public Health Law, is very readable even for someone not specializing in health or law. The class is graded fairly. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the issues involved!",
    "Take it. Its a great class. Exams are open ended questions.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. seriously it's really great. Professor Latham is awesome and a really clear and engaging lecturer. the material is really interesting and the workload is totally fair. great class overall.",
    "I would highly recommend Bioethics and the Law to another student. It is a great intro to the American Law system and how it correlates to healthcare and bioethics. It is a very rewarding class. I have learned so much from it.",
    "This is a great class with a good lecture and straightforward exams. Hard to get an A, pretty easy to get an A-. Impossible to do all the reading, but not necessary either.",
    "Yes. Very inspiring class.",
    "Take it. It's informative, interesting, and not a lot of work. The professor is great and the TAs are as well.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's incredibly straight forward, relevant, and enjoyable. Professor Latham managed to keep me awake at 9:25 am twice a week, which is definitely a feat. While there is an emphasis on the legal aspect of bioethics, you also examine the moral positions that are inherent in these sorts of questions. Paper is a breeze, as are the midterm and final, but you really get a lot out of the class.",
    "Take it! It was my favorite class this year. The material is extremely interesting, especially if you're considering being a lawyer or a doctor. The class could be called \"Law for Doctors\"--for me, it demonstrated that law might be an enjoyable career direction. However, because our case book is designed for doctors, it is very accessible, not burdened with legal jargon, etc.The material is so interesting and it's relevant to all of us: abortion, end-of-life care, assisted reproduction... You will find many topics that interest you covered in this class.The professor is excellent; discussion sections are interesting and definitely worth your time (can't say that for every class). Plus, the workload is very reasonable. Take the class--you won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I learned a lot!",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course on bioethics and the legal issues surrounding it.",
    "Great class, interesting material. One paper, a midterm, and a final."
