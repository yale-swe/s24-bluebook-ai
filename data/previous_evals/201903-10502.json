    "I learned a lot about process control, as well as Matlab.",
    "Review of mass balances, transport, Laplace transforms, Taylor series. Basics of designing and evaluating various control systems. How to generate transfer functions. Advantages and disadvantages of P,I, and D controllers. How to generate block diagrams and open and closed loop transfer functions. How to evaluate system stability using transfer functions. Interacting systems, how to decide pairing of variables. How to use PID Tuner and Simulink in MATLAB.",
    "In the first half of the course, I felt like I learned a decent amount about control systems: transfer functions, control loops, PID controllers, etc. However, in the second half of the course (i.e. shortly after the midterm) I learned almost nothing, since the quality of teaching drastically decreased. Especially the latter third about analog controls, Z transforms, and modern algorithms.",
    "Learned theory behind control systems and how to model them on Simulink. Not going to lie, at several points throughout the semester I would have been completely fine with not doing ABET solely so I could have dropped this class.",
    "How to construct control systems and how to use Matlab and Simulink",
    "I gained an intro to engineering process control and learned a ton of new material that I had never once seen before. I also learned how to code in Matlab which is a platform I had never used prior."

   "comments": [
    "This course does not have many strengths. The material is incredibly difficult. The lectures often go late, so do not schedule a class immediately after this one. The homework takes a long time, and is often impossible to do without going to office hours. The final project is assigned far too late in the semester, and is incredibly difficult. The exams are a challenge. The textbook is unhelpful at best. There are not enough resources to learn how to utilize Matlab, Simulink, Curve Fitting, and PID tuner, to the extent that the professor expects and tests on. You learn new material during reading week, literal days before the final exam. The workload during the last half\/quarter of the semester is absolutely unreasonable for seniors who have three to four other classes, are applying to graduate programs, applying for full time positions, and taking required standardized tests. The professor is not flexible with due dates when you are dealing with these things.",
    "This course is incredibly difficult, and poorly organized - lecture notes are not posted, lectures themselves are quite unclear, and the homeworks are difficult and expectations are not clearly articulated.",
    "Topic could have been very interesting but class was executed fairly poorly. First half of the semester was ok, but the pace of the second half was too fast. Class focused too much on math and derivations, instead of the principles behind them and why we were doing what we were. At the end of the class, I still did not have a good foundation or solid understanding of how control systems worked and how the math came out of the block diagram. Last few classes regarding sampling and z transforms (and current state of affairs in the topic) were so rushed and poorly taught that I understood nothing. Final project was WAY too time consuming for the amount of other homework that we received regularly in the class, and it made the last several days of finals quite miserable. Class needs TAs and regular office hours. Homework solutions and notes were never posted, so we never knew how to do the questions correctly.",
    "This course is brutally difficult, with a completely unmanageable workload. The combination of a final project, final exam, and psets through reading period makes the second half of the course absolutely impossible to manage. Having a TA to help with problem sets, designated office hours, and better distribution of material through the semester would be incredibly helpful.",
    "Strengths: almost nothing. The only strengths I can think of are that Prof. Altman allows for an open discussion type of class where we can ask questions regularly through the lecture, and that the material is relevant for real-world control systems which is nice. Weaknesses: Too many to count. Having weekly homeworks in addition to the final project is absurd, since the required weekly tasks for the project are in itself homeworks, meaning you basically complete two homeworks per week for this course in the second half of the semester. Moreover, little guidance was given for the final project, which takes ~200 hours to complete if we're being optimistic. Most of the project was self-taught online or by Googling rather than clear instruction from the professor, and little of the material such as how to use Simulink or Matlab were actually gone over in class. The tests are absurdly long (Prof. Altman likes to give long essays on the exams for you to peruse in your \"spare time\" instead of getting to the point) and the exams are too long and\/or complex to finish in the time allotted. How to improve: make the final project clearer on instructions and actually provide guidance on how to use Simulink effectively, reduce homework load in second half of course to compensate for workload of final project, make test questions less essay-like and more doable in the time allotted, and don't run through all of digital controls and Z transforms in the last 2 classes and expect everyone to understand it.",
    "MM:: \/: : M( : :N :(#NNN N, #NM ##'::NNN #(NN; NN##N\/( ##Q N N N , .Q ;` N##, NN#N This is a guy scarfing down chips. Everyone who took the final in this class knows why I'm posting this.",
    "This class was a lot of work - it was a bit much to have weekly problem sets and also tasks for the final project due every week during the second half of the semester. The final project was a ton of work and their was little guidance. Also, it was way too much to have the final exam and final project both."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, but it is required for the ABET degree. Just try to get through it and take it with friends that you can study with.",
    "Only if youre ABET or if Altman is not teaching.",
    "Good luck",
    "Absolutely would not recommend. If you are looking at this class you are either a) ABET ChemE or b) a masochist. Don't take this course unless you have to if Altman is teaching it. If Altman is teaching it, start the final project EARLY and go to him for advice. Keep on top of your work so you don't end up doing everything at the last minute. Work together with other classmates to make sure work can get done appropriately.",
    "This class was a meme. From Professor Altman probably spending hours making up unit names to put on the equation sheets to everyone blindly copying notes because no one understood enough to even formulate a question, this class was something else. I will admit though that the final project was pretty cool, and Professor Altman must have put in a lot of work creating the autothermal reformer simulation and making the packet. However, it had many things that were rough about it, including the fact that the packet did not explain the tasks well at all. For instance, at one point we had to implement parameter scheduling but were never taught how to do that in the slightest.",
    "Be aware that this class is a lot of work and you will need to put in extra time to understand the material and do the final project.",
    "No, absolutely not. If youre reading this review you are for sure an ABET Chemical Engineering major who has no choice and is already a Senior who is far to invested to drop the accreditation now. I wish I had taken more time to read reviews of courses as an underclassman because if I had known what I was signing up for I would have dropped the ABET accreditation a long time ago. This major, or at least pursuing the ABET accreditation within this major, is by far the worst decision I have ever made at Yale. A few upperclassmen had warned me of how miserable this experience would make me and I really wish I had taken their advice and that they had been more candid with how it would be. I am always up for a challenge and to work like crazy, but there is a big difference between being a hard worker and being up for a challenge and being put through years of unreasonable expectations and being intellectually belittled by countless old while male professors with large egos trying to prove their superiority to a bunch of 20 year olds. This entire major has been a saga of just that. I have had to sit through more than just one or two classes where I feel that professors are actively trying to convince me that I am inferior and will not make it in this major and careers. I have felt discriminated against by old white men a number of times and I think that the Chemical Engineering department needs major improvements on this front. This class is no exception. So to all of the Juniors reading these reviews, mentally prepare yourselves for a repeat of Fluid Mechanics with Allesandro Gomez, but with an even higher workload and fewer other students to work alongside with. In summary, I wish I changed my major trajectory years ago and this experience has only confirmed this regret. Good luck."
