    "Professor Wolf is tough. His problem sets are hard and his tests are harder. But... you will learn the material. Most definitely. If you take this class you will understand measure theory \/ integration.",
    "Material was mostly a retread of 305, with a few new topics. Lectures were enthusiastic but highly inefficient.",
    "Math 320 is a decent second semester of real analysis. It was a bit repetitive if you've taken 305 but there is much more rigor. The problems are harder but the class moves at a slower pace. Guy works you hard but is fair for the most part. On the down side Guy needs to work on the way he presents himself in class. I would taken again but preferably with stefan if possible."
