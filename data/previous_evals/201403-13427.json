    "This is a fun class, particularly if your aim is to get better at drawing. The workload is light. However, be prepared to work hard in class.",
    "I would recommend this class to improve your understanding of how to draw the human body, and to gain practice drawing from live models. However, I would recommend having some drawing experience to give you confidence from the outset. I took this class without having taken basic drawing and was initially worried I wouldn't be able to keep up, especially in terms of how long it took me to draw. The instructors had very high standards, but definitely invested in students' work and pushed everyone to improve. I would take it during a semester when you can block out a lot of time to devote to homework assignments which was not always possible for me. Still, I did feel my drawing confidence and ability improved significantly over the course of the semester.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "Take! All art majors should definitely take.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class as a 4th\/5th credit."
