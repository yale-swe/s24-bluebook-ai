   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in trade, wanting to learn a lot, and enjoy playing around with graphs (no intimidating algebra at all), then definitely take this class! The professor and the lecture materials are amazing!",
    "If you are interested in an interesting and challenging econ class, then ECON 184 is a good choice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for econ majors! So far my favorite econ class at yale. Professor Schott is a great lecturer and the material is interesting",
    "Totally take 184 - its an actually useful class that will make you thankful for studying econ. Professor Schott is approachable and a really talented lecturer. By the end of the semester you'll be able to read the NYT, FT, and WSJ and actually be able to evaluate their accuracy.",
    "This is a really good introduction to international trade. It is challenging without being impossible and the professor makes an effort to give you the resources you need to succeed. There is a good mix of theory and application and definitely made me excited about this branch of econ.",
    "This class will help you succeed at other Econ classes, but it is easier to take it after you have done intermediate micro because you know how to deal with the models more easily. I learned so so much in this class, mostly but not only about trade. It is a really helpful class in understanding what an economic model is and how different assumptions lead to different results. The lectures could be a bit faster, but professor Schott is great. He is incredibly brilliant, super funny, and nice to everyone both in class and at office hours. He was too nice to tell people to stop asking questions once everyone else got the topic. Nobody goes to class. Also, THE FIRST PROBLEM SET IS THE WORST. Don't drop the class after the first problem set. Also, the topics get easier after the midterm so do not worry if you do badly. However, I LOVED the fact that the class is very based on the real world. Finally, after all that theory in all those Econ classes...",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in Economics! I loved it because it combined both technical elements and applications. Some of the models combined insights from macro and micro, which was really cool too.",
    "Take this is you want a broad historical overview of trade models and enjoy GRAPHS.",
    "This course is about trade. If you are not interested in trade do not take this course. That being said, if you have even a tangential interest in the topic then you should take it. You will feel really well equipped to read articles on many topics and understand the give and take that goes into trade policy more than you thought possible. It starts off really difficult but gets more manageable as the year goes on.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you are very interested in understanding trade. It's not very applicable if you aren't interested in trade, and it's at 9am in Luce which can be a real struggle sometimes. It's not impossible to do well but you do have to work hard, so you just want to make sure you are interested in the subject first. Definitely very well taught.",
    "It's a really interesting class on a good topic with lots of references to current material. However, it gets incredibly boring later in the year and can be a little repetitive.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of major. This was one of the most useful and applicable economics courses I've taken. Overall, one of the most enjoyable courses I've taken at Yale (and the workload is actually very light).",
    "184 was probably the best course I've taken in the Econ department so far. Wonderfully taught, interesting material, and a crucial emphasis on course themes and applicability throughout the entire semester. Schott is excellent, the class itself isn't too hard, and by the end of it you gain a broad understanding of economic models in free trade and how to apply them to real world scenarios you might read about in the New York Times or WSJ. I'd heartily recommend this course.",
    "I recommend it. Not hard - 8 problem sets, midterm, final.",
    "I would recommend this class. This class covers old and new trade models that help explain the real world. The models can sometimes be abstract at first, though Professor Schott answers a lot of questions in class and makes sure everyone understands what is going on. Although the true\/false part of exams can be difficult, you learn interesting models to understand trade.",
    "Too many pictures not enough math",
    "One of the most interesting economics classes I've taken at Yale. This is not an easy course, but I can say I learned a lot. This course teaches you the core concepts behind international trade and you will learn to look at news headlines and politics in a different way. Pete Schott is also a fantastic professor who is extremely invested in his students. If you take this class though, you NEED to put time into though or you won't get anything out of it. Problem sets are tough. I'm telling you right now. The first one is especially hard but it gets better. Make sure you are committed to 9am lecture every Monday\/Wednesday or else you will fall behind.",
    "An econ course that is great for people who aren't as into the math aspects of economics.",
    "Yes, this class was a really cool introduction to international trade. Professor Schott is great - he's so engaging even at 9am and even cracks jokes! It feels like all of the pset and exam questions are T\/F\/U which takes some getting used to, but it's a great course, especially the second half. If you go to lecture this class is very managable.",
    "Take this class! I learned so much and this is one of the gems of the Econ department where you leave he class feeling like you learned material that is relevant to the rest of the world and will continue to be useful. International trade theory is applicable to a large variety of fields and this was my favorite class this semester. Keep in mind that the first problem set or two are the hardest in the semester and the problem sets get easier as the semester progresses.",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE. If you have taken intro micro and (suffered through) intro macro, this course will be a breath of fresh air. Probably some of the most useful econ you could learn, the last question on the final was literally analyzing a New York Times article based on the stuff we learned in class. Prof Schott is amazing, and is really good about explaining these concepts. And though the course is not math heavy, it's also not a walk in the park as well. If you have trouble with conceptual parts of Econ (graphs and such), this course might be hard for you. But if you're not a math person (like me), this will be a relief. This course is useful in so many fields, so just take it already and do something good for yourself!",
    "It is a wonderful introductory course that introduces one to the landscape and the scaffolding of international trade. After this class, you get a fairly comprehensive understanding of all the main trade theories, and become capable of reading international economics news through the lens of trade models, which is darn cool. Having said that, the process of acquiring that skill within the span of one semester is very challenging and requires commitment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in international trade or interested in economics or international relations in general. Professor Schott is a great professor and once you get a handle on the material, the rewards are very great.",
    "Awesome course and definitely worth taking for anyone who wants to have an intelligent conversation about global economic trends and trade. Especially useful for being a conscious consumer of the news and all this talk of who gains\/loses from trade and the implications of \"free trade.\" Professor Schott is an awesome teacher and really cares about students understanding the intuition behind the models he teaches and will not make you hate econ by drilling you with complex algebra and numbers. Everything is made clear though his explanation of models that really get at how the world works.",
    "Overall, a very strong economics course that provides very relevant material to understanding the global economy, a good balance between theory and application, and is a definite must-take for any Economics or Global Affairs student. While the midterm was very too lengthy for time allotted and was very challenging, the final and problem sets were very reasonable assessments; in general, the first half of the course proved somewhat more challenging than the second. Furthermore, lectures were interesting and engaging, and course slides were thorough and helpful. Professor Schott, in particular, is a strong lecturer, willing to engage with students in lecture and keeping lectures interesting through case-studies and real-world model applications. Office hours tended not to be particularly helpful, however, often repeating lecture material as opposed to more extensive Q-and-A or practice question review. The helpfulness of TAs would often be variable. Nonetheless, this is a very strong course and would definitely recommend it.",
    "Econ 184 is a great class. The material is engaging and challenging and also directly applicable to the real world. You get a great overview of the main models of trade theory, and also learn how to apply your new thibking to the kinds of arguments you see and hear every day. Professor Schott is amazing, honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. It's definitely worth the 9 am wake up time.",
    "Great class on trade theory, would recommend to anybody interested in how the global economy works",
    "International Econ is a great course. Though I think it was a tad overrated given the feedback I had heard from my friends, I definitely learned a great deal. The course itself was not overly challenging, and the professor and TA's are very helpful. You'll come away with a great introductory overview to the issues in trade.",
    "Great course that caters to different levels of knowledge on economic concepts. Prof. Schott is great at explaining the models and concepts taught and is very attentive to feedback and ways to improve his course. I loved how a large part of the course focuses on applying the models learned to real life events of international economics. Definitely take it!",
    "ECON-184 is an introduction to the most popular economic models and approaches to international trade. I would definitely recommend the class to another student who is interested in economics in general or international economics. The problem sets are very helpful in solidifying the material learned in class.",
    "This course seemed much easier at first, but got harder and harder as it went on. As long as you keep up with the material consistently (don't get behind) you should be in good shape. Not the most difficult course and a good econ course to get you started in the field, but also beware that it gets harder after shopping period. I would recommend.",
    "This is a good course to take if you want to learn Econ, but don't like math. While there is math involved, it is much less than in introductory and intermediate Econ classes. Most of the class is based on models of trade, which are explained by graphs. Understanding how the graphs work is key to the class. I would highly recommend this class to people who are interested in political science\/global affairs as well. The class is in some ways very oriented towards policy (although it doesn't offer hard conclusions, just methods). I wouldn't take this class expecting to breeze through it. The problem sets are not excessive, and were much easier with a collaborator, but they weren't easy either. The exams are challenging, by design. There isn't a ton of reading, and it is mostly supplemental to the core material, which is taught in class.",
    "I would describe ECON 184 as a class that explains international trade models and applies them to current events. I would definitely recommend the course to others."
