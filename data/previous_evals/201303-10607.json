   "comments": [
    "Lots of work but not as much as French L3. Good amount or reading and talking not too much writing. If you go up to L3 I would suggest finishing L4 as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I entered the course feeling very unsure of my placement--I felt inadequate for this language level. I was forced (in a good way) to get up to speed very quickly. French 140 is a great, immersive learning experience, and it has made me much more confident with my French abilities.",
    "I love Soumia Koundi. She is such a joy to have in the mornings and really helps you learn french. She has a great sense of humor and knowledge of French. 140 is a class that stresses grammar and reading texts. It's not too difficult. Essays are easy and exercises are straightforward and easy. The texts are difficult if you do not spend time reading.",
    "If you have to take this, try and get Madame Koundi -- she's a good teacher and a kind person. This class is a lot of work, and especially towards the end of the semester, the amount of reading that you have to do piles up. It's not terribly difficult to get an A-, although it's a bit harder to get an A, because you need a 94 and that leaves very little room for error. We had four midterms throughout the semester, and our lowest score was dropped. Midterms generally consisted of grammar exercises, oral responses, and \"identifications\" in which you listened to a quote from one of the readings and had to determine which character was speaking. Overall, a pretty good class, but not a trivial amount of work.",
    "French 140 is a 4th semester level class of French, so the class focuses on readings, grammar and some vocabulary. There are also several written papers, and exercises to be done every day. I would recommend 140 to any student placed into it, or who took 130.",
    "I would definitely recommend 04 130 to another kid. I think it was a great way to get much better at both writing and speaking and it was also a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are looking to fill the language requirement. It's not too challenging (simple grammar topics + a number of books), while still being beneficial for your french. Meeting five times a week is rough, but on the bright side, you only have to do it for one semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class with Madame Koundi.",
    "If you are serious about French, it is a must take.",
    "A strong language class that addresses writing and listening very well, and speaking, if you put effort into participation in class. I would definitely recommend it."
