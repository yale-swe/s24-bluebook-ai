   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you can get in (consistently showing up to the second class will help, since people always drop it after doing the first reading). It's an important subject, and Faragher knows what he's talking about and gives really insightful thoughts about the readings and events in general during class. The reading's a quite heavy (we read 10 books), but necessary and very interesting and rewarding to do. But if you're really bogged down with other work, skimping a little here or there is all right, too, I guess. S*** happens. You don't have to be a humanities person to enjoy the course. I'm premed, and this has almost nothing to do with what I'm pursuing, but it really opens up your perspectives on the violence problem in America, why that is, and what we can do about. Plus, Faragher's a great guy. He really cares about freshmen and is a great resource to talk to about almost anything. Highlight of my freshman fall, basically.",
    "No. Take a freshman seminar that is a SEMINAR.",
    "SERIOUSLY TAKE THIS CLASS. JMF is amazing. The class is structured really well with the sessions divided between lectures and discussion. I really liked all the material studied, too - though some of the reading is tough to get through because it's depressing and violent, it's really, really important stuff to study. (The reading is also intensive, but you'll learn to get by by skimming.) JMF presents a lot interesting ideas and theories on all the reading to emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. This class definitely made me want to be an American Studies major and definitely was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "It is a comprehensive look at violence in the history and culture of America as well as theories behind the causes of violence. I would recommend it only if the student is okay without taking away a lot of answers.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to fellow students. There are few other courses you can take during your freshman year that will allow you to discuss and write about such an important subject with such a knowledgable professor.",
    "We studied the themes of violence and justice through an interdisciplinary approach. The three units of the course cover social science, history, and culture, and I enjoyed the readings for each unit.I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Yes. If you get selected into this seminar, you should definitely take it. There is a lot of reading, and three papers, but the class is so worth the work you put in. You learn a lot and develop as a writer.",
    "Violence and justice is a crucial part of American history, but most Americans are not aware of the influence it has had on our nation's past. Students learn about the topic through reading books and then the class discussions answer some questions while raising more general questions about the American character. Tough workload, but great professor and interesting topic so it's a must take.",
    "The class provides a fascinating, interdisciplinary exploration of the issue of violence and justice in America. If you are at all interested in violence, justice, or American history, you should take this class. It involves a lot of writing which can be annoying for some people but I felt that it was mostly helpful and manageable. Professor Faragher is also excellent and passionate about the subject matter.",
    "Excellent class! A comprehensive overview of a vital question in America today and he is a truly amazing professor, and I want to take every class he offers! He is engaging and provides stimulating topics to co",
    "This course provides a great introduction to interdisciplinary studies and different methodologies. By analyzing the social, historical, and cultural background behind America's violent tendencies, you will gain a much deeper understanding of culture, human nature, and social patterns. Readings are engaging, insightful, and intellectually stimulating. Although some parts can be a bit dry, there was not one book that I didn't enjoy after reading it through. The readings were very well chosen and were my favorite aspect of the course. Lectures are pretty good and discussions are very interesting. The workload is manageable if you start readings and essays ahead of time. I strongly recommend this course because it will change the way you think and see the world. The ideas that you will be exposed to are insightful and profound.",
    "I would say that the class is something you should take if you are very interested in the subject. It's not a perfect class, but if you are going to find readings about violence fascinating, no matter what, it's for you."
