   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures in this course were entirely useless as the exams focused on rote memorization of the slides. The first midterm felt like something I might receive in high school. Like, \"list all things necessary for evolution to occur\" and stuff like that. This course also seemed like a mixture of entirely unrelated material. One lecture we talked about photosynthesis and cellular respiration, in another we talked about the Loop of Henle, and in another we talked about bryophytes. Also, for students reading this evaluation who are considering taking a course by Prum, please SPEAK UP. It really irritated me when students mumbled, didn't enunciate clearly, or didn't project their questions when WE ALL KNEW PRUM HAS A HARD TIME HEARING. I was annoyed listening to my peers, so when you ask questions, please speak loudly and clearly! (I can only imagine how frustrated Prum must have felt)",
    "Professor Prum was very engaging and I always enjoyed coming to class.",
    "too much information in a short amount of time",
    "Strength: you will have to learn stuff to do the tests so that knowledge gets in your noggin somehow. The papers for DS are engaging. Sam Lin is the only thing holding this course together. Weakness: most disorganized lectures, boring, homework doesn't help with understanding material and the paper is BS waste of time, Prum is MEAN on piazza, piazza is a dark, dark place",
    "The lecture is so dull. Smaller classes! Samantha Lin is the greatest strength to this course.",
    "The novelty of this class is its strength. From the first class that focuses on philosophy to sexual selection lectures to evolutionary medicine, the topics in this class are new and are improved by learning them from Professor Prum in particular. However, since there was so much breadth, it was hard to know how much depth we were also expected to know. Studying for the final was kinda a disaster. There is a lot of material in the slides, ranging from chemical mechanisms to philosophy terms to many (many) phylogenies. It was hard to know what we needed to know and what should be memorized. I wish this section of bio had the same term sheets and key concepts as other sections.",
    "This class was just pure memorization (which is a struggle for non-photographic-memory-Yale students!). I'd feel like it'd be better to focus on the main concepts rather than memorize animals, fungi, and plants that I will never remember after this class...",
    "It is fairly engaging, but there is a lot of material and much of it is just memorization which could be improved.",
    "strengths- prof Lin, teaching team weakness- doesn't go beyond memorization; hard to see practical application",
    "There was no consistency with the final and midterm, and it was difficult to determine what information was needed and what was unncessary.",
    "some of the course material felt interesting while other parts felt like they were just being thrown in for no real reason. For example, a lot of the material about human anatomy and physiology and also photosynthesis just felt like memorization for the sake of memorization, and I also noticed that all of the figures for such lectures were taken straight from my high school AP bio textbook. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but I felt like some topics were not in the areas of the profs expertise or interest, and there was a pretty big difference between these more generic lectures and the ones that I could tell the prof really liked to teach about. It also felt like these parts didn't fit into the 104 module that well and might have been more relevant in other bio modules earlier.",
    "I think that the course was overall structured pretty well - the content had a clear flow and was mostly interesting (even if you're a premed with no real interest in evolutionary bio). Sam is absolutely fantastic - a great teacher, provides all the materials and resources you need to thrive. Professor Prum was an interesting professor. He is a very funny guy and was especially engaged with the material when we started to go over birds and feathers. As for weaknesses, there was a lack of clarity about the course expectations - namely, what we were expected to know. There is a lot of details in EB (particularly the phylogenies) so knowing how to effectively focus on and learn the material would have been very helpful. Additionally, the professor was sometimes a bit inconsistent (sometimes was not as patient).",
    "Prums theories are one of the strengths of this course. He describes different debates and philosophies that are at the core of evolutionary biology, which makes the class much more interesting. The weakness of this course is how much it relies on rote memorization. The class would be better if it focused more on understanding theories and patterns, rather than memorizing names of clades and details of definitions.",
    "The course was memorization heavily, and there were so many different topics thrown in that there seemed to be no cohesive organization. I think it would be more effective to focus more on large concepts and less on small specific examples.",
    "Strength: not much work compared to the other BIOL 100 modules Weakness: not much feedback on assignments or questions",
    "Strengths - well organized Weakness - sped through content",
    "The tests and grading are a pretty substantial issue. I asked for a regrade on something that was clearly correct and got it back with the response this is what the professor said instead of any reasonable justification. Tests focus heavily on memorizing nonsense information that nobody is going to remember a month from now. Its just objectively not the way biology should be taught. If tests were based on concepts and ideas more, this might be a solid class. There was a question on piazza once that actually hit at an interesting feature of biology, and I tried to respond to it saying that its a complex subject but heres generally whats going on. The instructors then responded basically just memorize this incorrect value. Instead or fostering an appreciation for the complexity and beauty of biological systems, they want you to memorize incorrect and useless information.",
    "The strengths of the course were the TAs and some of the lectures. The weaknesses were the exam and problem set structure. This course could be improved by having weekly quizzes instead of 2 exams or having problem sets that reflect the material on the exams so that we know what to expect on the finals.",
    "Strengths are how fascinating the content was. Weakness is, sometimes, it felt like material was being zoomed through and we spent a lot of time talking about some topics that ended up not being very important.",
    "Information is just dumped onto you and you're expected to memorize any and all details. It's more of a guessing game of what information you think will be on the exams.",
    "This was a course about memorization more than it was learning. The midterm and final asked us to regurgitate facts. There were no analytical questions.",
    "The lectures were very long and but some where interesting If you like animals",
    "Strengths: none in particular Weaknesses: Not a fan of how teaching fellows are the ones who grade all of our work - pure luck with TA's will completely make or break your grade.",
    "A ton of material and memorization",
    "We focused way too much on the anatomy of certain things like bird feathers. It would be such a better course if we could apply the information we learned rather than just regurgitating information on tests (that were mostly memorization).",
    "Strengths: The problem sets were helpful and clear. Areas of improvement: The writing assignments were difficult to complete as they did not have a \"greater impact.\" Also, it would be nice to see some alternative theories to the origin of life, beyond the \"primordial soup\" model. A lot of theories were taught, but it was not emphasized enough that they are theories and not fact.",
    "Strengths: Professor Prum's interest in this field is infectious, and you it's easy to become interested in the material Weaknesses: some of the lectures were all over the place, and it wasn't always clear what content was going to be tested and what Prof Prum was talking about for the sake of it. This made studying for the exams quite cumbersome since the amount of slides covered in a given lecture is huge. The writing assignment also seems kind of useless",
    "Professor Prum is a very passionate professor, and his lectures don't feel like he's only reciting facts from the slides. The class is pretty straightforward, and the writing assignment is open enough to be tailored to students interests. At times it feels like the class is really only about memorization, but that may just be the nature of the subject at an introductory level.",
    "LEcture slides were fine, lecturer eh - it was super hard to pay attention and follow just because it was so boring and some concepts were made unnecessarily complicated",
    "I loved the homework assignments and most of the lecture material! I think it would be cool if we didn't just talk about things that the professor did research into, but got a more comprehensive and balanced view.",
    "Be more impartial-spend most time teaching\/explaining accepted theory, spending more time teaching the medical evolution stuff.",
    "Some lectures were very interesting but we learned a lot of minor details such as a lot about phylogenies that weren't necessary by the end. The weighting of the grading puts a lot more weight on the final. The slides were more disorganized than they needed to be but still good.",
    "The lectures were engaging. The course could be improved by making it more clear what material is important to know and what material was presented simply because it was interesting.",
    "it was fine.",
    "Strengths - learned a lot of information, section (especially the peabody tour) was interesting Weaknesses - hard to tell which information was important and which was not, learned a lot of seemingly unrelated facts",
    "Strengths: good content. Weaknesses: few assignments to enforce learning",
    "Strengths: forcing pre-meds to know the principles that underlie biology Weaknesses: several semesters of information crammed into one half of a semester.",
    "too much talk about philosophy\/history of the study of evolution itself; slides can be VERY overwhelming sometimes (except for the very last lecture; it was the simplest)",
    "A lot of information covered in lecture, maybe too broad.",
    "Strength: Professor is great, really cares deeply about the subject Weakness: Lots of rote memorization. Some of the information seemed heavily biased towards the professor's research\/personal views.",
    "Lots of memorization, maybe implement more conceptual knowledge",
    "Weaknesses: extremely fast-paced lecturing in second half of the course, huge amount of info to know for the final as opposed to the relatively chill midterm, had to essentially learn and practice tree of life on our own. But I do understand the importance of knowing the tree of life in a class like this. Prum also was not the most receptive to student questions during review sessions. Strengths: Prof. Prum actually places evolutionary science in context with history, which introduced interesting conversations about how science evolves with social ideas. And you get to learn about evolutionary medicine a bit in the last lecture which really changed the way I think about how to battle disease (by using less hand sanitizer, for instance).",
    "Strengths: interesting material taught pretty well, Richard Prum had a lot of interesting and passionate takes on the material, which introduced us to the academic conversation in evolutionary biology Weaknesses: final exam seemed to test rote memorization more than general concepts, ton of information --not exactly clear what is important to know",
    "104 was a fine course by itself like any of the other classes in the BIOL sequence however I have found that the material taught and emphasized across the biology sequence varies widely across different teachers and semester. This seems somewhat problematic especially when I compare it to other introductory course I have taken here. I feel like this course could be aided by being coordinated with other biology sequence teachers, I know every teacher has their own style but my room mates 101-102 experience has covered completely different material than mine so far additionally students who took 103-104 a semester before I did had very different material emphasized.",
    "A weakness of the course is that there is so much information on the lecture slides, there are about 80-100 slides per lecture. It is usually unclear as to what the professor will be testing on the exam due to the large amount of seemingly unnecessary information he puts on the lectures slides, so it does take a lot of time to study everything.",
    "Lecture is both very slow and very fast. I barely took notes because the slides go by very fast but there is so much information in each lecture. There is no direction about how much we actually have to know, so I wish that was more clearly expressed. I was able to do well solely because I memorized a lot, but I have already forgotten much of it.",
    "I thought that less material would be better, so we can really hone in on certain material.",
    "strengths: Enrichment, content is interesting weaknesses: memorization",
    "Fun content, improved by more clear instructions on what information is necessary to know",
    "I think that there should be more of the stuff we started talking about at the end such as the human bipedalism and virus stuff. I thought most of the course was fine but I did not like the stuff about bird feather development. I also dont like how prum taught us non consensus biology and basically just presented his book and paper to us",
    "Strengths: lots of resources if you need them, lecture slides are clear Weaknesses: Clearer guidance on what knowledge is needed for exams (maybe through greater use of red stars on slides). Also it seems that we were given only one in depth perspective on the sexual selection\/beauty, which I understand was Prum's view but it would be good to know what other perspectives are and what most biologists think of them. Prum tends to talk about his work a lot, so be ready for lots of birds, feathers, and beauty for the sake of beauty. Sometimes he gets irritated easily.",
    "Strengths: professors Weakness: review sessions, tests",
    "It was unclear what information resented in the course was examinable and important.",
    "Strengths: I really liked the content of the class. The course definitely focused more on evolutionary biology than ecology, but it was interesting to learn the different concepts of evolution and how they related to each other. Enrichment definitely helped. Weaknesses: I didn't like that the professor was biased in teaching in the course. He taught his own thoughts, and the course wasn't very structured or organized in how concepts led to other concepts.",
    "Very well organized and great to facilitate student learning.",
    "There was so much useless information that we had to memorize for the tests.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot about phylogenies Weaknesses: centered too much around memorization",
    "I thought some lectures were really interesting and I liked the homework assignment (writing about a specific clade of interest). I think a weakness was that there was so much information for students to memorize that lecture seemed a bit boring.",
    "This course is extremely oriented towards memorization rather than conceptual understanding. I would have appreciated it much more if the course could stress more understanding the concepts rather than memorizing names of clades and species, as that seemed futile. Furthermore, the course could use some better structuring and organization of the lectures and focus more on the fundamental concepts introduced at the first half of the semester rather than move quickly past them and go into much more specialized concepts.",
    "Strengths: Interesting and comprehensible course material, enrichment was helpful and accessible Weaknesses: Slightly unfriendly learning environment",
    "material was not interesting to me at all -- professor did not connect lecture to the big picture of why its necessary to study this stuff until the very last lecture. the midterm was also very early into the course, so I felt if could have been later so that there would be more stuff covered for that exam and less stuff for the final. the course had an extreme amount of content, a lot of which (like all this stuff on birds) did not need to be included for a general overview of ecology and evolutionary biology. enrichment was very good and helpful though.",
    "Professor Lin and enrichment were the best part about the Bio modules.",
    "I found a lot of the material to be quite engaging, but the examinations were brute memorization that involved very little critical thinking. If there was any way to test our understanding of the material as well as have us actually think on the exams that would be good.",
    "This course is overall very well taught and organized - both Professor Prum and Professor Lin were phenomenal. My one difficulty with the course is that there were only two homeworks, and then the rest of the time was dedicated to a research paper. While it was an interesting assignment, I didn't find the largest connection to the course and had trouble keeping up with the material when there were no homeworks or quizzes related to the material.",
    "This class was, by nature, a lot of memorization. A strength was that it covered a lot of material and was mainly engaging. A weakness was that it sometimes forced us to memorize irrelevant information, or expected us to know things that weren't really covered in class.",
    "This course had a lot of material, so the class could have moved at a slower pace. However, the material was interesting, and the professor was definitely excited to teach.",
    "Strengths: slides used in lecture were effective and provided good visuals to go along with each topic; attending lecture was extremely interesting and engaging because concepts were explained very well; discussion sections were used to go over and break down the information in scientific papers, which was really helpful because it helped me fully understand what I was reading; and the writing assignment was really fun because it gave us the opportunity to explore the evolution of a trait of our choosing in a specific clade! Weaknesses: only thing I can think of is the fact that we spent half a lecture on the evolution and development of the feather. I know Professor Prum specializes in ornithology, and I did appreciate learning about this, but for future classes I think less time should be devoted to this topic, as it probably is not super relevant to most people's future fields of study. Probably best reserved specifically for ornithology classes!",
    "I really liked the topics. At some points it was a bit confusing. The biggest weakness was that there was so much memorizing and not that much applying what weve learned.",
    "It was difficult to study for the exams because we had no quizzes, practice exams, practice problems, etc. that could be used as study aids. There was an abundance of information presented in lecture, and while we were not required to know all of it, what was required was often unclear. This lead to feeling unprepared for the exams and dissatisfied with what I learned from the course.",
    "Interesting material but tries to cover too much information in the time given.",
    "Good organization and focus on addressing some of the most active fields of research in ecology today. Gave me a good idea of the field and advanced my understanding about how to think about the development and organization of life on earth. Something about this course (and all of the intro bio courses for that matter) made me wish it focused less on breadth and more depth. I feel like we covered so much material, but as a result everything we learned was very surface-level, and thus less concept and more memorization heavy. I think I feel this way partly because of the way the homework was structured. I wish we were given regular problem sets (or something like that) to help reinforce concepts we had learned in lecture. I felt like I retained very little from lecture, and to prepare for exams, I would try to cram as much information in my head about each slide before the exam, and soon forget everything after the exam. I already feel like I forgot a lot from the course, and it has only been a week or so. Any way to force students to apply the concepts they are learning from lecture at a steady rate throughout the course would make the course more effective and worth their while. Otherwise the bio intro courses just feel like a ton of rote-memorization that is soon forgotten thereafter. This comment goes for all the intro bio courses except for Biol 102, where I thought the homework was well aligned with the lectures and helped me remember concepts learned in lecture.",
    "Release of lecture slides, structure of tests, discussion section all good. Organization of material in the course was not very coherent, but that might be because we had to to photosynthesis and cellular respiration which had somehow not been covered yet.",
    "Strengths: first half of material interesting and cohesive Weakness: instructor sometimes rude, second half material extremely disjointed, unclear what was going to be tested for final",
    "I did not think lectures of this course were useful at all. The professor seemed to simply throw out large quantities of factual information so that it was difficult to understand the main takeaways.",
    "The strengths are that it covers some interesting topics and the instructors make a conscious effort to connect the material back to the real world and the ways in which we can deepen our understanding with the content being presented. The weakness is really the lack of specificity regarding the material that we are required to know for the course assignments and all. Tangents we took made it harder for some to get a real grasp on what we're supposed to be taking away at times.",
    "I would have enjoyed if this course got more into the weeds of the mechanics and math models of ecology and evolutionary biology. The broad overview and the amount of time we spent on phylogeny and life history was less interesting.",
    "The lectures have a lot of extra material that is not tested on.",
    "The strengths of this course was the amazing teachings of Dr. Richard Prum, and the way he presented his knowledge about ecological and evolutionary topics. This course piqued my interest in ecology and evolutionary biology, and made me realize that this was my favorite branch of biology, and even of science. However, a weakness for me was the lack of meeting my expectation, which would be learning and memorizing phylogenies and different clades. However, I think it was beneficial because it made me focus more on the general concepts rather than the specific clades.",
    "Slides were way too long the entire semester without any real substance a lot of the time. Refine them and have direction that is more concrete. This would help people from not falling asleep every lecture.",
    "great",
    "I think this course was taught by a professor who doesn't really care much about it. It is clear that Prof Prum is a very talented scientist and was frustrated by having to teach an introductory course. I think the slides were a really good part of the class, but lots of other parts of the class were frustrated. I think the amount of content covered in the second half of the course was overwhelming. I think the distribution of content was poorly done.",
    "The course stresses memorization with opaque guidance as to what the students need to know. In fact, a whole problem on the final exam was promised not to be tested but was anyway.",
    "This course consisted entirely of a professor talking as fast as he could to relay as much information as possible for an hour and a half straight twice a week. It was obvious that he was enthusiastic about the subject matter, but the course was not at all designed to facilitate actual learning. I don't know anything about the actual real world applications of the concepts we MEMORIZED. Not learned. Memorized. In the first powerpoint it literally says \"What do you need to know in this course? Basically everything I say.\" For such a large lecture with a professor that can't hear us when we speak from across the room and who barely has time to stop for questions anyway, that is ridiculous. If I hadn't been able to take enrichment, I would have been completely lost. This is in reference to Professor Prum.",
    "The course was engaging as it used a lot of real life examples to understand that significance of what we were learning. There was a lot of emphasis on memorisation, however, instead of conceptual understanding.",
    "The course gave a very solid overview of the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, as it is supposed to, and generally went into manageable levels of detail in various areas of study, namely ecology, evolution (sexual selection, genetic drift, etc.), phylogenetics, etc.",
    "The course claims to deal with ecology and evolutionary biology, but the ecological component of the course was limited to one lecture.",
    "Strengths --> samantha lin weaknesses --> mostly memorization"

   "comments": [
    "Only take this course if you have to.",
    "Yes because like the rest of the bio sequence it is a good introductory course and shows the importance of understanding evolution.",
    "No, only if it is a pre-req.",
    "Not unless you have to take it, unless Prum isn't teaching, then proceed w caution",
    "It's the last part of the bio sequence! It's new, it's novel, it's worth taking probably because you have to but also because it focuses on totally new things from the previous. It has some of the same problems as the previous intro bios - assumptions about what you know, dense lectures, confusion about what you need to know - but also unique strengths. The professor cares a lot about what he's teaching (especially towards the end of the course).",
    "Well if you're in BIOL you have to take it. I'd recommend to take it with Near, if possible. And invest in quizlet or flashcards because you're gonna whip out that bad boy when finals come around. But if you're taking it with Prum (if he's teaching it, here are some pointers): Where do I even start with this professor? I thought he was super nice during the first class, but then I realized he's a super arrogant scientist (I mean, which is warranted, considering he's a MacArthur Fellow AND won a Pulitzer Prize and God knows what else) who doesn't make his students feel good about themselves. First, he's not the best at explaining things. I often found myself very confused after some slides (usually because he went over them so quickly) and had to refer to Professor Lin or someone else for help. Also, why teach almost 100 slides each lecture? That's a lot of content, and it made the final pretty rough in terms of memorization. Second, he makes students feel horrible. I experienced it firsthand. During a midterm review session, he said, \"Come with ANY questions, because I won't be leading the review, you are.\" So that made me comfortable enough to ask a question, and he totally dismissed it. As well as other questions that he probably deemed weren't \"important.\" If you're going to do that, then WHY tell students they can ask ANY question? Because clearly, they can't. Also, I don't think the man knows how Piazza works. When someone asked a question, he sometimes would answer it by not even answering it. My favorite quotes from his answers to piazza questions: \"That's too much to write down.\" \"Also, try to READ THE BOOK!\" \"Read the slides again. Then ask a question.\" The last two crack me up because he said that we never have to read the book (exam will only test the knowledge in the slides) while you can clearly detect the snark in the last quote. Also, what if these people genuinely did not understand the concepts? Sometimes I didn't understand the concepts, even if I attempted my best to understand it by READING THE BOOK or looking at the slides for the 100th time. He shouldn't think that these questions are formed because we're lazy to find the answer. If anything, we're desperate enough to post a question on Piazza! Hopefully, you take the class with anyone else but him.",
    "This is a necessary bio sequence course but was probably my least favorite of the sequence. That is not to say it is terrible, just not my thing.",
    "No, unless it's required",
    "yes, because professor prum was a good teacher and had very interesting and insightful lectures about the topics that he is clearly more interested in. however some modifications in the course material might be nice especially some of the later lectures about physiology. this class isn't too hard, just a lot of memorization, and its surprisingly satisfying to just know the names of various clades and organisms off the top of your head and know how they are related.",
    "If you have to take this course, it's going to be interesting. Especially with Prum, the lectures are pretty engaging, even if there is a lot of content to learn. If you are thinking of taking this class because you're interested in evolutionary bio, I think it is a nice first introduction to the subject. It features a nice overview, the support from Sam is fantastic, and the information (especially the evolutionary medicine lecture) is interesting and applicable.",
    "If you have to take bio 104, take it with Professor Prum!",
    "Only if you have to. Interesting stuff but would rather take a class focused on one aspect of ecology or evolutionary biology.",
    "Yes. Bio 104 is a very engaging Course.",
    "Most likely this is a requirement that you have to take if you've made it to 104, however this class is very different from the rest of the intro bio sequence courses. In my honest opinion, of the sequence this was by far my least favorite. I think that largely it was the disconnect between expectations of students to teach themselves such large volumes of slides to nitty gritty details, and the lack of time that can be feasibly dedicated to one of five classes at Yale in a semester. Everyone told me that this class would be a lot of memorization unlike 101-103, but the lack of direction in even giving emphasizes to topics was hard to follow. For example, in a 75 minute class a 100 slide lecture may seem appropriate if there is consideration of pacing. However, at least 3 times this quarter we spent 60 minutes on the first 30-40 slides and then blaze right through the remaining slides in the last 15 minutes of class. I understand that some topics warrant more emphasize than others and students should be expected to spend time with the material outside of class, but essentially teaching yourself at least 40 slides with just graphs and pictures of phylogenies or organisms is expecting a bit too much in my opinion. This class was probably the first that I posted more than 2 questions on Piazza especially before the midterm and finals in an attempt to get a better explanation than the book alone could provide or peer tutors and to my dismay, some responses from the professor really felt as if students should be ashamed for asking a question (\"Read the slide again then ask a question\") In which I'm sure a student would have read the slide before posting the question it referred to. I appreciated Professor Prum's insight into some of the scientific conflicts surrounding evolutionary topics like sexual selection and his genuine love for teaching ornithology (birds really do have a diverse and unique development\/evolutionary history!!), but most of the time I felt as if I couldn't decipher what the point was of some topics\/to what level of detail I would need to memorize down to. This was frustrating to me and a few other students that I spoke with, mainly because I didn't feel like I would be able to apply the vast majority of the information I learned in the class to anything outside of Bio 104. Despite the class having a decently high midterm average score, I still have some reservation about it. In all I recommend this course to those with a general interest in ecology and evolution (you're most likely somewhere in this field already) Personally, I love evolutionary medicine so much (the 6th section paper on evolution of Cancer was amazing!!) that I almost considered changing my major going into 104, but the aspect of applying evolution to topics outside of a historical perspective was not really discussed much. Still a really great class in all regards!",
    "Its obviously required.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have to do it for a major or other requirement.",
    "Yes! If you are a prospective EEB major, you definitely should take this class and see if you love it! It really all starts from the Tree of Life we are introduced to in this class.",
    "The information is very interesting, but I didn't really enjoy the course as much as I hoped I would. It's a lot of memorization",
    "Only if necessary as it involved solely memorization.",
    "only if you need to",
    "If you don't have to take this class, there is no reason to.",
    "only if required or you love phylogenies",
    "Not unless they have to take it.",
    "Yes. It was a great introduction to evolution and ecology.",
    "I would not recommend this to anyone unless they needed 104 as a pre-requisite for something.",
    "You're taking it because you have to - at this point, there's no point in not taking it if you've already taken 101-103. It's one of the better ones",
    "No, I do not think ecology and evolutionary bio should be part of the intro bio sequence",
    "I think it's an inherently interesting subject, and even people who aren't trying to be ecologists could enjoy it. Professor Prum is definitely a great professor to take it with. He really cares about the material and making himself accessible.",
    "youre probably only taking this cause you have to - other than that, if you placed out then definitely do not take it if you have Prum no offense to him",
    "Yeah, actually it was probably the most interesting of the bio sequence courses.",
    "Not really, there was way too much information in this course. Although it was interesting at times, it was overwhelming and the teachers did not make clear the information we had to know. When asking questions on Piazza we would receive rude responses from Prof. Prum. He also taught us his theory of evolution and did make it super clear that this is not really an accepted theory of sexual selection. I also though there was no unity in the curriculum. I did think the last lecture was really cool on medical evolution and I though learning anatomy was also cool.",
    "It's interesting enough. I don't regret taking the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to student who is interested in evolutionary biology.",
    "sure.",
    "Yes, it's a good intro to E&EB",
    "Required for pre-med and bio majors. Would not recommend for people who want to learn about biology on the side.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "you will get a lot of Prum's takes on what should be taught in biology but that may be enjoyable i guess",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if it is required for pre-med\/your major",
    "I would recommend this course if you actually enjoy the subject matter and are comfortable with having to memorization information for exams.",
    "Only if recommended",
    "you are likely taking this course because you have to, but nevertheless would recommend biol 104 anyway! prum's topics on female autonomy\/mate choice, as well as darwinian (beauty is subjective, we love for love) vs wallacean (beauty is encoded utility, we love to further what's best for society) theories of sexual\/natural selection, were really cool to learn because they allowed me to see how evolution of even evolutionary theory can bring science closer to modern social beliefs and inclusivity. plus the tree of life isn't terribly hard to learn so don't worry! class is on the more manageable side compared to other intro biol modules.",
    "No, not unless you need to take it or unless you really care about ecology and evolution.",
    "If you need to take it for biology sequence requirement or you are particularly interested in evolutionary\/ecological biology.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they needed it to complete a requirement. Although I would say that it is easier than Bio 101 and 102, there are other funner science courses to be taking if you are looking for a science credit.",
    "Not unless required.",
    "You have to take it for MCDB etc. It does give a cool overview, so a nice class to look back on, but I barely used any critical thinking skills which is something I would expect from a Yale course.",
    "No",
    "Yes, but only if it is required or if you are really really interested in evolutionary biology or ecology.",
    "Yes, very interesting. Good introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology",
    "Yeah, in the Introductory bio sequence so mandatory but one of the more fun courses in the sequenc",
    "No but I know you have to take for the bio sequence",
    "Yes, the topics covered are essential for a thorough understanding of biology. I gained a bigger picture of the natural world.",
    "Yes, if you're required to take it.",
    "Questions on both the midterm and the final will ask you to define something brought up once on slide 112 out of 170.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you don't know if E&EB is for you. I would also recommend this course for everyone who didn't have a hot time taking BIOL101\/102\/103. This is a refreshing break from things microscopic, and how species influence each other on the macroscopic level.",
    "Yes, a great intro course of ecology and evolution of all of life.",
    "If you're taking this course, it's because you have to.",
    "With Prum, only if you needed to take it.",
    "I would recommend because it gives you a basis of understanding how many species are interconnected. Also, this class is needed for many science majors and it is a pre-med requirement.",
    "Most of the students that take this course need to do so, and so there is no point in me recommending it or not. Nonetheless, if one is interested in learning the fundamentals of evolutionary biology and ecology this class definitely does the trick.",
    "I would because it is informative and challenging",
    "no, I did not like it, there is too much content and its not interesting, the professor is not that good",
    "I enjoyed the class, and I didn't find the overall memorization to be too specific so I enjoyed the material.",
    "Yes, I think this is a very well taught and interesting course. Professor Prum and Professor Lin do an excellent job!",
    "Only if you need bio for your major. Otherwise it's not worth the time and energy and struggle.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "Yes, absolutely! If you are interested in evolutionary bio, ecology, or just bio in general, this is an amazing class to take with Professor Prum! I really thought that he was an awesome lecturer, and I learned so many things that are super relevant to our lives today! Really interesting material, and definitely more thought-provoking than the other courses in the intro bio sequence. You learn that history and culture really have a huge influence on the development and evolution of scientific fields!",
    "Yea I would. It was interesting but a lot of memorizing.",
    "Not really. I find the curriculum of all the intro bio courses to be very surface level. I wish they focused less on covering a ton of material and more on ensuring students understand a few areas in depth.",
    "Being able to explore a phylogeny in one of the papers was fun. The historical perspectives on darwin\/wallace, along with Prum's insistence about sexual selection being a 5th type mode of evolution was entertaining. Most of the ideas in this course are learned through memorization however.",
    "No. Lectures were dry and contained tons of material. Class often went too fast and material very uninteresting",
    "Pretty good basic introduction to evolutionary bio and other stuff. Definitely found this to be the most engaging course in the bio sequence",
    "Absolutely, necessary for pre-med\/life sciences major requirements, but also a useful look into ecology and evolution. The class doesn't have regular or heavy assessments either, no surprises.",
    "The content is not uninteresting, but I didn't feel like I got much more than I got in high school. So if interested, take a higher level E&EB course.",
    "If they need to get through the bio sequence for a bio major or pre-med.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This has been my favorite science course I have taken at Yale, especially since I have been waiting to take this course since my first year! I think this course should be taken by everyone, since it is quite important to all areas of life: research of ecology and phylogeny (of course), but also chemistry (the ways drugs can be substrates to an enzyme found in many different animals and the phylogeny of biochemical molecules, such as fluorescent proteins) and political science (the ways senators and representatives pass bills, especially in this environmental age, require the knowledge of evolutionary biology and ecology because we need to maintain biodiversity). This course should be taken by every student: it is fundamental to our knowledge of all aspects of this world!",
    "No. Many people will have no choice, but this is not a course to take for fun or on a whim.",
    "no",
    "No, but since it is a required course many of us have to take it. I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun.",
    "No, not unless it's required.",
    "No. If you're genuinely interested in EEB, this course will change your mind.",
    "Not unless it's required for their major because otherwise, the workload wouldn't be worth it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is the easiest out of the intro BIOL sequence, but also the most immediately applicable to most people outside of the sciences. The material is interesting and valuable.",
    "I would recommend this! Of course, the bulk of students taking the introductory biology sequence are taking it to fulfill major requirements, but generally I thought this course was well-taught in a very engaging manner. Prof. Prum does a great job of lecturing with a relatively conversational feel that keeps you engaged and interested in the subjects at hand. This semester was the first semester Prof. Prum taught so there were some pacing issues at times, but overall it was decently organized and covered what I consider to be the main concepts that make up the foundation of the field.",
    "I would probably recommend this course if the student is interested in evolutionary biology, but if they are not, the class will be dull for them.",
    "Yeah, it was all about memorization so as long as you don't wait for the day before the exam to learn the information, you will be fine"
