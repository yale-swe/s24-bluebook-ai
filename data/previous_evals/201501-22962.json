    "I would definitely recommend Just Was Theory to another student. The topic is very specific, but if you are at least slightly interested in the morality of war, this is an amazing class. The reading assignments were great, and so was the class discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in international human rights and humanitarian law, political science, international relations, legal philosophy, social theory, etc., etc.. I really enjoyed the topic of just war theory -- jus ad bellum, jus in bello, and jus post bellum. If you are interested in whether it is meaningful to talk about a just basis for war and whether and how this constrains actors during wartime, then you should definitely take this course."

   "comments": [
    "I took the course as a senior undergraduate philosophy major. I had some knowledge of just war theory before walking into this class, but this course definitely provided me with a very strong foundation on the major issues and works of just war theory. Most importantly, there was a very good balance between more \"canonical\" pieces, purely theoretical pieces, and articles on pressing contemporary issues (such as drones or targeted killings). I really enjoyed the class.",
    "It definitely gave me direction for my senior thesis, which will be on questions of sovereignty. It also exposed me to some of the strongest literature that I've seen in the field.",
    "I am very interested in developing a philosophical foundation for international law, so this course is vital to that effort."
