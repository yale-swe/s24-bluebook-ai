    "Nice broad overview of oceanography with a solid introduction to understanding the primary literature.",
    "I thought this was a really good introductory course on biological oceanography. We covered a lot of material, and while much of it was in quite a bit of detail, I never felt that it was overwhelming. We started with an overview of physical processes, which was really helpful in understanding how the biological stuff happens in the ocean. The rest was a wash of everything from fisheries ecology to acidification to marine conservation. I felt like I came out of this class with a lot of knowledge.",
    "I learned a lot about ocean systems as systems, with many interacting elements (versus just a bunch of self-contained organisms).",
    "I learnt a lot about marine biology , protection and the complexity of the marine ecosystem."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - interesting, great curriculum, good blend of assignments, very reasonable exams, daily reading summary setup was a good idea Weaknesses - lectures were a little dry, not much motivation to do readings",
    "I actually thought this course was really well-balanced. The few things I would comment on would be things that I could've fixed by visiting office hours or even sending emails earlier. This would be specifically in relation to the reading summary and blog post assignments, since I personally could have benefited from talking things through with Mary Beth in a more timely fashion.",
    "The field trips were great, the content very interesting and the work load manageable although the readings were sometimes quite a lot to manage."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend to an EEB major as a really interesting intro course into a specific field that isnt too hard. I would imagine for students without a biology background\/interest this could be pretty difficult though, if you even manage to get in.",
    "If you're at all interested in marine biology or ocean processes in general, this course is fantastic. I've found that Yale has very few courses that cover oceanography topics or otherwise large-scale climate and ocean topics, but this course does. The workload isn't overwhelming at all, lectures are sometimes not the most engaging but the topics are cool enough to keep you interested, and Mary Beth is an angel.",
    "Yes I absolutely would! The information is very applicable to a lot of other things I think and talk about. Professor Decker is kind and great, and the field trips are a good time.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes it was one of my favourite classes taken at Yale and looks at marine biology from many different perspectives."
