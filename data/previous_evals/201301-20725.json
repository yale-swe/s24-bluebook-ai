   "comments": [
    "Chemistry 556 01 teaches students about the different experimental approaches in order to determine an enzyme's mechanism and a deeper understanding of enzyme mechanisms. I would recommend Chemistry 556 01 to another student because students would not necessarily be exposed to these type of experiments if they did not take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides exposure to an area of research which I would not necessarily be conducting but informs me of possible experiments which can be completed.",
    "Yes it was a good critical thinking class",
    "In summary, chemistry 556 was a challenging highly informative course that focuses strongly on analysis and determination of enzyme rates and mechanisms. I would highly recommend this course to other students, however, a basic knowledge of biochemistry and enzymology is useful for insuring success and adequate understanding of the material. Also, reading the biochemical literature pertaining to these topics is highly recommended both prior to and during this course.",
    "Self-learning is important.No homework assignments due.Trains the ability to read papers and extract info from them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material was useful and Dr. Loria tried to make the class as stress-free as possible.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is very interested in the mathematical and quantitative side, moreso for chemistry students than biology students.",
    "It was a good way to see some more rigorous chemistry in the context of protein science and a good discussion of several practical techniques for understanding catalysis and protein dynamics. The workload is very light but the topics would require some reading and exams require an in-depth and working knowledge of the concepts.",
    "It's a good overview of techniques and concepts regarding enzyme kinetics.",
    "good to know techniques you can use to study mechanisms."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I am more familiar with NMR experiments which can be conducted to determine structures of proteins, especially if a crystal structure is difficult to obtain.",
    "As I eluted to above, although this course was not directly relevant to the type of research I will likely be doing throughout my graduate study, Dr. Loria related the material to broader concepts that apply to all of chemistry and biology. Consequently, this course greatly deepened my knowledge of chemical applications and enzyme mechanisms in both a broad and highly focused manner. I expect that certainly if I do not use material learned in the course throughout my dissertation\/research, I will use the knowledge gained through the course in the rest of my life as a chemical researcher. This was a great course that left me well educated on the topic. Notably, I am now able to understand a great deal more when sitting in on biochemical seminars than I was prior to taking the class.",
    "Everyone in biology works with enzymes at some point, so even if my research does not tightly align with this class, I will use the theory and techniques in my research.",
    "Exposed me to many new quantitative methods in chemical biology, allowing me to consider new possible lines of research.",
    "The course gave a good treatment of several topics in chemistry and protein science, many of which I had not been exposed to in other courses. The rigorous treatment of several chemical principles as well as discussion of relevant examples from the literature was very useful and interesting.",
    "the course gave me a good opportunity to get in touch with physical biology technique, which I may use to study my organometalic project."
