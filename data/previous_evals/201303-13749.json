   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The way we evaluated each other from a mixed class with students from different departments was really useful, and during the mock interview we shared our background and future goal with each other, really inspiring.",
    "Waste of time for people who have had any professional experience. Focus on things that were not of importance to some people. Wish there had been more flexibility in topics that were of personal areas of growth rather than just working on presentation skills. Left knowing just about the same information I knew coming in.",
    "it was very helpful to break into small groups and get individual feedback from different perspectives; it also helped me to analyze others' performance",
    "I thought it was better than I expected it to be, but breakout groups and a variety of optional workshops would have made the process more effective (i.e. for 10-11 you can go to resumes, public speaking, networking, CL etc)I thought all of the outsourced people were great and gave constructive criticism. I especially enjoyed practice interviewing",
    "I found parts of it very useful such as interview coaching and pitch coaching.I did not see the relevance of presentation skills especially since most of the first years are not looking to develop presentation skills but interview\/resume\/pitch skills.This seminar should be reorganized to its target population and what they really need.Additionally, this should NOT be during October recess. This should be before school starts so that students can start networking and looking at internship opportunities, especially for HCM\/HPM students.",
    "Worth doing - received helpful feedback from the coaches",
    "Do think it was helpful, wish it included a resume workshop as well",
    "This was a good seminar and overall helpful. The best part was learning how to create and practice a pitch. The worst parts were networking and the internship search -- both components have a opportunity to be more useful (perhaps by having us practice networking or having us actually look for different internships).Having eight students in a room was a great number. It wasn't too long but it was large enough that we could mix pairings during interviews and pitches.",
    "This course should be optional. Most masters level students have had several internships, written many resumes and cover letters, and interviewed multiple times before this (another alternative: interview applicants to the school in the first place to ensure proper interviewing skills). I learned nothing new from these exercises and they only made me dislike YSPH and this pointless requirement. I definitely did not add anything to the other students' experiences either, which is another reason this course should be optional - so that students who want and need these sessions can benefit from them without negativity from others.The material was remedial and patronizing. If it must be required, at least add some more advanced activities. Finally, this should also not take place over fall break. We desperately needed that time to catch up on work and recover in sleep, not sit in Winslow and complete pointless exercises and worksheets.I am sorry to be blunt, but someone needs to be.",
    "Although sometimes difficult to sit through, much of the information was very helpful and applicable to our upcoming internship search and future careers. The breakout sessions were great, but sometimes overkill with the constant videotaping. Presentations, networking, and public speaking were all VERY helpful topics to cover, especially for introverted\/shy people like me who are uncomfortable with these things.",
    "Very helpful!",
    "The first thing I want to say is that having this course over Fall break is an absolute mistake. Have it before school starts, have it as a supplement, have it almost anywhere else. It was a waste of a Fall break. About half the material was relevant, the other half was pointless. Too much focus on intonation. Would have liked my resume to be reviewed by someone.",
    "I definitely liked all the material I learned in this 3-day course. I very much enjoyed being recorded during my presentation and given evaluations after. However, CVs or resumes were never explained or discussed in great detail. I was expecting to go over my CV with someone.",
    "I wished the seminar would cover more material in resume and cover letter. Also how to draft emails for an informational interview. Maybe it could cover dresscodes for interviews.",
    "I thought that the interactive portion of the seminar was really helpful. The more lecture-based portions less so.",
    "The material was not very relevant and some of the presentation of material was offensive.",
    "This course was nearly useless. The only part that was at all productive was being filmed presenting and then watching the video back. The rest of it was excruciatingly boring corporate bullshit. This course should not be required.",
    "Strength: The fact that there is a professional development component is a strength.Weakness: Professional development doesn't happen in 3 days. There should be a solid option for students who want to continue training. There also needs to be specialized sections for people in different programs.",
    "The course was better than what I expected it would be. The breakout sessions were helpful. What really confused me was getting further feedback about our presentations a month after we finished the seminar. I also felt like the feedback blind sighted me, because it mentioned weaknesses in my presentation that were never brought up in-person. It would have been nice to actually receive this feedback right after the presentation and not a month later.",
    "I wish the training could be muc longer in the future.",
    "I did not find this seminar to be at all helpful. The way in which the material was presented was very strange. I really disliked that we had to be videotaped so many times, and I never understood the point of this. I do not feel like my professional skills improved at all after taking this seminar.",
    "I think that the professional skills seminar was really helpful. I did think, however, that the seminar could have been two days instead of three. I think that some of the lectures lasted longer than they needed to and that the breaks were a little longer than needed. What I did find incredibly helpful were the breakout groups. I believe that the small group exercises really did teach me a lot about myself and gave me a lot more confidence is marketing myself.",
    "I really liked it. The material was relevant and delivered well. I don't think anyone really likes learning about these kind of skills but I thought that the seminar was an effective way to do so.",
    "This is a very useful seminar teaching you how to make public speak and communicate with people professionally.",
    "practical",
    "Excellent opportunity to strengths our professional persona. I learned so much about my presentations skills---my strengths and areas for improvement. These skills will assist us for the rest of our professional career. Many people hated the professional skills seminar, but I really loved it. I obtained many valuable tips which will help me market my brand. I can't think of any improvements. I really loved it.",
    "This was a waste of time and should not have been scheduled during our break. The modules were not useful because the seminar only lasted 3 days. No one can truly improve their speaking skills in 3 days. We only learned about resumes not CVs. The topics covered were ones I had already learned about in college. This seminar was not at all useful if you already passed college.",
    "Should not have been scheduled during the fall break. I would have preferred to have it once a week for multiple weeks so we have adequate time to reflect on the feedback and have time to work on it and practice the presentations. The scheduling of this (3 days in a row, 8-3 each day) was very difficult to keep up with, especially because we were expected to improve upon the previous day's feedback each day.",
    "Very poor! It is a waste of time, and is very insulting. The people who led this seminar are super sexist and racist. I do not think it was tailored to the public health career at all. Might work in finance&consulting, though I hope we are moving away from sexism in all fields.",
    "There were a few things I liked about this seminar: the resume and cover letter sections, the talk on internships, and the interview practice. However, the sections about networking, public speaking, and presentation practice seemed somewhat contrived and artificial. Rather than having each of us develop our natural personalities when speaking and play to our character strengths, it seemed as if the instructors were prescribing a very stilted approach to all career scenarios, regardless of whether we felt comfortable with the presentation style or not.Of the recorded sessions, the interview section was by far the most helpful. Having to make\/memorize a presentation that will not be used in the future seemed like a poor use of time.",
    "Strengths: in theory this could be a useful course. The alumni panel was good.Weaknesses: This course seems to be tailored to benefit a select group of YSPH students. It seemed less helpful for careers that are not business-oriented.",
    "I learned some many skills from the class, which hardly learned from other courses.Maybe focus more on interview and conversation skills.",
    "It helped me prepare big time for my internship search. Also, the group workshops were great.",
    "Helpful.",
    "Very helpful, great material to think about and the feedback in our small groups was invaluable. Come prepared and awake, be open to constructive criticism, and you should benefit a lot. Career Services did a great job!",
    "better than I had expected, some of the things we learned were helpful, but I thought that the homework we had to do was not helpful",
    "This course was awful. It was wrong of YSPH to take away the fall break to require this course, which teaches mostly how to conform to white upper-class corporate standards, something that I am not at all interested in doing. The resume and interview help is something I have been able to seek out from Yale and YSPH's career offices and I didn't feel like I gained anything from the seminar.",
    "Overall a good idea and had some good parts. How it was conducted was terrible though. It did not need to be 3 days long. It was good to see people improve their presentation skills but I would have liked to see more personalized attention concerning cover letters and resumes. I feel like that was glossed over. Also, taking away our break was terrible. It would have been much better if this has been done in conjunction with our orientation over the summer. Student were here anyways so it would not have taken away from summer. Also, I would have liked to see more of a focus on internship finding and internship application skills rather than job finding skills.",
    "Very helpful seminar that taught me a lot of professional tactics.",
    "Gave good insight into public speaking and interviewing skills",
    "I found it helpful. Wish I taken a class like this before now as I would have done better at many interviews",
    "Awesome instructors! I really learned a lot and I loved the small group sessions. It was also super helpful, the cover letter and resume tutorial, as well as the other etiquette things.",
    "I thought this course was good overall because it forced us to practice interviewing and flex our oral presentation skills. We received good feedback for both. I don't the course needed to be from 9am-3pm each day. We had unnecessarily long breaks and lunch breaks. Everything could have been condensed into 1 or 2 days.",
    "Most of this seminar was a waste of time. The parts that weren't: giving presentations and getting feedback, practicing interviews with others. I found that a lot of the lecture material of the course was designed for a very narrow conception of professionalism--working in a corporate\/office setting. After being told to bring our resumes EVERY DAY to the seminar, they were never read and critiqued.",
    "Way too long; pretty unnecessary. Could have been completed in 1 day. William Vance was slightly demeaning and awkward.",
    "TOO EARLY, especially for it being our fall break. I felt that the timing of the seminar should not have been during our break. Nonetheless, it was very helpful and I learned a lot.",
    "A waste of time - it should be an optional workshop and not over fall break. Technologically advanced with the video recording, but maybe a bit excessive.",
    "I understand that these are skills they think we all need, but I felt like the timing of this course was bad, and the networking skills aren't things that I will necessarily need in my medical career. It felt a little bit forced, but I did get some things out of it that I will use.",
    "well coordinated, covered wide range of professionalism, provided good feedback",
    "I thought that it wasn't extremely helpful. I wish they would have incorporated more internship tips.",
    "It was really useful in providing presentation style feedback, interview practice, and self-critique. However, it was really frustrating that we were not given advanced notice on the assignments we'd have to prepare for the seminar, as it was right before fall break, and exhausting to complete many midterms\/papers and then find that we had a presentation to create. Also maybe spreading out over the semester would allow for skill building and improvement.",
    "I thought it was useful especially the part where we had to record ourselves and then critically evaluate our performances. It was a strange and painful experience, but I definitely gained insight into what I could do better. I don't think there is a better time to place the seminar than during fall break. Although I realise professional skills seminars would be more useful over the course of the semester, I am not sure if this is feasible logistically and among students.Also it would have been a lot more helpful if we had the same TA assigned to our group over the course of the 3 days. The different TAs made it difficult to assess whether we had improved or not from the day before.",
    "It was a nice introduction into developing professional skills and being more cognizant of speech patterns.",
    "Was helpful for presentation skills, and really looked at each student individually which was nice. However, a little more notice that we had to do a presentation would have been appreciated. It was nice to get back to thinking about how to write cover letters and resumes, conduct yourself in interviews, and such. None of it was too overbearing, but none of the lectures were absolutely essential either. The one-on-one exercises and feedback in the group breakouts was really helpful and was what made the seminar worthwhile.",
    "This course provided guidance on some important issues (resumes, interviewing, etc...), but it seemed hectic and a bit chaotic at times.",
    "This program was designed to best teach people to take advantage of white and male privilege. Very outdated curriculum given the emphasis that Yale places on work in the global health field.Its strengths were that it taught the very basics so perhaps it brought students below that baseline up to a reasonable starting point. I expected to learn more from a required course that Yale pays money for to contract out.Weaknesses were that there was conflicting feedback from multiple coaches. Some coaches expected females to adhere to gender roles and femininity, others were okay if a female was authoritative in presentation style.",
    "Glad it is required. Wish it hadn't been during October recess, though.",
    "Good!",
    "I thought the professional skills seminar was great. I learned a lot about how to perform more professionally, give better presentations, and be better in interviews. I think the biggest weakness was timing, this would be extremely helpful at the beginning of the Semester, at the break, I was already contacting people about internships, so having the talks on that before would have been great. Also, it should focus more on internships, I think a lot of it was focused on career interviews, etc. I think this would be interesting in the second year, but was not as helpful in the first.",
    "Average for a seminar course.",
    "Very useful tips and lessons learned from the seminar.Also apprecaiated that it was taken over 3 consecutive days, rather than over 3 weeks as it was done previously.",
    "Incredibly useful for professional development.",
    "I thought this course was very helpful, and liked how it was given to us over a 3 day period instead of breaking it up. It helped me pinpoint my weakness areas so that I could work on improving them.",
    "I thought it was pretty good for what it was designed to do. Not sure if this format is better than weekly sessions though.",
    "I did not like this course. I thought the material presented to us was not useful or helpful. I think it would have been much more beneficial if we actually were able to break out into our groups and work on our resumes or work on cover letters. I did enjoy the interview practice but that was about it. Also, I do not thinking making this mandatory during the fall break is fair. Perhaps a better time would be a couple days during orientation in the beginning of the year."

Why an accent is a bad thing in a global health profession or the 21st century escapes me. Many comments referring to women's \"desperation for approval,\" \"timidness,\" etc were offensive and off-putting - especially in a school of predominantly women. I also did not want to emulate his style of patronizing, obnoxious public speaking, and his definition of self-branding was mechanical and impersonal. He should not be in charge of this course - he automatically makes students dislike it.",

    "Yes",
    "It was hard to have the seminar during fall break but I learned a lot during the 3 days.",
    "This is question 8's response: The best part was a one-on-one talk I had with a coach. I highly recommend one-on-one sessions because you can really discuss what you want to work on and methods to improve.-----This is question 9's response: Yes, overall it was sort of helpful. I wish it were more customized though. The ideal program would be something ongoing. Either public health students can use resources already available at Yale or YSPH partners up with another school to promote resources. For example, if we could use resources from the School of Management we could pinpoint what we want to work on. At the beginning of the semester, it would be nice to create goals then continue meeting with a coach over the course of the semester to keep in touch and receive evaluations.",
    "Overall, this was a good seminar, and I feel like I definitely took away skills from it",
    "Yes. It is helpful in public speaking and also interviewing.",
    "This course was not helpful. It was also very frustrating that we were required to attend and it took place when other students were on break. I would not recommend this course, but it is required.",
    "I think that this seminar felt long and tedious at times, but at the the end of the day, it was incredibly valuable. I think that everyone should have themselves videotaped at some point in their life because it is a very eye-opening experience.Also, since I had to decline to answer question 8, I just wanted to say that Josh and Felicia were great breakout group leaders!",
    "I recommend you to attend the seminar even if you qualify for waiver. It's quite useful when you start job hunting.",
    "These 3 days will change you for the better. It is up to you to learn and be willing to accept constructive criticism! This seminar will help us become more competitive inthe real world! It is essential to attend!",
    "This seminar needs more time than just 3 days",
    "Required seminar.",
    "The class is helpful for practicing speaking, and I would recommend it.",
    "Why do we have to take this? There must be a better forum where we (everyone of all genders and race) can feel comfortable. I will say it was beneficial to get myself videotaped and see how I talk, but otherwise, it was not a great learning experience.",
    "Overall, I had a lot of hopes for picking up some useful skills in this course, but felt that all the useful information that I learned could have been picked up elsewhere via Career Center appointments and job experience (which I had some, but not enough to exempt). Overall, I would not recommend to those who have similar work experience as me.",
    "Unfortunately this is a requirement!",
    "The process is very interesting.",
    "I know it sucks to not have a fall break, but its worth it. You'll get your stuff together for internships.",
    "It's required for first year student but it's helpful indeed!",
    "Very helpful for everyone as we prepare for the real world. Even if you have professional work experience there is something to be gained from this seminar, and as someone who was initially skeptical I can tell you that it is an invaluable opportunity to get very necessary feedback on how we carry and present ourselves in a professional environment.",
    "Yes, I learned useful things about finding an internship, and also learned about some of my speech habits and how I can fix certain things to be present myself as more professional and confident.",
    "Do anything you can to get out of it. You will only learn how to be a corporate robot.",
    "Overall good. But could have been better organized.",
    "Very helpful and necessary",
    "Yes!!! I learned so much, seriously I even used some of the things they taught me there in real life! I went to my boyfriend's company holiday party, and I relied on the 2 minute personal branding to introduce myself when people asked what I did.",
    "waived out of course",
    "This course is useful for those who want to improve their oral presentation or interviewing skills. I don't think I learned anything new because I worked for 2 years before entering YSPH, and so I think those of us who worked for 2 years should have been able to be exempt from this course.",
    "Terrible. Try to get out of it.",
    "Good to take, even if you had 2 years prior work experience. I learned a lot of new techniques and a lot about myself that I did not know, even when I had over 2 years of work experience.",
    "It is required, but it was painful",
    "This course goes over interviewing and presentation skills necessary for navigating the job search process. As a joint MD student who won't necessarily be going through the same type of process as most of my colleagues, I felt that it covered a lot of topics that weren't relevant tome, and I would not recommend the entire course to other students in the joint degree program.",
    "although it was during our oct recess, i'd prefer 3 days crash course rather than biweekly mtgs or other alternative schedule.helpful for those with no work experiencenot necessary for those w at least 2 years work experience",
    "It is valuable in receiving feedback on presentation style, however not so much so for professional behavior advice.",
    "Come to the professional seminar. Though you think you may be missing break, but in truth you are gaining money! The things they teach you are so valuable in future job prospect and career development, you couldn't have asked for better people! Be on time, and listen!",
    "This course is required, and no one really wants to take it. Despite that, there is some good information covered here, so take it as an opportunity to learn something.",
    "It is a three day exercise in reviewing the very basics in talking to anyone over the age of 18 in a professional manner.",
    "Recommended! Can I do this in my second year?",
    "I didn't find this course very useful and the way the course was presented (3 full days in the middle of the semester) should be changed, to perhaps during orientation.",
    "Good! Recommend the course.",
    "It is required and fairly interesting so yes I wouild recommend attending!",
    "A good refresher on how to polish yourself for interviews.",
    "Although this course is required I would still recommend it, because even if you think you don't need it there are still areas that you could improve upon.",
    "I would recommend it because it is required."
