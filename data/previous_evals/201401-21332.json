   "comments": [
    "If you want to know more about African American history, take this class.",
    "MUST-TAKE IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HISTORY MAJOR! AMERICAN HISTORY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE AFAM EXPERIENCE! TAKE IT!",
    "Great course! Enjoyable lectures. Incredible reading list. Take it. Important material. Weekly reading responses are a lot of work.",
    "This is a fairly basic survey history course, but that being said, I ABSOLUTELY recommend it. Even though it's material you've probably already learned, Holloway presents it in such a moving and compelling way that it's well worth taking again. There's a lot of reading but much of it is actually really enjoyable. I so so enjoyed this class and definitely recommend it - just do mind which TF you end up with.",
    "HIST 187 moves from emancipation to the present. The lectures are extremely engaging - including quotations, video clips, and audio segments. There are weekly readings and reading responses. There is one midterm essay (about eight pages) and a final exam with identifications and essays. The readings were somewhat repetitive, but I was definitely exposed to a new set of authors and experiences. The class distills many misconceptions about the African American experience - Malcolm X wasn't just a rebel and Rosa Park's actions were extremely calculated. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "YES. Without reservation. ABSOLUTELY. When I review classes I mention reasons why I liked it or didnt like it so other people can decide but in this case I think everyone should take this class. I am AMST but I think you dont have to be in this major or even from this country to find this stuff fascinating, disturbing, eye opening, life changing. There are so many names Dr. J introduced me to that I will never forget about, they have forever changed my thinking about the world. He also teaches nuances in history that will truly make you question everything you think you know about your own identity, culture, country, history even if they have nothing to do with African American struggle for liberation or the United States. This is a class about history of oppression and ideas and culture and politics. It includes music, poetry, art, novels, letters, FBI documents, films, documentaries, experimental prose, paintings, photos, news clips, and speeches. I promise it will be worth it. I enjoyed doing reviewing for the final and THE FINAL ITSELF!",
    "Fantastic introduction to African American history and race in America. Will go beyond your expectations for an introductory course. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE IT!",
    "AFAM 162 is a survey of African American history from Emancipation until present day. The class examines questions of citizenship and what it means to be a citizen. Each week there is assigned reading to be covered in discussion sections. There is one midterm and a final exam. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone, whether or not you are interested in AFAM Studies or History.",
    "Take it! This history is so important for anyone to know. If Andrew is still TA-ing try to get in his section if you want engaging discussions. Warning: this year we had to write weekly reading responses even though these were not listed on the class syllabus.",
    "A crash course in African American History. I would definitely recommend it, the information learned is fascinating and important.",
    "Wonderful course. It's information we all (hopefully) know, but Professor Holloway does a great job of weaving everything together into one cohesive story. The readings are also awesome, but how much you get out of them can depend on your section. If Professor Holloway teaches it again, I would definitely recommend it as a nice 5th class.",
    "Terrific course. Loved it. Great thematic coherency, excellent primary source readings, good lectures and section. Fair midterm and final. This is material that everyone should know, the workload is manageable, and I can't see any reason why you wouldn't take this class.",
    "AfAm history is an awesome class to take if you want a review of what you should have learned in high school plus some extra information. The readings are great, the lectures are interesting, and the section leaders are talented. Take it!",
    "This was a good survey course on AfAm history. The content was very dense, so it's important to be in a good section where you can really make sense of the large amount of information (including readings) with other people! I took this course as a lens into understanding American history, and it certainly helped with that. I wish there could have been more points of views explored (other than Prof Holloway's), but other than that it was definitely a solid class and worth all the effort.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. It will change the way you see the world",
    "I would recommend it, it's a good opportunity to read important texts and learn more about black history.",
    "Yes, great course! LOTS of reading but it is all enjoyable and easy to get through. Interesting, insightful material.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take this class!!!!",
    "I feel like this is a fairly standard history lecture. What's so amazing is that this is a story that most people think they know well, but there is so much more to learn, and this class is a great place to do it. The readings can sometimes be a lot, but they aren't boring. The midterm and final are fair, and the professor and the TAs are fantastic. Take it!",
    "There are some nuances to the typical narrative that we know. The reading every week is one book plus primary source readings, so it can be heavy at times. Course is one midterm paper, one final, section participation, so you have to remember a lot of information for the final. Plan ahead and study with in groups.",
    "AFAM 162 follows the history of African-Americans from Emancipation to present in America. It addresses the intersections of race, sexuality, gender, and class is social movements of African-Americans. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great intro into thinking about our constructions of race and how it affects our everyday lives.",
    "A good class. The professor wasn't as engaged in lectures as I would have hoped. Certainly it's very important material to know, and it is taught in a good and thorough way. I found Slavery and Abolition: 1500-1888 a bit more engaging and useful. But this is a solid course, interesting, worthwhile, though with a fair amount of reading - I recommend.",
    "This class was a great way to reevaluate and question the ways we remember and teach African American history. I recommend doing the readings, because they were really interesting and elevated the content of the course. I found some of the material repetitive as someone with a strong history background, but I learned to think critically about both the larger and smaller moments of American history.",
    "Must-take. You can't know the history of America without knowing the history of the African-American people in the US. This course gives insight to the often over-looked part of our history. America was built on the backs of slaves and ran its economy off of blacks so it only makes sense that America can only be fully understood by learning of the country's actions after slaves were emancipated. I'm serious when I say everyone should take this class, especially people who plan to go into policy that will affect urban\/black areas (do not stay ignorant please of reality).",
    "It is a study of African American history from the time of emancipation to the present time with weekly readings to complement the topic of that week. I would recommend it as it is a very complete and comprehensive history of African American history in the US thus it provides a new insight."
