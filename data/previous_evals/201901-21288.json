    "It is a great independent research opportunity for credit. Perhaps more interaction between lab PIs\/mentors and course instructors could be helpful so members of lab understand the requirements and expectations.",
    "I think the final paper has maybe a bit unnecessarily long page requirement. You only get to do like 2 weeks worth of work if you were full time as you do in a full semester of this course. It is hard to write 12-15 pages on 2 weeks worth of work.",
    "I can have a chance to experience the grad-school life",
    "The freedom and flexibility is a huge strength. Weakness: I wish we had a few meetings with the course directors.",
    "Strength- there is some compensation for the work that we do in lab that is usually unpaid. Weakness- it is only pass\/fail, which does not reflect the amount of work students put in. If it was graded on a letter scale it would be much more fair."

    "Yes! It is a great opportunity to conduct independent research in a lab.",
    "Depends on your PI and your lab! My lab really helps me to learn a lot, as does my P.I., and they are all very invested in my success in research. As a result, I felt like I was nurtured a lot and this lab was very helpful. Was definitely more than 10 hours a week.",
    "If you have the time (and that is a big if) and you are interested in continuing research during the semester then this course is a great way to keep your feet wet.",
    "Yes, but bare in mind that some experiments\/procedures take a long time e.g. 6-10 hours and you must complete them in one go; make sure you can afford the time",
    "Yes if you are working in a lab you might as well get credit for it!",
    "Yes. If you are conducting unpaid research in a lab during the semester take this course."
