   "comments": [
    "It's a continuation of Arabic 110\/120, and I would only recommend it to another student if they're willing to work hard at it.",
    "Just remember this is not colloquial Arabic, you should consider Levantine and Spoken Arabic to know what is really spoken on the streets. It's great though.",
    "Arabic 130 is better organized but also more intense and a larger work load than the Arabic 110 and 120 classes. I did find Al-Kitaab, part II to be better than Al-Kitaab, part I - no more Maha stories and it seemed more \"mature\" in terms of reading articles that have been printed in Arabic journals and magazines. I felt like I was finally grasping the Arabic language. Some of the concepts are extremely repetitive - I feel as though I only covered a few things but over&over again with perhaps not that much clarity. Furthermore, additional materials are introduced, such as short stories (fairy tales), core conversations (think recitations, only harder and not about Maha), and weekly essays&quizzes. The saving grace is that the schedule is consistent - which makes it easier to plan the work load than it ever was in L1 and L2. Then again, there was far less work... We had 3 tests overall, which was probably made easier by the weekly quizzes that assured you knew the information and were typically not that hard.",
    "Yes, only if you're willing to put in the time and effort.",
    "I would recommend Arabic for anyone who wants to learn the language. Yale has a department with some really dedicated faculty.",
    "This was a really good class, I enjoyed it. We pulled together texts from the book, children's story books, the news, and youtube videos, and I feel like I learned a lot. Shady was an incredible teacher who knew absolutely everything about the language. He was really dedicated and always spent hours helping students after class. Overall it was a really good class.",
    "If you're looking to build on your knowledge of Arabic, take 130. It will teach you a wide range of vocabulary, help you improve your listening and writing skills (although not so much your speaking), and if you take it with Prof. Al-Ani you'll not only learn, but you won't be stressed out as you learn. She was really friendlyand good at explaining grammatical concepts. She also made lots of worksheets for us to practice with, so if you're the type of person who likes worksheets, take Arabic 130 with her! And she showed Disney clips and animated cartoons in Arabic to help us with our listening skills, which was a nice change from the news articles we read.",
    "Definitely take it and since they have changed the structure of L1 and L2 this year, you will find L3 a lot more enjoyable and relatively easier than we did. Make sure to do daily homeworks though, otherwise you will fall behind and face a tough time. Get extra help if you have to and be prepared to put in time to this class but in the end, it will all be worth it.",
    "If you want to learn how to read a newspaper or any kind of formal text and know a lot of Arabic grammar you should take this class. However, this class will not teach you how to speak Arabic. It is also a lot of work. Two hours of work everyday is really just a minimum.",
    "It's hard. This course will take up a large portion of your time.",
    "It's a lot of work. A quiz every week, a core conversation to memorize (about ten lines in Arabic) every week, a weekly essay, and homework every night (even when the other stuff is due). I guess if you're taking L3 it's most likely for the requirement, but just know what you're getting into. The teacher's expect you to work 2 hours a night, and you probably will.",
    "arabic is a good class that is sometimes a little disorganized. if you are genuinely interested in the language i think it is a great class to take, but there is definitely room for improvement",
    "I would not recommend Arabic 130 01 to a fellow student. I felt it was impossible to succeed no matter how much work one put into the class. It caused me constant frustration. The class was miserable: it had much too fast of a pace and on the tests, hyper-specific knowledge from years past appeared. I felt the whole time that questions on the tests were made to catch or trick us. Simply, it was a miserable time. The worst academic experience I have had at Yale so far.",
    "Arabic is very difficult, but the professors do a great job of keeping you on the right track.",
    "It's okay... it was a LOT of work for not many rewarding experiences. However, we do read short stories and texts, which is very exciting :)b",
    "This is the hardest Arabic class so far (obviously it's harder than L1 and L2, but this really feels like a step up). You have to take it if you want 1) language credit or 2) to get better at Arabic.",
    "Too much work detracted from the learning, but otherwise pretty good.",
    "Significantly harder than first-year Arabic. Be sure to stay on top of the work. The curriculum is still in flux but be prepared for some assignments (lengthy stories) that seem less than helpful. How well you do in the class is almost purely a function of how much time you put into it!",
    "Yes, good above the foundations level course.",
    "Much more work intensive then first year (at least when I took first year, before the program was overhauled). Essay due every monday, Quiz every friday, and a page long conversation to memorize for every thursday. Plus around 3\/4 exams and a final. The daily work isn't too bad but the other stuff can add up to be a bit of a pain. Take it if you want to improve your arabic reading and writing - the vocab you can just learn from the book, and the class is too big to concentrate on speaking. Shady is a really good teacher, and he designs the tests so it helps to have him as your section instructor.",
    "If you plan on continuing Arabic, you have to. But it is well worth it, since you don't really begin to understand the language until L3 anyway.",
    "I really love this course. It's very hard, homework is given nightly and it takes a long time to complete, but the professors are very understanding and helpful. Still, I would only recommend this course if you are really willing to take on this language. This is not a class you take just to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Arabic 130 to another student because Arabic is such an important language, and it is good to get at least beyond the 3rd year.",
    "Do not take this class unless you really want to learn Arabic. It is not easy, but it's doable. An average of about an hour-hour and a half a night. I had Ghassan and he is awesome.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to do the work.",
    "This is a very difficult course. I highly recommend it, however, and advise anyone taking it to feel free to seek out help from the professors. They will do their best to assist you. Most of all, don't be too proud to seek help and get it before the last minute.",
    "Arabic L3 was extremely difficult this semester. The amount of work that the class required was rather absurd (huge jump from L1 and L2), and there were some nights when I asked my self: \"Why are you doing this to yourself?\" I am not taking this for a requirement, but just because I like languages. That said, the workload sometimes drove me off my rocker and made me want to forget written tradition and revert to communicating in grunts and punches.The in-class experience, however, was very good. Class sizes were decent (mine was the biggest at around 18, which was too many but hey). My teacher (Shady) was wonderful. The teachers work interactively, which keeps you interested. Going to Arabic class was my favorite part of the day, but doing the homework (as I have said) was often rough going.This year, the Arabic department was revamped and made more rigorous, but it seems that they overcompensated and it became too hard. Hopefully it will be better calibrated in future semesters."
