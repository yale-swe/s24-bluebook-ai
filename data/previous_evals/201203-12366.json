   "comments": [
    "This course will definitely give you the opportunity to look at cities from an infrastructural, urban studies and historical perspective. Would absolutely recommend it to someone looking for something more hands on in the urban studies sphere.",
    "The course is a good summary of the most important movements in urban studies through the 20th century. Professor Rubin does a good job integrating this study with the city of New Haven and on a few field studies the class goes out into the city, which is a lot of fun. The class is fairly relaxed, a normal amount of reading for a seminar and class is treated as a large free form discusion.",
    "Not a lot of work, laid back discussions, learn some about cities. Ok class.",
    "Urban Life and Landscape is a great class for anyone who has interest in Urban Studies. I would recommend it, but warn people really need to like urban studies. Most people in the class were very into it, which is a good thing.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in urban studies or urban design. We look at the built environment from several different perspectives over the course of the term, including ethnography, social psychology, urban drift, and more. The field trips over the course are a lot of fun--you get to see parts of New Haven in detail that you wouldn't otherwise, and also provide a nice break from the regular rhythm of the day. The readings are really interesting, and the workload's well-paced throughout the semester: really short response every week (not difficult to do at all), a few short papers based on different activities (researching the history of a building, an urban observation exercise, and an urban drift exercise), and a final paper that can be on pretty much anything you want (a lot of people were able to make it work as part of a yearlong thesis). There's a lot to do, but it's all really fun and interesting, and spaced out enough that you never feel too overwhelmed. The class has a good balance of Rubin's teaching and discussion, and people bring in a lot of outside knowledge in discussions, in posts to the class blog, and sharing reading responses.",
    "I would recommend this class with the caveat that you go to office hours. Otherwise, Elihu can be unclear about his expecations and the class becomes less enjoyable. Make sure to do all the reading and participate fully, or else taking the class is truly pointless. This class was not the best, but worth taking.",
    "Urban Life and Landscape covers the breadth and the depth of urban studies, by addressing issues related to urban planning, policy, governance as well as an expression of culture, life and politics. It prepares the grounds as well as presents opportunities to delves into specific urban studies across disciplines and majors. The course content includes visits to urban sites to engage with the content discussed and assignments developed in class.I recommend this course to anyone who is students who are interested in exploring academics and professional practice in the urban environment. For students interested in architecture or planning this is a great course to take as it helps explore interests and develop a self directed study.",
    "Yes!! Absolutely take it if you have any interest in the subject. It transformed how I look at the city and gave me much more respect for New Haven."
