    "Philip's instruction was incredible, especially in the field. I really appreciated his knowledge, thoroughness and incredible patience. He really went the extra mile for us.Prof. Camp was also very helpful at every turn and gave good lectures.The only thing I could criticize at all about this course is that we ignored herbaceous species, but this was by design.",
    "7a. Philip Marshall knows everything anyone could possibly know about the history of individual tree species. He is an unbelievable wealth of knowledge.7b. Jason always had time to answer questions and even led a review session before the test without anyone having to ask him. He was attentive and helpful in each class and on field trips.8\/10. Even students who are not MF should take this course because it provides a foundational knowledge of and familiarity with tree taxonomy and identification.9. The field trips, especially Sleeping Giant and Yale-Myers were amazing. The bog was my favorite part of any class that I have taken since undergrad.However, I would have the list of species to be seen at each field trip available at least a week ahead of time so that students can read up on them before going into the field. If we get the species list the day of, it was more difficult for some students to keep up when going from tree to tree.",
    "response to 6- the amount of material we had to get through made lectures somewhat encyclopedic, so we didn't get to focus on individual families as much as they deserve",
    "Because the course was taught by two instructors, Ann and Phil, the pace and kind of instruction really varied depending on who was lecturing. They both have unique teaching styles which can be good depending on your learning style.",
    "1. I found the organization of both texts confusing, as neither did a good job grouping according to families and orders clearly. But in the end I was glad I had purchased both.3. The midterm was a lot of fun, but it would have been great to have discussed it in class afterwards in order to learn what Phil had been looking for in each question.7a. Both professors demonstrated a tremendous depth of knowledge and worked amiably together. I wanted to give an excellent rating, but two things held me back - 1) Both instructors did too much reading directly from their Powerpoints when presenting to the class. 2) At times the instructors competed too much with each other - especially on field excursions. Phil's command of natural history knowledge was boundless and added a tremendous amount to the class. Ann's ability to incorporate West Coast species was enlightening.7c. It wasn't that Jay did a poor job as TA, it was that he contributed so little that at times it didn't feel as if we had a TA.9. The field trips MADE this class. I learned so much more rapidly in the field and my retention was 10-fold over the class lectures. The instructors did a fantastic time making sure we got outside as much as possible and it made a huge difference (even if it meant just walking around Farnham Memorial Gardens or Greeley Gardens).",
    "Phillip Marshall is an invaluable asset to FES as an instructor. His knowledge made the class what it was - a very valuable course to anyone with an interest in trees.",
    "The course requires a lot of individual work in the form of memorization and practice but with that, one comes away with a terrific understanding of tree identification skills. The main instructor is more than incredibly knowledgeable, and both teachers seem to be working very hard to modify parts of this relatively new course to make it even better. The course is great, but would benefit from some relatively minor changes, and may a few larger ones. Minor changes: as much practice time\/ field work as possible, and maybe some structured group activities during that field time; smaller practicum-type assignments along the way (maybe ID quizzes?) at each field trip; have the 3-hour lecture chunk include a 30 minute ID session of species relevant to the lecture that are near-by (a short walking tour of the day's trees). Maybe larger changes: It would be good to more clearly decide\/ define the purpose of the course. Is it about learning to ID trees or to understand their place in an overall system\/ natural history context? I know it's currently both, but it would help students to learn \"both sides\" better if these goals were integrated more. How can you integrate the natural history and the ID better so each accentuates our understanding of both? Are there discussion activities that might engage students in the natural history portion more during lectures?",
    "This class was terrific.Due to the weather constrictions, it is a must that we do the field trips prior to the bulk of classification lectures. Ideally they would be done beforehand, but it's not possible. I think this is understood, and it's appreciated by students that we get outside w\/ the leaves still on!The field trips were AMAZING. I learned so much. One suggestion to Philip Marshall as an instructor would be to do more \"quizzing\" of students while we are in the field. We ask him so many questions which he answers thoroughly and generously. I wouldn't want him to change that but I think there could be some benefit for him to turning some of the questions back on to us.When we are in the field, it is very easy to get sucked into focusing on tree ID entirely, but it would also be helpful to work in some of the more conceptual classification and evolutionary discussions while we are out and about."

Field practical - one of the most practical exams I have ever taken.5. The class schedule. Perfect amount of Friday trips and thought that 3 hours once a week was very perfectly suited to the material that had to be covered.",

   "comments": [
    "It should be a two semester course!",
    "It was difficult to absorb all of the material from the lectures.",
    "Maybe reorganize the slides so that each class begins with a picture of the phylogenetic tree with the portion to be discussed that day highlighted (i.e. the rosid clade, fabid clade, malvid clade, etc.). Then, only do the families and species within that clade. It was more difficult and took longer when studying for the final to have to organize everything to get the big picture.",
    "Classroom was a little too small for the amount of students in the class.",
    "Sometimes people were confused about the expectations for assignments.",
    "the lectures get to be encyclopedic and are long since the class only meets once a week for 3 hours. It may be nice to have the option of switching to two 1.5 hour sessions once the field trips are over.",
    "There was more work in this class than other classes. I think that only one midterm (either the take home or the field practicum would be sufficient). Also, the final paper was so loosely defined that I didn't really understand what the instructors were hoping that we would get out of the assignment except to jump through another hoop.",
    "I would strongly suggest that the instructors distribute a large taxonomic chart on the first day of class. Then, throughout the remainder of the lectures the students could be engaged in populating the chart. It would better establish an understanding of families and orders as we went along, rather than being something that's merely studied for the final exam.A move involved TA would have made an already excellent class even better.Smaller Powerpoint file sizes.",
    "- providing time and guidance in class to learn the trees along the way (more practice, maybe field trip quizzes, etc.)- figuring out how to make the natural history portion seem more relevant and connected to the taxonomy portion",
    "The lectures were a little dry. There was a lot of information that we probably could of read in a book. I would of enjoyed a little less tree taxonomy and a bit more natural history.",
    "Learning 'check in' questions asked of students.Integrating tree ID with taxonomy and classification concepts. in the field time is very heavily weighted toward ID.I felt very unprepared to answer the questions posed in the midterm - iwanted to be able to answer them and in researching the questions i gained a lot of insight into certain things I should have been focusing on in my reading and listening to lectures.I like the \"thinking\" questions posed in some of the handouts for the field trips, and wished we had focused a bit more on the answers\/discussion to them. This would have increased the \"applied\" practice during the course."

    "This course \"colored in the lines\" drawn for me in my stand dynamics class. Learning about the characteristics and tendencies of certain species made me feel much more comfortable with the highly abstract material presented in Stands. These two classes were highly synergistic and I'm so glad that I took them at the same time.Having little background in forestry, I felt this class really increased my fluency with the particular species in southern new england and gave me the tools i need to approach learning specifics about other regions. I feared it might be too specialized toward SNE forests, but it actually feels very transferable in the end."
