    "Q8: We werent really TAUGHT much in this class - it was more Michael's thoughts on various subjects, and then the presentations of the guest speakers...I don't know how you could go about making it different, but at times it bordered on pontification and that was challenging to sit through.",
    "The readings were helpful. However, writing reactions to readings is always a wasted exercise. We're at grad school because we want to be here. \"Busy work\" assignments just to prove that we're actually doing the reading is a bit demeaning.Also, I have a major problem with the system of participation points, which is basically the TA making a check mark next to our name whenever we say something in class or ask a question. This is absurd. So, the people with loud mouths who say unintelligible things get more points than people who are intrinsically more reserved yet might be getting more out of the class than the first group? Also, in a class of 30 people, where there's usually only 5-10 minutes reserved for questions, the environment isn't very conducive to this process.",
    "7b\/c - Liz was an amazing TA. Very organized and always willing to talk about the class.",
    "I came into the class with low expectations, but really ended up learning a lot about a part of environmentalism that I'm not very familiar with",
    "It took me a while to realize what was at the heart of the class. When I did, I realized it is probably one of the most valuable classes offered at FES.",
    "This course has been refreshing, rewarding, and a true training for us future natural resource practitioners when we go out into the real world of environmental policymaking.It was exciting to hear directly from on-the-ground practitioners how they organized and implemented their environmental campaigns; especially when some of us had been exposed to their communications and outreach strategies."

    "The group project forcing us to think about how we would organize a capaign.",
    "How helpful Michael is in connecting us to people with our interests and bringing in good speakers.",
    "The readings synched up so well with the speakers; reading across disciplinary areas and social issues provided new frameworks through which to view campaign issues closer to my heart; the historical insight from Bury the Chains was fantastic (I've used it in conversation ever since); I learned a ton about how to think creatively around framing an issue; the discussion was good.",
    "the speakers, and the professor's connections with people. He truly helps you out with your own project (which is a fun one!)",
    "The guest speakers!",
    "We could learnt the real story from real campaigners.",

    "Water Wars lecture",
    "dinner&how practical it was",
    "Learning from and exchanging with practitioners in the field; exploring a campaign or topic of personal interest and practicing campaign modeling with a group. Meals were unbelievable. Michael is a flexible and supportive instructor who really tries to cultivate a unique and applicable class.",

    "The methodology based on expositions from persons that participated in campaigns was the best. It allows students to understand the campaigning issues from real experience testimonies.",

    "- Prof. Michael Northrop is AMAZING!- He has designed a very special course with real-life examples of some of the best environmnetal campaigns ever implemented in the United States and around the world.- Extraordinary selection of invited guest speakers- Night course schedule as it allows to combine it with other day courses.- Liz's organization and food selections (connecting our meal selections with our social and environmental values)I believe the most pragmatic course is the one that provides authentic tools to our professional development. I have already benefited from the knowledge gained throughout the course\u0092s presentations and discussions, through ideas that I am already applying to my real-life work and environmental campaigns."

   "comments": [
    "Timing could be better -- most classes ran over, and time limits (i.e. student presentations were supposed to be 5 mins) were NOT respected or enforced, which was quite challenging.",
    "I don't feel there was enough in-depth analysis. We listened to speakers, but it would have been good to discuss some of the details more in depth as a class.",
    "guest lectures were sometimes too long",
    "Michael, I feel very strongly that you should have a closed laptop rule during classes. The School of Management has that rule so that students actually pay attention and contribute meaningfully to conversation during classes, and I think that this class is ripe for good conversation, but that people gchatting or playing online is interfering. Try it next year - I think you'd be surprised at how the quality of student participation increases.",
    "Going over the time limit!",
    "LONG class!",
    "A bit more structure in terms of drawing together lessons from the different speakers during the semester.Also, readings at times seemed pretty random (i.e. good, but a lot of reading and not always particularly related to the speaker that week). Some more selection in terms of assigning book sections rather then whole books would be good.",
    "The readings - out of date and too vague.",
    "It would be great for speakers to have been aware of the collective class background before they came to speak (perhaps a paragraph on our work and campaign experiences) so that they could tailor their lectures to us as a class.",
    "More discussion, fewer speakers.",
    "-a little juggling of speakers - some were AWESOME, others a little lacking in enthusiasm or charisma...",
    "More involvement from the professor\/more inclusion of his experiences rather than of those he knows.",
    "I don't believe this course need any improvement.",
    "Integrating readings into open discussion.",
    "- Just a general recommendation to start the course with a one-day or half-day workshop on environmental campaign design framework to help contextualize the different campaigns\u0092 strategies andtactics taught throughout the course.- More time for final class presentations (15 minutes per presentation plus 5 minutes for questions)- Inviting guest speakers to talk about successful local and community campaigns from groups that have very little budgets, such as environmental justice groups, small-scale campaigns in the New Haven\/Yale community"

    "As someone interested in policy, it was good to gain a better understanding of how campaigns work.",
    "I'm interested in persuasion - in what it takes to convince the public that a given environmental issue matters, and matters enough that they should take action. Although my actual degree is far from the content of campaigns (I'm a forester), there is a lot to be learned about how to brand and bind an initiative in order to create public buy in. I think I learned a lot about creating change, a skill I think everyone at FES is seeking.",
    "This is an incredibly important course for anyone looking to work in environmental policy after graduation (i.e. most of FES). Taking this course means that people looking to be involved in or run campaigns right after graduation don't have to reinvent the wheel in putting one together but can learn strategies from what has happened before.",
    "I hope to work in program management with community groups and nonprofits in the future and this exposed us to some of the nation's best and brightest campaigners. It is an applied or at least apply-able class in contrast to many skills or theory-based classes.",
    "Provided input on a unique skill set that anyone in the environmental field can use.",
    "It is really helpful, since I'm interested in environmental justice, and a lot of advances in EJ have relied on successful environmental campaigns. It was great to see these campaigns broken down in a classroom setting - I didn't expect to have the opportunity to study campaigns at FES, and it ended up being really helpful.",

Mat's unparalleled passion for wild spaces echoes the passion I hope to bring to my work and showed by example how each of us as environmental leaders must learn to share our campaigns and causes to a wide audience if we are to form effective policy. While not every speaker appealed to me as strongly, I enjoyed hearing about each person's campaign and quest from Dick Amper to Becky Tarbotton to Tom Kruz.",

The single most important element in learning to reflect more effectively and that many professionals lack, is having time to reflect\u0094"

    "The group assignment about a New Haven-hypothetical campaign was fine, but ill timed--easily could have been scheduled earlier in the semester\/planned for more meaningfully and not thrown in at the end of the semester amongst all the other final deliverables. Also, the 5 minute presentations turned into 15-20 minutes a group which I think does a great disservice to teaching people how to present within a given time-limit and got downright boring.",
