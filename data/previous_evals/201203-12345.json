    "Take it. It's not a blow off class or an easy 5th credit, but it is an excellent class that will be well worth your time.",
    "Every now and then people throw around the phrase \"this is the best class at Yale.\" I can't comment on those other claims, but I can, with certainty, tell you that Professor Dufresne's class deserves that title. First, there's the subject matter which is super interesting to anyone interested in current events or politics: immigration is a huge, complex issue that we cannot even begin to understand just by reading isolated news articles. This class equips you with a 360 knowledge of immigration law, policy and history through the US. But second, take this class to learn what it feels like to be truly challenged, to truly learn and to see how transformative an experience with a professor who really cares about her students can be.",
    "If you manage to get a spot in this class, you'd be a fool not to take it. It's the best class you'll take at Yale, period.",
    "Yes! You would be a fool not to take it. Seriously. I'm not joking when I say it's the single best class I've taken at Yale (after 5 semesters here).",
    "I would absolutely recommend it because it's a challenging yet rewarding class with a phenomenal professor.",
    "I recommend this course whole-heartedly. If you are interested in learning more about immigration matters than what you've read in the news, you will enjoy this seminar as much if not more than your other courses. Your classmates will keep you in line since everyone wants to do their best and make the most out of this course. You will carry around a hefty book, but it will become a source of pride throughout the semester. The assignments are fun to do and challenging.",
    "Take it if you can get in! This is the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you're looking to see if law school is the thing for you, take this course. You'll learn a lot preparing for your oral arguments.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in either immigration policy or the law - if you're interested in only the latter, you'll definitely become interested in immigration policy later on. Dufresne is great. That said, this class is quite a lot of work and so shouldn't be underestimated!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in going to law school; it is a great introduction to what to expect. Do not take this class if you do not have time to dedicate to it. You can't really afford to fall behind on readings.",
    "AMAZING. LIFE-CHANGING. Best class I've taken. Do it.",
    "If you're interested in the law, this course is arguably the best pre-law class at Yale. Even if you're not specifically interested in immigration law, the basic concepts and practical skills that you're going to learn from this class will serve you well going forward. The class is extremely dense - you'll have to read all of a huge casebook and be prepared for very difficult homework assignments. At the end of the day though, the material and Professor Dufresne's amazing dedication will win you over. Take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "Amazing class! Take it if you can get in! One of my favorite classes at Yale. But, be ready to put in a lot of work on a weekly basis. If huge books and long writing assignments scare you, you will suffer in this class.",
    "TAKE IT. It's hard, and you'll have to do at least 100 pages of reading a week in the casebook, but Professor Dufresne is so kind and brilliant that you'll want to know everything so you can keep up with the awesome class discussions she leads. Everything about this class is intimidating at first (the book, the debates, the homework), but once you overcome the first big hurdle and learn how to get it done (and somehow, Professor Dufresne will teach you), it'll be the most rewarding class you'll ever take. It's not just immigration policy - it's legal theory and critical thinking - that this class gives you. Seriously, TAKE IT FOR DUFRESNE -- SHE'S AMAZING.",
    "Please take it. Take it if you are either really interested in Immigration or really interested in the law. And if you are willing to do all of the work (which does not even feel like work because it is so enjoyable!).This is definitely the best class I have taken at Yale. The weekly assignments were varied and tested\/developed different skills. The material was incredibly interesting. The readings were fast-paced. The class discussion was structured and designed to improve the argumentative skills of even the least outspoken student in the seminar.I came out of it feeling like I learned a new way of thinking, a new approach to heavy workloads, and a whole set of substantive material regarding immigration and the law.",
    "EVERYONE, TAKE IT. This is an amazing class. (Lots of reading, though.) If you think you know what a good class is, take that and multiply it by two. Professor Dufresne, a former dean of Morse, shares her infective enthusiasm and knowledge on the subject. The class's actual arguments format is also really cool, and although you might be a bit intimidated if you're not used to debates and intense discussions. Speaking as a non-polisci or EP&E major, this class is TRULY FOR EVERYONE. If you weren't interested in law, you will be after. If you were into law, but not immigration law, you'll definitely be sucked in (at least a bit) to this subfield."
