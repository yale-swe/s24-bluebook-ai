    "I learned to cope with and analyse texts from one of the most complicated literary traditions I have ever encountered, through the use of close reading, attention to para-text, and of course a great arsenal of theoretical tool. Not many literature students are aware of the richness of Maghrebi literature, and prior to the arrival of Prof. Jarvis to Yale, there was no true expert to instruct this field; I believe her presence will soon create a community of students and scholars of the French North African corpus, a field crucial for any group trying to think about world literature and all that it entails."
