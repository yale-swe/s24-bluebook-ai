    "I thought that this course was exactly as I had expected it to be. The workload and assignments were of sufficient difficulty. The course provided me with a strong foundation of human genetics.",
    "Not exactly an introductory course, as mentioned in the course description. But a very useful and recommended course for anyone interested in genetics and medical research.",
    "strengths- the content learned in the course is quite fascinating and challenging. I appreciate the challenge in the course and how passionate and enthusiastic the professor is in teaching the material. I also really enjoyed the computer lab component that supplemented the course as well to get the exposure.",
    "Very useful skills learned for people who are genuinely interested in genetics and how genetic epidemiology studies are conducted and used in the field",
    "Excellent course.",
    "This course is great! Homework concepts could maybe be explained a little better in class but overall the course is fun and really teaches you a lot!",
    "The course is difficult for students who don't have much related knowledge.",
    "the course is really close to practical human genetics rather than just basic genetic biology knowledge. The classes are well-organized.",
    "Excellent course",
    "Excellent broad knowledge. Computer labs were not as useful",
    "The content of the lecture is pretty beneficial to us mph.",
    "The course was challenging, but the professor made it a doable challenge. I enjoyed further delving into the role genetics could play in public health research. I thoroughly enjoyed the course."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent instructor and very helpful during office hours. Kept topics relevant and that's much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I think that Dr. Dewan was a great instructor. While I found some of his slides to be a bit brief, his explanations during office hours more than made up for this.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Awesome. Very helpful and patient.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0strengths- definitely loved the professor and really appreciated how he made a great effort to follow up with students and with content related questions. the content may be difficult for some but he really challenges you to learn the material. weaknesses- sometimes the professor is unable to grasp where the confusion of the content material arises.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent instructor and a very good person who genuinely cares for his students to master what he teaches in class He puts his hours into developing students to fully understand the materials taught in class by providing open office hours! Best professor I have ever had! Really learned a lot about the principles and methodology of genetic population studies under him",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. Dewan is the best teacher I met.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Very helpful during office hours; notes were scattered though, so make sure to supplement understanding with office hours or a textbook if necessary for help in homework and exams",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0So nice! Super helpful, knowledgeable, understanding. Great at explaining concepts one on one",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0He is a really good instructor, he is really kind and patient.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor Dewan is really professonal, helpful and patient. He make time for students to ask questions and help us understand the class knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Excellent. Great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan is excellent as an instructor. He was always willing to offer help.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0The professor was spectacular -- he was the type of professor you hope to get in these kinds of challenging courses. He graded fairly and understood the level of difficulty of the exams and homework which he always took into consideration when grading. He was also frequently and readily available to discuss questions or concerns via email, office hours, or an in person meeting. Without a doubt I would take another class with him again."

   "comments": [
    "This course covers the basics of human genetics in public health. It provides you with the foundation necessary to critically read\/discuss the literature.",
    "Not exactly an introductory course, as mentioned in the course description. But a very useful and recommended course for anyone interested in genetics and medical research.",
    "if you are interested in learning about epigenetic and more about genetics in epidemiology, this is a great introductory course that exposes you to various topics. it is also a challenging course that really provokes you to think and engage with the material.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to students who are interested in learning about GWAS. If you put in your effort and are genuinely interested in learning about genetics in public health, you will obtain alot!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "excellent teacher and homeworks leave you with a useful skillset in the lab",
    "This course was great!!",
    "This course will be a little hard for students who don't have much related knowledge.",
    "it is really a good course for students who are interested in human genetics. But the course itself is not so easy and will take time to understand for students without a close background.",
    "Excellent, highly recommended",
    "Great course. Broad knowledge. Less computer labs would be beneficial.",
    "Great course for those who have a good foundational knowledge of genetics. For those who do not, this course may be a bit more challenging. However, the professor is phenomenal and I'm sure would be more than happy to help fill in those knowledge gaps so long as you seek help. I've learned a lot about genetics in public health research, but also about all the programming software used for genetics research in general. Wonderful course and extremely recommended."
