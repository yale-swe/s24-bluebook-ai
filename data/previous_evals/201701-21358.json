    "I think the course is strong in its design. I did feel that my class spent too much time discussing in the abstract what the essays were about and not enough time discussing how they were written (the latter being significantly more useful in developing skills as writers), but this was probably more an artifact of my section than of the class itself.",
    "Good discussion environment, fair assessment of abilities",
    "strengths: drafting, workshopping, reading pieces of students essays, reading long-form narrative weaknesses: sometimes the pedagogy (i.e. reading a lot of essays) failed when we had to do a lot in one night and had little time to discuss. I would honestly recommend eliminating the Norton Reader from the course and keeping DFW, and making us print some of the essays --kind of a waste of money and also made the guidelines too strict for the course (i.e. prescribed readings, and a lot were really bad)",
    "Taught very well. No real weaknesses. The readings were interesting and applicable and the essays were fun to write and graded fairly!"

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who feels confident in his\/her analytical writing abilities. Someone who doesn't have a strong background in analytical writing will probably benefit from taking English 114, but anyone who comes from a high school with a strong English department will definitely learn more from English 120.",
    "If you're interested in improving your writing, this class is a must-take. We read some of the most interesting modern essays and talk about them at length. Spending time on constructing your own essays is also very rewarding.",
    "YES! really an incredible WR credit, especially compared to ENGL 114 and 115 (though I havent taken them). workload is daunting at first but I feel like a much stronger writer after having written and edited 5 essays. good readings for most seminars, especially david foster wallace. great teachers",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly!",
    "Yes, it was interesting and improved my writing."
