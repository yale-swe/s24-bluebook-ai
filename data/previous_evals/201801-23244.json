   "comments": [
    "Critical thinking skills",
    "Estimation",
    "Knowledge about the physical and observable universe. Knowledge about large abstract and relevant calculations and estimations.",
    "The most useful skill I developed in this class was definitely order of magnitude estimation. We learned how to estimate crazy things like the amount of oil humanity has used or how many people the state of Connecticut can feed, which I certainly could not have imagined doing before taking this class. I would say we got an unusual perspective on Earth's unique place in the universe and that overall, this course lets you explore a lot of topics that you might not otherwise cover in an ordinary astronomy class.",
    "This course has a little bit of everything. Rather than being a normal introductory Astro course with equations and physics, this class was more discussion based. I developed the ability to estimate seemingly unreasonably large quantities, like \"how many grains of sand are there on Earth?\" The way we talked about the universe and especially life was really eye-opening and made me view many aspects of our existence in new ways.",
    "I learned not to be afraid of order of estimation and basic astronomy information",
    "order of magnitude estimation, some important physics ideas.",
    "This class taught me how to be able to answer crazy questions simply by using my knowledge and estimates. I love the fact that I know can estimate how many ants are on earth, the flowers on Yale's campus, and many other random things to an order of magnitude simply by using my best estimates.",
    "I really mostly developed order-of-magnitude estimation skills within the context of astronomy.",
    "This class helps develop an understanding of order-of-magnitude estimation and the history of Earth, the Sun, and other celestial bodies.",
    "How to perform large scale estimation, applicable to real life.",
    "A real eclectic mix of stuff was learned, to be honest, not just limited to astronomy. Or rather, was covered by the class. One actual skill I think I acquired from the class was a more successful approach to order-of-magnititude problems, which I really appreciate. Other than that, much of the material was covered in a way that felt like memorizations and scattered fun facts.",
    "I learned how to estimate to order of magnitude almost any large scale scientific quandary. I also gained an introductory to astronomy from the perspective of the basic chemistry, biology, and physics of the Earth.",
    "I dramatically improved my estimation skills and have a much deeper quantitative understanding of the world around me after taking this course.",
    "I developed the skill of being more confident in making estimations. I also think I got a way better grasp on units and measurements, as well as more macroscopic theories about the universe and our place in it (including problems here on Earth like global warming)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Amazing professor, amazing knowledge!",
    "The course felt like a lot of BS honestly, I felt like the professor didn't answer answers in an effective manner",
    "Highly engaging course. Math was tough at times, but overall great course.",
    "I would say that section is extremely useful for answering the homework. Professor Laughlin is a really engaging lecturer, and he makes challenging ideas seem very accessible. I would say, though, that overall the course is a little disorganized, often jumping from topic to topic without any clear connection.",
    "This course was awesome: engaging lecture, good workload, semi-optional section.",
    "Incredible course, a great way to get engaged in science if your not a science major",
    "great class, some more structured notes would help to retain material.",
    "This class was great. It was a wonderful class that taught me a lot about the earth and its cosmic context and also how to do life skills.",
    "It does a good job of preparing non-STEM majors to encounter problems that require critical\/scientific thinking. It could be clearer form the outset that the class only sporadically has to do with astronomy, the psets exams and homeworks could be more consistent with each other in terms of content and format, and it would be better if exam prep didn't involve memorizing a sheet of facts and equations.",
    "How could be improved: be clearer about exams",
    "The class is pretty interesting, but some of the psets are incredibly difficult relative to what has been taught in lecture. Professor Laughlin is nice and interesting but can be unclear at times. Taking word-for-word notes is not that helpful but listening to the big concepts in lecture is useful for both psets and tests.",
    "This class was pretty messy, in all honesty. The lectures were often too simple or too esoteric at the same time, and the class, while attractive for it's non-QR credit (which is in itself a slight misnomer) actually suffers for it, wherein we learn a lot of concepts without the math\/logic to back it up. The homeworks were often too broad or too specific to the point where I wasn't sure how much I should\/could use online resources to answer the questions for me.",
    "The class is a brilliant introductory science credit class. We learn far more than just basic astronomy (of which we learn a lot), but we also gain a deep understanding of a range of basic scientific problems and how they apply to our lives right now. Lectures were well organized (and lecture notes were well written). TA sections were also incredibly helpful.",
    "This was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. It is graded very harshly and the professor is all over the place.",
    "I loved the way this course was set up. I think the PSets were difficult but we were given ample resources to complete them and get good grades on them. I think the lectures meandered a bit sometimes which made it hard to know which concepts were important to learn, but I generally enjoyed listening to them anyways!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, please.",
    "Yes, if only because it's a relatively chill, non QR science credit",
    "This is a great Sc course to take for non STEM people. Laughlin ensured that the material we covered extended far beyond Astronomy, leaving us with some extremely compelling insights meant to challenge our conventional world view. Lecture was engaging, and homeworks were actually enjoyable. You learn some pretty crazy stuff about how the world works and problems future generations will have to face. Laughlin wants everyone to succeed, and the math is pretty simple. Seriously, take this course.",
    "Yes, if you have any curiosity about our universe!",
    "I would recommend this course with a caveat: it's hard to get comfortable with the types of wild questions that Professor Laughlin likes to ask, so it definitely requires some adjustment to the possibility that you probably will not know exactly how you should answer a question. Lectures are interesting and give you a really different take on Earth than you might get in another astronomy class. Section is really useful for help in doing the homework, but the overall workload is very low (only 5 psets, a midterm, and a final). I would say this is a good, relatively low-stress science credit.",
    "I totally would recommend this course, its like the secret gem science credit. Professor Laughlin is hilarious but he also has a lot of interesting takes on life and the universe that will make you question a lot of your assumptions. He is big on encouraging you to think for yourself and be a skeptical consumer of information. The homeworks were a mix of technical work and critical thinking. If you want to talk about energy in terms of pop tarts this is the class for you.",
    "YES. This has been my favorite class at Yale. The professor is very engaging, the TF was very helpful and available. The information was fascinating and the material challenged me to learn outside of my comfort zone but in a great way.",
    "yes, great class to learn big picture thinking and estimation problems.",
    "YES! I would definitely recommend this class. It teaches you very useful skills and the professor Greg is an amazing guy who is funny, witty, and very knowledgable.",
    "Not unless you know what you're getting into in terms of it being not really about astronomy and being really about estimation.",
    "Yes -- teaches you how to think in interesting ways",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone looking to complete a science credit if they are willing to spend some time working on class material outside of lecture and attend every lecture.",
    "Yes! Especially if you need a Sc credit. Super enjoyable and prof Laughlin is awesome.",
    "No, I wouldn't. I felt frustrated by nearly every class meeting, and I wish there were more cohesive\/coherent\/applicable science classes for non-STEM-inclined folks.",
    "Would definitely recommend as a science credit to any Humanities minded person (or really anyone!). It's a very philosophical and practical science class. You learn a range of skills to view science articles with educated skepticism, and to solve any problem with a calm and solid sense of estimation. The Professor is also hilarious.",
    "Absolutely. I learned a lot and received clear feedback.",
    "No",
    "I totally would. Im not a STEM major and needed a science credit and Im so happy to say that through this course I learned valuable information that will stay with me, met great adult professors\/TAs, and formed strong bonds with my classmates. Im super pleased with what this class gave me."
