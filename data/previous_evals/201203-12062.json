    "Yes!",
    "HSAR112 is an excellent survey class that covers the development of art over the ages. With two short five page essays and a reasonable amount of reading the class is fantastic and simple. The lecture is well done and is worth your time especially if you want to explore Art History. This class is recommended and I find that a trip to the Met in NYC during Fall Break or Thanksgiving Break is a great way to get to see the art you study. The class is not difficult but does require memorization and basic inference abilities.",
    "Really great course if you are looking for a basic background in art history. Both professors are really great and the sections are really fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in art history. The material is fascinating and section is a wonderful experience. But for anyone looking for an easy way to fulfill humanities requirements, find another class.",
    "The class is not quite a nemerov but it is a good survey. It seems less suitable for art majors, however.",
    "Yes and no. The class was fascinating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 lecture was mind-blowing every day and I learned SO much in section. My writing and descriptiveskills skyrocketed. However, the exams are dreadful. I did well on both grade-wise, but I put in A LOT of studying. Definitely take the course, but start studying for exams early so you can space it out.",
    "I thought that the class was very well structured and very informative. Although I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of material, I thought that it was a very useful survey as it exposed me to a vast chunk of the history of the art, which I never really explored in the past. Section took place at the YUAG for most of the semester which was really fun. Both the professors are good lecturers, although they have very different styles.",
    "Take this class if Jung and Gaifman are teaching it together. It is a great chance to learn a huge amount from two different professors on the history of western art traditions. Be careful though, the second half is a bit more confusing and there are a lot of cathedrals! Also, section in the YUAG is great and having an awesome TA can make the class so worth it! Not a lot of work, a ton of amazing art.",
    "Overall I would recommend this class. I thought it was definitely lacking in some areas, but for the most part it does give you the background you'll need for many early art history classes. Be warned, though, that although it claims to be an intro to all art history, it really focuses almost entirely on Greece, Rome, and early Christian art, glossing over or entirely omitting other important civilizations.",
    "I think there are better art history classes, but for someone looking for a art history class that is not too overbearing, this is the class to take. I think for junior\/seniors looking to take on before graduating this would be okay for a letter grade or credit\/d. I think someone interested in possibly studying art history a 200-level course might be more engaging. On that note Intro Art does establish the basics and you get a wonderful introduction to the art gallery, which is invaluable.",
    "Definitely recommended if you're interested in getting a broad overview of the history of Western art from prehistoric to medieval periods. It's a survey class, so it sacrifices depth for breadth, but I nonetheless came away a lot of interesting and important general info\/themes that gave me a greater appreciation for the study of art history. Section is terrific - especially when you're examining the art in the YUAG. The professors are solid and the material engaging for the most part, so go for it! Overall, not a very difficult class (two relatively open-ended papers, two somewhat challenging exams) and well worth it.",
    "A good survey intro to Art History for those (like me) who haven't taken any HSAR courses before, but who have an interest in the area. This course in particular was cool for me because it rekindled my childhood interests in ancient Egyptian history and Greek mythology. Most weeks our sections met in the art gallery, which was awesome and something that added a lot to the overall experience of the class.The two professors have different lecture styles, with Prof Gaiffman painting a narrative that is easier to follow, but both did a fine job.",
    "Its a great introduction to art history and even if you arent going to major in it, it has a lot of good information that is helpful to know.",
    "I would say that this is a tale of two courses. The first half of the course, taught by Prof. Gaifman, is a phenomenal survey of cave paintings, Egyptian art and architecture, Ancient Near East art and architecture, Greek art and architecture, and Roman art and architecture. Unfortunately, the second half of the class, taught by Prof. Jung, focuses almost exclusively on Christian art and cathedral architecture. There are some very brief forays into northern European pre-Christian art and Islamic architecture, but the focus is mainly on depictions of Jesus and various saints. The switch between professors in the middle of the semester further contributes to a lack of unity in the course. Additionally, Prof. Jung inconveniences students by forcing them to use the ARTStor viewer, which requires turning off security settings to use in Mac OS X 10.8, instead of PowerPoint. There isn't much workload in this course, but it is very frustrating to spend a substantive amount of time taking screenshots of the ARTStor viewer since it doesn't provide a convenient way to access the photos of artwork.",
    "HSAR 112 was disappointing, but probably a good choice if you're looking for a chilled gut class. Gaifman and Jung are without a doubt very distinguished, but they didn't complement one another as lecturers and seemed a bit out of touch with students. Great opportunity to spend time in the YUAG though.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Even if you are not interested in art history, this course provides lessons that are helpful in life. The instructors\/TA's are incredible, and students are very lucky to experience learning from them.",
    "A really good opportunity to get yourself cultured! My favorite part was during the first half of the course, which focused on Greek and Roman arts. The second half focused on medieval arts and involved many architectural knowledge. I would definitely recommend the course to any student who is interested in the subject. The two professors are a good pair and the learning experience is very good in general. You get to visit the Yale art gallery almost every week!",
    "Strong recommend this course for everyone as a general knowledge course",
    "You will never look at the art and architecture around Yale the same way. Take the class just so your next visit to the Yale Art Gallery becomes a lot more involved.",
    "intro HSAR was fantastic as a Credit D. I highly recommend this course to anyone. The lectures are interesting and full of visual references, including on-site photos taken by the professor, video documentaries made by the professor, and incredible online records to world wonders I would not have found on my own. The midterm had 113 images to memorize, and the final about half that number with an essay of broad topic. This class made me want to travel Europe and the Middle East to experience the art& architecture in person."
