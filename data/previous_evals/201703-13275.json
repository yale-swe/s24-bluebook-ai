   "comments": [
    "The course introduced to me the Industrial Ecology concept.",
    "Almost none. This was a survey course. I hear that last year the course was highly technical and mathematically oriented, and students didn't like that. This year they seem to have overcorrected. Even a little bit of quantitative analysis or hard skill development would have been nice, especially considering that IE is highly quantitative in nature.",
    "Gained an overview of what Industrial Ecology is and basic knowledge of the tools used in the discipline. Topics included metal recycling, industrial symbiosis, LCA, IE around the world, etc. Project was a good deep dive into an aspect of IE, provided practical knowledge and experience.",
    "Insight into the industrial roles of metals materials I hadn't previously considered as important. Insight into current trends in recycling and industrial processing. The cutting edge of research into this transdisciplinary field. Better understanding of the specific methods, techniques, and terms associated with Industrial Ecology (such as MFA, circular economy, etc), and evaluation of those methods, techniques, and terms within the context of science and policy.",
    "I learned the core theoretical concepts behind industrial ecology, reading fundamental papers and articles about it. I learned to think about how \"things\" in our human built environment are all connected to each other, and also dependent on Earth's resources. Introduction to Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Analysis were crucial.",
    "I learned how to think about industrial ecology concepts and the flow of materials and energy",
    "I gained a good foundation in Industrial Ecology concepts and theories",
    "I learned about tools, methodological approaches, areas of focus, and areas of debate within Industrial Ecology. I learned many things in this class, but as a whole, I have a fuller appreciation for the need to study how materials and energy move throughout their entire lifecycles, and not just in their use phase.",
    "I was very unfamiliar with industrial ecology prior to taking this class. I will now view other environmental problems with system thinking and am happy to have taken the class.",
    "This course helped me take a macro perspective on the movement and life cycle of materials around the world.",
    "I gained perspective on the field of industrial ecology and was able to think about its applications to my research. I also learned some basics of conducting material flow analyses and life cycle analyses, although more in-depth training of LCA will be required before I can put that to use.",
    "A survey of the techniques and practices involved in the discipline of industrial ecology."

   "comments": [
    "I expected the course to be more practical and solution-oreinted. I also expected the course to highlight and analyze the best practices of industrial ecology symbiosis worldwide. However, we only briefly covered real IE examples. I learned about the concept but overall the course did not provide skills needed for the work (even analyzing LCAs).",
    "I wasn't sure what I was expecting from this course, but overall it was pretty soft.",
    "This course was a little more basic that I was expecting. The topics were expected, but I expected a bit more information, a little more depth even for a survey course.",
    "I learned a whole lot during the course but some of my expectations for course content were not met. Several lectures fell short of their mark and the guest lecturers were extremely uneven in quality. However, some of the course content was absolutely revelatory and amazing. Although it could be frustrating on a day-to-day level, I think overall the course really changed my outlook in important ways.",
    "They aligned well. I got an introduction to the core concepts of industrial ecology.",
    "The knowledge and skills I learned aligned with my expectation because I learned material flow analysis and life-cycle assessment which were two things I was hoping to learn about in the class",
    "I think I expected a little bit more. I feel like the course could have gone more in depth in some areas",
    "Very well. I expected a survey course on Industrial Ecology the discipline, which is what I received. I did not expect to engage with the course project as much as I did, but this was a very good and rewarding surprise.",
    "This class aligned with my expectations.",
    "Aligned well",
    "They aligned well.",
    "I did not have any experience with industrial ecology prior to taking this course, so the information presented met my expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed working on the debates and group presentation the most. First of all, we were given a lot of freedom and enough time to have a quality research on the issues. I definitely learned the most from these two assignments. The slides at times needed to be updated with the new data. There was a lot of overlap in the information discussed in class and it felt sometimes that the course pace is way too slow. We also did not discuss enough the real-world examples of circular economy or industrial ecology... The homework was poorly explained and it was challenging at times to get some clarification on the assignments from the TAs.",
    "I enjoyed class and the materials that we covered over the course of the semester. I engaged with my final project and it connected key concepts from lecture in a practical manner. That being said, the frequent small assignments felt more like busy work than actually contributing to my knowledge or understanding of IE. Furthermore, I felt like I didn't get any feedback until the very end.",
    "Lots to be improved on. More hard skills, please. The last half of the course almost felt like a waste of time like the lecturers were just running out the string. Lectures like \"Scenarios\" were particularly frustrating. By the end it was clear everyone was checked out. The TAs were so unorganized and could not get feedback to us. My midterm was only just graded a couple weeks ago! The rubric\/guide for our final presentation was given to us the day before our final presentations!!!! There was so little guidance on the technical front that it was hard to accomplish anything in this course. Several of the assignments seemed like busy work.",
    "Strengths: - Good breadth of knowledge - Projects were very interesting - Readings were interesting and appropriate both in length and topic for the course - Great guest lecturers! Weaknesses: - Some assignments seemed like busy work and didn't help me to learn that much more than just the readings - Some topics were repeated unnecessarily. The time could have been used to go into more depth in more practical knowledge",
    "I would like some more content on policy recommendations and other ways to apply this material to careers outside of industry. A bit too much focus on academic researchers and their work\/publications. This academic focus meant neglecting the applied and real world content that most of the class was really interested in. Most of the written assignments were unsatisfying-- they were either way too hard or way too easy. Make written assignments relate to the readings and lecture content so the students feel like the course holds together. In class discussions tended to be unsatisfying, just one-sentence comments from the loudest\/\"best\" students without any attempt to analyze or engage in actual discussion. Have a weekly TA session!! There were two profs and two TAs and you could barely get any time with anyone. With some of the more complex course topics, I would have very much enjoyed talking for an hour with a TA just to be sure I understood.",
    "Strengths - intro to industrial ecology concepts. Weaknesses - the final project felt forced. My actual project was more about statistics than about concepts from industrial ecology. I also think our \"clients\" had differing expectations - they wanted actionable recommendations, while we could only provide approaches using industrial ecology.",
    "The strength of the class was in the professors' teaching style and their ability to convey material in clear and effective way. The homeworks were not well suited for the course. It was hard to see the point in some of the homeworks as there was no clear takeaway from them.",
    "clarity in learning objjectives for each graded assignment. A lot of the grading seemed arbitrary and didn't give credit where credit was due and docked for things not emphasized.",
    "I learned a little about a lot, which was good. At the same time I feel like I would have liked to dig into concepts more and gain concrete tools",
    "Most lectures were well planned and delivered. Guest lecturers were well chosen. All lecturers promoted good class discussions. The course project was a lot of fun and a valuable learning experience. The big weakness in the course is the homework and midterm exam, which were graded late and with minimal feedback.",
    "I really enjoyed the class project and felt that I got a lot out of that experience. I also really enjoyed the readings but found that there was a disconnect between what we were reading about and learning in class and some of the homework assignments. I understand that this was a survey course and that there was a lot to cover in the course. It would have helped me to have a little more discussion about the goals of the homework assignments before they were due.",
    "Weakness is the workload seemed like a lot at the end. Assignment four overlapped with heavy lifting of final project. Hard to stay motivated to keep reading near the end. Wanted to read but was overwhelmed by the other assignments and final project at end. Strength is I came out with greater range of systems thinking.",
    "This is a survey course, and thus it tries to tackle a lot of information and ways of thinking. I think it would be helpful to spend a little longer practicing how to analyze or utilize certain tools, such as MFA and LCA, in class. The greatest weakness of the course was the assignments. The expectations and outcomes were not discussed in class, the directions were often confusing, and the evaluations occurred very late.",
    "This was a great survey course that provided a holistic view of the field of industrial ecology. I enjoyed the class discussions we would have, when other students would relate their prior work experience to what we were learning in class. Generally, I did not feel especially challenged by the material and thought we could have gone a bit more in-depth, particularly with quantitative skills, but it was a nice \"chill\" class to break up a more difficult schedule. Would have liked to get feedback on assignments a bit more quickly.",
    "Strength is that the two instructors, Marian and Tom, are excellent complements for each other. Weakness is that it can be disorganized at times, with TAs telling conflicting deadlines and taking a long time to receive grades back."

    "I don't really have much nice to say about this course. The professors were nice and pretty engaging. Overall, unless they change the material around significantly, I would pass on this class.",
    "If you are looking for a more intellectually stimulating course, this class is perfect. If you are looking for more practical, applicable knowledge or learning a concrete skill, consider other courses.",
    "The course topics are fantastic but the course itself is somewhat of a patchwork.",
    "Take the course if you mean to go further down the industrial ecology course, into doing real LCAs and MFAs.",
    "They should rely on the lectures because they provide the basis of learning in this class",
    "Take it if you want to be inspired and learn about what IE is",
    "The class project will be rewarding if you put in time and effort, and engage with the material.",
    "This is a great survey course of industrial ecology and a systems view of environmental studies.",
    "Don't expect to be very challenged or gain any especially deep insights, but this is a solid class that will provide you with some useful perspectives in a relaxed environment. The experience is definitely what you make of it, especially in terms of the project.",
    "If you're a self-started, you will get the most out of this class."
