   "comments": [
    "The hardest course I've taken at Yale, but also the most rewarding. The reason is Professor Horan. She is demanding, but she knows her stuff. In the first part of the course, you analyze frameworks of city politics which is agonizing in the moment, but so worth it later on. I now feel like I'm so far ahead of my fellow students studying urban politics. Be wary, the workload is heavy: you have to read *everything* and weekly reading comments are basically 2-3 page papers. But if you put in the time, it's so worth it.",
    "Urban Politics and Policy is a class that I would only recommend to a student who has a real interest in policy issues and the theoretical frameworks that cities function within. You may feel lost at times, as the readings can be long and boring, but seminar is generally engaging and Professor Horan is a great option for those of you hoping to write a senior essay in political science!",
    "The class is an in-depth analysis of urban politics and governments and the problems associated with it in the hopes that you can think critically of causes to the problems and potential solutions. It involves a manageable but dense reading amount per week and weekly reading comments. Take the class if you are genuinely intrigued by urban government& politics. Professor Horan is great. I would recommend it because it exposes you to readings of several key urban scholars and forces you to think critically of very modern problems.",
    "Good professor, interesting and important material, but very frustrating syllabus and course plan. Significantly too much reading each to do any of it carefully, a problem compounded by the useless and time-consuming weekly reading responses. In fact the reading-load was so heavy that we often spent all of class just explaining the various readings instead of engaging in any real analysis or conversation between the articles. And having students ineptly \"teach\" six full classes seriously limited the quality of the discussions for almost half the semester.This is a very good course, but as currently constituted I would not recommend it - it simply demands too much busywork for what you get out of it.",
    "PLSC 245 is a seminar on urban politics and policy. This means that it is focused on understanding how city politics works and how politics influences policy-making.The first half of the course is dedicated to studying abstract theories of urban politics. The readings are slightly dense but necessary in my mind for fully appreciating the second half of the course, which is dedicated to examining the politics of 3 policy issues (reforming urban bureaucracies such as the police, reorganizing urban regions, and rebuilding New Orleans). It's a good balance of theoretical and practical.The discussion is intense and high-quality. Reading responses force you to think about the class thoroughly every week.Professor Horan is tough, but in the best way. She will teach you so much.In sum, the class is challenging in the very best way. Take this course if you're interested in the subject at all and want a challenging and very rewarding academic experience.",
    "Absolutely! Urban Politics and Policy was a truly fantastic class. Professor Horan is incredible, and anyone with even the remotest interest in cities should DEFINITELY take a class with her at some point.Not the hardest class ever, but not the easiest. The reading load is pretty standard (4-5 articles per week), and there's a weekly 1-2 page reading response. There's two 12 or so page papers - they're not super demanding. She's not an easy grader, but its certainly possible to do really well, especially if you meet with her to get a sense of what she's looking for.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend PLSC 245. It's a great introduction to some of the theory behind urban politics, as well as some case studies in policy-making.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I'd recommend this course to a political science major before recommending it to student unfamiliar with the political science discipline. I enjoyed the class but the readings were quite dry and all this talk about theory through the use of plastic terminology offended my more romantic and flourishing sensibilities. This is not a class so much about case studies (which I hoped it would be) and more a discussion on structures, actors, etc... Coming as a history major, I didn't so appreciate turning sterilizing events and characters with political science lingo.",
    "Great class--probably my favorite this semester. Prof. Horan is exacting (and a relatively hard grader) but brilliant, and discussions were always interesting and mostly lively. The organization of the class is one of its strengths: we start out by studying \"frameworks\" through which scholars study urban politics, and then apply them in the second half of the class to three different broad policy areas, the classes for which are led by groups of students. I thought this really tied the class together and provided diverse perspectives on the topic. The class is probably more work than your average seminar, and you'll probably get a slightly lower grade, but I thought the class experience was worth it.",
    "I recommend this course to those who are interested in urban studies. Yale doesn't provide enough urban-related courses, but fortunately here's one that allows students to see the politics\/policy side of urban issues. It'll give students a better understanding of how city governments work and how urban policymakers think.",
    "Recommend. Great class, but lots of work. Worth it if you are really interested in the material, take a look at the syllabus.",
    "Overall, this course is quite good. It is essentially divided into two halves: in the first, Prof. Horan leads discussion on the more theoretical readings that lay out frameworks for thinking about urban politics; in the second, student groups lead discussions on particular policy issues. Personally, I didn't care for the student-led seminars. I found them almost invariably worse than the ones led by Prof. Horan, but perhaps the format just didn't work with the class in this particular year. In any event, I do recommend the class - it's a very good introduction to urban politics.",
    "Great class; you will learn a lot about the topic and have a better sense of what really matters when it comes to the decisions that affect metropolitan areas. Understanding how urban scholars approach contemporary issues regarding \"communal\" space and propose strategies to ameliorate them is very interesting and something anyone should want to learn about because it affects our everyday life. I would recommend this course, just make sure to do the reading and actually form an opinion and the ability to delineate between the viewpoints of authors you will be reading."
