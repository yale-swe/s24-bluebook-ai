   "comments": [
    "Our section was a combination of undergrads and grad students, and both were up for engaging with the text and had great things to say. As usual the people make the seminar. If you think you're the kind of person who would enjoy spending a semester with Rousseau--and with Steven Smith (who is brilliant and enigmatic, imposing, hilarious, and endearing all at once)--then you're likely to get along with the group. Even if you were lukewarm about DS but Rousseau or the Romantics really got to you, give it a try. Rousseau's philosophy is much less dense and more colorful and lively than others, and the second half of the course is devoted to his novel (Julie) and to his more novel-like treatise on education (Emile). It's nearly impossible to separatethe philosopher from the man, and Rousseau can be at turns insightful and aggravating (btw, speaking in paradoxes will become your modus operandi). This course is suitable both for those who only know Rousseau through one or two writings (and WANT to know more) and for those who have more exposure. Two regular papers or one long one--very straightforward.",
    "Rousseau is so wonderfully amazing. I loved being able to read him in his own right, without having to reduce him to how he has been judged and misinterpreted throughout history. Rousseau is such a great writer, and every week this reading was by far my favorite homework. He writes on so many different topics, but it all fits together, and has had an influence on so many different parts of life. I'm so glad I got to spend a whole semester with this incredible human being.",
    "Yes, by all means, although it is bound to be a popular course.",
    "Steven Smith remains one of the best seminar leaders who has taught me at Yale. He chooses readings judiciously and knows how to ask the kinds of questions that will inspire good discussions about those readings. Moreover, his classes always seem to have a collegial and communal feel, which also makes discussion friendlier and more fun. If you have the opportunity to take a seminar with Smith on any subject, take it.",
    "The course was a great exploration of Rousseau's major works. The readings were wonderful and the discussion always lively--it helped that Professor Smith has a group of very smart students who seem to take every class they can with him. It was not until the end of the course that I fully realized how well Professor Smith had crafted a narrative arc to contextualize Rousseau and how we had really tied together the various faces of Rousseau by dealing with the major questions about his thought in each of his very different works. One of the only flaws in the discussion, I thought, is that Professor Smith called on students only in the order they raised their hands. That makes it difficult to have a real conversation in which the students are responding to each other. The discussion often felt disjointed as a result, as each student dealt with a different issue.Nonetheless, all of the discussions seemed to come together in a way that really furthered my understanding of the material. Professor Smith's seminar offered a rich and nuanced view of Rousseau that I could not have gained from reading his major works independently. Definitely recommended if he teaches it again. Also, Rousseau is a beautiful and very versatile writer--worth reading no matter what (and not just the Social Contract).",
    "In this class you'll read a broad span of Rousseau's works, spanning the public and private. Professor Smith is an engaging professor and leads great class discussions - enjoy!",
    "This class was wonderful. It's sad that this class probably won't be offered next year--but definitely take a class with Professor Smith if you ever get a chance!!!",
    "Wow. Rousseau at 300 was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, hands down. I loved Jean-Jacques Roussseau as a thinker since before freshman year, and I've always wanted to be in a seminar with Steven Smith, but the combination of the two was incredible. Short but very pithy readings, not too muchwriting but enough to test your engagement with the texts, extremely intelligent students in the seminar, all led by a professor who asks you what YOU think about the arguments personally and whether YOU wish to apply them in your own life. What more could one ask for?",
    "I would. This is great material with a talented professor.",
    "A wonderful class encouraging close reading and connections between texts. The syllabus blended Rousseau's political philosophy texts with literature and even an opera listening-party; class unfolded with trademark Steven Smith eloquence followed by a DS-like discussion. Writing papers for this class was particularly enjoyable, again in part due to the literary emphasis.Steven Smith cares moreabout his classes than most, perhaps all, of the professors I have studied with at Yale. Announcing that RKZ was not \"conducive to philosophy,\" he moved us to the Branford Mendell room. That must have worked, since discussions were wide-ranging and fruitful. The class was strong in part because of the students it attracts, and the work Professor Smith does to create a space for their ideas. It improved over the course of the semester, as we moved from Rousseau's political writings to his more personal work, and as students were more comfortable responding to each other in discussion instead of offering tangentially-related soliloquies.I would certainly recommend this course to another student, and hope it is offered again. The kind of thing I hoped to get out of Yale."
