    "TAKE IT! TAKE IT! TAKE IT! (So great.)",
    "I don't think a lecture is the right way to read or learn about Tolstoy. I might have enjoyed this course much more if I had a better TA. The only way I would recommend this course is if you had an excellent section leader. Otherwise, it was not worth it.",
    "Good class to take if you've ever wanted to read War and Peace or other Tolstoyan classics. Professor Alexandrov's lectures are engaging and paint a whole picture of the 19th century Russian context, as well as providing interesting tidbits about Tolstoy's life. The pace of the reading is fast, but there are only two medium-length papers, and the final seems very straightforward. I recommend it to anyone interested in literature, Slavic Studies, or just a good fifth course.",
    "Great survey of Tolstoy's major short stories and two great novels. This course is wonderful. I would definitely recommend it to another student. any class with Professor Alexandrov would be wonderful.",
    "Wonderful. Great books, great lectures. Not a light load as far as reading is concerned, but the reading is such a joy it doesn't feel like work. The papers are a very doable length. It's worth it to show up for lecture, partially because Alexandrov is a great lecturer, and partly because then you don't have to worry at all about the final. Definitely take it if you think you might like Tolstoy.",
    "Take it - definitely. You read books that you should read anyways, but with a lovely professor to guide you through it. Reading is a bit onerous at times but there are only two 7-8 pp papers and a final exam (spot passages, easy if you've done the reading). I truly loved the course, the reading, and the professor -- a great class.",
    "yes!",
    "This definitely a course worth taking, just be sure to get into a good section. Tolstoy is spectacular, and Professor Alexandrov is wonderful lecturer and an even better reader from whom you will learn a lot. The TAs, at least my TA, did not live up to the standard set by Tolstoy and Professor Alexandrov. Fortunately, Professor Alexandrov makes himself available for consultation on papers and offers to read and grade papers. So, if you take the course, don't hesitate to take advantage of Professor Alexandrov's hospitality.",
    "I would definitely urge other students to take this class. It's a rare opportunity to get to read so many masterpieces and to learn about them from someone with such expertise and enthusiasm. I found the paper writing process to be very difficult because of the depth and breadth of the works that we read. I would definitely recommend taking up Professor Alexandrov on his offer to meet with you about your paper and grade it. I had a disappointing experience with my TA and would urge people taking the class to shop sections carefully if possible. As far as the notoriously heaving reading goes: just always stay ahead! (Read Anna K over spring break!)",
    "Great way to read great literature. If you're afraid that you won't be able to finish War and Peace or Anna Karenina on your own, read it in this course.",
    "Alexandrov is a fantastic professor, passionate about Tolstoy and his students. I'm not sure I have ever seen a professor more in love with his course material. Oh, and you get to read some of the greatest books ever written. Take this class.",
    "I loved the opportunity to read both War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and in general thought the lectures were well-structured and well-delivered. At times it was difficult because of the extent to which the professor pushed Tolstoy's philosophy--I, as someone who disagrees with Tolstoy about most things, would have preferred a more neutral stance.Take if you want to read the books, but probably not for the lectures. Also, shop sections if you can--some of the TFs are abysmal.",
    "There is a ton of reading (2000 pages just between War and Peace and Anna Karenina), but an excellent course that I got a lot out of. It's great literature for one, and Professor Alexandrov is a very good lecturer and very accessible too. He made himself available to the students and you can tell he has a passion for what he is teaching. Make sure you are up for a lot of reading, but it's enjoyable because of the engaging narratives you read. I recommend this course.",
    "The lectures were not nearly so good as the reading, but, as the reading list was incomparable, that's no insult.",
    "I loved this course! I know that I could not have read the entirety of War and Peace and Anna Karenina by myself, so I decided to take this course. Professor Alexandrov is an amazing lecturer, and you can pick your paper topics, which makes it easier to write them. These two novels are such that you can reinterpret the ending as many times as you read it! The course is amazing, and if you want to start reading or have read any of Tolstoy's works, take it!",
    "YES!!!!!!!!!!!If you enjoy reading and are interested in Tolstoy, TAKE IT!!!!!!Even if you don't, you should take it.War and Peace and Anna Karenina are works of literature that you need to read at least once in your lifetime, and might as well take it with an amazing professor here at Yale.",
    "Yes, take the course. It is one Yale's gems and I think anyone would love it. Alexandrov's lectures are the best I've heard at Yale.",
    "This class is amazing. You HAVE to take it. The only thing I would have changed about the course is to eliminate the section (they're useless and filled with some pretty annoying lit majors) and lengthen the lectures. Do not shy away from this class because you're scared of the workload. It's honestly very manageable. The most you will ever read is 250 pages a week and when you are assigned short stories it's more like 50 pages of reading. If a bunch of freshmen DSers can get through War and Peace in two weeks, I'm sure a smart person like yourself can read the book in a little over four.Take this course. It will change your life.",
    "A great class, especially if you take it credit D. Great professor, great reading, just a lot of it, and less than inspiring section.",
    "GREAT class. Take it if you want to read War and Peace and Anna Karenina in a class setting, which I could recommend. I don't think I would have gotten as much out of these books if I hadn't read them in a class. Professor Alexandrov is excellent, the books are great. Although it's a lot of reading to stay on top of. I took it Credit\/D so that made it easier and not the end of the world if I dropped a little behind on the reading. Take it credit\/d if you want to but take it!!",
    "A fair bit of reading, as you would expect in a class that covers War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I don't think the workload is more than your typical English\/literature class though, and it's 100% worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is willing--really willing--to keep up with the reading. Every text that we read was rich in content and a pleasure to read; despite the quick pace and the sheer enormity of War and Peace and Anna Karenina, I'm so glad I actually read every page. So I would discourage someone from taking this if they're planning to skim through the novels, just because it would be more profitable to skim through the novels on your own time and take a class that you actually want to do the work for.I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever read any Tolstoy and wanted to read more, or to anyone remotely interested in reading Tolstoy. I also would recommend this to a student looking to learn more profound ways to understand a text and to dig for meaning, because Alexandrov's approach is fascinating.",
    "Lots of reading! You don't have to do it ALL on schedule, but it is expected at some point. The lectures are interesting, if a bit thick. The work isn't too bad overall, however, as the final is very reasonable and there are 2 papers.",
    "Yes, because it is a good course on a profound writer.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS - Alexandrov is one of the great Yale lecturers and Tolstoy is one of the greats as well. Nothing bad about it. Easy work too, especially if you take it credit\/D - just be prepared to read two large texts and you're fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who likes Tolstoy. If there's a chance you won't like the reading it will be very hard to get through.",
    "Alexandrov is wonderful. I didn't finish some of the reading, but the way Alexandrov talked about them makes me want to spend the first part of my summer finishing all of War and Peace. I've never felt the urge to do this for another class.",
    "You read a ton of Tolstoy and listen to lectures about it.",
    "if you want to really read tolstoy, take it. it's a lot of reading (obviously), and if you get behind, i promise you will not catch up without sacrificing your other work. professor alexandrov is brilliant and that comes across during lecture, but sometimes it's a little boring and hard to pay attention. lots of people skipped lecture, but i found you have to go in order to be prepared for the final. the class assessment is structured like this: 25% midterm paper, 25% final paper, 25% final exam, 25% section participation. the papers are 7-8 pgs, but you don't get a lot of feedback from your TA. the final is quote IDs and was much easier than i thought it would be. do the readings and pay attention during lecture, and you'll succeed",
    "In this class, you read two really great books: Anna Karenina and War and Peace + Tolstoy's short works. Everyone should read these books! And Alexandrov's lectures are clear and illuminating."
