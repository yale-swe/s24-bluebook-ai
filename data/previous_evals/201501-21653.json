    "Great class. Good discussions, interesting material whether or not you're studying architecture or religion. Decent readings (and not too long), good guest speakers.",
    "A class that encourages you to explore something new!!",
    "Yes! It's a great small seminar and I feel like we really got to engage with the subjects in depth. Most students in the class are from architecture, but there was a surprisingly good deal of variety in age (third year grad student to freshman) and background.",
    "Religion and Modern Architecture presents a wide variety of architectural case studies via both visual and written sources and teaches students how to analyze, discuss, and formulate their own ideas about design and spirituality. It involved substantial readings and written responses on a forum, helping to foster a sense of effective class discussion both inside the classroom and on the web. Individual courses of study were also required, allowing students to learn and think more about relevant topics that interested them. It provides students with a breadth of knowlegde in the fields of architectural history and theory. I would recommend it to other students, as the course fulfills the above description."
