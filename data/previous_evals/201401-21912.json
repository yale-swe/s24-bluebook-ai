    "take it",
    "I really enjoyed this course. That said, its not really about the Political Economy of Foreign Aid. Also, its not taught like a 100 level course. This course is essentially a really laid-back upper level seminar on research methods. The only connection to foreign aid is that you discuss the research methods of papers related to foreign aid. It's a really chill, entertaining, informative class.",
    "Great class, I definitely recommend it. Basically you are jsut reviewing the current state of political science researching and discussing ways it can improve. Its super interesting and not ridiculously hard.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the right way to conduct political science research. Not that hard, not that much work, but some of the concepts may be a bit tricky if you don't have a statistics background. If you've never felt like taking a stats course though, you probably won't find this course interesting. Rooted in methods. The topic of foreign aid is almost incidental to what seems to be the real purpose of the course: defense against the dark arts of misused statistics in social science."
