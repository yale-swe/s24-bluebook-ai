    "Analytical skills required to read papers and follow lectures",

    "With this course I reviewed and, at the same time, went deeper in some empirical methods - like IV, RDD, selection models, and so on - and I also learned new methods and approaches, like bounds\/set identification, estimation from optimality conditions or from incomplete models, demand estimation, among others. The course also allowed me to face the first challenges of the research process: coming up with an idea, maturing it, presenting a project and obtaining feedback."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Covers a lot of topics in econometrics and applied micro Weaknesses: It is taxing for students not interested in econometrics and applied micro (game theory, auctions) to write summaries for the readings each class, since this course is a required course for all second year students and not all students will do econometrics and applied micro (game theory, actions)",
    "strength: Nice review of empirical methods and their application. weakness: the deadline to turn in the empirical paper could be longer.",
    "It was helpful in giving a broad view of several concepts in econometrics. I think this course would be better if there was more focus on helping us with our project. For example some time could be devoted to brainstorming sessions or trouble shooting with classmates. It would also be nice to have more structured support from the professors (for example, one meeting in the first quarter and one in the second quarter to help us with any questions we had)",
    "I believe the course is a great opportunity to develop an empirical paper - and to increase knowledge and skills in empirical work. The revision and presentation of new empirical models - and the presentation\/critical evaluation of excellent papers - complement the econometric formation students already have, favoring the upsurge of new ideas. The course also brought some topics that enlarged my horizons, as it was the case of estimation from optimality conditions and from incomplete models. My set of tools became wider after taking the course. The feedback professors gave in the presentation of the project and their availability to solve doubts contributed even more to this process of carrying a research paper. The course is really strong to polish students which already know econometrics, and also to present some new perspectives. It does not seem to be designed to a more systematic analytical learning (the focus is not on problem sets and on derivations, but on research, - and it does so very effectively)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. A good way to satisfy the second year empirical paper requirement.",
    "Yes",
    "I'm not sure. I wasn't expecting the material to be especially stimulating. I think maybe I expected it to be more helpful for writing the econometrics paper.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who already has a reasonable knowledge in statiscts and econometrics and is interested in reviewing\/learning empirical methods - or is interested in being presented to how theoretical models are used in empirical work. Also, I would make sure that the focus of this student is more on developing a research proposal than on acquiring\/reviewing analytical tools regarding the theory and derivations underlying the empirical methods. I believe the course would be really effective for these students."
