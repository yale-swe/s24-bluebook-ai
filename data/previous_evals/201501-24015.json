    "It's the ideal class for someone exploring history as an area of study. It will help you get a taste of everything--the range of reading material is wonderful and manageable. The interactive nature of activities makes homework fun. And your writing skills will improve tremendously!!",
    "I would recommend anyone who is interested in world history and having a comprehensive understanding of historians in the history. For me I learned what history study in college should be, how to read a book intelligently and critically, how to give a well-organized oral presentation, and how to write an effective, interesting and concise paper.",
    "I would recommend this course highly to any student, regardless of the course of study they wish to pursue. Professor Hansen is a professor everyone should vie to take a course from, and the experience of having her in the classroom is valuable enough.",
    "A great course that is less about actual history and more about how to do history. My writing improved exponentially over the course of the class, as did my approach to reading history texts.",
    "HIST 072 is a great course for an incoming freshmen, particularly if it is offered in the fall. Professor Hansen is an expert, both in her field and in navigating the complexities of Yale. The course is generally very interesting, especially with some of the non-traditional writing assignments. Furthermore, Prof. Hansen is very helpful in improving ones writing and manages to present an idea of history that is different from what is usually presented in high school. If you're interested in this topic, I definitely recommend the course."
