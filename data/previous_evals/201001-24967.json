    "Great course and overall experience. All of the instructors are great resources so make sure to ask them a lot of questions and seek out their advice.",
    "This is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. The trip to the rainforest is amazing, but the research that is done with the endophytes is equally amazing and is something that I am really looking forward to over the summer. I would definitely recommend this class, but I also have to say that you shouldn't let the beginning of the course give you the sense that you will have very little work to do, because right before spring break and immediately after you will be bogged down with work (enjoyable work, but still work).",
    "This course give students a unique opportunity to design their own research projects and take them from start to finish. It begins with eight weeks of class to prepare for a trip to the Ecuadorian rain forest during spring break. On the trip students collect samples of rare plants with documented uses, which upon return to campus are used to grow fungi in the lab. The natural products from these fungi are used in bioassays envisioned by the students in collaboration with other labs at Yale. The class is very light on work before the trip, but gets much more time-intensive after spring break. Expect to spend ~10 hours per week in the lab at the beginning, and ~5 hours toward the end. The summer portion of the course has not yet begun, but I very much look forward to it. This is a fantastic experience that has allowed meto go to one of the world's rain forests, design my own research, interact with great faculty on a personal level, and get to know a cool group of science students quite well.",
    "This is the best class at Yale, by far. It's not even a class, it's a wonderful, inspiring, and life changing experience\/opportunity. You need to take it. You'll actually never have a chance to have such a unique amazing adventure with such amazing people and be able to explore research independently, from the very beginning of asking a question to getting the chance to answer it, again.",
    "TAKE IT! YOU WILL NEVER EVER REGRET IT.",
    "This class is one of a kind. Anyone interested in biological research should definitely consider it. It is a LOT of work.",
    "TAKE IT. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. The chances of getting in are pretty good, and it's amazing to lock up a fantastic summer in January, not to mention that the trip to Ecuador was one of the coolest experiences of my life.",
    "If you're interested in research and having a genuine lab experience, TAKE THIS CLASS. You are actually doing your own work, which is practically unheard of for undergrads. When else are you going to have the opportunity to travel to the rain forest (practically for free) and continue working with your own samples over the summer? I've also made a bunch of friends in this class and am looking forward to spending the next several weeks together.",
    "Definitely take this course! All the instructors are excellent, class lectures are interesting and fun, and the spring break trip is an experience of a lifetime. This is also one of the few opportunities for undergrads to really take ownership of a research project.",
    "Yes. Take it if you are free in the summer and are an MBB or MCDB major.",
    "It is a great course. If you can get in and have a summer for research component, you should do it.",
    "YES. This class has been the best class that I've taken at Yale. I've made a lot of great friends in this course. And, I like the independence of this course, which allows you to develop your own assay and collection theme.",
    "This is the best class ever!!! We learned a lot of really interesting things about Ecuador in general and about botany in particular during the first half of the semester. The trip was absolutely amazing! It was so much fun, and it is really cool that every part of our projects is truly ours, from finding the plants in the rain forest all the way to conducting our assays and characterizing our compounds. I love that we are really able to shape our projects however we want but still get good advice about how to proceed. The professors and TAs are great! Basically, Rainforest Expedition was AWESOME!!!",
    "Take this class!!! This class will truly remind you why you chose to come to Yale. You not only get to embark on a unique and really individual research project, but you also get to know some of the most amazing students and professors here. The trip to Ecuador is really a life-changing experience too--it gave me a whole new perspective on what is really important and on the true goals of scientific research (in addition to severely abating my fear of dirt and cockroaches!). It was so much fun (rappelling down tree towers, hiking through really deep mud, swimming in hot springs), and the rainforest students have become some of my closest friends! Don't worry if you don't know how to swim or you don't think you can survive in the jungle for two weeks--you will be well taken care of and you stay in some of the most amazing and comfortable places. (Also, don't forget to pack a bathing suit like most of us did and get a really good headlamp because it is REALLY useful there!) Also, the work load is really not bad at all (basically reading two books, writing two papers, a problem set, and a couple of presentations and quizes). And take this course because you will get to meet Percy!!!!"
