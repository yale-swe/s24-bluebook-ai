   "comments": [
    "Very interesting. A little overwhelming at first. Just make sure you get the ideas he is trying to get across and the evidence that leads up to it, then you can enjoy dong the exams, which are mostly a reconstruction of that thinking.",
    "This course focuses on the genetics and neural underpinnings of mental illness, with a strong emphasis on schizophrenia (the instructor's area of research). It covers a lot of material in a very short period of time and may be hard to follow for students without any background in neuroscience or genetics. For those whose research pertains to this field, it's extremely useful and the instructor is very knowledgeable and passionate about this work.",
    "A great course for covering both the fundamentals(genes, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry) and for surveying current knowledge of a variety of mental disorders. I feel reasonably prepared to read original papers within the field if I need to.",
    "I great course for developing a better understanding of the current research in neuroscience and behavioral genetics on psychopathology, especially in schizophrenia and mood disorders.",
    "I would recommend it to another graduate student. It provides a good survey of basic neuroscience methods and how the area approaches the study of psychopathology."

   "comments": [
    "I have greater familiarity with how neuroimaging and genetic research can help answer important questions.",
    "This course was extremely useful to my research -- it gave me a working knowledge of much of the field that I'm in and what kind of similar work is being done in research across mental illnesses. I think Ty frames the theories in the field and what each of them would predict very well and offered a good foundation of how to consider and think about the questions in the field we still haven't answered.",
    "Provided greater understanding of the neural underpinnings behind the pathophysiology of psychopathology and explored behavioral genetics approaches to understanding and classifying psychopathology phenotypes.",
    "This course added to my knowledge of another approach to studying psychopathology and answering questions related to the etiology and maintenance of psychiatric disorders. It also provided an interesting perspective on how to approach the issue of discussing and classifying mental disorders."
