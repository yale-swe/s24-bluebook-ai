    "In theory, this could be a really good course. The basic concept is totally valid: humanities students should understand certain scientific concepts that figure prominently in everyone's live. To be informed citizens, we absolutely should know what we mean when we say we want to fight climate change, when we say we support (or don't support) federal funding for stem cell research, etc. BUT in reality, it's a terrible course, will make you question yourself, your education, and so on. It's very little work, and chances are half your friends will be in it, so it's not a particularly painful experience, just a pathetic one. And you do get a SC credit. It's team-taught by three professors; unfortunately, the first two were terrible, so by the time the third taught (Miranker) people had pretty much totally checked out, even though he was actually good. He should teach the whole course. But **sigh** he won't, because then he wouldn't be able to do his research. Three cheers for science education!",
    "This is a science-for-non-science-majors class. It is generally okay, occasionally exciting. The material was not as easy as I thought it would be, but the exams were as easy as I thought they would be. Don't forgot about the final paper.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.Relatively light workload.Section is fun! Try to get into Colleen's section, she is the BEST TA EVER. Learned more from her than the professors.There is no need to do the reading.Lots of memorization but not too bad.",
    "easy bio credit. class is ridiculous.you do learn some interesting things though. kind of like bioethics.",
    "It's a science class that goes over the very basics of biology. It's like a watered down version of AP bio. All the tests are fine if you study and go over the power points. Section is required, but definitely worth it because you don't really have to go to lecture. It teaches some interesting more modern day applicable science that was interesting and something I probably wouldn't have learned in a regular biology class. Enjoyed it overall. Get Ellen White as a TA if you can! She's so helpful!!",
    "A great way to get a Sc question. You will learn applicable material",
    "It's a good science credit.",
    "There were some weeks that I was excited about what we were learning, but I was not extremely happy overall with the course. I took this class to earn a science credit, and that was the biggest takeaway for me.",
    "not a lot of work; definitely need to study a great deal for exams and section is not too difficult",
    "It is a great way to learn about biology- from a societal perspective.",
    "Interesting. The professors in this class are amazing. Leaders in their fields and they are teaching non-science majors. The equivalent of Jeter teaching a six year old how to play whiffle ball. Listen to their personal stories. They are passionate about science and it was a great experience to be taught by them. Also, not too much work. Great for a non-science major.",
    "Great class for non-science majors. Take it!",
    "Take this - easy science credit for non-science majors that still teaches you some valuable information.",
    "It's not an easy gut science, but if you're willing to put in the serious time\/work and come to review sessions\/build a relationship with your TA, it's doable I suppose.",
    "Easy bio class, take it if you aren't super science-ey",
    "I would recommend this class to other non-science majors who need a science credit. Totally manageable workload, and you learn about some interesting and very relevant topics. Stress-free course",
    "Really interesting way to get a science credit without an excessive workload.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're a non-Science major who needs a SC credit. It's a pretty easy class that's interesting, too.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. At the end of the semester, I didn't really feel I had learned anything that I couldn't have learned from reading a few articles in the Science section of the NY Times. Even though I am not a science major, I would rather have obtained a science credit in a more difficult class that I could have gotten more out of. I also found many aspects of this course unfair, like how a huge amount of kids didn't go to lecture but still had all the notes, and how the same tests were given over the course of a few days so some kids had answers ahead of time.",
    "Very Interesting",
    "It's a solid science class for those of us who aren't too good at science.",
    "This class is thought of as a \"gut,\" but I'd caution students to enter it with the understanding that you WILL be studying hard for each test, working pretty extensively on the paper, and you should go to lecture just like any other course.With that said, the material in this course is very interesting, though the presentation of it is sometimes hindered by the effectiveness of the professors' lecture styles. Shop and see what you think, if you want a humanities-minded science credit.",
    "Choose another science class, if possible. Although the material itself is fairly easy, the lectures are so mind-numbingly boring that it quickly becomes physically painful just to attend lecture, thus making exams actually somewhat challenging (although the curve is generous as the athlete content of the class if fairly high). Avoid at all costs.",
    "This class is DEFINITELY not for science majors -- which is good if you're not one, and bad if you are. Personally, I chose NOT to major in science at Yale, but I have a really strong science background from high school (AP Bio, did an independent science research project in a real lab over the summer, Intel\/Siemens, etc.), and I thought this class was incredible basic and frankly kind of a joke; if this sounds like you, you might want to avoid this class. But if you have no background in science at all, this is the one for you. It's taught well for people with no prior scientific understanding. Everyone else, steer clear.",
    "A pretty good science for non-science majors--you learn some (very basic) science, and get to understand a lot of important scientific issues on a somewhat deeper level than you would by simply reading the NY Times or something.",
    "A good way to get a science background on some political issues, but if you're looking for a breeze of a science credit, this isn't for you: required section with written, graded work each week, 3 exams, and a research paper.",
    "yes if you're trying to get a science out of the way",
    "I would recommend it as a science gut, though the tests weren't quite as easy as I expected. There wasn't too much work, just 3 tests and a term paper, and sections were laid-back.",
    "Do not take this class",
    "If you are looking for a gut class, this is not it. The lectures are full of information, and some of the questions that show up on tests are completely arbitrary - this means you will have to study pretty much every slide. However, it's only marginally more difficult than high school biology, so if you enjoyed bio but you're not that much of a sciencey person, this class is the perfect blend.",
    "good basic science course",
    "Definitely take it. You learn interesting material that you'll see popping up everyone in newspaper articles and what not. I'd never taken any bio and you leave the course with a sense of what the subject is, and where the science is headed in the future. Which is cool. Cool stuff is on the way. Oh, and the class is as easy as pie.",
    "A solid science credit, especially considering the work load.",
    "Gut. Study a day before the exams and you'll be fine. That said, it's frustrating to be treated like a five-year-old; everyone here was at least decent at science in high school, right?",
    "If you're looking for a bearable but not fascinating easy science credit, this one is an okay choice. The material has it's interesting moments, but I felt like it didn't really form a cohesive whole, especially because 3 different professors teach it. Just hope that you have a cool TA like I did so that section, which is mandatory, isn't a pain.",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS. The tests were graded extremely hard and the TAs do not want you to get a good score. For science people, they take off points for every little thing in your writing. Do not be confused by the amount of athletes that take this class; you need to put in the time, and you still may not do well. Discussion sections are a waste of time.",
    "This is not a bioethics course-- don't be fooled! You \"approach\" biology by taking specific things like cancer or cloning and studying the biology behind it. Yes, you deal with a few ethical questions during section, but the focus is on learning the biology and connecting it to the issues. If you've taken AP bio (unlike me!) you won't have much trouble, but otherwise you'll have to study hard for tests and work extra on the research paper. Overall though, this class is not stressful on a day-to-day basis.",
    "If you're not a science student or have a small science background take this course.",
    "Take it if you want an easy science credit that you don't have to care about.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. It's not difficult, but it's not going to be particularly fun. Section feels like being back in high school.",
    "Yes good science",
    "Fantastic course that truly teaches you about some of the most important scientific issues in the news today - both about the science behind it and about the ethical etc. debates in the media. I would 100% recommend it to another student, particularly one who needs a science credit but actually wants to really learn something about science!",
    "do it if you need a science credit. some people whine about it, but it's really manageable and worth your while.",
    "Not bad if you need a science credit. You'll learn. Probably shouldn't skip class.",
    "Surprisingly strong class. I came in sort of disappointed I hadn't been able to find a more interesting science class to take for my Sc credit, but now feel fortunate I chose to take this class. The workload for section and 3 exams was enough to keep me feel like I was learning, but not too much ever to feel onerous. Sections were well designed and lively. It lived up to its goal of teaching limited, relevant, mostly rigorous scientific knowledge.",
    "A pretty difficult class not because the material was especially complicated but because of the way the tests were formatted. The paper was fun and allowed me to feel like I was really engaging with the science. You definitely have to go to lecture and study deeply but overall a decently easy science credit and pretty interesting",
    "Good class. Reading the recommended material would definetely clear up a lot of the concepts introduced in class.",
    "Yes. A decent amount of work outside of class can get you a solid grade without really having to be at lecture",
    "Expectations and material are straightforward. Go to lecture, actually memorize the material (which is reasonable if not light), apply some basic logic, participate in and prepare for section, and you'll be fine. Very consistent class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking for an easy science credit. The workload was light and the material was pretty interesting and important to know.",
    "Yes, it's a fairly easy class for non-majors. A great option!",
    "This is a good course for non-science majors. Not a bad workload, but the lectures can be kind of boring (and keep in mind that there are three professors and all have very different lecture styles). Make sure you study for the three exams! The paper is not bad at all, though. Also, there's a weekly section with group work, which is easy but make sure you go. Overall, not a completely painful way to get a science credit.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, especially for non-science majors. Very interesting and relevant, without going too in-depth with scientific detail. Very doable for non-science majors, and yet not boring, quite intriguing. A worthwhile science credit.",
    "I highly recommend MB&B 105 to students who are not science majors but want to be knowledgeable in major issues that are controversial or prevalent in our generation. It's important to not go into this class with the mindset that it is a gut class, because it does require work and effort to understand the biological processes. However, the material is interesting and can be very easy with outside work, especially for those that have already taken a biology class either here or in high school.",
    "Ye. I took it just because I am a non science major, and never expected to learn so much and become so interested in the subject. Probably the best science class I've taken at Yale.",
    "It is one of the more enjoyable and easier guts from what I have heard.",
    "This is a good class to take if you're looking for a casual Science credit. You'll have a bit of an advantage if you took AP Bio in high school, as the biology this class covers is only a little more than a review of that, and the articles you'll read about current issues related to biology are really interesting. It was so cool to learn the science behind relevant issues like infectious diseases and genetic engineering. The discussion section (which they refuse to let you miss) proved to be pretty helpful, and overall, the workload (weekly reading for section, three exams, and a final paper) was more or less manageable.",
    "MCDB 105 is a great course for those interested in learning about the science and issues (ethical, political, societal) of current topics in biology. The course workload is very feasible, and readings for section are interesting. Sections are group work, which helps further the understanding of what has been covered in lecture, and gives an opportunity for students to ask the TA any questions from lecture. the three exams make studying for each exam doable, and the paper at the end is a great way to explore any issue that has only been touched on in class, or has not been covered at all."
