    "How words mean and how meaning is produced.",
    "This was an introductory course to linguistic anthropology and provided a survey of core concepts and theories in the discipline.",
    "This course changed the way I view human language and meaning more generally. The foundational readings were rather abstract, but were critical in understanding the more tangible (\"cultural\") topics later in the course.",
    "I learned more than the sum of our far-reaching readings and discussions; I learned a new way to think! The course introduced me to a kind of abstract--but no less centered--and systematic framework in which it becomes possible to ask questions about meaning itself--why it matters, what it is, and how it works, especially when refracted through language, culture, and cognition. I got, I feel, a good background in some of the larger disciplinary problems of linguistic anthropology, to boot!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The students should probably talk slightly more in seminar. That's my only criticism. Fantastic intellectual experience.",
    "The course does explain a lot of concepts clearly. The information is presented in a 2 hour lecture format with little time for class engagement or participation.",
    "I wish the syllabus offered a greater citation of each source we read (it was difficult to comb through the internet to find the origin of each source to construct a bibliography). Apart from that, this is one of the strongest courses I have taken at Yale. Paul is a wonderful professor (hilarious) and makes what could be a dry course a welcoming way to start of the week.",
    "The workload was well-balanced, classtime was always productive, and the structure of the course was well crafted. I thought maybe there could be more of a structured class discussion component, because mostly it just happened spontaneously which worked out for those who were opinionated and willing to jump in, but I would've liked to hear some of the quieter people's voices too, since I think the overall makeup of the class tends to be a very interesting mix of people.",
    "This was an extremely good class, taught by an extremely good professor! The course's strengths are in the way in which Prof. Kockelman is able to direct the class to take a deep dive into the course material, yes, but then to see beyond it: His lectures placed our readings in historical and disciplinary context, and then managed to use our questions as launch pads for far-reaching discussions about language and meaning that put in easy to grasp, matter-of-fact terms, what before might have seemed impossible to articulate. The framework of linguistic anthropology gives us a set of tools to ask otherwise slippery questions. The one thing I would change about the course is that, it was not very discussion-based. I've taken another class from Prof. Kockelman in which discussion was an integral part of the course, so I think it was just the particulars of maybe this group of people (and, frankly, the set-up of the room: we sat in rows facing the front of the room so couldn't even see each other) and whatever else set the tone the first few sessions, that prevented us from ever really talking. I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if I could have learned what my peers were thinking; I'm kicking myself for not making more of an effort to make this happen."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Kockelman is a genius. You will get out of it what you put in. Fantastic intellectual experience. This stuff is really cool.",
    "If the student was interested in linguistic anthropology but had never studied it before, the course is a very useful introduction.",
    "Absolutely! Paul Kockelman is a gem of the Yale faculty, and shifted the way I engage with other professors and with anthropology in general.",
    "As a senior linguistics major, this class was very engaging, since I could build on everything I've learned in the major with a chance to look at all of that through a different lens. I would definitely recommend this class to linguistics majors and people who are willing to put the work in to understand the underlying linguistic principles, but I could see it being kind of difficult to engage with if it was your first step into linguistics. I think if you're coming at it from an anthro perspective you'll probably feel like it's kind of removed from reality, but from a linguistics perspective it was a really great opportunity to actually apply all of the highly theoretical principles I had learned. So yeah, it was a great course, but just know what you're getting into and where you're coming from will affect your experience significantly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this course! It may have been my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. The material is incredibly interesting and Professor Kockelman is a dynamic and brilliant lecturer.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. You'll learn a whole new way of thinking! Not only do you get a strong understanding of disciplinary questions and debates that animate linguistic anthropology past and present, but you learn how to grasp and fluidly think about meaning and language itself: The framework of linguistic anthropology (although we read philosophy and other things too) gives you a mean through which to ask otherwise impossible questions. Prof. K is absolutely fabulous, very kind and willing to let students take the conversation wherever you want it to go! Please do speak up: the class does have the tendency to become more lecture than seminar, if you let it. It's one of those courses that alters your brain forever, in a great way."
