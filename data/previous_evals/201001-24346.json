    "I would tell them to take it. This exposes you to the range of different things you could be doing with an Ecology major. Even if you don't want to be an EEB major, it's a fun class if you're interested in the biosphere.",
    "The labs are interesting. Writing the lab reports are not fun.",
    "Lots of work, but interesting. The labs took a long time, and I think that too much stuff was crammed into one lab. Grades are fair and kind of easy, but SO much work.",
    "Good things:-This lab can be really fun. You get to dissect all sorts of things, try weird fruit, take a tour of the Peabody Museum, take a tour of the greenhouses, and tramp around a stream.-It's not that difficult. All the information you need for the lab reports can be found online.Bad things:-It is very broad. You are introduced to a lot of different topics, but you don't get to go into anything in depth.-It can be disorganized at times.-It can go long. Be prepared to stay at least half an hour after lab and leave feeling like you haven't done everything.",
    "This is probably the most fun you will have in a lab course at Yale! Labs are hands on, and not stressful. Lab reports are reasonable (compared to Gen Chem Lab) and expectations are clear. TFs are helpful and grading is fair. A general synopsis: explore the Peabody, feed a crawfish, dissect a sea anemone, visit the greenhouses and eat fruit, go to Sleeping Giant State Park to do field work and Marta buys everyone ice cream. Take this lab, even if you don't have to.",
    "Awesome lab! Most of the labs were fairly exciting, dealing with the diversity of all types of organisms. There's a 15 min presentation at the end that is somewhat time consuming but interesting. Overall, I think this lab may take much more time than other labs, but the material is interesting.",
    "This is the best lab class I have taken in my four years at Yale. Dr. Wells is phenomenal, and you get to go on field trips to the Peabody Museum, a greenhouse (twice), and a stream, so each week is different and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this lab. Be warned the quizzes are not that easy, so actually hard for them and you will be fine. Marta is amazing, and the TA's are great as well.",
    "Take this lab if you're taking the course of even if you want to have a lab experience at Yale.",
    "This is a good course in describing the basic principles in evolutionary biology. I would recommend it to someone because of its hands on lab work and knowledge base that is obtained.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student. The labs are interesting and much better than other labs in other classes. It is a great class to fulfill a lab requirement.",
    "The lab is pretty fun, a little tedious. A lot more work than 0.5 credits, but I learned a lot and it corresponded well to the lecture. mostly focused on diversity.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is fun and not too much work.",
    "If you are looking for something cool to do at Yale, DEFINITELY take this class. The work is not overwhelming, but you will see so many cool things and learn so much about evolution and diversity. The class is like watching Planet Earth.",
    "In this class you meet once a week and studya different portion of the tree of life (invertebrates, mammals, land plants, etc.) and there is also one lab where you tour the Peabody (you see some amazing secret stuff in the basement) and one fieldtrip to a river where you get to walk around in the water in neoprene wading pants and do sweet stuff.The labs can be long and a little tedious, but then you remember that you're dissecting a sea anemone or examining a whale skull and that this class is AWESOME. Even if it's a lot of work and sometimes a little tedious with all the lab reports, the stuff you do is a lot of fun and you do learn a lot in the end.TAKE IT!",
    "Dive into diversity. Recommend if not a heavy courseload otherwise.",
    "Fun if you like organisms, but a lot of work.",
    "An excellent lab about ecology.",
    "It was a really fun and laid-back lab.It helped me appreciate biology and nature and connect the subjectsI learned in textbooks to real life and tangible things.The professor is what makes this course super exciting. She is just so enthusiastic about everything that it makes the lab genuinely fun.Not too stressful but still quite a bit of work.",
    "A great class where you get to do a lot of cool, fun, low key activities. Great for pre-med students.",
    "If you must take a lab, take this one, it has some very fun labs and is very interesting.",
    "If you are a diehard EEB major or even unsure of what you want to do, this is a great class to take. The labs are exciting and interesting, and the lab reports are not bad at all. Marta is a great professor and really engages with students, and I enjoyed coming to lab every week.",
    "This is a fun, engaging lab experience featuring basically the \"greatest hits\" of ecology and evolutionary biology. The instructor is excellent.",
    "This lab is a great accompaniment to the lecture course. The labs are fun, engaging, and interesting. the first half of the lab course is definitely slower and less exciting than the second half, but necessary. It is easy to feel frustrated with the detailed lab reports, and for only half a credit the course does require a lot of time and effort. If you haven't ever taken a lab before, though, this is probably the most pleasant one you'll find! Some of my favorite labs included a specimen hunting trip to sleeping giant state park and eating tons of exotic fruits while studying flowering plants!",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. It is fun, interesting, and refreshing. The work is not too rigorous, but you learn a lot. There are lab write-ups after most of the labs, which are time consuming but straight forward. There are also four quizzes and a final presentation.",
    "This course does what it promises to do: show you the great diversity of life. Some labs are significantly more interesting than others. Lab reports aren't too bad, though you will probably start to feel like you are writing the same lab over and over again (ie 'such and such is an amazing innovation that aided in this or that and allowed for a great divergence of so and so). A good TA makes the lab much more enjoyable.",
    "take it if you have to take a lab. the theme of this class is biodiversity and it was really interesting and you learn so much. the lab reports aren't hard at all, and if you study for the quizzes they're not bad either. of course labs are kind of inherently painful, given the length of class, but this lab is pretty cool. you do a couple dissections of invertebrates, look at some specimens from the peabody, visit the peabody,visit the greenhouses, and go to a stream outside of new haven to collect samples. grading is labs, quizzes, lab notebook, and a presentation at the end. the presentation isn't a very big deal.",
    "It is a really obnoxious lab that involves a lot of busy work and no thinking. You essentially dissect things without knowing the detail of the anatomy of what you are dissecting and it takes a lot of time. The quizzes are annoying and it was just a lot of work every single week for something that is really boring.",
    "Yes. This is probably one of the best lab classes at Yale. The first couple weeks are incredibly boring, as you start with the microscopic organisms. Fortunately every week is better than the last. By the end of the semester, you are touring the back rooms of the Peabody, tasting fruit in the greenhouse, and wading across streams to collect ecologic data. This is well worth the boredom of the beginning of the semester.",
    "Great class. Do it!",
    "Loved loved this class!! Take it! I'm a senior and can say this is the best lab at Yale!",
    "If you're looking for a good biology lab (especially for pre-med requirements), you can't go wrong with this one! Compared to some of the other biology labs you could take, the workload's quite a bit lighter and less stressful; a 4-5 page, double spaced lab report every week but it's a lot of summarizing results and never much in the way of rigorous data analysis. The material itself is unbelievable fun too! Over the course of the semester, we played with samples from the Peabody Museum, ate 25 different kinds of fruit for a lab of flowering plants, and went to Sleeping Giant Park for a lab on stream ecology. SO MUCH FUN!!!",
    "This was a solid ecology lab course and was fun even for someone not using it as credit towards their major.",
    "It was a very fun course I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a hands on lab.",
    "Yes, take this class. It's much better than other labs.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's a bunch of fun, although weekly lab reports can be tedious.",
    "Loved this class! You explore the biodiversity of beetles, birds, buds, and beasts through weekly dissections, hands on experiments and amazing bus trips out to the creek. On special days, you even get to enjoy a feast at the Yale greenhouse to experience with your taste buds the diversity of fruit from around the world! This was the most entertaining course I've taken in the sciences and am sad I can't stay in Marta Wells' class for more. There are so many awesome things about her, and the butterfly tatoo engraved on her left collar bone is just the beginning.",
    "It's a wonderful lab. Take it if you have any interest in biology, biodiversity, etc. The lab reports are manageable and what you write about is relevant and focused on the big picture; the ending presentation can be as fun as you make it, and a chance to research an area of biology that fascinates _you_. Both Prof. Wells and the TAs were great."
