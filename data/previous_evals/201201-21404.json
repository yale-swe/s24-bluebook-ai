   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. Unfortunately, Pietschmann will no longer be teaching at Yale after this semester, but German 140 was extremely well taught and an enjoyable experience.",
    "It's a good class. We touch briefly on many aspects of German culture, language, and history. As with most language classes, you can do okay by doing the minimum work or you can put some effort into it and learn the language. Your choice.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that is a lot of time and effort, but it is worth it if you like German. I would recommend it, but be prepared for a lot of work. If you enjoy German, and are willing to put in many hours of homework and studying for the class, then I would recommend this class.",
    "The German departement in general is great. There is a lot of support and the teachers really seem to care about what they do. There is not too much work for this class and much of it is enjoyable (readings, a novella, movies etc). That said, it's definitely a good idea to shop different classes to see which teacher fits your style the best."
