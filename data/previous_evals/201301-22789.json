   "comments": [
    "I had very mixed feelings about this course. I liked the set theory and other maths but the philosophical discussions were a bit lofty and utterly too abstract for my liking. If you're into this kind of thing, the professor\/TA were very good, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed learning about this are of philosophy, and this is my first philosophy class. A lot of people complained about the math in the course. While there is no formal math pre-req, there are a few assumptions about math knowledge that are made (ex: that you know how to form a proof). However, Pam the TA was incredibly helpful and nice. If you make the time to work on these psets with her, they will go really well even if you struggle on your own.",
    "A class called Infinity? How can you have a class about Infinity? You'd be surprised. Infinity is mostly about set theory and paradoxes. The first half of the course is brutal. The psets are diabolical and the subject matter is extremely difficult if you don't have a math or logic background. If you can make it through part one, part two (paradoxes) is easier. It may be harder than it should be for what you might think is a fluff class, but the subject matter is truly interesting. I would take it with a friend. It makes the psets less daunting and we actually had a crazy amount of fun debating the answers and making stupid infinity puns. They never get old.",
    "It is a very interesting philosophy class!",
    "Take this class is you like surfing Wikipedia or Reddit for interesting paradoxes. The class has its boring phases, but it always comes back around with a paradox or problem that will make your head spin.",
    "It was OK I guess. Not a lot of work, OK credit\/D class. If you have a decent math background, don't worry too much about the mathy portions. It gets a little BS-y by the end but I guess that's par for the course in a class like this. Still interesting though and interesting discussions",
    "PHIL 281 is about the mathematics and philosophy behind infinity. The first half of the course deals with set theory while the second half tackles the philosophical problems. There are eight problem sets, one midterm exam, and a final essay. I would recommend PHIL 281 to another student. However, it would be helpful to have some background in set theory or logic before taking the course.",
    "Excellent course. Fascinating material. Not a gut, but totally doable workload. Fantastic professor.The material starts out with a lot of math and set theory that will be challenging to those without a background, but the professor gives helpful handouts, is helpful in person, and TFs are usually helpful (mine was great). The course merges into more philosophy and less math afterwards which is much more manageable for most people but the math is helpful in bringing up the level of discussion.",
    "A brief overview of several topics in mathematics and philosophy in which the concept of infinity arises. Discussions of set theory, decision theory, Pascal's philosophy, Zeno paradoxes, topology. The class is a lot of fun.",
    "The course is a solid and interesting QR. The first half of the semester is predominantly mathematical, while the later half presents contemporary philosophical issues around infinity. Professor Szabo's lectures are a little different than the usual--he solicits questions from students during his lectures, so be to contribute in lecture as well as in section. The midterm tests you on the mathematics, while the final essay (5-7 pages) allows you to explore one of the issues from the second half in the course in more depth.",
    "Yeah, take it. The grading scale is a little weird so I'm not sure if I'll get the grade I deserve, but it was a nice course, especially with Pam, the TA.",
    "A class that is a lot harder than it would seem.Because the class doesn't seem that great at the subject, but the material gets hard.",
    "I would very highly recommend this excellent course. Szabo is a great instructor, and lectures were always fun. I grew as both a mathematician and as a philosopher from this course, but the material was not hard, and the workload was fairly light (8 problem sets; the syllabus advertises that they should only take an hour or two, which is a definite underestimate, but 5 hours should be sufficient for each, and often less; one midterm, for which the questions are provided in advance; and a short paper, for which you provide a draft and receive comments in advance). When I describe the workload as light, I say this as a math& philosophy senior; I had great respect for the students who had not studied math who took this course. This is a great way to develop your mathematical skills without taking a math-department course; it really does require analytical, quantitative thinking and is by no means an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceasy QR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but it is a great example of why encouraging all students to think quantitatively can be beneficial to them. Overall: a must take for math-phil majors, a fun and rewarding HU for math types, and a challenging, interesting QR for philosophers. Take Pam Corcoran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s section if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a choice of TA\u00e2\u0080\u0094she was phenomenal.",
    "Phil 281 is a fun class. However, I cannot say I came to have a better understanding of the idea of infinity. Rather, you evaluate the different paradoxes that arise when we allow the idea of infinity to exist. The class is valuable not so much because of the material that I learned, but because of the argumentative skills that I developed.",
    "This is a good class to take if you are interested in mind-boggling paradoxes. There isn't a lot of work, but some of the problem sets can get really tough. Some math background and\/or interest in math is needed to really enjoy this class.",
    "This was a very interesting course and not too much work. I would recommend it if the subject sounds at all interesting.",
    "Not too hard, while having some work and a lot of fun. Not the usual writing a whole bunch of papers in usual humanities paper form. But then, how could you expect that, given this is a QR? If it's not, it should be counted as a logic course.",
    "This class is cool, but it is by no means a gut class. The topics and paradoxes discussed are fascinating, but, especially early on, you're going to want a math background. The weekly problem sets can be really challenging if you're taking this as a humanities person looking for a QR."
