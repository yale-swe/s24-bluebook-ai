    "absolutely. take it. take it early. take it many times.most importantly, TAKE IT WITH AN ADVISOR YOU CLICK WITH.",

    "Find a professor, pick an interesting project, and take this course! The course itself has super low-stress requirements so that you can focus on your research. Fun little presentation at the end in front of your peers. Sweet deal, right? Take it.",
    "Great, lots of freedom.",
    "Physics 471 is a great way to get involved with research. Definitely spend a lot of time considering your project and advisor, though, to make sure you'll be tackling something feasible.",
    "This being the physics senior project, you'll do it if you're a physics major, and you won't if you aren't.",
    "MOAR RESEARCH. TAKE MOAR.",
    "Physics 471 is exactly what it sounds like---independent research with a professor you find. I would suggest that people start independent research as early as possible and do it as much as possible for several reasons. First it fun and enjoyable as long as you find the right advisor. This leads into the second reason which is if you start early, and you don't like (or aren't inspired by) the group\/advisor that you have picked, then you have time to find another advisor which suites you better. Also the more research you do, the more likely it is that you will have concrete results which you can publish, which leads into the final reason which is the more research you do as an undergrad, the more it will help you if\/when you are applying to grad school (can also help you decide if you want to go to grad school). In conclusion, take what they say about Chicago elections to heart with respect to this class: Take it early, and take it often!"
