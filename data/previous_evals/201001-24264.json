    "We all know organic Chemistry isn't normally the class you take for fun. Professor Herzon is a great teacher to learn from, but I would say we might have been required to know a little bit more detail than previous orgo I professors. It was his first year teaching and he did a phenomenol job. The only weird thing is that the TAs and the professor wrote the problem sets and test questions, so it isn't just about the professor. The TAs matter, too, so use them! I would be much worse off if I didn't use my TA.",
    "If you have to take organic chemistry, I would recommend Chem 220. Professor Herzon is a good lecturer and he covers most of the material in the book. Although the exams are challenging and do cover material not presented in the book, the curve is pretty decent, so don't let terrible grades on the exams worry you too much.",
    "hard, not as interesting as other chem classes ive taken, but necessary as a pre-req for things and for pre-med. Wouldnt recommend it for someone who's not pre-med but (like me) is just interested in chemistry.",
    "I really feel like you get out of orgo whatever you put into it. If you get yourself into the mentality that orgo will be interesting and fun, then it will be. If you get bogged down in the rote memorization required, however, it can get very tedious and stressful. The class moves very quickly and I feel that some of the concepts were covered very superficially. Ido wish the class had spent more time discussing applications of the learning instead of focusing on cramming in as many reaction schemes as possible.Herzon can be funny at times, but most of the class he lectures in a dry manner that sets orgo in a stale light. He makes the mechanisms and important information very clear, which is useful. He could have been warmer toward the class, but whenever approached for help, he was (most, but not all of the time) accommodating.Overall, I would not recommend the class unless you're forced into it.",
    "You're going to take it because it's required for your major\/pre-med. Herzon is really great. His grading scale is VERY generous, but for the class, it was necessary. DON'T MISS HIS LECTURES. He basically outlines the chapters for you. His notes are very clear, and his examples are very helpful for the problem sets.",
    "It is a great and one should definitely take especially Hezron's class",
    "If you have to take it.",
    "Take if it you have to \u0097 don't take it just for kicks. Definitely a weeder class for premeds so be prepared. Just saying.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class to other students simply because it is the most interesting science class I have ever taken.",
    "Nothing particularly interesting if you aren't required to take it.",
    "Personally, I really enjoyed orgo and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to do the work. It takes quite a bit of dedication, but I think it paid off - I'm seriously considering a chem major after taking Chem 220 with Prof. Herzon.",
    "Chem 220 with Herzon is a well-taught and well-organized course that makes you wonder why organic chemistry has developed such a bad reputation. Herzon's lectures are really clear and parallel the textbook, which I really liked. I found it really helpful to read the book before class; having the preliminary background knowledge made it incredibly easy to follow the lectures. Because Herzon presents everything in such a neat, organized way, your notes are really easy to study from. The problem sets are of a good length and difficulty level. The exams are ok-generally pretty fair, but definitely challenging. I really couldn't have asked for a better experience with organic chemistry.",
    "I would definitely recommend Orgo to another student, especially with Professor Herzon. Obviously it's an incredibly hard class, but it's also incredibly rewarding because you feel like you're really thinking. Also, taking Orgo just because it interests you (nonpre-med, non science major) is probably the best way to go because there isn't any pressure. If you want an interesting science course that really makes you think in a new way, definitely take this class.",
    "If your schedule isn't already challenging, go ahead and take it. None of the concepts are too demanding, but the sheer weight of the material that you have to master halfway through the first semester is a burden. From talking to other students, I felt that this is probably the best intro to organic chemistry - the most simple, clear, and concise introduction that doesn't needlessly complicate matters. So I would recommend Professor Herzon to those pre-meds out there, or anyone who wants the classic introduction to organic chem with no strings attached for your major.",
    "This is an interesting course that covers introductory organic chemistry: synthesis, mechanisms, reactions, and trends. One should have lots of time to invest in this course. Strongly recommended.",
    "This is a good introductory course for organic chemistry - be warned it is a lot of work, and one of the more difficult courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Just be careful before you take this course. Don't take it because you *might* want to be premed or go into Chemistry. Make sure you take it seriously and don't get behind. There are plenty of chances to sort of try it on for size (shopping period, the drop date, etc.), but just know that if you're not doing very well after the first exam, DO NOT think that it will get easier, because it in fact gets harder. So watch out for that.",
    "I would not take this course unless it is required for your major or pre-med requirements. It is a lot of work and I found it hard to do well in.",
    "Herzon was a great professor even though the tests were hard. A great course for a pre-med student, I felt that I really grasped the concepts taught in this course because of Herzon's teaching style.",
    "Organic chemistry is a difficult course, but you shouldn't be overly discouraged. You will study hard and memorize a lot, but the key is to learn how to think about synthesis and mechanism questions. Spend time on the problem sets, go to review sessions, use your fellow students as a resource and DON'T PANIC. If you put in the requisit time, you will be fine. You may not get an A, but that's not the end of the world (I'm talking to you insane premeds).",
    "In the words of Professor Herzon himself, \"There is X amount of memorization in this course, and X is a fairly large amount\". Organic chemistry departs from the analytical focus of general chemistry; it requires more visual thinking as well as creativity (when solving synthesis problems or molecular mechanisms). Many people will only take this course because it is a pre-med requirement, but it is a course to be enjoyed, even though it is very challenging. Problem solving in organic chemistry, while frustrating, can also be fun, as the material itself is, for the most part, fascinating.",
    "If you're going to take Organic Chemistry, I strongly recommend taking it with Seth Herzon. He's such a good Orgo professor that it actually was one of my favorite classes. Expect to know how to synthesize organic molecules without it being spelled out for you.",
    "Typical first semester intro to orgo. You're obviously either taking it to fulfill requirements or for bragging rights. The curve of the class was basically anyone within +\/- half a standard deviation of the mean got a B+. In the spring semester, we only had 60 students and generally students were either freshmen from Chem 118 who did well or really motivated sophomores\/juniors who suddenly turned premed, meaning the curve isn't necessarily \"harder\", it's just more difficult to stand out from the rest of your peers and be above average because \"average\" is actually outstanding by normal standards. If you're looking for an easy time with grading in orgo, wait till fall to take the class. If you just want to get it over with and you're willing to constantly work hard to stand out from everyone else, go ahead and take it in the spring. If you want an A\/A-, make sure you don't slip up for even a week, keep up with readings always, do each problem set yourself and if you don't understand, ask right away, don't wait till the day before an exam. You can't fall behind for even a week or you're gone, doomed to the mediocrity of a B+ or B, which is fine if you're happy with a grade like that I guess. Herzon's an organized, straight-forward lecturer but don't be deceived into thinking you can get away w\/o reading the book if you pay attn in lecture, try to get Terhorst as your TA, the others don't provide as many review\/practice materials and aren't as nice.",
    "Organic chemistry is a really difficult course, but if you're willing to work hard and memorize a lott of stuff then you'll be fine.",
    "Organic chemistry isn't really a class people take for fun, so if you're thinking about taking it, you probably have to. It's actually not too bad if Professor Herzon is teaching and you get a good TA. Optional section, weekly psets graded on completion, three midterms and a final, study enough and you should do fine.",
    "CHEM 220 is your standard organic chemistry course. While it starts off slow, the reactions start coming in fast in the second half of the course. Definitely take the course with Herzon if you are able.",
    "The course was not too bad, just know your reagents and products",
    "Recommended, although probably taking it because you need to - work load is a lot, but the course is overall pleasant (not what is often said about Orgo)",
    "Professor Herzon's class is perhaps a little different from normal orgo. classes. Professor Herzon presents the material very clearly, but a lot of the learning occurs outside of class (in doing textbook questions, problem sets, etc.). This organic class was a lot more synthesis heavy than I expected it to be, but it's certainly one way to approach the subject. And like all orgo. class at Yale, it's a lot of work (probably more than you are expecting it to be now), and the competition is a little disgusting, but it comes with the territory.",
    "Orgo is definitely not as intimidating as many make it out to be, especially if you have a good professor. Professor Herzon was great! If you can, try to take the class with him! Despite it being his first year teaching, he made the material so much more manageable by following the organization of the textbook, which was really helpful because if you didn't understand something from lecture you could always go read it again in the book. I was surprised to find out that by the end of the semester, this became my favorite class!",
    "CHEM 220 is first-semster orgo. The class is intense, and to a certain extent it is made more so by the particular crop of people taking it. If you're taking orgo, it's because you have to; that said, taking first-semester orgo in the spring semester is definitely nice, because the class size is smaller (and with arguably a slightly less intense crowd of peers). Definitely take it with Professor Herzon if you can; he is an amazing lecturer, in the sense that his lectures are extremely clear and straightforward, and everything is written out neatly on the board (albeit at a remarkably rapid pace). The difficulty of the problem sets and exams largely depends on the TA's who write them. Be prepared, though, that in order to do well in this class, it requires a significant amount of dedication and disciple on your part, and you should be ready to dedicate a substantial amount of time to reading and practice problems in addition to the problem sets each week. If you are willing to put the whole-hearted effort into this class, it has the potential to be an extremely interesting and rewarding class, especially if you take it with Professor Herzon; on the flip side, however, if you are not ready to dedicate the time and effort to this class, it will quickly become a painful experience about halfway through the semester.",
    "Organic chemistry is hard but when you get it, the mechanisms can actually be pretty fun to deal with. Although the class involved some memorizations, it is really about getting the intuitive of how electrons will move around, and therefore practice is the most important part to study the material well. I would definitely recommend the class to science majors as organic chemistry will give better understanding in other chemical and biological process.",
    "CHEM220 is a pretty interesting introduction to organic chemistry and its major themes and topics. While there is a lot of memorization, try to keep the big picture in mind as well as the major themes, as most of the \"rules\" and such to memorize are actually explained by a few simple motifs. I'm not pre-med, but took the class anyways and I'm glad I did- a lot of people in the class will get caught up in the tiny details, but try to keep it all in perspective and look at the themes running through the whole semester, and you may actually find it pretty interesting. Herzon is pretty clear and fair, and while the problem sets aren't great because the TAs write them, the tests are pretty fair for the most part. The TA you have can really make a difference, so if you aren't happy with yours don't be afraid to go to other sections.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "Chem 220 under Prof. Herzon was an outstanding class, in spite of organic chemistry's reputation of impossibility. The book and the lectures were synchronized fully, and each supplemented the other. Weekly problem sets (very manageable in size) ensured that the material did not get too far ahead of the students. Thus, the course had an excellent sense of direction; while the tests were intensely difficult, the distribution of grades was fair.It was my observation that this course was focused primarily on synthesis, with glancing mentions of applications in biology. As such, the course serves chemistry majors very well, though perhaps at the expense of pre-medical students.",
    "I'd recommend it if you feel you're ready to take it in the spring, its definitely a lot of time, so think about that in terms of your other classes--otherwise, I highly suggest waiting until the fall."
