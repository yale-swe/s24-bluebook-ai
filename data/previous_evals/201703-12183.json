    "The contextual understanding of Forman's films you will have by then end of the course is amazing, but the course rarely touches on visual or cinematic analysis. If you are seeking that, you will have to bring the discussion to the table yourself.",
    "The course was interesting and the professor was very flexible with assignments. This allowed for the class to focus solely on discussing the films.",
    "A strength of the class was the depth of analysis Professor von Kunes has a excellent grasp on the material and communicated the nuances integral to popular views of Formans cinematography clearly and effectively. A weakness was that it was difficult to offer in writing a grounded critique of the films before we discussed them in class."

    "Yes, it is well taught and allows me to view film more critically. A valuable skill to have."
