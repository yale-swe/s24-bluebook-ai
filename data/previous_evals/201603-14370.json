   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about cognitive science of fiction and fictional pleasures, and explored a rather unusual topic of study in the field of cognitive science. It allowed me to discuss some of the most fascinating papers I have read in a long time with a group of smart individuals, and also allowed me to develop my own research proposal.",
    "I learned to engage in critical discussion on topics that don't have a concrete right or wrong answer.",
    "The reading responses were the place that I grew the most from this semester. Being forced to consolidate my various ideas about a handful of texts into one carefully-articulated argument was a really positive experience, and I think my critical thinking skills grew a great deal.",
    "Throughout this course I learned a lot about fiction and why we like it. The readings and discussions were interesting and engaging and I found the material to be extremely enjoyable.",
    "PSYC 421 was hands down one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. The readings each week were very interesting; the reading responses were helpful in that I was able to formulate my own opinions on each of the readings which not only helped me remember the content of the readings better, but helped hone my critical thinking skills. I found myself writing the responses more and more efficiently as the semester progressed, which I think was the result of me interacting more with the pieces as I read them. The discussions during seminar were also constructive and challenging. Most of the time, we were sharing our speculations, and Professor Bloom did a great job of facilitating discussion and validating everyone's ideas. These discussions were very engaging and I think I came out of this course as a more confident and articulate speaker. It has also impacted how I view fiction, daydreams, and books\/movies because of the topics we explored, like the paradox of fiction.",
    "The absolutely amazing thing about this class is you can be a senior psychology major, take this course, and come out knowing information that is not only new, but was completely foreign to you before. This class allowed me to ask questions about psychology and fiction that I not only didn't know the answers to, but hadn't even thought of before. It truly expands your knowledge and your mind in the best way possible. There are no right or wrong answers, but there are infinite thought provoking questions and theories I've learned about the way we think about fiction, and the way we function as people.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was very well structured, the workload was fair, and the class discussion was very engaging.",
    "The strengths of this course included Professor Bloom, who is great at leading engaging discussions and providing exciting and accessible readings. I also loved that Professor Bloom was open to our input about what to discuss in a given class or even what topics we wanted to explore toward the end of the semester. I wish we had had a bit more direction on the very open-ended final project, though some students may have loved the freedom.",
    "Small and engaging! Amazing class",
    "Sometimes it felt as if discussion became a little bit cyclical. However, my classmates were incredibly engaging people and always kept the conversation interesting.",
    "The structure of the course is great -- weekly readings, a discussion, and an intensive final paper. But the quality of the discussion was rather disappointing. Often, the readings seems randomly thrown together, not quite covering the topic for the week, and the discussions rarely felt like they accomplished anything. For example, we had a discussion about whether or not various mental processes\/experiences could be understood as \"multiple selves\"....without ever defining what a \"self\" is. We often went back and forth, with students continually begging questions, and without clear goals or a collaborative spirit. It felt in a few ways quite lazy.",
    "Sometimes, the amount of reading can be a bit overwhelming, but for the most part it is manageable. The weekly responses are helpful and not tedious.",
    "I thought this class was wonderful. Professor Bloom is just an amazing speaker and incredibly intelligent - I left feeling mindblown after every class. The discussions were engaging and fruitful and I thought the reading responses were also helpful. Perhaps the only additional thing that could be helpful would be to get some feedback on how students are doing in the class grade-wise.",
    "Professor Bloom's ability to ask students such thought provoking questions, and genuine kindness and enthusiasm for the course is easily the best thing about it. There are no weaknesses I can think of, it was a joy taking this class.",
    "The main strength of the course were Professor Bloom's ability to engage with students."

    "I would definitely recommend a Paul Bloom seminar to any student (this is because he changes the topic every year, but honestly anything he chooses will be very engaging). This was by far my favorite course at Yale. The readings were fascinating, and the assignments were fun.",
    "I would recommend! Taking seminars with Prof. Bloom is a great move, and this course was accessible to people outside of psychology.",
    "I would strongly recommend this seminar. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. There are very few classes that allow students to speak openly about abstract topics without fear of having the \"right\" answer. The class was fun and Professor Bloom always kept the conversation engaging. Definitely take it if you can!",
    "It is very exciting to be in a classroom with a mind like Paul Bloom's. He is (obviously) a giant in the field of psychology, and is a really brilliant person. But. The course felt (sadly) pretty lazily taught. The conversations were incredibly frustrating and mostly consisted of people sharing random conflicting anecdotes rather than engaging in a thoughtfully-led debate. I usually left with no better grasp on the material than when I arrived, because of how circular and fragmented the discussion was. You read cool stuff...but otherwise, sadly, I was pretty disappointed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in psychology, cognitive science, or fiction. The subject matter is unique and was very fun to learn about. It was also a great experience to learn from Paul Bloom, a leader in the field.",
    "Take this course if you can! Professor Bloom is just an amazing speaker and incredibly intelligent - I left feeling mindblown after every class. Prof Bloom also does a good job of creating an eclectic group of students, which made discussions especially interesting. It was a bit intimidating to speak in class at first, but the topics each week were so interesting (i.e. paradox of horror) and Prof Bloom did a good job of facilitating\/ encouraging conversation that I think everyone ended up wanting to contribute. I grew so much as a thinker, writer, and even reader (I left the class wanting to read more fiction, as our seminar topic was on imaginary pleasures\/fiction). Hands down my favorite class at Yale!",
    "Without any doubts YES TAKE THIS COURSE. Let's be honest, we both know the subject matter is incredibly interesting and Professor Bloom's reputation precedes him. You don't need to read these reviews to learn anything other than this \"everything you've heard is true.\" The class is phenomenally interesting and about a wonderfully unique subject. Class discussions are lively and exactly what you think of when you imagine intense intellectual collegiate debates. And most importantly Professor Bloom is brilliant, kind, and contagiously enthusiastic about the class. Take it, take it, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the workload is low and the class is very interesting."
