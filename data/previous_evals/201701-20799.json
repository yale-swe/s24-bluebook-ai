   "comments": [
    "I didn't really understand how to read studies before this class nor did I understand why clinical case studies were so informative. I feel like this class helped me think more like a cognitive scientist.",
    "I learned to think critically about\/analyze language in a way I'd never done before. More importantly, this class brought up the debates around questions I'd never even considered before, such as why\/how we have the ability to produce and understand language, and how language is represented in the brain.",
    "I developed good fundamental knowledge of linguistic theory and how the mind processes language. Also, my note taking skills greatly improved, since the class moves at such a fast pace.",
    "This course was such an incredible exploration of linguistic and cognitive science topics. There was such a range of ideas we cover4ed in the class, and I feel like I gained very comprehensive knowledge of both of the cross-listed subjects.",
    "Very solid starter course in linguistics, I learned a ton about phonemes and syntax and such",
    "It was interesting to learn about the interaction between cognitive science and language.",
    "I have gained a comprehensive knowledge of the cognitive science of language and some surface knowledge in the field of linguistics.",
    "Thorough understanding of various linguistic fields, such as phonology, syntax, semantics, theory of mind, and neural networks.",
    "A broad introduction to the various subfields of linguistics, with a focus on the way humans process language.",
    "Learned a lot of interesting theories and concepts at the intersection between cognitive science and linguistics -- some practical applications",
    "I learned a fairly comprehensive overview of cognitive science, linguistics, and the relationship between the two.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge in the field of linguistics, learned to structure sentence trees, calculate linguistic entropy, even a little bit of probability and improved my scientific literature reading skills.",
    "This course provides a nice introduction to linguistics (phonology, syntax, phonetics , etc.) but also only seems to only focus on the coolest aspects of those, in addition to questions about the nature and development of the human language capacity. By the end of the course, I definitely have a better understanding for the nature of language (distinct from other cognitive processes) and many of its fascinating properties.",
    "In this class I gained a greater knowledge of the basics of linguistics. As a cog sci major, I was most interested and compelled by the ideas relating to the innate language capacities in humans and the various perspectives on and evidence for and against the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis. When I read the papers (I stopped 1\/3 of the way through) I really enjoyed them and got more out of the class.",
    "I learned a lot about the modern study of language and the various skills and techniques used to do this. This also is a great entry into cognitive science as a whole as you learn the basic approach of study done in the realm of cognitive science.",
    "I gained a newfound appreciation for cognitive science and language that I never thought I would have. I learned a new way of thinking and synthesizing information.",
    "Basic linguistics concepts, theories on how the brain acquires language",
    "Really great information on language development in disabled children, as well as a general scope on the intense complexities and usages of languages as a human tool.",
    "A lot of linguistics theory, some cog sci theory, and a great understanding of where the field stands as of today in terms of the cog sci of language"

   "comments": [
    "Professor Frank is an EXCELLENT lecturer. One of the bests I've had at Yale. He is great at explaining things with easy to understand examples and analogies. It would have been nice if lectures were uploaded onto canvas before class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I thought the material covered was very interesting, and the exams were reasonable given the material covered in lecture. For the future, I would suggest the following improvements: 1) Post the readings earlier. Often times this was left until just days before an exam. 2) Return exams back to students. It's very difficult to remember exactly what mistakes we made on an exam, and being able to keep exams may prevent students from falling into the same traps they did on a prior exam.",
    "The course presents theories from a broad range of fields, often in a somewhat random array. Linearity could have benefitted this course, but otherwise it was very engaging and intriguing.",
    "It tries to do so much but is unclear on how much emphasis to place on unnecessary topics",
    "I liked the clear overview of linguistics, from phonology to syntax. These P-Sets were almost comically time consuming in some cases (for a non-stem major like me, at least) with more time spent on a single P-Set then on a final project in one case. Maybe tone those down a bit. Especially the one where we had to make a lab report, that was nuts.",
    "The course takes a very comprehensive look at language and explores many different fields, which means that lectures are always varied and interesting. However, because it is so comprehensive, there are many questions left unanswered.",
    "Really insightful lectures and interesting assignments.",
    "This course does a good job introducing cognitive science terms to non-cognitive science majors",
    "Bon Frank was a very enthusiastic lecturer who always covered interesting topics. Although the general arc of the course was somewhat disjointed, every lecture was enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Course was fairly well organized around main themes -- would have preferred a little more big-picture tying together of themes, especially at the end of units and at the end of the course Lectures varied a lot in depth and specificity, and sometimes, I felt it went outside the scope of a survey or intro level course.",
    "Strengths: very interesting and engaging, well taught materials Weaknesses: often time overly complicated and impossible to understand without a prior understanding of the topic",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the course content Weaknesses: sometimes I found myself slacking off on the reading because I wasn't held accountable for doing it, and sometimes the backend of a bunch of studies during the latter portion of the lecture was too much (I think it's also just hard to keep attention for a whole 75 minutes)",
    "The course is very well-taught, covers extremely interesting material with a great level of depth, and certainly facilitates student learning. The only complaint I can really think of has to do with the readings -- they were organized into pretty large categories, and many were quite dense research papers (of which we only needed to know the most basic ideas). To better motivate reading the papers, some ideas might be to assign more reading responses, send course-wide emails reminding students which should be read by which date, or only include those papers that are really relevant on the syllabus (and perhaps put the others, which could just be for students that want to know more details, in a separate folder). The readings seemed really interesting, but because of their length and a slight lack of organization, it was hard to keep up with them (or even to remember to keep up with them). But I want to emphasize that this is a great course, and this is really quite a nitpick!",
    "I think Professor Frank lectures about generally interesting material. Not every class was breathtaking, but overall I feel like I gained a decent grasp on the basics of linguistics and how they relate to how we think about the world more broadly. This course did have a couple of areas of improvement though. First off, it was often difficult to understand new concepts that were introduced. Im a senior cog sci major, so many of the ideas were straight up repetitions or were expansions on concepts I was already relatively familiar with. However, for many of the times when Professor Frank was introducing new material, it was rather difficult to follow the lectures. This wasnt true all of the time, but I think something that was constant throughout was that Professor Frank would rarely define the basic terms and concepts before going into the nitty gritty of the new topics. Often this wasnt an issue for me because I had a decent grasp on the general concepts in linguistics from my other cog sci courses, but it definitely confused many of my classmates and confused me when the topics were wholly new. Another issue was that some of the homeworks were very hard and time consuming. All in all, they werent extremely time consuming, but the main issue was that for two of the homeworks I had no idea how to start them and ended up meeting with Professor Frank to talk it over. I didnt feel like the lectures and readings prepared me for some of the homework. I think this could be remedied by Professor Frank explaining the basics a bit more thoroughly in class.",
    "Kind of nitpicky questions on tests that I don't feel wholely matched the material emphasized by the class. Aside from that though this a strong course with not too much work and rather more direct engagement and analysis with course material directly in lecture or indirectly with readings.",
    "This course was incredibly strong and does not require any improvement. It was my favorite class I have taken at Yale.",
    "It's definitely really hard, but mainly because there's little background context as I've never taken linguistics before. I think the pace of the course is a bit rushed, and not having a textbook to reference (but rather, multiple seperate readings) can make the subject matter more confusing.",
    "The course was very broad and the work was scattered\/not very consistent. Weekly assignments should help.",
    "Maybe more lab-related experiments, hands-on assignments as homework.",
    "The content is really interesting and pretty comprehensive Some of the readings are a bit long"

    "Great class if you think you are interested in linguistics and\/or cognitive science. While it is called \"COGNITIVE SCIENCE of language,\" we covered a lot of topics in linguistics such as the basics of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, connectionists vs. functionalist models, and language acquisition. Super interesting class with fun p-sets that teach you the material but take longer than you would expect. Not necessary, but if you have programming experience and familiar with LaTeX this class will be a really smooth SO cr. Professor Frank is probably the best lecturers I've had at Yale. He is a good teacher.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It's a great SO if you're interested in linguistics\/the brain, and it's way better than ECON! It's not a \"Gut\" but it's not the most work, so it's a really nice 4th\/5th class.",
    "I am not particularly interested in linguistics, but I am interested in cognitive science. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in both, but not one or the other. I would recommend it for fulfilling the requirements for the cognitive science major, however.",
    "No, unless you're on the fence about becoming a linguistics major",
    "Wonderful course! Incredibly interesting material, covers a lot of intellectual bases. Something for everyone, and will really change the way you think about language... no, really. Professor Frank is amazing and if you pay attention in class you will love it. Would not recommend as a \"never go to class and show up for the final\" course, though. At all.",
    "Yes, as long as they know what they're getting into. As P-set 2 proved, this was not a gut, with time intensive and difficult topics.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Take it with caution; it gets into the knitty-gritty of abstract linguistic representation (syntax trees, voicing, how your tongue position affects your vowels). it's a fun class, but not as consistently fun as it comes across in shopping period. There's a lot of seemingly abstract\/pointless stuff you're expected to memorize.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It was disorganized, and there was not clear was to improve on exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about why language is the way it is without taking a specific linguistics course. The course provides an overview of the science of language that is easy to understand for anyone, even those who have never taken a linguistics course before.",
    "Fantastic linguistics course for those interested.",
    "This a good social science credit. It is interesting and Professor Frank is clearly passionate about teaching this material. It can get somewhat technical in its linguistics, but it was an interesting course.",
    "I'd recommend it for sure. I don't know how good it is as an introduction to linguistics for potential majors, but for anyone who is somewhat interested in how language and human comprehension of language work, it's definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course. I've looked forward to every lecture. Homework was actually kinda fun. Prof. Frank is a great lecturer and super friendly. If that's what helps you learn, you'll learn a lot in this class. I guess the TA's change from year to year, but there were three of them this year(!) which was amazing. Go to office hours! You'll be happy you did!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in cognitive science, and how language affects the brain! Lectures are engaging and interesting. Assignments are generally fine, not too difficult -- if a bit tedious. Reading responses and writing-based assignments were valuable for learning.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in taking a challenging and interesting class.",
    "Yes, it's a well taught class with interesting material",
    "Yes! Bob Frank was an amazing lecturer and the information he chose to include was very interesting (for someone's first exposure to linguistics). It's a great overview course but also goes into some depth and makes you work to understand some of the harder concepts. Overall a great mix",
    "This is a really well-taught course on some super cool topics, so I would definitely recommend it! If you already know a lot of linguistics, there will probably a lot of overlap in the middle, but the studies about the development of language, and the relation between language and thought, were fascinating. It also has a pretty light workload, and exams are not bad. Professor Frank is great at explaining concepts -- some of the things we covered, I had theoretically seen before in a different class, but didn't really understand until he explained them -- so definitely go to lecture and pay attention (it can sometimes be hard to reconstruct what the purpose of a slide was without recalling what he said on that day).",
    "Yes, great introduction to linguistics, and cog sci methods",
    "I took this course for a cog sci requirement, and was pleasantly surprised. It wasnt a great course in my book, but it was decently interesting, providing me with greater evidence of the innateness of the human language capacity. I also learned the basics of linguistics, which is sometimes fun. Sometimes boring, but what are you gonna do? If youve taken a lot of cog sci courses before, theres probably gonna be a lot of overlap. I didnt find this course to be very challenging, partly because I was familiar with a good deal of the content beforehand. Study hard for the tests and youll do fine. Also, meet with Professor Frank if you have any questions! He was always super helpful and happy to talk. If you want a bit more flavorful introduction to linguistics that relates more to everyday experience and cognition, Id recommend this class as a pretty chill, sometimes engaging course.",
    "This course is great for anyone who wishes to understand the particulars of language and enter the realm of social sciences. Amazing breadth and great amounts of depth on ideas that merit it. Do not take this class thinking it will be a joke though, some effort is definitiely required and with the amazing lectures and good structure it's really merited to put some effort into this class.",
    "Not fun for non-majors... I took it as a humanities student who was very interested in linguistics\/how it could relate to writing and am not taking away much from it (bc that's not what this course is--it's cogsci as much as linguistics). Studying for the three exams and doing the five homeworks was pretty time intensive, but no work besides that.",
    "I would (and have) recommended this course to any student who is interested in a new way of learning and looking at the tasks our brain undertakes every day. It was fascinating and engaging.",
    "Overall I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. I found the linguistics portion to be very dry, and while the cognitive science aspects were interesting, I thought the course was poorly organized and I ended up looking up a lot of stuff on my own. This course would greatly benefit from a textbook. Many of the homework assignments are unnecessarily tedious and a waste of time.",
    "This was a wonderful course that most students enjoyed very much. Bob Frank is a very dynamic lecturer and makes learning the material fun. The course on a day to day basis isn't extremely taxing. The psets\/homework assignments do take a while though, so make sure you budget enough time for them. Overall, it was a super interesting course and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a tough course. Unless you plan to pursue a knowledge base in this area, I would not recommend it. That said, as someone who is majoring in Cognitive Science, it was a lot of fun despite the challenges.",
    "If you want a basic introduction to both cognitive science and linguistics, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes. It's really fascinating. If you're motivated to learn this stuff you will love the lectures and readings"
