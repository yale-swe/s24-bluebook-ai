    "yes take it",
    "This is a class designed for juniors and seniors embarking on their senior projects. While students in other years take the class, the discussion is very much focused on a building a large-scale project. That being said, Professor Adams is fantastic, and the TAs are extremely helpful.",
    "Great class for learning different ways of research and how tell when they've been used well...and poorly. Helps hone your approach to your specific research topic. Professor Adams is knowledgeable, patient, and gives great individual advice.",
    "The Prof. and TA's were AWESOME. but the material is sooo booring. Don't take unless required of you. DID however help me and provide info for me that was helpful in formulating my ideas for my senior thesis, take junior fall... its perfect timing!the student presentations were the best part!",
    "Weird, uninspiring, unhelpful. Don't take it",
    "I really recommend taking this class EARLIER rather than later in your course of study, especially if you are considering doing any substantial independent research, especially in Sociology (speaking as a Senior Sociology Major who waited until now).",
    "Great class. If you plan to do your own social science research \u0097 forget that, if you plan to READ social science research \u0097 this will be a welcome and refreshing class. Prof Adams is the best. And the proposal you produce at the end is very helpful for your senior project. Recommended without reservation!",
    "Sociology 160 01 is a good survey of various methods of sociological inquiry. Readings are diverse, and seem well chosen. The seminar setting provides a good format for discussing issues presented in course. Prof. Julia Adams is warm and seems to encourage students. She is prompt with emails and seems eager to answer students\u0092 questions and address any concerns they may have.",
    "I really enjoyed SOCY 160. As a sociology major (but I imagine as a non-major, too) it was really helpful to look at and understand the many different ways in which you can utilize these research methods to pursue your own interests. Also, I was able to build the proposal for my senior project as part of the class, which puts me ahead of schedule for next year. The class was well-organized and the reading wasn't too bad. You didn't have to worry about getting it all done every week because it was a good-sized seminar. The take-home final was also really nice.",
    "I would recommend it: a pretty easy class that provides a very useful overview of sociological methodologies and thought.",
    "This class is great for students looking for guidance on and direction for an independent research project. While it definitely has a sociology focus, it's useful for anyone interested in doing social science research, and the final project (a research proposal) is a great help. The workload isn't bad, and the class focuses on ways to think about research questions and different methods of finding answers to them. There are a lot of guest speakers throughout the semester, most of whom have good things to say, but sometimes you wish more time could be spent on the class material."
