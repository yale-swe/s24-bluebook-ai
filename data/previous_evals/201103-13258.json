    "This class cuts to the heart of public health in a way that surprised me. It covered issues that we overlook at our peril. I liked the way the assignments were arranged around a main text, with a chance to critique the text using course readings. I learned a lot from that approach. By the end of the class I felt familiar and comfortable with ethical issues that get used again and again, and often very superficially, to justify public health decisions. I will not be less tolerant of that kind of thinking (and be able to criticize it constructively)!The only weakness was the small size of the class (usually I complain about classes being too large!), something which seemed inexplicable given the importance of the topic - maybe people just don't realize how central ethics is to everything we do in public health?",
    "- A lot of reading but all very interesting- Opportunities to explore ethical issues in public health practice from a variety of perspectives",
    "The course was fantastic- I think it is critical to learn about the ethics and ethical frameworks for thinking about public health issues and interventions since the practice of good ethics is so critical in our field. I really appreciated how this class was distinct from a medical or bioethics class, and really grappled with issues that were distinctly public health. This is not to say that we didn't receive a good foundational ethical background- on the contrary, I feel much better versed in classical philosophy and ethical schools of thought after this class. The readings were fabulous, the books I will not be selling as I know they will be great future references. Professor Jennings was fabulous and so knowledgeable about the material being explored in this course. At times, I did feel like we lagged behind the syllabus and that there were some interesting readings and topics that we didn't get to focus on as much as I would have liked; however, there is only so much one can do with a class that meets once per week for a semester.",
    "This is an excellent course. It's important to understand the ethical issues related to public health to help inform appropriate policy. I sort of think what I learned in this class is comparable to a compass for guiding policy. If you're not familiar with the different ethical constructs it would sure be difficult to navigate toward a specific outcome."

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0I found the instructors teaching style very engaging and his willingness to get into class debates (even if they went off the main subject for the day) very helpful. Feedback on essays was first class and extremely helpful. His command of the topic is superb.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0- Articulate and engaging lecturer",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0As mentioned above, Professor Jennings was fabulous. He provided great feedback on our papers, talked to us at length about ideas for papers, and offered great suggestions. Despite his clear talent, he wasn't at all intimidating and was always appreciative of the ideas we brought forth.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Professor Jennings was outstanding. He designed a curriculum that truly helped provide clarity on the issues. His weekly lectures were incredibly insightful in helping to understand the material. As with other courses related to health policy, this course (and the professor) allowed students to reach their own conclusions based on the material as to the nature of ethical issues. He provided a helpful response to each of the three papers I wrote for the course. I really can't praise him highly enough -- YSPH is very fortunate to have Professor Jennings on the faculty!"

   "comments": [
    "For policy students, this is a must-take class. You won't regret it. How can you make policy recommendations without understanding the ethical basis on which different people operate? The workload is large enough to generate learning but not so large as to cripple work on other classes.",
    "A good introductory course to basic philosophical and ethical principles with a focus on applications in public health practice",
    "The first part of the course gives you a thorough education in ethical schools of thought and the strengths and limits of each. As we got into this material, we started seeing models where more than one ethical school of thought\/frameworks were mixed. Toward the latter part of the course, we started focussing more on public health problems and how all these classical ethical frameworks apply to issues of public health importance.I would definitely recommend this course to another students regardless of specific interests or foreseen future career paths in public health. As a student who would like to follow a more clinical path after the MPH, I feel that the material that I learned in the class will be particularly useful in thinking about interventional research as well as helping me to hone in on the implications of epidemiological research on questions around justice."
