    "Reading and writing. Deciphering old texts. Looking for themes.",
    "Why study the humanities? One compelling answer is the humanities provide the means to navigate a world characterized by uncertainty. This course begins with the valuable recognition that all facets of life (personal relationships, business transactions, experiencing art, reaching major decisions, etc.) require a degree of uncertainty. From here, the course explores the central question of how different humanistic fields operate under uncertainty. The course might have some features of a survey in its wide range (from law to medicine, literature to film). But unlike most survey courses, the syllabus addresses a single idea (as opposed to a single subject), and more importantly, HUMS 473 does not sacrifice depth for breath. The material lends itself to a meaningful seminar discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I thought some of the guest lecturers were off point. But then some of the guest lecturers were exceptionally interesting. So I suppose its tough to balance. Both a strength and a weakness.",
    "Professor Thompson was from the beginning thoroughly passionate about not only the material of the course but also the course's namesake: uncertainty. Although this was the first time the course has been offered, it benefitted greatly from Professor Thompson's deep understanding of the concepts to be unearthed from each text. From time to time, the seminar seemed to lose focus of its goal(s). Perhaps this stems from our rather ambiguous goal(s) or lack thereof. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a fault of the class, but I would venture that it contributed to our being distracted as a seminar, focusing on a more tangential analysis of text rather than on uncertainty.",
    "The strengths of this course are twofold. First, the dedication to exploring a single question quickly leads to cultivating key overarching ideas. Through HUMS 473, one begins to see how various strands of humanistic thought can fit into larger narratives, crossing mediums, subjects, and historical eras. Second, the course encourages diverse and insightful conversation. Simply put, this course was made for the seminar model. The weakness might have been the class greatly depends on the students around the table, primarily because the syllabus demands such flexibility to weave between subjects. Yet I felt deeply fortunate for my peers this semester, and the dependence on student contribution became a definite strength."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely would recommend. So great especially coming out of an undergrad program.",
    "Forget what you know about single word courses--Uncertainty is special, Norma Thompson is special, and you really should allow yourself this experience at Yale. Coming at the course with basic high school preparation in humanities and focusing largely in STEM at Yale, I never felt out of place in this seminar. Professor Thompson creates a welcoming and educative environment that drives her students to actually think, and that's something that I think anyone can appreciate. If you get the chance to take this course in the future, do it!",
    "Take HUMS 473 if Professor Thompson offers the course again. I regularly walked out of class, both surprised the seventy-five minutes passed so quickly and still thinking about our class discussions. Admittedly, I had the opportunity to take the class with a small group of committed peers, but I imagine the course would also be excellent in a larger setting as well (under Professor Thompsons guidance). For me, the class was a testament to the seminar model and why to pursue a liberal arts education at Yale. (Professor Thompson also brings in some interesting guest professors to supplement the material.)"
