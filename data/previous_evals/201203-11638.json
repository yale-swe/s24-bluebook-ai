    "It's kind of hard, especially at the end.",
    "Fantastic starting point for heritage speakers. I had Liu Laoshi, and I credit all of my love for Chinese to her; she is energetic, exciting, and quite the comedian. Note, however, that the class can be very demanding, with daily quizzes and homework.",
    "I loved this class! It was perfect for my level of Chinese (only spoke at home, didn't really read or write much), and Liu Laoshi was great. The textbook was interesting, discussions were fun, and the grading was fair. I highly recommend this class if you are placed into it.",
    "Depends on who you are. If you're willing to do a lot of work, then yes. This class is usually fun and informative enough to make it worth it.",
    "Chinese 132 03 was absolutely amazing. It was my favorite class even though I'm premed and an MCDB major. The professor, Liu Laoshi, is the sweetest lady in the whole world. She is so much fun, so energetic, so happy, so effective and efficient and great at what she does.Liu Laoshi makes Chinese so exciting and fun to do to the point where I felt I'd be okay with just doing Chinese homework for hours a day. Just being in her presence makes you a much happier and lively person. She brightens up your day and makes learning so so so enjoyable.She cares about you outside of the class, asks about how your day is, talks to you personally if you're depressed about something going on in your life, asks what you're doing for vacation, informs you about fellowship opportunities, has lunch with you to discuss your life (something that lots of professors don't do, in actuality), and so much more. She is your professor, your role model, your mother, your friend, etc.Her ability to teach a foreign language as hard as Chinese is unparalleled. I've taken numerous languages before with different professors back in high school, and she is by far the greatest.She has so much experience. Before Yale, she held VERY HIGH administrative language department roles back in China. After that, she worked at Princeton for a few years. And now, she's at Yale. So she clearly has phenomenal credentials which would explain why she is so extraordinary.She is an incredible human being and an incredibly understanding and intelligent professor as well.This class is a MUST TAKE if you're a heritage Chinese language speaker.",
    "Yes I recommend."
