   "comments": [
    "This course was instrumental in reading the fundamental theoretical texts of the art historical discipline.",
    "I learned a lot about different art historical theories, as the name of the class would suggest, but mostly this class helped me learn how to better understand and apply these theories in my own work.",
    "The reading list was excellent, and I feel like I developed a better understanding of the foundational texts of the discipline.",
    "Various frameworks\/approaches in the discipline of art history and their philosophical, epistemological grounding as well how such approaches apply to specific art works and artists.",
    "I developed an understanding for the disciplines within art history and the development of art history as a discipline.",
    "I learned how to read critically and apply the theory that I had been learning directly to art pieces, allowing for my own insight to shine through. I learned that I am capable of deeper intellectual thought than I thought previously, and I developed my own academic voice throughout this course. I also learned the value in being able to summarize a complex idea in a few sentences.",
    "I gained knowledge into history of art as a discipline by reading seminal theoretical texts within the field. The texts and discussion also encouraged me to think critically about art, its foundations, and its applications within history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course should be standardized by the History of Art department, so that all majors get a similar experience.",
    "This course is (I have heard from talking to other previous students) extremely variable depending on the faculty instructor. Because there is no particularly set style of teaching or curriculum, I think this course is harder to engage with and harder to understand in terms of what is expected of each student. I think the material is the strongest point of this course: it is all very interesting and I enjoyed it, but it was hard to get a lot out of this class because of the way in which it was taught.",
    "Strengths is the syllabus; weaknesses is often incomplete communication about assignments and expectations.",
    "The class is a great gateway to understanding the various approaches in the discipline and for practicing application of those approaches to specific works. A more structured course schedule and feedback on submitted works would improve the experience.",
    "Overall, I loved HSAR 401. I feel so much more confident about my understanding of the discipline now, and I feel equipped to begin to think about my senior thesis. My main critique of the class is that we had too many assignments for having only one professor. I felt that, for this reason, some of the feedback I received was rushed. I think that doing an additional 5-6 page paper (3 total) in addition to the final of 12-15 pages would have been the better option than the four reading responses, two short papers, and longer final paper than we had to do. 3-4 pages for a reading response is a very odd length, in my opinion: you can't quite review the readings and develop a deep argument at that length, but it's also a significant length. An additional short paper in place of this would have allowed for us to receive better feedback and help us stay focused in discussion.",
    "This course was well organized and the seminar setting allowed for a high level of engagement with the course overall. At the beginning of the semester, the amount of reading for the class was a lot to handle, however it was adjusted to a more manageable amount.",
    "Nicola Suthor is an absolute gem and should be considered a strength. She is so well read and so kind and genuinely invested. A weakness of this course is how much reading was assigned at the beginning of the class (which we later reduced). Once we lessened the page count, we could more deeply engage with the text at hand and I think his was a better set up. This class is a lot of writing, but you will definitely improve your skills.",
    "Really excellent important readings with assignments designed to facilitate learning.",
    "I enjoyed that it was a seminar as it allowed for open-discussion and critical thinking. The reading and writing workload was challenging however it felt overwhelming at times. I would have preferred to keep the same reading workload and perhaps lessen the writing workload by changing the reading response requirement somehow."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to all art history students.",
    "I would recommend it because it is interesting (and required for HSAR majors) but it is not the most satisfying nor most user friendly course.",
    "I would; it's important context to familiarize yourself with if you're hoping to continue in the study of Art History.",
    "Yes. Although the class could do with more concrete feedback the subjects dealt in the class are thought provoking and pushes your previous understanding of art history.",
    "I would recommend this class to a art history student, since it is required for the major, but also because it is an interesting class on the discipline as a whole.",
    "If you are an art history major, or interested in these texts, for sure. This class was very difficult at the beginning, and I put more of myself into this class than I have for any other Yale course, but it really paid off."
