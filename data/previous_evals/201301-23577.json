    "not nearly enough time for questions.spectacular line-up of guest speakers, perfectly orchestrated course, except too often it was a 2.5 hour lecture each week. there has to be time for intra-class discussion, and there almost never was. Professor should do a little less speaking and a little more questioning.we were DESPERATE to talk to each other all semester. ive never been in a class where i learned so little about my classmates despite good camaraderie and in general a great course.",
    "Despite the fact that the course didn't feel particularly rigorous, this course was great for me. I learned a lot more than I thought I was learning over the course of the semester. This course is essential for all those learning to make change in the world.",
    "An outstanding collection of readings. (I wish that more courses relied on journalism for their readings, as this course did, rather than academic articles.)",
    "It wasn't the best class for me, but it was an amazing class that would be great for others.",
    "By far, this has been the most useful course I have taken to date at F&ES. It is not focused on studying problems, but instead with solving them. In addition, this was my favorite F&ES course.",
    "Fantastic course. This is what I thought FES would be like. Strategy, history, conspiracy. This course has it all. I loved the guest lecturers, and Prof. Northrops brilliant exposition and dialogue with them. The assignments were very useful and targeted. The readings were a a bit on and off. Some were fantastic, others felt like filler. I would have liked some more rigorous academic work and exploration of social change theory, as well as some more rigorous thinking on tactics and strategy. But it was all there, in a sort of bottom up kind of inductive reasoning way.",

    "This course was extremely inspiring and an excellent window into how campaigns actually develop and win. I learned many great practical tools and am sure this class will help me in the future. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This course discusses topics that aren't covered in other classes. Beyond the nuts and bolts of how to run good campaigns--vital for anyone who needs to convince anyone of anything, basically--this course really dives into motivation, ethics, morality, tactics, the environmental movement, etc. It's refreshing to have long discussions about these topics and helped me think about why I'm at FES and what I want to accomplish with my career.",
    "Michael is wonderful. It's so refreshing to take a course with an instructor who is a practitioner, rather than an academic\/scholar. Excellent guest speakers, the material felt relevant and important, and our discussions were very grounded in reality\/actual on the ground experience. This was a wonderful class. Thank you, Michael!",
    "Helped me achieve a solid understanding of how environmental campaigns actually function \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more pragmatic than some other FES courses. Acquired incredibly useful, applicable knowledge in this course that you can't acquire in other classes. Also, it was just nice to hear about some success stories!",
    "Amazing and candid campaign speakers.",
    "The community it created and Michael's real-world perspective",
    "The guest speakers and examinations of case studies of successful cases",
    "This course was excellent in every aspect: the readings, guest lectures, instructor, and assignments.",
    "The variety of speakers, the reading, the amazing professor and TA's.",
    "People, inspiring speakers, the sense of its possible and the power of collective action and good strategy. trainings were really fun.",
    "This course is a masterfully orchestrated tour of successful environmental campaigns, mostly in the U.S. Rather than the downers we normally hear about, this course goes over campaigns that succeeded against all odds to make a huge difference in the world.",
    "This is the best course I've taked at FES. It's inspiring and motivating. I am currently applying the readings and materials I put together for the class for my internship. I wish there were more courses like this at FES."

Yeah, they get us to think a little about the readings, but they're never really followed up on in any meaningful way. Right now, they just feel like work for work's sake. I think the weekly writing assignments could be better integrated, or replaced with more meaningful assignments.",

We talk a lot in this school about what needs to be done, but comparatively little about how to do it.",

I would like to spend more time on campaigns other than climate change or oil. Social movements is particularly exciting when there is a clear need for refocusing priorities of the masses.",
    "Before this class, I was interested in policy, but from a more passive standpoint. This class made me realize that I want to work on the forefront of environmental campaigns.",
    "This was counterpoint to my scientific studies, but was just so inspiring. I felt really grateful to have access to michael and these amazing speakers and TAS. sandy, bonnie, and tom were just brilliant.",
    "I do energy and climate issues, and aim to work in energy in the private sector. I don't see myself going into campaigning after graduation (though I have lots of past work in advocacy), but this was a fascinating course given my interests.",
    "This course has changed the direction of my research and my interested. It's helped me find my passion: campaigns and advocacy. My summer internship\/research is a direct result of this course. I lament that there are not any other courses at FES to compliment this one. I am looking into creating a course that can compliment it."
