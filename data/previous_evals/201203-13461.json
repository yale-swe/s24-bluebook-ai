    "I would recommend this class and then some, easily the best course on campus. Whenever you have a chance to take it, try and do so.",
    "There is no way to convey through words the profound experience that was Great Big Ideas, except for the fact that it is probably the best course in the entire university.The online lectures? Though mostly beautiful, they're NOTHING compared to the engaging discussions led by the \"great provocateur\" himself. Prepare to have your notions of existing fields challenged, weekly existential crises, and the occasional disappointment of not capturing all of the poetic allusions, sweeping truths, or invaluable axioms that surface.Adam Glick? Deeply caring and absolutely hilarious. One of the most supporting professors--mentors, I should say--you will ever have. He is the life and blood of the course.Peter Salovey? Perhaps the most approachable president Yale will ever have. It was an indescribable privilege to have him joke, argue, and tell stories, often at Adam's expense.An environment in which you can stand up in the middle of class, be profane about some ridiculous statement you disagree with, and then get rewarded? Check.A host of surprises I dare not spoil? Yep.An atmosphere at once so electrifying, gripping, and emotional that it leaves you in a state of shock at the privilege of attending so great an university? Undoubtedly.Though Mr. Glick will not return until a few semesters from now, I strongly encourage you to take GBI with Adam's successor if offered next semester. He has been carefully chosen and will make the experience just as worthwhile.",
    "It is the most formative and transformative experience of my Yale experience thus far.Take the class.",
    "Definitely take this class! It will change your college experience and maybe the way how you view life. Adam Glick and Peter Salovey did a really great job. The weekly discussion, readings, lectures and emails from Adam were great! If you want to take a class that will change your college experience, take Great Big Ideas!",
    "YES YES YES YES YES.If you can get it...Not worth explaining. Just do it.Trust that Adam knows what he's doing and enjoy the ride.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME TO YALE FOR. THIS IS WHY YOU FUCKING PAY 50 GRAND A YEAR.",
    "I loved this class, especially being a freshman. Introduces you to a bunch of different disciplines. Not much work at all. Most of your grade is class participation, there are also 2 papers which don't matter much and a video project. If you can get in, definitely take this class",
    "I mean, it's Great Big Ideas. It is everything you've heard it is. And then a bit more.I applied on a whim, thinking there was no way I could get in. Now I can't imagine what the semester would have been like without it.I got to debate once a week for 2 hours with a snarky investment banker, the president-elect of Yale University, and 20 of the most opinionated Yalies about everything from Physics to Philosophy. Paired with a video lecture from someone at the top of their field and the coolest collection of readings for any class, every week was something to look forward to. Nothing else has changed the way I approached academics than this course.Apply to it, and be yourself!",
    "Great Big Ideas is the single greatest course I will ever take. And Adam Glick is the best teacher. Nothing else needs to be said. Or should be said, for that matter.",
    "Of course I would recommend it! It challenges the way you think and teaches you about many areas of study. The most important thing is that you learn how to defend your points and articulate your opinion in a convincing manner. Honestly, I think few courses at Yale achieve that.",
    "The best class you'll never have the chance to take, thanks to yale.",
    "You should take this class.",
    "Absolutely amazing class. Take it take it take it if you have the chance. It will change your whole outlook on life, the way you think and the way you write.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN. Oh and I love the t-shirt and gift we got at the end of the semester.",
    "Don't be fooled: this isn't a class about 12 'Great Big Ideas' - it's a class in debate, performance art and psychology. It should probably be called 'Great Big Adam Glick': the professor leads all discussion and at high volume and speed and tries to convince you to share his unconventional viewpoints. At times it feels like he wants to knock you down, beat all the academia out of you and rebuild you in a fuck-the-establishment mould. But it also means you learn how to debate, decide, convince, question and re-evaluate at lightening speed, not to mention yell at strangers at the top of your lungs. These are some of the most engaging and engaged class discussions you'll probably ever have at Yale - and the dinners after class go on for hours and hours in which you can talk about anything and everything with a really really smart group of people. But the class does have big downsides - it can start to feel like Adam is just bashing you over the head with dogmatic viewpoints that lack nuance, and there's no room for anyone overly sensitive here. GBI is best suited to freshmen and to people who haven't really had much contact with their professors - don't take this if you've thought a lot about your education and what you want to do in life, or if you just want to debate the academics of the 'Great Big Ideas', as you might just get frustrated.",
    "Wow, I don't even know where to begin. One of the best classes I've ever taken. Adam Glick has more perspective and insights about life than any academic or professor I've ever met at Yale. The whole class is about challenging established ideas and nobody does that better than Adam.Adam was absolutely inspirational for me, and it was never about grades and assignments and all the things that don't matter it was about how to think and a bit about how to live. Not too much work at all.",
    "This course is not for the faint of heart. It is also the most rewarding and eye-opening classroom experience that you will have at Yale. GBI looks at 12 subject areas (such as sociology, biology, physics, art, investing, etc.), one per week, and attempts to tease out the big ideas within each subject. Classes are structured as debates: Glick versus everybody else. Class participation is mandatory (there isn't really much point of taking the class if you're not planning to talk\/argue\/yell a bit), and you will be forced to put your ideas on trial in real time as they occur to you. You have to be bold enough to present thoughts that are only partially formed, and strong enough to handle being told that you are wrong. There is no beating around the bush in this class, and it is extremely refreshing. The writing assignments (two essays) are thought provoking and short, and the final video project offers the chance for creativity. The amount of personal attention that Adam Glick pays to each student is remarkable, and perhaps completely unique. He is an original and thoughtful teacher. It is completely insane that Yale is not allowing him to teach the course any longer - what an incredibly foolish mistake. It is cruel to deny future students the opportunity to spar with and learn from Mr. Glick.",
    "Take it. If Glick is teaching a different course at Yale, take that. The course is completely unique and the professor's goal is for you to find clarity through purposeful confusion. The seminar style is aggressive and engaging, so do not take it if you aren't willing to speak up and defend your beliefs vocally in class. There's almost no work outside of class except for two short essays, a one hour video to watch a week, and readings that aren't terribly important. The benefit of the classes really comes from the seminar itself. I think you'll get the most out of this as a freshman, but I took it as a Sophomore and still found it great and I think anyone can."
