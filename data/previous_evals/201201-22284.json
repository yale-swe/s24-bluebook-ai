    "Very interesting conceptually though I wish we had a bit more experience with the practical applications of the material.",
    "Information theory is a decent course. Take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "I would recommend the class to anybody interested in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. There may be some physics applications too, although the EE and CS applications of info. theory are much more interesting in my opinion.",
    "AMTH 364 will teach you theoretical basics that will be very useful for learning more about the fun topics in information theory. The first few weeks are spent mostly developing \"language\", but there are some elegant proofs and cool results in the middle and end of the semester. If you're new to this kind of material, the class will open up a whole new world of cool things to learn about.",
    "take this class if finding theoretical limits of data compression and sending messages through noisy channels sounds interesting to you. if you dont have a foundation in statistics and probability, this class may prove to be difficult at times, since most of the class requires this basic foundation. if youre a math major and think this class will be easy compared to pure math classes, you are basically correct, but do not make the mistake of not taking this class seriously. to do well in the class does require a solid understanding of the material, and none of it is trivial."
