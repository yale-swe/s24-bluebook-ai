   "comments": [
    "This was the first time I had studied such a discrete historical event in such detail. You get a really intimate knowledge of the witchcraft outbreaks in colonial New England. The readings are fascinating and the papers are painless, if you're used to history papers. Definitely take it!",
    "It was a good option for knocking out the pre-industrial credit, and was actually pretty interesting. However, about midway through the course the material starts to get fairly repetitive, which can't really be helped due to the sparse amount of material out there. Otherwise, the discussion moved smoothly and Professor Tannenbaum knows a lot about the subject.",
    "It wasn't what I expected from the title, but in the end was an ok class. I wouldn't take it unless you are interested in the various aspects of Salem. Every week you read a different book about another angle to the story, or from another point of view. It can get old, but it is fascinating to work with primary documents about the trials.",
    "An interesting angle from which to study the culture of early America.",
    "I would recommend witchcraft in colonial america. It is a very interesting class, especially if you like classes that focus in on a specific subject and really explore every facet of it. If you are looking for a broader survey class I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a good pre-industrial for history but... it is NOT easy. Do not take thinking it is a joke, IT IS NOT. Tannenbaum is great.... but she's a harsh grader.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Especially if you are interested in the topic.",
    "It's a really great course! Be warned that it has more papers than your average junior seminar - two during the semester and the big one at the end. But the topics are so much fun that it won't be unenjoyable. Also, Prof. Tannenbaum is really great but definitely take advantage of her office hours because she's better one-on-one than in seminar.",
    "As long as you can keep up with a pretty heavy reading load, I'd definitely recommend this class. The readings were a bit long but always interesting, discussion was fun, and there's a lot of freedom on the papers. This is pretty much what a seminar should be: challenging but worth every late night spent working.",
    "I would highly recommend this class",
    "This is a really interesting class that takes an in-depth look at many different theories about colonial-era witchcraft and how it functioned. I knew very little about witchcraft before this class (really, I only knew some of the facts about Salem), so I learned a lot. Some of the reading is a little dull, but the vast majority of the books are excellent (especially the last one, Remembering Satan - even if you don't take the class, you should read it). Two shorter 5-7 page papers and one longer 15-20 page research paper make up the entire grade, though, so make sure you put in the work.",
    "This class is the study of multiple aspects, from social to domestic to religious, of the witch hunts in colonial America. It examines the roles of the accused, the accusers and their families, the authoritative figures, and the community as a whole."
