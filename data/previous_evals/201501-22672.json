    "I learned so much in the class - professor Mccarthy is a great lecturer and very dedicated teacher. I really appreciated the lectures uploaded online because I could go back and listen\/understand the concepts (sometimes I didn't understand everything in class). The wiki was also incredibly helpful. 4 hours in lab was pretty physically exhausting however. Lab reports were pretty brutal and long. The final project was a lot of work but I also learned a lot from writing up the research report and presenting. Overall incredible class.",
    "This course is an amazing opportunity to learn how neuroscience research works. The final project is definitely a lot of work when you're doing it, but as soon as you turn in that final paper you realize how ridiculously awesome it is to be able to design and run an fMRI study for the sole purpose of a class project. The class is very technical everything you do will be on a computer, be prepared to get familiar with Terminal so be prepared to spend a lot of time working on lab reports and staring at computer screens. So it's a difficult course, but it's very rewarding. Take it especially if you're thinking about going into academia or doing more neuro research in the future.",
    "A truly amazing course. One of the most unique opportunities in the psych department and at yale. A wonderful introduction to neuroimaging research",
    "Take PSYC230L if you are interesting in doing actual psychology research at Yale. This class will provide you with the knowledge and experience you need to kick-start your research career at Yale.",
    "Take it!!"
