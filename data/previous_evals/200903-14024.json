    "It is divided into two parts with an introduction to immunology in the first part and applied examples in the second part, I think that this is a very successful approach.One way it could be improved is to slow down the lectures and really delve into examples along the way. This may make it more accessible to some students",
    "Great course - I have learned a lot",
    "detail driven. good coverage of huge amount of info",
    "This course was very interesting and provided a very good foundation for further epidemiological topics. Having a basic knowledge of immunology made it easier to understand the EMD Seminar speakers' research as well. I found that the textbook was not necessary as the lecture slides were very thorough.",
    "i learnt a lot in this class",
    "It was a great overview of immunology, and the guest lectures supplemented the course material well.",
    "The class was very good, and has an excellent and comprehensive coverage of fundamental immunology.",
    "Strengths:I like the fact the final assessment was held early in Nov, so we could get that out of the way for other work.I also like the guest speakers who spoke on different diseases and how they related to immunology.Weaknesses:Some of the guest speakers were repeating fundamental points taught to us by Prof Krause earlier on in lectures. This was not necessary and perhaps future guest lecturers can tailor their talks to suit our current level of knowledge on immunology.",
    "This is an excellent course to take. I learned a great deal and really enjoyed the material.",
    "I thought the class was very informative and fair overview of the material.",
    "A great course, Dr. Kraus summarized a lot of information in a very concise manner- it was a great intro course to immunology",
    "Strenghts- the instructor and the TA were 2 of the best I have ever had. Fantastic. The assignments were appropriate and relevant.",
    "It was really helpful course for the EMD students.",
    "I now have a decent working knowledge of the immune system.",
    "This class provided a nice summary of immunological function and I especially enjoyed the guest lecturers towards the end of the semester. I guess my only criticism would be that at times it seemed a bit disorganized.",
    "The material was taught so dryly and did not get interesting until the end of the course.",
    "We never used the discussion section on wednesdaysThere wasn't any homework, and not much incentive to do the reading because the lecture notes were comprehensive and posted on the website.There wasn't any student involvement in the course, we just listened to lecture and took exams. A more interactive course would've been more challenging and may have made the material a little less dry.",
    "I learned a lot in the course. The professor is super nice. The diagrams in the book were very helpful.",
    "The course was great in general. i would suggest that the slides have more diagrams and less text.",
    "i really enjoyed this course, but mostly because i was so fascinated by the material and so excited to learn about immunology. the format, with lots of guest speakers on specialized topics was great. professor paintsil was especially interesting. dr. krause's lectures, however, could be improved since he just read straight off the slides and went through diagrams very quickly. his lectures could've been more engaging if they didn't follow the textbook so exactly. i enjoyed the flexibility of the final paper, with the option to pursue whatever interested us.",
    "The course very very quick moving. Lots of material was covered. I especially enjoyed the end section of the class filled with guest lectures focusing on specific immunological diseases.",
    "-Good introductory course for people without an immunology background-The break-up of the course for the semester was good: course material in the first half and immunology related research in the second half of the semester.",
    "The course was fine as is. It's a biology course that went through the gist of immunology and achieved this very well.",
    "Best class I have ever had.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and the pace of the class."

    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0he's a good, fair teacher who really cares about his students. he really needs to work on his lectures and not just read through slides at a fast pace. It is not a very effective method of teaching and I would say I learned 90% from the book.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great instructor and very easy to speak with outside of classroom hours",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0very approachable. lectures were a little too fast paced for those without prior knowledge on topic.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is an excellent professor. His lecture slides were organized and he provided plenty of pictures and diagrams. He was friendly and approachable and always answered student questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0great guy, prof is extremely smart, the way information and material is presented makes it difficult to sit through, outside examples would help more throughout the lecture",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause covered the material well, however he had a habit of reading off of his powerpoint slides and moving very quickly through the presentation, which sometimes prevented students from being able to fully digest and absorb the points he was trying to make.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0I dont think there are enough words I could type to explain how excellent Dr. Krause is. Not only his dedication and understanding of the students, but his genuine interest in the subject in its entirety. Even his questions and comments in the seminar of epidemiology reiterated his desire and passion of the subject. I felt fortunate to have had him as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0His lecture notes are very comprehensive and the exams questions were straightforward and relatively easy.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0He is one of the best teachers I have had. He is very understanding of students and interested in their future plans. I would definitely take immunology again if possible.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause is an excellent professor. He is very caring and thorough with all of the material. If we ever had any questions or concerns he was available to help us. He genuinely wanted us to succeed - That is definitely something that a professor should be like.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very informative and knowledgeable. A fair grader and very assessible.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Wonderful. Not only was he a terrific instructor, he is an incredibly amicable person and I really enjoyed having him as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0The best I ever had! !!!!! Knew the material, kind hearted and a good speaker",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr Peter was a nice person and really helped when we had questions about the material. But he was not the best lecturer . He was monotonic and we used to lose interest some time.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very kind, helpful, and open to suggestions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was incredibly knowledgeable of immunology and was an enjoyable lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0I really enjoyed him as an instructor and was really happy to chat with him before and after class, but the way it was taught was not too enjoyable. Everything was straight off the slides and it made coming to class pointless, though I went to every class anyways.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Krause is wonderful - very responsive to questions, available to meet with students, and has an impressive command of the material.He went through a lot of material each lecture, which didn't leave any time for questions or discussion, and when we did have an extended class period on wednesdays, he would leave and the TA would occasionally host a discussion. It would've been more informative if the Professor had been involved, as it was the only opportunity for class participation, and the TA's knowledge was limited.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Well, you don't learn a tremendous amount in the lecture because most of his notes are written directly on the slides. It might be good to slow down a bit when going over the diagrams.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0The instructor is very personable and just pleasant to be around. He explains concepts well and takes a great interest in aiding students with any questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0dr. krause is a very kind and understanding professor. i really appreciated his willingness to meet with students or to go over the tests. as mentioned above, he could've made his lectures more interesting and engaging by not following the book so exactly and not reading directly every sentence off the slides.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is extremely knowledgeable and, although he moves through material very quickly, he is very good at explaining complex processes in simple terms. He was also always very open to questions and seems to be very passionate about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was a easy to understand and very comprehensive lecturer. Since he was a practicing doctor for years he was very good a helping connect the topics we were learning in class to everyday examples.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr Krause presented the materials really well. Focusing on the important points.- I like his summary of points at the end of each slide shows. It was a nice way of ending the class...",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Excellent. He knew the material, presented it well.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is phenomenal. He is genuinely concerned with the students understanding of the material.",

    "It is an introduction to immunology",
    "If you want to learn immunology from a public health perspective this is the class to take.",
    "very intense but fair. a lot of studying.",
    "Great introduction to immunology!",
    "Awesome course if you like hard science.",
    "For EMD students, this is a nice concise immunology course to get you started for your future work. Pretty interesting refresher too, if you have taken immunology back at undergraduate level.",
    "Immunology is a dry subject, but Dr. Krause makes me want to show up to class.",
    "We went through the entire book and covered the adaptive and innate immune systems. Then we focused on specific diseases and had guest lecturers. The class was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",
    "Yes the course coverred the basics well",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND",
    "I would recommend this as an introductory immunology course. It did not get into mechanisms of action - which may be an issue for some. However, the general concepts of immunology are unique - and it may be hard to understand the general mechanisms conceptually and cellularly at the same time. This sets a person up for the next level.",
    "This class is a useful summary of cells and functions of the human immune system. Grades were based on 2 exams, discussion section articles, and a final paper. The last few weeks of the semester saw many faculty coming in to lecture on various disease-related topics which was particularly interesting (almost like a seminar in a way). Overall an interesting class with a slightly lower amount of work throughout the semester but requiring heavy studying for the exams.",
    "The class is basically a recitation of immunology facts. You don't get anything out of it that you couldn't read from a textbook yourself.",
    "This course is nice because it is hard science based. It is a nice relief from all those other first year social science classes. There is quite a bit of memorization so I wouldn't put off studying for the test until last minute!",
    "I would say this course is a good intro to immunology, and would recommend it for people without any experience in the field.",
    "this course is a very practical basic immunology course. you learn all the basics of the immune system, but also have guest lectures on all kinds of specialty topics- immunology and HIV\/AIDS, immunology and nutrition, etc. the workload isn't bad at all and it's very interesting- definitely applicable and necessary to anyone pursuing research on any kind of disease. the basic immunology lectures are sometimes boring since they follow the textbook so directly, but you come away with a good understanding of the immune system. i would recommend it.",
    "If you like immunology, this is a great class. Dr. Krause knows everything there is to know and is an extremely thorough lecturer. If you don't, it will probably be very dry and boring. If you go to class and actually pay attention, you don't really need to use the book.",
    "I enjoyed this course as an extension of my education in biology and medical research.",
    "Great class. It could sometimes be a little dry, but it's immunology so that is to be expected.",
    "I would recommend it others, especially to other EMD students."
