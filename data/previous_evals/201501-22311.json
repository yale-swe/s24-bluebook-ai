    "Requirement of the major.",
    "It's required so yes, if you are a history major you have to do it. My recommendation would be to not only think about a topic but talk with your advisor about it before school starts in the fall otherwise you will spend all fall looking for a topic.",
    "Find a topic you love and write about it! You'll be so proud of what you produce.",
    "A ton of research, many pages of writing, but worth it when all is said and done.",
    "A course that really helps you graduate from Yale College.",
    "It's a great experience if you stay on top of your work. Do a little bit at a time over the course of the year and you can end up with a final product you're really proud of.",
    "Tough; but anything properly challenging and intellectual will be tough. Do it! This is one of the reasons to be a History major. You really learn how to research, structure your thoughts, and write clearly.",
    "Have loved the history major, wish I had put more into the essay",
    "I would of course recommend the yearlong senior essay to all History majors. The year gives you the right amount of time to synthesize your primary source materials and think carefully about your essay's arguments.",
    "I think the senior essay as it is now is a great project. I'm sorry to hear that, in the next few years, there will be the one semester essay option.",
    "Your experience will depend on your topic and your advisor, but the process is well worthwhile and I learned a huge amount.",
    "Be smart about who your advisor is, pick someone who will help you do what you're bad at. Pick the harsh professor as your advisor, so that the nice professor will be your reader.",
    "Necessary.",
    "Work hard, work early, and it'll be a rewarding experience.",
    "Finding a good adviser is key to your success. Otherwise, the project is largely a self-guided affair with little support from the department.",
    "You have to take it if you want to do the yearlong essay.",
    "You're a history major and you need to write a thesis. So yeah, take it. But also you'll embark on the first completely independent intellectual project of your life. You know how to do it, but the self discipline and organization are the learning curves here. Balancing this with the rest of senior year is really hard, especially if you're applying for jobs. But you'll feel so fulfilled if you really do stick to it. Don't write it in two weeks, advice from experience.",
    "You kind of have to do it so not really a choice here.",
    "The senior essay is truly a capstone for the History major. It is a truly powerful exercise to implement what you have learned in your coursework and write a piece of original research. While it may be daunting to begin a yearlong project, the time and effort put in over the course of the year truly pay off in the final product.",
    "The thesis is a good, worthwhile, and unavoidable experience if you plan to be a history major. That said, there are many ways it could be improved with really easy fixes. It would be helpful and not at all unreasonable to have a workshop for making a bibliographic essay or bibliography. We could have at least one writing workshop in the spring, considering all three of our originally scheduled ones for spring semester were inexplicably canceled. We could have instructions on how to turn in our draft and our thesis and exactly what to turn more than three days in advance. There are all sorts of ways to improve the experience if someone took the time to enact them.",
    "I actually really would recommend doing the 2 semester essay, even when the 1 semester one becomes optional. Spread out over an entire year, the 40 pages works out to a manageable load. Nothing beats the satisfaction of picking up the final product from the printer!! You're not going to get that same satisfaction with the 1 semester one done within a seminar.",
    "The Senior Essay is the culminating project of your four years as a history major. It is extremely challenging but also very rewarding in the end. The process is unique especially the researching and writing of a such a long paper. Make sure you find and develop a good relationship with your adviser--that will help you the most."
