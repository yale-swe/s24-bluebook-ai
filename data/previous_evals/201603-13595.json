    "I learned some new things about hip hop history, expanded my musical tastes, and met some great people. Both class projects force you to be creative and really delve into something.",
    "I learned so much about rap and my classmates--a truly special course in that latter respect.",
    "This class gave me a new perspective on contemporary hip hop, rap, and the music industry in general. It revealed the core elements of the emergence of hip hop as a genre, and the factors that shaped its development from the 70s to today. We could have directed our focus in a lot of directions, but ended up talking about subjects including sampling, trade rights, the role of women, gangster rap, violence, and lyricism, all of which were fascinating. Definitely expanded my tastes in hip hop and educated me about the foundation that current big musicians build off of.",
    "Hip Hop is a vast topic that transcends music in the worlds of dance, visual art, and DJing. Although so much is considered hip hop today, there are several basic elements that can be traced from the days of its conception."

    "This is a wonderful class. You get to learn about hip hop and meet some of your classmates in a relaxed environment. The class community, which Nick carefully curates, is the best part. Students would frequently share music, articles, and events over email. We gave each other a lot of feedback on our essay\/project ideas in class (a lot of which were really cool!). If your looking for a serious, academic look at hip hop, this isn't the right class. But though class has a lower workload, that definitely shouldn't be changed. I would've gotten way less out of the class if it was a bunch of reading. Instead, there were more opportunities to learn from my classmates, which is really what a college seminar should be about. Also, Nick is great.",
    "Strengths: our amazing professor: Nicholas Conway is a gift to Yale; one should take this class because it is interesting and important, but also to get the chance to know this fundamentally good man.",
    "Amazing class. The best days were when we started off with a purpose or topic, and then in the second half of the seminar turned to whatever aspect of that topic we wanted to talk about in more depth. That meant looking at videos of different rhyming styles, comparing our favorite and least favorite artists, and debating the legitimacy of sampling as an art form. Definitely went better when Nick talked more about a given theme, though, since he is more knowledgeable than the rest of the class combined.",
    "A strength would be the very low stress learning environment. A small weakness would be that the readings are all from different, not easy to acquire textbooks.",
    "I would love a class teaching the basics fo DJing"

    "Yes. It's a fun class where you get to listen to music and meet some great people. Worth taking even if you don't listen to a ton (or any) hip hop.",
    "Yes, this was an enlightening class. Took away a lot of lessons.",
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE IT NOW! It's so much fun and Nick is the most kind, caring, and generous teacher I have EVER had. Truly cannot emphasize how great he is. It was the best way to spend a Friday afternoon and challenged me to think about my assumptions about the music industry, hip hop, rap, and the way we consume and produce music as individuals and a society. Definitely take it - perfect 5th class. Low work load. The hours flew by every time.",
    "Yes. Fun learning environment and great class bonding.",
    "Yes, please satiate your appetite for hip hop with this class."
