    "Two things: 1) The chance to work with a stakeholder and provide useful inputs for furthering their Durban strategy and general climate change strategies. The list of stakeholders and projects were very interesting; 2) I also enjoyed the chance to bond with classmates through group work, the mock negotiations, attending meetings, etc. This has been one of the best courses at FES I\u0092ve taken for getting to know my classmates.",
    "opportunity to listen to various speakers and opportunity to work with external stakeholders such as NRDC, WRI, UNITAR.",
    "I have to say that definitely the best thing about this course was the experience of working with a stakeholder. The second best thing has to be the excellent invited lectures to the class. The third best thing would be the experience of a real life conference.",
    "working with stakeholders on real-world projects.",
    "Minimal funding to attend conferences, working with a relevant stakeholder - gaining real skills.",
    "Everything. Gordon and Angel were a star team to learn from. Angel deserves a lifetime pension after this one.",
    "Working with a stakeholder, where my contributions had a value and purpose was very important.",
    "Was the pairing of stakeholder groups such as NRDC, WRI, Red Cross etc. with student groups to work on specific projects towards COP-17 and Rio +20 intersessional.Students in the class got work with real life issues and NGOs clients. This was well run by both the Prof. Geballe and TA Angel Hsu.",
    "You get the experience and challenge of working with a real client on projects that they are implementing at current conferences. So for my group, we had to quickly learn to navigate the relationships between our client and their partner organizations to obtain information, define expectations, and find a role in which our applied work would be both useful to them while being consistent with our values and goals for the class.The trip to the COP-17 at Durban provided an excellent opportunity to then present our project work (although I was the only one in our group who went) in a professional setting and network with numerous professionals covering the same issues. Going as a confident Yale student with business cards helps in getting almost anybody to talk to you. Definitely provided an unprecedented opportunity to make contacts, discuss controversial ideas we covered in our project with real practitioners, and represent and increase the profile of our school. Websites around the world were linking to our blog posts which offered a unique perspective from Durban. Granted, you have to work to find a niche in this class and there were limited spots to go to Durban, but it's a great way to dive in headfirst to real-world dynamics.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Shorter class period, fewer student presentations",
    "I think a lot more upfront education needs to be done about the meeting that the course is focusing on, and this could take place during the time reserved for student presentations. The presentations were horrible. They were far too frequent. There often was not much progress to report between presentations, and doing them so frequently meant everyone put less effort into them; the quality was much lower to the point where they wasted everyone\u0092s time. 99% of the class checked their email on their laptops and ignored the presentations. This time could have been used to educate us more about the process instead of forcing us to learn about it in our own time outside class (time better served working on the stakeholder process).",
    "It can be better structured.",
    "I don't see a clear improvement in this class.",
    "I'm unsure how to improve this course, but I think it was frustrating to some that a PhD student did a majority of the teaching, and was most knowledgable in the subject. It's okay, because she is VERY knowledgeable, but then the course started to revolve around her personal research, which again, was relevant, and she is very qualified, but I think if this class was taught by someone with experience in this area - like Ben, etc, it could be more valuable.",
    "It would be great if the stakeholders could provide an outline of expectations, and what things he or she wants to get out of the working relationship with students early in the semester. It takes some time to get started with the work in the semester.",
    "Need more direction from professor as well, just in terms of offering more content and instruction on some of our topics. We dove into a very complex issue (REDD) that I don't think any class at FES really prepares you for, so it was slow-going for the first couple of months, and we felt like we were grasping in the dark. Need to put more work beforehand into defining the deliverables from the client organizations and looking into their backgrounds a bit. Our project was very controversial and we even wondered whether it was ethical to support it or give it legitimacy with Yale's name as a collaborator.I think the mock negotiation should happen sooner, and we could use a more structured lecture and exercise on the UNFCCC process earlier in the semester. I was completely lost for the first several weeks, but after the mock negotiation, all the alphabet soup and terms really made sense.",

    "Gordon was incredibly supportive and helpful, although I think the topics might be outside of his field. Logistical and financial support was unparalleled in terms of getting us what we needed in New Haven, New York, and Durban. Angel was amazing, I don't know how managed to balance everything she is doing, but she always made time for us, really pushed us to stay on task, and really opened doors for us. She juggled so many difficulties and challenges for this course, in addition to working on her own stuff, yet always had a smile on her face and found ways to help us. One of the nicest and best TAs ever!"

I now have dozens of new contacts that I can at least share information with and check with if I'm looking for potential opportunities in the field. The class is client-driven, real-world, and yet gives you the safety net of Yale while you feel out the project.

I did not plan on attending Durban or the Rio+20 intersessional (although I did attend the latter), because I believe that attendance at these meetings is not very valuable but it is definitely valuable to learn about them and think about their role in the landscape of environmental institutions. Instead of learning about the climate change negotiations or building a good relationship with a prominent organization, I learned about the perils of managing groupwork.

Even if you are struggling with the direction, just dive into it headfirst and create something; it will come together better that way. We agonized over the direction of the project for too long, and ended up having to leave a lot of stuff out of the policy memo anyway. Might as well do that earlier and have more time to refine the memo.",
