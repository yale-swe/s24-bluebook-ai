    "Take it if youre willing to put in the workload! And dont worry about the Type 1 prereq, you get a crash course from Pamela and its enough to get you started. Expect to spend 10-15 hours a week on projects if youre a perfectionist (Im sure most fall on the shorter end of that spectrum though) so keep your Thursdays open. Pamela is a fantastic professor and the projects are very involved. They are much more open-ended than those in graphic design and they require you to integrate many more elements. While it can be tough to make it all work together, the assignments really get you to flex a lot of your design skills especially with regards to typography. But Pamela is always there to get you through and to work with you on your process. Seriously, you often get email responses within an hour or two, even in the late evening, with very detailed feedback and constructive criticism. She is committed to your development as a designer!",
    "This class is beyond fantastic! Pamela is phenomenal, every project is exciting and well thought out, and the class is incredibly interesting with great guest critics and speakers. Note that if the class is from 1:30-5:20 on Fridays again, that our class opted to move it to 12:30-4:20 so we could get out earlier. Even with this awkward timing, take the class if you can handle the time commitment. It takes a lot of work, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend if you are very interested in graphic design because it's a good course and you learn a lot, but this course should not be taken lightly--it consists of fairly time-intensive weekly assignments.",
    "absolutely",
    "Intermediate graphic design is an excellent extension of previous graphic design courses. I would suggest this course to another student interested in art, art theory or graphic design; however I would strongly suggest taking it in tandem or after Typography I. The class occasionally calls upon typographic choices that are explored more thoroughly in Type I.",
    "Don't let the timing of this class deter you!! It is well worth your Friday afternoon. Pamela is a fantastic instructor, and the material builds on what you have learned in Introductory Graphic Design. The class is full of students from a variety of classes and majors. This course provides you with skills that are relevant to any profession. The projects are creative and build upon each other that makes sense. I am a senior and this course was one of the best I have taken in my four years at Yale."
