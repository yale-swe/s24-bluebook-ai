   "comments": [
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Definitely take it even if you do not have a background in Iraq as it is very accessible and easy to pick up. Reading is interesting and not too much, allowing you to actually complete it.",
    "No, I wouldn't. It is filled with security buffs and people who think they know more than they actually do. Discussion was always superficial.",
    "This course gives an excellent overview of modern Iraq from early Ba'athist regime to present. Definitely recommend it to any student- it's definitely possible to do well without a background in the material.",
    "Take it, 100%...or at least try to, obviously hard to get in to.",
    "Great course, great readings, great professor. Howorth shines as a discussion leader and is very knowledgeable about Iraq. If you're like me, you'll walk away from this class exceedingly grateful for your newfound understanding of the history and situation in Iraq.",
    "PLSC 183 is a well-taught, interesting seminar. It focuses exclusively on the Iraq War and the roots of the ongoing turmoil in the country. The word \"Europe\" in the title is somewhat misleading, because Europe only plays a secondary role in the class to the extent that Europe was involved in the Iraq Crisis and in Iraq historically. Professor Howorth is incredibly knowledgeable and leads interesting discussions. Overall, it was an excellent class.",
    "Yes, definitely take it!",
    "I highly recommend this class! I gained enormously in my ability to sift through complex documents in order to analyze the subtle nuancs and drivers of the Iraq crisis and its political actors. Manageable readings which are all interesting and important. No fluff here! Grat class discussions!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for any student interested in the Middle East, or any type of US foregin policy as Iraq is such an integral part of America's history as well. This class is also worth taking just for Howorth.",
    "yes, do!"
