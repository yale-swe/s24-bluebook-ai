   "comments": [
    "Math 115 is a comprehensive single-variable calculus course comparable to a high school AP BC Calculus course, but more in-depth, faster-paced, and more challenging. Weekly problem sets did not prove to be a huge time demand, so the workload outside of class was not excessive. However, it is also relevant to note that the class contained students who had taken AP BC Calculus, or just AP AB Calculus-- for some who took just AB Calculus in high school, and were thus learning significant parts of the curriculum for the first time (among many who had already learned these concepts), the course was much more challenging and competitive. Overall, however, Math 115 was a good calculus course for anyone who wants to solidify their knowledge of single-variable calculus, without jumping into a more advanced course (multi-variable).",
    "I hadn't taken BC Calc in high school even though many people did in the class but I found it very reasonable. Swarnendu is probably the best professor you can get for this class. I would recommend him specifically.",
    "calculus II.. not too exciting, and the curve isnt too great. you need to stay on top of the material or you will fall behind big time.",
    "It is not hard. Just get the textbooks and study it. I would recommend taking it only if you need it\/ do not mind simple and plain calculus.",
    "If you have only taken AB calculus in high school, this course is manageable, but can be difficult for those students. The midterms are very difficult and it is hard to understand information during the classes. Lots of outside work\/help is needed. I would not recommend the course to someone who is looking for an easy math course.",
    "This class made me miserable this semester. The tests are way too hard, and some of the problem sets can take forever. Don't take it unless you absolutely love math. It seems like most people have taken Calc BC already, which messes with the curve. If you have to take this class, try to get Swarnendu. He's good and pretty funny.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes. But be ready to do a lot of self teaching.",
    "You definitely need a mathematical inclination, but I would recommend it to my peers.",
    "not much work, just very tough problems. copious studying won't really help.",
    "Take it with Datta if you can, because he's great at teaching you what you need to know and teaching it well and he has a unique sense of humor on top of that. It's a basic math class, but that definitely doesn't mean it's simple.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to someone who has completed AP Calc AB or BC in high school. Good math course if you need to fulfill a Premed requirement.",
    "I would recommend math 115 only if you have to take it as I did not like all the stuff about the series etc.",
    "I would tell them it is the worst thing in the world and will make you cry. I would not recommend this class ever.",
    "This course is like calc bc but with some added topics. It's most likely a requirement for you so I would recommend it.",
    "Yes",
    "I think it was a good course. I would recommend it because I gained a deeper understanding of calculus, and while it was hard at times, when I finally grasped certain concepts, it was very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it if you like math, if not you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "A lot of the students in Math 115 have already seen the material before. This does not necessarily mean that the tests are any easier for them but if you have not seen the material before, you'll have to put in more work. Overall, I would say take the class if Math is something you care to know. Quantitative skills are usually an asset.",
    "This is a course about integral calculus and series. If you took AP BC Calc, it will be mostly things you've seen before, but don't expect it to be an easy course, because it's not.",
    "I would recommend it. I found the problem sets interesting and not too repetitive."
