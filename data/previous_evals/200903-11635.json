   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is not a workload burden at all, and a cool explorative, relaxed atmosphere.",
    "Joan is an extraordinary person, creates a safe space, the exercises we did were fun but not much structure.",
    "Take it, it's fun, but you don't do\/learn a whole lot. You do end up bonding with your classmates a lot though, which is nice, and some of the exercises are very cool. We only did one real \"scene study\" the entire semester, though.",
    "Joan's 210 was a lot of fun and very little work. I am not sure how much I learned per se, but it was great to have the freedom in a class to co-create what we were studying, and to have an actual input in what we did. We did quite a bit of movement and a little bit of voice work, worked extensively on a self-written monologue, and did two scenes each. If physical work sounds exciting to you, take it with Joan, if you want something more cerebral, try Connie, and if you want more self-exploration, try Deb.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It made me even more interesting in pursuing acting as a career, and it was a wonderful, fun, non-stressful course that I always looked forward to.",
    "If you have had a lot of acting training, you will not find this class very rewarding. However, it is a prereq and as a prereq it is very enjoyable. You learn how to become a true ensemble, which was a good and valuable experience. But this truly is an \"Introduction\" to performance concepts, so don't expect to advance in technique very much if you already have a good foundation in training.",
    "Theater Studies 210 is difficult to summarize, both because (based on talking to students in other sections) the different instructors take very different approaches to the course, but also because the class is so dependent on the ensemble of students engaged in it. It is this unpredictability and creativity that lends the course its vitality, but those seeking structure or concrete information might be frustrated.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Obviously, a necessary class to take as an actor or theater studies major that varies greatly based on the professor and the students. Take it if you are interested in continuing the theater studies major or having a self-exploratory class, but do not take it to learn much about theater theory or in-depth acting methods."
