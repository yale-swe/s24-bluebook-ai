    "Yes. Great class. Fascinating and relevant material. Reasonable work load.",
    "Take it.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Great class.",
    "This class tackles all the major debates facing terrorism since 9\/11 and you better come prepared to class because if you don't you will be unable to get a word in during discussion. Every week there were amazing debates and by the end of the class you will become impressed with how much information your fellow students know...and impressed with the information that you will be able to learn.",
    "This course will make you re-evaluate everything you thought (or didn't bother thinking about) in the 'war on terrorism.' Do the reading, but it isn't so unbearable, and Professor Stimson is amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to students seriously interested in the practical implications of moral inquiry and ethical decisions, particularly as they pertain to the current and past anti-terror tactics.",
    "Recommended if your interested in terrorism; really nice conceptual overview of a topic that can appear analytically vapid.",
    "Take this courseif you're interested in a legal perspective of pertinent political issues surrounding terrorism. The discussion of torture and civilian courts vs. military tribunals was especially well structured and well conducted."
