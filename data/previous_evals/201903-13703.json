    "I learned about different ethical and moral theories, as well as ethical codes of conduct in various professional settings.",
    "I dont think I developed any skills but I learned a little about philosophers and different ethical dilemmas.",
    "This course is a great introduction to ethics, especially if you care more about how to apply ethics in the real world.",
    "The course gives students an analytical framework for evaluating situations that are ethically ambiguous, specifically within but not limited to the realm of business.",
    "This course allowed me to gain a broad overview of ethics in an interesting and practical way.",
    "I developed critical thinking skills, and reading and analyzing case studies.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Carreras' enthusiasm for the course material; Weaknesses: low level of student engagement",
    "Making the lectures more engaging and interesting would improve this course. The content is interesting, but it's delivered in such a dry way that it's hard to stay engaged.",
    "Strengths of this course included Mercedes -- she is very passionate about her teaching, and it shows through every lecture. The weekly case studies are also interesting to read about. Sometimes, the lectures could be a little dry, so perhaps more in-class case studies could help to engage students more.",
    "Overall, terrible structure to the course and senseless assignments. TA's all graded assignments differently.",
    "The homework consists of case studies that are interesting to read about; we also did cases in class that were interesting to discuss. I thought it was interesting to apply ethical concepts from various thinkers and philosophers to real-life situations.",
    "Although the professor was very smart, the class was incredibly boring and felt like a waste of time. I wish we had had more engaging lectures and discussions with the material.",
    "Great course! Some weeks were perhaps more case-heavy than needed, but still a lovely course overall.",
    "The course is great and you more or less get out what you put it in, but if you get a TA that disagrees with your particular approach to solving ethical issues, you're gonna have kind of a rough time with the psets, especially since they're never present in class.",
    "I liked this course because prof cerraras uses videos and case studies to illustrate points. However, the homework assignments were often long and redundant.",
    "Strengths: low course work and very nice teacher but a definite weakness is the TA system. Some TA's grade incredibly hard in this while others are much more reasonable with the expected responses. Some want you to copy verbatim what the case study response is.",
    "I like the use of videos and media to aid in teaching."

   "comments": [
    "Sure; For those who have learned some political philosophy or have taken ethics courses, this might be a good refresher. For those who have not, this may provide good framework for making ethical decisions in the business world.",
    "Yeah, it's pretty chill and a great way to learn about some introductory moral theories\/basic philosophy! The course can get dry sometimes though",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a gut that is relatively interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a slightly lighter workload, and who is interested in learning about different ethical theories and principles in professional fields. If you are not interested in learning these things, it might be a bit hard to sit through lectures, which can sometimes be very information-heavy.",
    "No. The material and assignments are overall very senseless and there are no continuous themes are structure to the course.",
    "Yes, this is a great course! It was not too stressful, which I believe helped make learning and absorbing the material easier.",
    "I would not because although the content could have been interesting, it was a very boring lecture",
    "yes great interactive discussion in the class",
    "Take this course if you would like to learn about ethics without having to sit through a boring and intense philosophy class.",
    "I think a lot of people feel that this is one of those classes that you absolutely must take before you graduate, and I think this class can be that good if you're willing to engage with it a little bit, but if you're looking for something that you don't really need to be present for and that won't challenge you you should probably take something else.",
    "Definitely take this class if youre looking for a chill, interesting way to engage with ethics and are planning on entering the professional world post graduation.",
    "Definitely take this class with Professer Carreras. She is so nice, the class is interesting, and the workload is not too bad. Wait until senior year as only seniors get in."
