    "In Summary! -- EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT GANDHI!!This class takes you into philosophy, history, political theory and so much more. Prof Desai is ammazing! but be careful, if you dive too deeply into gandhian philosophy is might make you slightly crazy... If the point of education is to change the way, or as some might say \"enhance\" the way you look at the world this class definitely does that!",
    "Yes. It's a great class and wonderful opporunity to learn something interesting and valuable.",
    "Take it! You learn a lot about a really important historical figure with a great professor.",
    "Take this class even if you have no real interest in Gandhi or Indian history\u0097you won't regret it."
