    "In summary, we read a lot about what other artists and critics have thought about art, artists, and critics in the 20th century, and ultimately how it's up to the artist to create--regardless of what others say or discourage. It had the feel of a self-help seminar, with assignments that built up our confidence. But it was still entirely up to us to begin work. There were not check-ins or presentations or in-class crits, like in Junior Seminar.",
    "It's new this year, and it first seemed a little odd, but you'll definitely learn a lot. Robert Storr is head of the art school for a reason, and talking about art with him for two hours once a week could never be a bad thing for an art major.",
    "If you're an Art major, you don't really have a choice...but this is a really worthwhile class. If you're a Computing and the Arts major, definitely take it if it's with Prof. Storr. Otherwise, it's probably still worth checking out. It was much more helpful to me as a CompArts major than 395 was.",
    "Yes."
