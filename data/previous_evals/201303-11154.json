    "A good intermediate German course. The syllabus occasionally left something to be desired: somewhat superfluous and, on occasion, patronizingly simple, 'cultural' elements of the course too often took precedence overgrammar and actual language learning, in my opinion, but nevertheless I came away at the end of the semester feeling much more confident in my German abilities, particularly listening and speaking. Andrew was a fantastic instructor, if he's teaching next year\/semester. Really funny and always very helpful and understanding.",
    "Andrew Kirwin is an excellent German teacher! I hear he might be teaching different courses next semester, as opposed to one of the German levels, but if that changes, do try to take a class with him. He is very helpful and has a good sense of humor that puts everyone at ease. He also has the invaluable skill of requiring thoughtful answers from students without making them feel stressed or as though they are being put on the spot. I liked this course very much, as I did German 120. There were few problems, though they would include the format of the online homework (not being able to see your answers after you submit them wasn't very helpful), and the relative disconnectedness of the different units (not the most conducive to long-term memory). I felt the course was appropriately challenging without being unmanageably difficult. Also, the fact that the final is a video project instead of an exam is VERY stress-relieving, as the work is spread out. However, to make sure that this is actually so, I would advise not waiting until Thanksgiving Break or even after it to start filming!",
    "In general the course was pretty good, but the homework was really disorganized and confusing. I don't recommend taking German unless you need to fulfill thelanguage requirement, but if you are going to take it, definitely take it with this Andrew Kirwin. There were about 7 different types of online homework, all through different websites. These different formats often wasted a lot of time and didn't teach us much. It was a huge hassle to keep track of them, and there ended up being tons of busy work. The main website that we had the most homework on had a grading system that only worked about half the time, and we inevitably ended up spending the first 5-10 minutes of every class trying to resolve issues with the technology involved in the homework assignments. However, Andrew Kirwin was a really fantastic teacher. I had him for a total of three semesters, and he was consistently clear, helpful, kind, and a pleasure to learn from. He made class enjoyable and funny, and really took an interest in individual student's progress. He was always willing to give extra help, and was very generous with his time. I couldn't say enough good things about him, and would absolutely recommend taking a class with him.",
    "Beware that tests get a lot harder (sometimes unfairly so) during L3 and the online homework continues to be a pain."
