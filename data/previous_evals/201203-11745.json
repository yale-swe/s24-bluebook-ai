   "comments": [
    "Your ear will be trained to work in \"harmony\" with your mind and your pen. This is a required class but is very enjoyable and is an essential skill for any musician.",
    "Great class for continuation of developing ear muscles- work with augmented 6th, neopolitans, and other more chromatic harmony.",
    "A prereq for the major, but if you're a musical person (and you've already taken the much easier 218) looking for a half credit, take this. Virtually no work outside of the class, and in class is a breezy fifty minutes of singing, listening to music, and taking dictations. Keyboard labs can be annoying but it helps to get a partner who you're friends with. The quality of the class can depend based on who's teaching so make sure you shop the other sections.",
    "If you're a music major you have to take this. It's definitely possible to get a good grade even if you're ear is not the best. You should also probably take this if you're a musician at all, even if you're not a Music major."
