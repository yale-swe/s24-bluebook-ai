    "It seemed much more skewed to CDE than SBS. As an SBS student I did not feel like any of my interests were remotely incorporated into the lectures. Everything was incredibly research-based - I understand that is the focus of the program but it would be nice to hear more about projects like Tim Mercer's for those of us who are more interested in public health practice.",
    "It would be nice if the speakers were more chronic disease-specific. It would also be nice to have more snacks since it's right during lunchtime.",
    "Interesting lectures.",
    "There was a great variety of topics presented in this seminar. Some of the speakers were very interesting.",
    "Very interesting topics and presenters",
    "I enjoyed most of the lectures, especially Margaret Wrensch's!",
    "Good way to hear about new and emerging research in CDE\/SBS",
    "Te seminars were all informative and engaging. I enjoyed the selection of topics and learned a lot about the research going on at Yale as well as at other institutions around the country.",
    "Great speakers",
    "I found it infuriating that the course instructor did not use the roster from ClassesV2; instead, she created her own (incorrect!) roster from the first-years in SBS and CDE. This meant that anyone taking the seminar in their second year (for instance, anyone in the 5-year joint degree program -- i.e., myself) was completely left off of the emails! I missed the first two meetings because of this, even though I was officially enrolled in the course according to the registrar and also a member of the ClassesV2 group. This is an unacceptable mistake and must be remedied for next year. Every other professor has figured out how to use ClassesV2 -- you can too. You cannot just ignore the students that take courses in a different order.Also, this was a useless seminar; I don't know why it's required. The topics have nothing to do with my interests, and the vast majority of the speakers were terrible lecturers.",
    "In the future, it would be helpful to provide students with a finalized list of the speakers and the dates of the lectures at the start of the semester, so that students may prepare for the lectures in advance (e.g reviewing the speaker's research, preparing questions for the speaker, etc.).",
    "I did appreciate the speakers that were brought in for the seminar series. I learned a great deal about the research being done on campus and outside of Yale. It was enlightening and I liked hearing about the work people are doing. It also helped me hone in on the specific fields of epidemiology that I find particularly interesting.",
    "N\/A",
    "The seminar was very interesting. Many great speakers were brought in, and it was nice to hear about various research initiatives happening at Yale.",
    "The lecturers were interesting and I enjoyed each week we met.",
    "interesting topics",
    "Some seminars went over my head and I had no idea what the speakers were talking about. Other seminars were very interesting, including the presentation on the validity of epidemiological studies.",
    "This seminar was great- I learned a lot about the different research areas in CDE and SBS. It was also an opportunity to hear about what is going on at Yale and other universities in the realm of Public Health."

    "It is a lecture series with speakers in SBS and CDE. I would recommend it as a way to have exposure to research at Yale.",
    "These lectures offer an opportunity to learn about current research and developing ideas within our specific field of public health.",
    "it's useful for understanding what kind of opportunities are out there and see some real example of research in public health",
    "This seminar is required of all first year CDE and SBS students. The speakers give you a look at the different areas of research and practice happening in CDE and SBS. Not everything will interest you."
