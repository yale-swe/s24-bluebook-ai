    "Huge developments in more formal\/written Chinese, a great handle on various relevant topics in Chinese, more comfort in handwriting and essay writing.",
    "As always, taking Chinese is the only way to keep up and improve language skills. The course particularly stresses formal writing style, and thus I feel I am much more able to properly write in Chinese.",
    "I learned how to write a more formal essay in Chinese",
    "Zhou laoshi worked hard to help us understand how to write and communicate more effectively rather than just teaching us new words (although we learned plenty of these as well)."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Consistent syllabus, great readings, Zhou Laoshi's passion and empathy. Weaknesses: Not enough feedback in writing, not enough opportunities for debate-style speaking practice.",
    "This class' biggest strength is Zhou Laoshi. He is patient, kind, very thorough in his teaching style, and understands what students of this level need and do not need. He doesn't stress rote memorization as much as style and writing eloquence, and his requirements seemed to be very fair. I think the biggest weakness in this class is the same for nearly every Chinese class, and that's just that some of the units' content is not engaging. It comes pre-prescribed from a textbook we use, so I don't expect it to be fixed, and of course interest is subjective, but some vocabulary words we cover will just never be used in real life.",
    "I really appreciate that Zhou laoshi focuses on developing skills rather than rote memorization.",
    "Strong course, Zhou Laoshi is wonderful. A little confused sometimes about which assignment was the most recent or whether the next assignment had been posted yet, but this was usually easily resolved.",
    "At times follows the textbook too closely (I.e. quizzes are jus regurgitating the text) but the presentations and tests do a good job focusing more on refinement of writing skills and less on memorization of characters, which is great at this level of Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Very important piece of the puzzle in Chinese education--learning Zhou's philosophy of written Chinese is invaluable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you're on the Chinese track and you've made it this far, don't quit now that you've made it to the good classes. It's finally 3 times a week instead of every day, Zhou Laoshi is the absolute man, and the classes are typically small enough that you will get a lot of speaking time. Chinese is a fantastic skill, and if you have the option to continue, I say you do it.",
    "Yes, definitely a great class for students who have taken Chinese for several years.",
    "A great course, no reason to try to skip out of it when you come back from Light, you'll keep learning more here!"
