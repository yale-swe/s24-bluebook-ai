    "I think this was a great course. It offered a strong reading list and presented the intersection of AI and philosophy quite well. Though the readings were at times dense or very specialized, the lectures did a good job of distilling the important information. I happen to be quite interested in this topic, personally, and found the class captivating. As a writing credit, the work load was quite reasonable, though the prompts often left too much room for interpretation (which became a problem if you answered a question that McDermott wasn't looking for). I would have liked to see a little more class discussion early on, rather than 75 minutes of straight lecture. As the semester progressed, we did get a chance to debate more of the counter-intuitive topics, which I appreciated.",
    "Interesting philosophical discussion, but do not take if you are looking for an AI class. It's great at what it is.",
    "Great 400-level elective for engineering \/ CS majors who also need a writing credit. Two papers and a ton of optional reading."
