   "comments": [
    "Learnt how to read critically and to analyze a wide range of texts. Explored a number of writers with great insights into a number of topical issues regarding the mind and self.",
    "You will learn how to think critically and apply what you've read in the text to in-class discussions that extend the material into a broader context.",
    "Ethics and Self-Knowledge brought us through thinkers including Plato, Augustine, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, Fanon and Rankine. The class reading list was thrilling because it encompassed such a wide range of genres, including aphorism, autobiography, writings about psychotherapy, exposition, and poetry. Yet, Professor Russell ensured the class was grounded in philosophy we approached this diversity of texts through a philosophical lens. Ethics and Self-Knowledge introduced me to a new kind of epistemology: whether we do and can know ourselves, and if so, how we can know ourselves. Does it involve solitude and an inner search? Do we need to talk it out to another person? We explored these questions in conversation with ethics and moral behaviour. With Professor Russell's guidance especially, I learned a new way of analysing a philosophical text: i.e. not just deconstructing, reconstructing and critiquing it, but engaging with it vis-a-vis a new, original way of reading it. This class not only was incredibly intellectually stimulating, but also was personally rewarding. I had the sense that the texts we read and the insights we gained mattered to me as a person in this world. The flow of the class was especially organic: we started Plato's Alcibiades - where the question of self-knowledge all began - and ended with Fanon and Rankine, which situated the topic of this class in the \"real world,\" where self-knowledge, and the communication of the self to an other, can be incredibly racialised and political.",
    "I learned about how to read and write and discuss philosophy.",
    "I learned to read traditional and non-traditional philosophical texts through the particular lens of self-knowledge. I improved my philosophy writing skills and engaged with new texts."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Russell is the strength of this course. She is both incredibly knowledgable and super approachable. I also think the mini-lectures she opened class with ere helpful and interesting. I think the syllabus is interesting, but could be better balanced. It was a mix between reading the same author for a month or switching authors every class, and I think balancing a little how much time we spent on certain thinkers would be good. I will admit I got a bit tired of Freud by the last week, and there were other works we only talked about for one class that I would have loved to spend more time on. Discussion was all right--but I think that has more to do with the people in the course than the professor\/design for the most part.",
    "This course has a really interesting and eclectic syllabus, which manages to cover a wide range of different works (and different kinds of works) and still feel cohesive. Professor Russell gives really interesting, well-organized mini-lectures at the beginning of each class session. The readings were definitely reasonable and well planned in terms of their overall sequence. I generally enjoyed the student presentations also, and found them to be helpful. The assignments and workload were also very reasonable and provided a meaningful way to engage with class material. The one thing that I occasionally found dissatisfying was the coherence of class discussions. Sometimes it felt as if our discsussions were all over the place, jumping to another topic before we could dig deep enough to reach any meaningful point with the first topic. This was certainly not always the case, but occasionally. There were also times that it felt like the discussion questions were so open-ended that students were all speaking to different points in a way that felt disjointed. Overall, though, this course was really enjoyable and well run.",
    "Strength: prof. Russel - chose great texts and writers for us to read, was very passionate about the material and teaching it to us, ensured we all participated and gained from every discussion. Weakness: perhaps tried to cover too much content in too short a period - needed more time to synthesize the great texts we were reading.",
    "Strengths: Professor Russell opened each class was a mini-lecture. I've never been in a seminar where the professor does this and I found her lectures immensely grounding and inspiring. They helped to anchor and guide discussion, and also gave our readings a huge breath of life because Professor Russell's insights were often very intriguing, deep and captivating. The syllabus was exciting because many of the texts don't occur very often in Yale philosophy classes, like Freud and Fanon. Professor Russell is an excellent professor in that she is very able to bring all students into discussion and create an atmosphere where all students feel comfortable speaking up, no matter if they're a first-year, no matter gender. I also really appreciated how our class was grounded in philosophy even when the texts departed from the \"traditional philosophical canon.\" Great that we spent more weeks on Nietzsche, Freud and Marx too. We also had a movie screening of Todd Haynes' Safe which enhanced my learning tremendously and got me even more excited about the material, upon realising how the topic truly pervades all art forms! Improvement: Discussion went too many directions sometimes, because students would ask a multitude of questions that may not necessarily be linked. Since each seminar is only 1h 15min, the discussion was most enriching when it followed 1-2 trains of thought. The questions Professor Russell posed during her short presentations at the start of class were the questions I would've liked to follow through more thoroughly via discussion (as supposed to the random questions sometimes posed by students in class.)",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. I wish we had been given less reading because we would read a huge amount and then only talk about a tiny portion of it. I think I could have gotten more out of the course if we had less reading because I would have had time to understand it.",
    "The course's syllabus is incredibly interesting, and allows students to approach the topic of self-knowledge from different angles (philosophic, psychoanalytic, race, gender, etc.). Professor Russell is an attentive, clear, and engaging seminar leader -- and she strikes a good balance of clarifying the readings while still encouraging students to push their thinking to more difficult questions.",
    "This course got better as it went on. It really shined by the time we got to Marx and race theorists. Reading Nietzsche and Freud felt a bit fragmented as we pulled from various locations. Generally it would have been helpful to have all the required essays available in a print format from tyco. As it was, most classes everyone read from their laptops, which detracted from discussion. I also would have liked to see a slightly different format for discussion. Having both a professor introduction and a student introduction felt redundant, and sometimes it would've been nice to get into discussion without any lengthy intro."

    "Yes! Great Professor and interesting topics.",
    "If the syllabus and\/or overview of the course look interesting to you, then I dont think youll be disappointed. Professor Russell is extremely knoeledgeable and helpful, and makes the class a wonderful experience.",
    "Prof Russell is great and the readings were brilliantly selected and conducive to learning and analytical thinking - left the course feeling as if my intellect wasnt greatly increased\/refined",
    "Totally! Philosophy is a great way to expand your outlook on the world, even if this class does succumb to its traditional euro-centric biases.",
    "Yes! This class was one of the best philosophy classes I've taken at Yale, partially because I loved all the texts we read, and partially because Professor Russell is such a brilliant mind and engaging, nurturing instructor. If you're interested at all in the question of whether we can know ourselves and how self-knowledge guides or changes moral behavior, take it.",
    "If you are interested in philosophy, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the role that self knowledge plays (or should play) in ethical thinking, or anyone who is interested in critical theory\/non-ideal moral theory.",
    "Yes, especially if you like the authors discussed and would like to read their work from a slightly new perspective."
