    "I",
    "This course provided me with a review of and introduction to a collection of intellectual frameworks for situating my own research in a broader discursive milieu. It encouraged me to engage with theorists I would not otherwise have read and think through how to relate them into an understanding of coherent, if diverse intellectual project.",
    "I believe I understood the value of reading and appreciating philosophy from primary sources, and then participating in the discourse around that. The course was highly effective in terms of instigating conversation and breaking mental barriers to understand and unpack otherwise dense concepts.",
    "To think about architecture in depth, conceptually and philosophically.",
    "This was a great course in providing an overview of various theories of imagination and perception from the Early Modern (plus Aristotle) period through the 20th century. I think I gained a richer vocabulary for talking about these concepts and new ways of thinking about them. It definitely opened up new avenues of inquiry that I'd like to pursue further in my studies.",
    "I gained in depth knowledge of difficult philosophical texts I hadnt read before, and more confidence in reading texts of this kind.",
    "From this class I was challenged to be free."

   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful course that allows one to delve into many interesting texts from different philosophical traditions in order to figure out what this thing we call the \"imagination\" is all about. The freedom experienced here in the process of reading, interpreting, and debating the texts with the other students has been amazing. Very few weaknesses could be pointed except for the fact perhaps, at times, this freedom was so great that we would lose a bit of perspective regarding the organization and direction of the materials.",
    "The course dealt with topics and readings that fell in a wide ranging spectrum of difficulty. This made for a rich, but often uneven class discussion that at times would take a long time to arrive at valuable insights. This provided some in the class the opportunity to enhance their understanding of subject matter by exploring avenues for explaining their interpretation, while for others it could come across as alienating. Shorter or more precise primary source reading excerpts paired with secondary source readings might be one way to address this issue. Another potential avenue would be providing some framing comments about the upcoming readings at the conclusion of each preceding class, so that students are alerted to which areas of the text require specific attention.",
    "Strength was all the reading materials, no weaknesses.",
    "I can't really think of any specific weaknesses. Sometimes the readings varied greatly in length so that could be \"jarring\" from week to week. I'm not exactly sure the course was lacking because of it, but there was little (no) secondary material considering the texts we read from the outside. Strengths were our deep engagement with philosophers and the sustained conversation week to week.",
    "The only thing I would change about this course is one or two less weeks for presentations, so we could add additional readings."

    "Yes, no doubt.",
    "Yes. I think the course offered a good overview of approaches to a particular topic that would be of interest to a broad range of students that would allow these students to develop and apply their own intellectual frameworks relative to this topic.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to learn how to really theorize what we actually do in architecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in theories of the mind and vision. It was a great selection of readings.",
    "Definitely"
