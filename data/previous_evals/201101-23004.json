    "I would recommend it -- I learned a lot about an era of history that no other yale class really covers.",
    "An overview of world war two in the pacific. you learn less about strategy and war, and more about the cultural ramifications of the war on china and japan. I would have liked to hear more of a US perspective. It was mostly focused on Japan.",
    "yes definitely would. great course that gives you the japanese perspective of the asia pacific wars.",
    "This is a good class, especially if you're looking for a Non-Western credit.",
    "Yeah, its a good course for understanding another side of WWIIthat doesn't get talked much about. The workload is like most other seminars and is very manageable. Prof DiMarco's office hours are very useful. If you do the readings you'll get a lot out of them.",
    "This class covers the Wars in East Asia, that is, wars involving Japan and other countries from the 1890s through 1945. Sample topics included causes of the wars, comfort women, the Nanking Incident, the atomic bombings, the Tokyo war crimes trials, and documentaries\/memories of the conflicts. The class was primarily centered on Japan, but topics naturally shifted to Korea, China, and the United States, among others, and no particularly advanced knowledge of Japan, Japanese, or East Asian history was required. The class was well organized and taught, and I recommend it ifthe material seems interesting."
