   "comments": [
    "Very challenging texts; listen in lecture and in section. This will probably help you more than doing the reading in its entirety because its so dense. Squashed philosophers was my best friend.",
    "If you get Possen, don't trade your spot! He's amazing at explaining the material and getting the class involved. He'll go further than any other professor in order to help students. He also runs a great study session before the final.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. These philosophers talk\/scream at each other, and it's so cool to watch. You cannot be awakened from your dogmatic slumber without it.",
    "Directed Studies is a powerful and challenging program. By the end your DS year, you wil be familiar with most or all of the quintessential theories of Western thought. For every aspiring leader, thinker, or writer, DS should be your beginning. However if you choose to do DS, I highly recommend that you focus upon it, and select only one extracurricular activity. DS should be enjoyed. With numerous extracurriculars, DS will become an incredibly stressful and less rewarding experience.",
    "Second Semester Directed Studies Philosophy provides a great introduction to modern philosophy. The thinkers are more varied and interesting than the first semester philosophers, and the issues seem much more relevant to modern thought. Professor Possen was an absloutely amazing section leader, and I would recommend taking any class with him. He both cares about his students and can explain the material very well.",
    "This is a very good introductory course to modern philosophy. It is mainly focused on ethics and metaphysics, and it covers a wide range of thinkers and philosophical schools. Compared to the other sections, this one has a manageable workload and the texts tend to be very engaging, although also complex and containing somewhat arcane ideas. Anyone who considers being a philosophy major and is also interested in the humanities to the extent of wanting to be enrolled in DS should take it.",
    "It is difficult and a lot of work since you cover many dense works (including Kant) in such a limited time, yet you will emerge with a strong grasp on the history of philosophy if you take this course. Plus, it is actually a very enjoyable class, if you take it with a professor such as Professor Possen."
