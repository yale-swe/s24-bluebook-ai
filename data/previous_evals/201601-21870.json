    "You need to take this class. You will grow as a scientist and you will grow as a human being.",
    "take it Continuation of 344 which you should also take one of the best classes at yale!",
    "Good course to learn the basics in biology research. Great students and TAs. I found that the professor digressed too often, thus explaining the need for a 10 hour per week block for the class. Lab could have been shortened by a few hours a week if we remained on task. Beyond that I enjoyed the class and the community it built.",
    "MCDB 345L, along with MCDB 344L, are hands-down the best ways to finish the biology lab requirements! Not only do you learn a lot, but you also do so in a nurturing environment with Professor Wolenski, a talented TA, and a family of students. While it's a lot of time in the lab (8-10 hours split between Monday and Wednesday), there's no commitment outside of the lab, except for a 15-minute \"job talk\" presentation where you present on a published paper. While this took some time, it's an extremely useful skill to have in the future. Overall, amazing lab with almost no graded assignments and lots of learning!",
    "Continuation of 344. Take it, simple as that. This course is more about using what you've learned to solve a problem, than learning the techniques (but you still do learn techniques)",
    "Having to continue this course as part of the 344\/345 series was a rewarding experience. The TA in the class was just as enthusiastic and well-prepared. Putting in the same amount of effort, if not more than from the first half, I continued to learn a lot in the course. A very enjoyable module on immunology was presented to us in this course.",
    "Take it! Take it!",
    "This is the continuation of MCDB 344L. Please sign up for both, and so so in advance. The class maintained the high standards set by the previous module. From both classes, I felt that I have learned a lot and matured as a scientist, especially due to the practice job talks we had to give. This class deserves its demand and reputation.",
    "A wonderful course--will help you become a better scientist and communicator. Dr. Wolenski and the TAs are fantastic! Take it if you have the opportunity!!",
    "TAKE IT IF YOU CAN! But sign up for the waitlist early because it is incredibly long (18 months!) The experiments are interesting and there are no lab reports, just a quiz and a 15 minute presentation on a scientific article, defending it as if it were your own. Wolenski is the man and will help you out in and out of the lab.",
    "Overall, this course was one of the best I've taken because of the dedication of all the instructors."
