    "The films are great, but I'm not sure if it's worth going through the class to watch them. Get the syllabus though.",
    "This was one of the classes I legitimately looked forward to attending. Discussion ranged from engaging to entertaining, which is a great spectrum to straddle, and the overall course felt organic. some people may not like such a liberal method of learning, but I personally enjoy the free-form nature of the course. I felt like I played a proactive role in my discussing of Black film as opposed to just memorizing facts and motifs.If you're a FILM STUDIES major, take it. If not, take it anyway. The films are also just fun to watch, in and out of their historical context."
