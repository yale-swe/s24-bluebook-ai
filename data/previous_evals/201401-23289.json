    "I would recommend this class especially if you are looking for a writing credit that covers interesting topics. My class wrote our research papers on big name companies like Coca-Cola, Apple, and Ford. Additionally, Professor Winders brought us cookies the last day of class which was super nice!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was very useful in improving writing style etc. However, for the student that wishes to take the course for the subject matter (consumerism), I would like to warn them that this course has one foot in the realm of consumerist theory and the other in English essay-writing.",
    "Works analyzed and class discussion got interesting, the discussion based mostly on what students brought up. A lot of the time people didn't have too much to say and we would move on without fully covering everything. This class is ok, but I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to.",
    "English 114 is a decent class if you're looking for a writing credit and also interested in improving your writing."
