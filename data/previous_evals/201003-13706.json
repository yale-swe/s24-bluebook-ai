    "Take it, don't take it. There's another section in Spring, it might be the same, might be better. If you want to get a good introduction to video artists, take the class--or go online and do some research. If you want to learn the tools, take the class--or go to the DMCA and learn. It's nice to have other students to crit your work, though, and it's nice to see what other students are doing, and it's nice to be able to check out some good equipment.",
    "Intro Digital Video consists of three video projects. It's very self-guided and you can really put in as little or as much work as you want. You'll get more out of it if you put in more effort. I would definitely recommend it - it's a low stress environment, not much work, and always fun.",
    "Video with Traci is great. Three projects and you learn the basics of editing sound and video, lighting, image manipulation, appropriating video and audio, etc. It will get you on your way to doing whatever you want in video. In class you watch really awesome videos from all kinds of genres and this is the type of class where you're very free to take this learning as use it in any way you want. Really, great.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who didn't want complete guidance. While Traci would help us with ideas, the expectation on how to use finalcut was part of the course.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a great grasp on video and its possibilities, I would tell them that they are going to have many chances to expand ideas and also get that initial step into final cut pro.",
    "If you are interested in either learning the basics of final cut pro (or learning enough so that you can learn more on your own) or already know how to use the program and want to experiment - do it. Basically, you can be any level and it works, as long as you want to make videos. The pace and workload, like any class, really depends on the teacher, so find out what you can about them to get a sense of how much work you will be doing. Keep in mind, however, Murphy's laws, because things will always get messed up at some point when dealing with computers.",
    "Fun class -- if you're not an art major, take it Credit\/D and you'll have a nice, entertaining class that you can be creative in and not have to work a lot for."
