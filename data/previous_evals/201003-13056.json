   "comments": [
    "This was your usual seminar. The topic was pretty interesting and Professor Espinosa does a great job and facilitating discussion and helping out with paper topics.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter, definitely take it!",
    "Super interesting course, readings were very managable.",
    "interesting class on the history of colonialism and public health. Very interesting if you are considering a career in public health.",
    "basic junior seminar, a lot of reading, class could get long and boring but there was some interesting material, the strength of the class really depends on the participants because each week a different student presents and leads discussion",
    "definitely- especially if you are an hshm major, this is a great junior seminar.",
    "Good class, but a lot of reading. Espinosa is a good seminar leader.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale, and Professor Espinosa is awesome and incredibly helpful. (I think its telling that when there was overwhelming interest in her class at the beginning of the semester she opened up a new seminar slot and basically taught two sections for the same seminar). The course content is very important for anyone interested in medicine or healthcare; the history of medicine and public health in colonial settings provides a useful framework for looking at how medicine can be a tool of empire. As far as its requirements, the course is pretty standard for a history seminar: 2 short papers (book reviews) and one final paper. You should definitely take this class!!",
    "This is a great class that introduces a lot of historical case studies concerning public health and its role in a colonial context. Professor Espinosa asks great questions that provoke interesting conversations.",
    "I would recommend this class highly. It was very interesting (if you like to study colonial medicine). The discussions were very engaging, but you should do at least half of the reading in order to gain anything from the class."
