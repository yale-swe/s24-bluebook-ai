    "I learned how to evaluate surveillance technologies and tools within the context of our modern day society, and how it intersects with issues of race, fashion, sexuality, and gender. This was a great course.",
    "Introduction to the field of surveillance studies and the intersection of surveillance with race, gender, socioeconomic standing, and activism.",
    "Learned about surveillance culture around the world, but also how it adversely affects certain communities.",
    "This course taught me everything about surveillance. From military surveillance to everyday surveillance, this class covered it all!",
    "Gained a foundational understanding of the ways surveillance works in society.",
    "I learned a lot about the surveillance culture we lived in and the different ways we are being watched everyday. Sounds spooky, yeah that's how I felt.",
    "This course really gave me perspective on how surveillance influences our day to day lives.",
    "I learned valuable information relating to why and how surveillance exists in everyday society, including biometric surveillance, facial recognition, CCTV, mugshots, technological surveillance, and more. The class covered various topics, from radicalized surveillance during the slave trade to modern-day resistance clothing, all which were extremely interesting.",
    "I gained an overall understanding of the field of surveillance studies and an interesting narrative of its evolution through an African American studies lens from the Atlantic slave trade through the present day. I read current research in the field of surveillance studies, learned to evaluate primary source material from the Beinecke library, and applied concepts from theorists like Foucault and Deleuze."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include both the lecture and the discussion component. When a seminar is run entirely by students, I find that the learning is quite ineffective. Professor Browne balanced this dynamic well. Topics were never redundant, and each covered an interesting facet of surveillance.",
    "This was an excellent course, though it seemed a little circular at times, with multiple class sessions seeming to cover similar topics or the discussion ultimately going back to the same topics.",
    "I dont think this course had any weaknesses. I loved going to class and discussing with my peers about surveillance its presence in everyday life. It was well organized and very engaging.",
    "Strengths: Professor Browne, lectures, readings, assignments",
    "I loved the emphasis on discussion in this class and small projects like watching a space to notice the surrounding.",
    "This course includes a wide range of topics that are very interesting and the readings were amazing.",
    "Strengths of the course are the varied topics and varied learning formats, including presentations, videos, interactive exercises, trips to the Beinecke, etc. I cannot think of any weaknesses, aside from the early time slot!",
    "The course is well organized, packed with interesting sources and topics, and engaging to students. I particularly enjoyed Simone's lectures because she had so many fascinating references to show, though they didn't happen every class. The assignments were very clear, but sometimes they felt stressful or limiting because of the specificity of the requirements for them-- I would have appreciated more freedom in what and how to write."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Engaging material, great professor, and cool niche topic you would not learn about anywhere else.",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course! It was outside of my interests\/concentration and was a class I just stumbled upon, but I loved it from the very first class. It was a very small seminar, which made everything more engaging and interesting. Professor Browne brings a rich and impressive background in the field and I found that to really make the course special.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Browne is just a fantastic individual who really wanted us engaged in the material. I don't think she will be around next year to teach this course as she is from UT Austin, but if you get the chance to take a course with her I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Yes! Simone is a visiting professor so take this course while you can. The discussions are incredibly interesting and workload is not bad whatsoever. 5 reading response (2 pages each), in class presentation, film review, and a final paper. Take it!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. It is an interesting and exciting way to learn about the basics of surveillance.",
    "Yes, great class that is really interesting in a field we usually do not hear anything about.",
    "Yes, definitely. Simone is an awesome professorgenuinely enthusiastic and interested in the subject and all of its nooks and crannies. The diversity of topics was also fantastic. Sociology and history are great complements, as are sociology of science and history of science, and Simone took advantage of that well. We analyzed and discussed everything from memes to the slave trade to drones. The course opened my eyes to very different ways of thinking about surveillance as a concept and as a window into race, gender, history, and much more. The assignments (3 papers, two short, one medium) for this class were also all interesting and worthwhile. There were also bi-weekly reading responses, which weren't too difficult\/intensive and they were helpful for digesting material. The seminar-lecture style was interestingperhaps the only part of the course I think could use some improvement to figure out a good balance, but I liked it better than a typical straight-up seminar. I definitely recommend this course and likely any other course Simone offers.",
    "Yes, however, I would stress that the subject material focuses on slavery and the oppression of black people and if that person cannot handle such sensitive material appropriately they should really consider not taking the class.",
    "Absolutely! Surveillance studies is a very relevant field, and everyone should learn more about it, especially from Simone.",
    "I would recommend this course to pretty much anyone-- it's interesting, applicable to daily life as well as to a number of academic fields, it's well taught, and it's a very manageable amount of work."
