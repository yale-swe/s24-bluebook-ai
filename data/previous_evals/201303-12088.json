    "It teaches you how to be a better person.",
    "I highly recommend Psychology 110, particularly in your first semester. It is interesting.",
    "Yes! Psych is probably the most relevant class I have ever taken. It's around us everyday.",
    "Take this class! It is easy and fun. All the kids who take it Cr\/D\/F aim for a C-, so they inflate the curve and it's easy to get at least an A- provided you aren't an idiot.",
    "Psych 110 is a great intro course if you are interested in the subject. Great lecturer, fairly straightforward material, very manageable tests& papers. I would definitely recommend it to another student at all interested in the field of psychology.",
    "A wonderful overview of psychology as a science. Master Chun is an excellent lecturer, and the guest lectures are equally thrilling. This is not a gut class, but you really do learn a lot. While there is a lot of material to cover, both the lectures and the textbook are actually engaging and interesting. Taking it credit D is a viable option if you want to spend less time engaged with the material, but I highly encourage you to take this class. One tip for those that do: Do readings as assigned, as cramming 200 pages in the day before the exam helpsnobody.",
    "A very fun and informative survey of the different areas of psychology. I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to other students. Take this class with Marvin Chun before you graduate. You will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting Credit D\/fail course but very time consuming and hard as a letter grade",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but honestly only if you plane on taking Psychology as a major.",
    "Psych 110 is a great introductory course that I would recommend taking with Professor Chun. He makes the already-interesting-material that much more engaging.",
    "Take it.",
    "My opinion of the course is great. I should speak to two audiences:If you are in any way interested in pursuing a medical career or interested in the brain or biology or sociology or any science similar, this class is amazing. It's very interesting and the material is covered in a fun and clear way. This was me and I absolutely loved it. There's a lot of reading but you'll find the textbook authors have a quaint sense of humor in their writing that keeps you from falling asleep. The tests were very fair, and the papers were not too difficult with any background in scientific writing (the papers weren't actually research papers, just reflective papers, but background helps). Absolutely take this course, if for no other reasonthan to have a fun class in a day of otherwise tougher and more stressful classes.If you are just taking this course for the sake of the distribution requirement or if you were told it's an easy class by a friend, note that I think you will find it extremely interesting but the workload is still substantial. There is a significant (often ~30 pages between classes) amount of reading assigned for each lecture. The readings support the lectures well and while I think it's possible to take the class and do okay without doing the readings, it will still make it much tougher. I say this because I doubt you will do the readings if the subject isn't already that interesting to you. Be aware of that. Also the tests are extremely factual-based (and understanding in the nature that you understand what some theories are\/studies showed). In other words, I would still recommend this course, but don't blow it off or you might quickly lose ground in this class and be scrambling to catch up for the rest of the semester, which would turn your otherwise enjoyable class into a stinky one.",
    "Great class. One of the must take's at Yale. The tests are not hard at all if you know how to study for them. The lectures are phenomenal and interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psychology 110 to a fellow student. The workload is not unmanageable in any way, however it is challenging enough to be make its students learn the material. The concepts in the class are full of real world applications, and I find myself constantly referencing lectures or readings from this class in all sorts of conversations. Finally, Marvin Chun is a great lecturer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! But it is not an easy A or anything, actually a lot of people get a bad grade so I would suggest taking it Credit D\/Fail.",
    "Psych 110 is a really great class. If you are at all interested in the study of psychology, definitely take it. Every class is interesting and engaging, Professor Chun is a great teacher, and the workload isn't bad. There is a reason it's one of the most popular courses at Yale. Professor Chun definitely lived up to the hype.",
    "Intro to Psychology is a fun, interesting course, definitely worth taking for anybody planning to study anything. I would definitely recommend this class, however, it is crucial to keep up with the readings (which are long, but equally interesting)",
    "Psych 110 is not a gut. I recommend taking this class when Chun teaches it. He makes the class so much better. There are 3 small papers, 3 exams, and a participation grade. The tests can be difficult if you don't study enough as you should. I recommend this class, especially to people taking it with friends.",
    "TAKE IT CR\/D. THere is a reason so many people do, and you will not regret it. If you want the A-F grade, still start with it Cr\/D and then switch - Chun gives you a \"where your headed\" with grades before the conversion deadline so it makes no sense to not start it Cr\/D. Everyone I know who took it for a grade regretted it. Its a fantastic class that is far too stressful if you take it for a grade so CR\/D it and just enjoy the lectures - you will still get just as much out of it, but not have to memorize so many of the small details",
    "This class was cool, but also overhyped. I felt like I had already seen a lot of the material just from reading the newspaper and some psych-related books, and a lot of the time it felt like we were just describing things that we all intuitively already knew. Still, Professor Chun was an engaging and organized lecturer. I would recommend this class to other students (especially freshmen) who might be interested in psych; it was a great class to take my first semester.",
    "Take this class!! You will feel absolutely enlightened by the end. Coming in without any psychology exposure, this class made me wish I'd given psych a chance when I was a freshman.",
    "It is a kind of fun class with some interesting topics discussed, but if you are looking to be challenged in your classes do not take this class I don't feel like it pushed me and so I didn't take that much out the class.",
    "Psych 110 is a great introduction to psychology and should be taken even if it's not towards your major just because its great to understand human behavior and thinking. I would absolutely recommend this class",
    "great class. not a gut class. but very straightfoward, 4 unit tests, lab req, 3 short papers, and no finals.I definitely recommend",
    "Great intro course. I would recommend this class to anyone! Psychology is relevant and fun!!",
    "IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! And yes you should take it why are you even asking that question?",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.There was a lot of textbook reading, but most of it was intuitive knowledge.The class material was enjoyable and applicable.",
    "Psych 110 is an interesting class that provides scientific backing to many concepts you may already know intuitively.",
    "A fascinating class that is an absolute must for every Yalie, prospective psych major or not.",
    "Great class with a lot of eye opening discussions and topics in lecture!",
    "It's a must take.",
    "It is a great class that everyone should try to take before they graduate. It goes over some of the basic aspects of psychology and tries to give a general overview of everything. I was generally never bored and the lectures were always very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class because Professor Chun is a dynamic lecturer, the material is interesting, and the workload is bearable if you keep up with the readings and take good notes in class.",
    "so useful to take, such interesting material that we went overit was a very fun class, although the reading load was a bit heavy at the beginning, however, it drastically lightened up near the end of the semesterplease take it - I was hesitant about taking it and was shopping several other classes but I'm so glad I ended up taking intro psychit's probably the best or one of the best classes you'll take at Yale - and hands down take it with Marvin Chun",
    "I took the class even though I could've skipped it with AP Psych. Lectures were all interesting and the workload is very manageable. Tests and papers are easy if you put in the minimum effort.",
    "Yes I would! Take this course because it will teach you so much about everyday life!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class! It was extremely interesting and engaging.",
    "Take this class, don't think twice. You will look forward to class every day, and you will learn a lot about yourself and others in the process. This class should be mandatory for every student who passes through Yale.",
    "Marvin Chun is excellent. He received an applause after pretty much every lecture, which really says something about the way he presents. Not only is this class fun and engaging, it is also really interesting. It's basically just a broad view of everything psychology related. This class has some other perks such as guest lectures from Peter Salovey, Paul Bloom, and Laurie Santos. Also, one of the course requirements is participation in real psychology studies at Yale.",
    "This class is awesome. The topics are super interesting and Chun is the best lecturer I've ever heard. Take it!",
    "I would recommend it but not without strong warning that it is very heavy on memorization.",
    "Chun is fun! Do it.",
    "Duh, take this course.",
    "100% absolutely recommend to any Yale College student even if you don't want to major in it. It's extremely applicable to the real world, very fun, MARVIN CHUN IS A BOSS, and you'll just have a lot of fun. A must take class. TAKE IT CREDIT\/D\/FAIL FIRST AND THEN SWITCH TO LETTER GRADE IF YOU WANT TO. A lot of people made that mistake and just took it letter grade. It's a great class but the tests get kind of hard, especially the first one. So do yourself a favor, and start taking it Cr\/D\/Fail for safety and then switch it to letter grade if you think you'll get a good grade.",
    "There is a big hype about this course and I can attest that it is a fun and entertaining class indeed. Marvin Chun is amazing and what you learn is relevant to everyday life. Take it.",
    "Three SUPER short papers and three multiple choice exams. The exams are pretty fair but there's a TON of material and sometimes it's difficult to tell what you have to memorize. Read the book on time if you can, I feel like that would've made the week before tests much easier.",
    "Psych 110 is an extremely engaging class and probably the best intro course I have taken here thus far. This is not an easy class, but anyone who has even a slight interest in psychology should take it -even if you start out credit\/d. If you go to lectures (and why wouldn't you?!) and do the reading you'll probably do well. Regardless psychology is one of those subjects that has something for everyone.",
    "TAKE PSYCH 110. IT has changed my life, it has answered so many questions that I had wondered and never had the chance to figure out. I love it, I would be a psychology major if I didn't love English so much.Master Chun does an amazing job of making every single lecture interesting. Some of the book readings are pretty boring (sc. all the stuff about hormones, etc.) but there will always be interesting real-world applications. In addition, I've never seen a professor work as hard as Master Chun to be fair. Everything on grading policy and attending lectures and attending labs is so fair, to the precise percentage. Ihave no complaints! One suggestion though, is more clarity on the grading rubric for our papers. It is just listed as top 10%, 20%, etc., but I guess TFs arereally busy so that's why there aren't too many comments about why your grade is a certain way or what makes you in the 30th percentile but not the 20th, etc. It seemed a little like a crapshoot to me, because I got a really high grade for the paper I did not work hard on and a lower grade for the one I worked really hard on!",
    "I would definitely recommend it! I had never taken psychology in high school, so this was a really great class for me!",
    "YES. Take it. The material is more or less intuitive, but you will learn things that will surprise you. The Milgram experiment done in LC is one. did you know you can get more donations by using the \"foot-in-the-door\" technique or \"door-in-the-face\" technique? Or your likelyhood of having people let you cut them in line increases drastically if you just say the word \"because\"? Very interesting material that I think everything should learn. Great Cred\/D.",
    "I thought PSYC 110 was a fantastic class - if you have the chance to take it, especially with Professor Chun, don't miss out! The work is nowhere near unmanageable, the material is incredibly interesting and relevant, and Professor Chun is the greatest man who ever lived. Take this class!",
    "This is a good class to take if you are interested in Psychology. However, if you have studied Psychology in high school, you might find the material covered in Psych 110 repetitive. So try and take AP Psych and get a 5 if you want to place out!",
    "I would recommend Psychology 110 to anyone. Really interesting class where you learn things that are useful in many different fields. Of course since it's an introductory class, it might not go in much as depth as you would like, but in terms of covering the psychology in a broad manner, this class does a great job. Professor Chun is also great, talented lecturer but also down to earth. Reading is usually pretty interesting, though it can get long sometimes. Would recommend trying to keep up with it so you are not swamped right before the test. Tests are pretty easy if you do the reading and go to lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is looking for a great lecture experience. I took this class my first semester of freshman year, and it was a great way to get a feel for what a huge lecture at Yale is like (although there were no sections, which may differ from many other lectures). The course material is interesting, the workload is very reasonable, and Professor Chun is wonderful -- extremely humble, engaging, and genuinely caring about the welfare of his students.Psychology 110 as a class is a survey course, so you don't get really in-depth about any material, and sometimes it can feel like there is so much material that you don't really retain it afterwards, but that's the case for any intro course. I definitely feel like I learned a lot, and it was just a fun class overall!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student, regardless of his or her experience or interest in psychology because of this class's engaging nature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "A fantastic class that you should most definitely take with Marvin Chun. It's incredibly interesting, well-organized, and fun. I looked forward to lecture and actually felt sad when it ended.",
    "Take this. You won't regret it.",
    "Marvin is pretty funny sometimes, and a great lecturer. I've never had a teacher give individual grade projections (and this lecture was huge). Given that he's a master, I think he's got a great concept of what students want from the class. Which is great.Once you get a hold on what the tests are like, they are pretty easy - you just need to be prepared.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych to another student. Not only is the material interesting, but the workload is decent and you are able to get out exactly what you put in.",
    "Everyone who hasn't taken psychology before should take this class, especially if Marvin Chun is teaching. The material is relevant to everyday life, and sometimes Chun is teaching you straight-up life lessons. First semester freshman would be well served to hear the lectures about sleep, rationality, and social psych as a lesson for how to navigate college life and to stay sane while doing it. A lot of the the things you learn are extremely intuitive, but you learn the actual terms to articulate what you probably already knew. The work is very manageable if you pace yourself. About 3 hours of textbook reading a week, a few short research papers (~5 hours each) and three tests. Take this class!",
    "Take it. The information is vast, but the tests are fair (i.e. if you studied veraciously you could easily get an A since it is all memorization from the lectures and reading). However, just sitting and enjoying the class lectures and doing the readings, without too much studying can also lead to a decent grade in the course. You'll come out of it with a wonderful additional perspective to use in your coursework and life in general.",
    "If you've taken AP Psych then you really don't need to take Psych 110. That being said, Professor Chun is a wonderful lecturer. This is a great class to take credit\/d\/fail because it does require a decent amount of work. Most of the exam material is from the lectures and if you take it credit\/d then you definitely don't even need the textbook.",
    "Marvin Chun is definitely the coolest professor, if not the coolest person I know. His lectures were awesome, the guest lectures were fascinating, and the material didn't feel obscure at all...it was actually really practical and useful. Exams were tricky (meaning it didn't really matter how much I studied, there were always weird questions that I missed). Grading on papers was definitely tough. Good notes in lecture plus completing all the readings are sufficient for success. Try to get the research requirement done earlier in the semester.",
    "Great course. Workload is evenly spread out through the semester, and there's no final exam, so it's very manageable. I really enjoyed getting an intro to all of the topics in Psychology, because if a particular lecture isn't super interesting to you, the next one will be about something different! The papers (3 short research papers) were interesting to write, as well, and you could choose your own topic.",
    "Take it.",
    "One of the must take courses at yale. Don't miss out on it.",
    "This is a great class that gives an incredibly interesting introduction to psychology. You should definitely take this before leaving Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student. I think it's a class that everyone at Yale, no matter the major, can relate to and benefit from.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone mildly interested in the subject it is VERY interesting and you'll learn a lot.",
    "This was a fantastic class and one of the best and most interesting at Yale. Marvin Chun was great and the way the lectures were laid out made every class a special occasion. A must take here at Yale. You'll be surprised at how the topics in class are so relatable to our everyday lives.",
    "TAKE IT if you'd like to learn incredibly interesting things from an incredible professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 110! Chun is a great lecturer he's super engaging and the experiments he discusses are fascinating. Going into the course, I thought maybe it was overhyped, but I did genuinely enjoy the class and am possibly even considering being a Psych major now.",
    "PSYCH 110 is a must take class at Yale. I would take it again if I could! (It's that good). Professor Chun is amazing, the material is super engaging and interesting and the workload is manageable. Tests are hard but if you do the reading you will be fun and Professor Chun is very fair with grading. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Overall a fun, enjoyable course, not just for those interested in psychology, but also for those who are just looking for an interesting class to fill out their schedule, those who like people or even just those who are curious about why people do ridiculous and embarrassing things to get into frats.",
    "A solid course, Chun was amazing, but it's huge and you probably won't know your professor by the end of the course. But take it, even if it's Credit D.",
    "Take it with Marvin Chun, he was the best!!",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "Take it, it's a really interesting course. However, it is not really an easy A if that's what you're looking for.",
    "you should start it with credit d\/fail",
    "Well taught, Chun is a great professor. Psych is a very interesting subject and you learn alot about humans and why we do what we do. Highly recommend because it really is one of those Yale classes everyone should take. Also, not a gut.",
    "Would look forward to Monday and Wednesday afternoons! Would 100% recommend it to all freshmen!",
    "So fun with Chun! Not too hard, exams are regurgitative, papers short. Really fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because the lectures are enjoyable, Chun is amazing, and the readings are manageable. The exams are mostly multiple choice and fair though they are thorough. The lectures and readings do not cover the same topics, however, so you must attend lecture and do all of the readings to do well on the exams.",
    "YESSS Take this class- its amazing. I took - and dropped Paul Bloom's class last year - love the structure of Master Chun's much more. its amazing",
    "A great intro lecture course. It's a lot of information, but all very relatable to daily life",
    "PSYC 110 is a must-take. Cr\/D it to start, but treat it like a regular course. It's hard to fail it, but if you are Cr\/D, you must make yourself work to convert because it's so fair that there is no reason to not perform well in the course.",
    "The class itself covers a very wide breadth. It's a great class for non-majors who are interested in psychology.",
    "Definitely take this class. You just have to! Several everyday concepts are covered and it is just a fun class to have in your schedule. It's a nice break from typical boring\/stuffy lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend intro Psych to anyone. The lectures are always interesting and the workload is manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych 101. Take it with Professor Chun if possible-- he is so engaging and funny and kind. Lecture was never boring; you learn information in this class that is extremely interesting and applicable to the rest of your life. There are three exams that are very doable if you study and do the readings, and three small papers. We also had some great guest lecturers such as Peter Salovey and Laurie Santos. Probably my favorite class of the semester-- takeit!!!",
    "PSYC 110 is an AWESOME class! Professor Chun is fantastic! I can truly say that after taking this class, I have become a different person. Once you get adjusted to the class and the workload, you can create a balance. The exams cover everything in class and the textbook. The class is really well organized. Professor Chun's lectures are amazing! This class is really an experience that everyone MUST go through.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT even if you're not a psych major or you're remotely thinking about taking it or you think you would not like it. If you are taking it, be sure to do the readings and attend lectures since a lot of the info is not explicitly written in the slides.",
    "Wonderful class! If you have the slightest interest in Psychology, take this!",
    "Excellent course. So relevant. I wish I would have taken this class my first term at Yale.",
    "Great course. Take it if you have even the slightest interest in psychology.",
    "This class is much harder than I expected. It is a great great lecture course, and Marvin Chun is a superstar, but the exams and papers require a lot of studying and hard work. Therefore, definitely start this class Cr\/D\/F. It is exceptionally difficult to get an A, so it's worth using one of the Cr\/D\/F options on it. You can always change back! I would still recommend it because it's one of those classes that should be taken by every college student. I learned so much about the world, and how to approach other people through this class, that no matter what grade I get, it's still worth taking.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for any student, whether or not he\/she is an intended Psych major.",
    "Intro Psych with Marvin Chun is wonderful! It covers a wide range of topics that are relevant to everyday life and human behavior. The class provides valuable and interesting insights into subjects like risk-taking, attraction and compassion. Professor Chun is such a great guy and lecturer! The guest lecturers are great too, especially President Salovey! But please note that you do need to do all the readings assigned and go to class in order to get an A.",
    "If you're genuinely interested in psychology, read a book or take a different class. If you want to listen to incoherent pop culture references twice a week, take this class.",
    "This course is very interesting and the professor is good at keeping the class engaged. I would highly recommend this course because it is very enjoyable.",
    "One of the best classes to take at Yale. Not that challenging (you still have to work, but because psychology tends to be more on the \"obvious\" side it tends to stick in your brain easier), and the professors who teach this intro class tend to be some of the best lecturers on campus. You learn a broad range of psychology, and in the end you really benefit not only in adding to your knowledge of psychologybut also by becoming more knowledgeable about yourself, your actions, and what might be driving you to act a certain way. Fascinating material!",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC110 to any other student! I thought that this was a very fun course that introduces you to psychology in a way that does not seem overwhelming. You never have to memorize nitpick details - just get general ideas, which really lets you focus more on enjoying the lectures rather than feeling as if you need to actively process each thing and memorize it during class. There's not that much work to do, just 3 short papers and 3 non-cumulative exams, so it's a nice social science credit that teaches you things that are applicable to all aspects of life. Marvin Chun was so lovable and funny, so definitely take it with him! This class is usually over-hyped, but it was definitely enjoyable, and was a nice less-stressful class; probably one of the classes I really enjoyed attending.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible. Marvin Churn is one of the smartest, most caring, and fairest teachers you will have at Yale. He is also an amazing lecturer. It's not a gut, but the work is completely manageable and the content is so interesting that it never felt like a burden to do a Psych reading or paper. I would absolutely recommend this class to everybody. Each lecture is fascinating, and Professor Chun organizes topics so that they are particularly relevant and interesting to his students. I really cannot say enough good things about this class--take it!!",
    "First off: TAKE THIS CLASS! It is extremely low-stress, high-reward. Marvin Chun's teaching is unbelievable. Seriously. Go to his first lectureduring shopping period and you'll be hooked. The course material is so incredibly interesting to the point of mind-altering. The course load is very minimal, every lecture is incredible, and the exams are exactly what Professor Chun outlines that they will be. There are no curve balls or gimmicks in this class and, best of all, there's NO final! Only 3 exams, which are non-cumulative.",
    "THIS IS A GREAT CLASS. Take it as a freshman, or at any opportunity you get. Professor Chun is a fantastic lecturer, and he makes everything we learn about extremely interesting. You will not regret taking this class. DO IT.",
    "Great class, everyone should take it (start Cr\/D though)",
    "Simply a fantastic class. Interesting, fun, and has a great professor. Take it. Take it. Take it. The tests are really difficult, but if you study, you'll be fine. Not a gut course.",
    "I would recommend Psychology 101. It was a great intro course to learn about psychology.",
    "Intro Psych is not popular just because it is a fad, and certainly not because it is a gut of any sort. It is a phenomenal class. I loved it. I loved it because the topics presented are absolutely fascinating, and totally relevant to everyday life, because \"it's all in your head.\" These are major topics with discussion about, and though down the road the minute facts you had to memorize to get that edge on the exam may fade, the concepts you've discussed never will. If you have no experience with Psychology (I didn't), this class will open your eyes to a damn cool new world. Also, it's really not that hard. The exams will get the best of you if you save the readings and studying to the night before. Take it Credit\/D if you're lazy and want to miss out on this not-so-hard A or A-. But if you do your work when you're asked to, and study when you're supposed to, it won't take you that long, and you'll do just fine. This class is AWESOME.",
    "Introduction to Psychology with Professor Chun is a very fun class. There is a fair amount of reading, but nothing is hard: it really just paying attention, taking good notes in class, and some memorization to do well. I would retakes commend Psych 110 to anyone interested in taking more psychology courses or who wants a pleasant lecture in the middle of the day. After all, it is definitely a class about life. Taking the class will probably positively effect at least one aspect of your life, from your relationships to the amount of sleep you get. If you want a class that gives you slightly less background but makes you think harder and isn't as well crafted, go for Intro Cog Sci instead. Or do them both; there is some overlap, so they mostly reinforce each other.",
    "An absolute must-take course. Take it with Marvin Chun if you can because he is simply superb! Enjoy his hilariously entertaining and informative lectures filled with self-deprecating jokes. The class is extremely engaging, not difficult, and applicable to real life. I've recited countless Psych facts to my friends and in my essays in other classes. By the end of it, you will know how to manipulate a person, the reasons we fall in love, and basically the answer to life. Marvin Chun is the cutest! Love him!",
    "I would recommend it as a fun and interesting introductory course, but certainly not as an intensive course.",
    "Introduction to Psychology. Take it if you want to learn the basic principles of why we do what we do.",
    "very hard class",
    "It's the college version of your traditional AP psych. I would recommend it - really fun and well-taught.",
    "An introduction to basic topics of psychology. Would recommend as a must take before graduating from Yale.",
    "That it is a wonderful class to introduce someone to psychology. I would very highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the subject.",
    "I would highly recommend psychology 110 to another student! It is very interesting to think about life from the perspective of a psychologist, and the course is very engaging.",
    "Fantastic course. Every Yale student should take it. Prepare to learn a little bit about everything, from why we should get at least six hours of sleep before exams to how babies learn language. Keep up with the readings, though the exams mostly focus on lecture material. Use your laptop to take notes, and pay attention to every detail Professor Chun mentions!",
    "Amazing class - highly recommend. Not quite a gut, but if you go to lecture and read the readings in the week before the exams, you're good to go! Chun's lectures are WONDERFUL. Take the class!!!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a survey in every regard. This class gives a sampling of the aspects of psychology but does not give a clear, single narrative. It is a good taste to let you know if you are interested in psych and teaches you some pretty cool stuff!",
    "Most definitely! I felt like I learned a lot, both in the subject and in how to study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You don't have to want to be a psych major to take the class. There is definitely a lot of textbook reading but it is managaeable as long as you plan your time right.",
    "Psych 101 is a must take at Yale because Master Chun was amazing. The class itself did not cover most aspects of psychology, so it wasmostly just a fun class to enjoy while still getting a basic of psych, but I would highly recommend it for someone as long as they plan to study- the tests were not easy.",
    "A very fun and interesting course. You will learn about why we do what we do and life in general.",
    "Yes, take this class with chin, you will not regret it, definitely helped me restructure the way that I think and approach my life.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 to other students because it is a very interesting class.",
    "Great intro class, but put in the work. Didn't like how a lot of the class was memorization, but, the concepts driving the class are good.",
    "Great class, Professor Chun is fantastic. I don't especially like Psychology, but Prof. Chun made lectures fun and relevant. I felt like lectures were more \"life advice with Marvin Chun,\" but he definitely made me want to go to lecture.",
    "Intro Psych is a fantastic course, and if you can take it with Marvin Chun, I HIGHLY recommend doing so. I found myself thinking about this class all the time throughout this past semester, and I still talk about it practically every day now. The lectures are fun--Marvin Chun is NEVER boring, he's hilarious (but also the perfect amount of serious), and he'll open your mind to so many amazing new ideas and perspectives. Personally, I didn't find the class to be extremely difficult. If you do the readings (or even skim them honestly and review them a couple of times) and (even more importantly) take good lecture notes that you can look back on a few days prior to each test, you'll definitely be able to at least get a B+\/A-. If you read carefully and love the subject and are motivated to think about it, I think an A is quite doable as well. But much more importantly, this class really opens your mind to the wonderful world of psychology and it makes me want to take many more classes in this field. There is a lab requirement where you have to be a subject in a number of experiments as well, but I found most of these to be extremely interesting and fun! Seriously take this class, and take it with Chun. It's incredible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it is very fascinating. If you keep up with the work, it isn't too bad.",
    "Fantastic class. I took this as a Junior looking for a relaxed fifth credit and it was absolutely that. Really limited work-load but also extremely interesting. Win-win.",
    "Take the course if you're prepared to do a lot of readings. Lecture was always pretty fun.",
    "Master Chun is a great lecturer, and every class was fun and interesting to attend. The material is not only fascinating, but can be applied to your life. There are three tests, three papers, and you have to do the equivalent of 4 hours of psych studies. The tests were not that hard with studying, and the papers were short. There are also guest lectures by Paul Bloom, Laurie Santos, and President Salovey, who were all excellent. Take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "It's very interesting, and a nice overview of what psychology is. I would recommend it, especially with Professor Chun.",
    "Amazing class- Marvin Chun is an incredible lecturer, the readings were simple and easy to follow, the exams were relatively straightforward, and the essays weren't much of a burden. You don't notice the hundreds of other students in the room because Professor Chun is such a great speaker. Absolutely take this class- It was my favorite as a first-semester freshman, and made me want to learn more about psychology.",
    "I would recommend for a student who wants a basic overall view or understanding of psychology. Be prepared for quite a bit of reading - but the papers and tests are manageable.",
    "I absolutely loved this class and I'm so glad I took it. It's a difficult class, but very interesting.",
    "Take this class!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else! You'll learn material that is relevant to real life and the material is always interesting.",
    "It's a standard intro course.",
    "An incredible course; Professor Chun's lectures were dynamic and engaging and the material was interesting and comprehensive--I felt like I was getting a really good survey of topics in Psychology. The guest speakers were terrific, and more often than not I left a lecture with either my spirits lifted or a deep question brewing in my mind. Highly recommended!",
    "Recommended. Word hard. The material isn't lways intuitive.",
    "Psychology 110 is just one of those legendary courses you have to take sometime during college. It is applicable to everything.",
    "A must take class at some point during four years at Yale. Learn life long skills and very interesting information.",
    "A class about a wide variety of topics in psychology. They are mostly all intriguing and relevant to your everyday life (which is partly why they're so intriguing).",
    "Take it for a fun basic psych course. However it is NOT a gut class.",
    "Great, interesting class! Lectures are great, and as long as you keep up with readings and study for exams, it's not a difficult or extremely work-intensive class. Marvin Chun is an excellent lecturer.",
    "Great survey of psychology. Professor Chun is phenomenal and makes the class exponentially better. The reading is long and dense, but Chun's lectures make the work worth it. These are the types of lectures you DON'T want to skip. Take this class, even if you're not interested in Psychology. It's just fun.",
    "I would recommend the course because everyone should have some background in psychology, and Prof. Chun makes the experience enjoyable.",
    "Great class for anyone to take. Generally very interesting, whether or not you're interested in studying Psychology as a major.",
    "Absolutely! I think psychology is a science that everyone should have at least some introductory experience with, and Professor Chun will make the material both exciting and challenging. To that end, I would recommend anyone who isn't confident in their interest in psychology or would prefer to enjoy the course and not get bogged down in the memorization of quite a sizable bit of information to take the course Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course -- it is fascinating, well taught, and a truly wonderful experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a fun course and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, this course is good. It will be overrated in these evaluations. The material is interesting. The professors, especially Marvin Chun and Paul Bloom (from what I've heard) are excellent. In this course, you will learn the topics of a survey psychology course. It's good material to know and worth learning, but I wouldn't say you'd be missing out on a huge Yale staple class if you don't take this course. If you decide to take this course, TAKE IT CREDIT\/D\/FAIL. It's definitely not a gut, and if you don't do the readings\/aren't good at memorizing a lot of information and terms\/aren't good at multiple choice, you will not get a good grade in this class. That said, if you take it credit\/D, you can be a little more lax about the readings, but you definitely need to go to all the lectures still. Take this course though, you won't regret it (unless take it for a grade from the start).",
    "It's a fun class but not a gut. Take it because it's interesting and the material is relevant for a broad education, but don't expect to just skate by without studying.",
    "Absolutely take it. Whether you are a freshman or a senior, you will certainly gain from the experience. Watch out for the lecture on love if you're casually hooking up with someone whom you don't want to date (but their enthusiasm outmatches yours).",
    "Take this class! This class was amazing, the workload isn't that bad if you know how to \"college read\", and the exams were also not that hard if you study a good amount of time. The material covered is so fascinating, and professor Chun teaches in a very entertaining way. Take it!!!",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Overall, Psych 110 was fascinating. The course was very fair and very enjoyable. I can see the information I learned almost every day in normal life, and it is exciting! Everyone should take this class during their time at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It is an interesting course which doesn't really require any prior knowledge, and thus ideal for anyone looking for a first-semester class.",
    "Broad range of topics. Each lecture is generally individual from other lectures. Great class to learn a lot of cool things. If you want to pass the class credit\/d, you probably don't have to do the reading if you go to all the lectures.",
    "If you are looking for an overview of psychology this is definitely the course to take. It as enjoyable and not too much work (if you split up the readings), but the tests and papers are harder than you think. You definitely have to put time and effort into those.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course at some point during your time at Yale. The vast majority of the material covered can be immediately applied to your life, especially social psychology. It gives insight into the actuality of human nature and gives you a better understanding of human behavior. I always refer to it as a \"life class\".In addition, Professor Chun is one of the most dynamic lecturers on campus, making a lecture for five hundred people relevant and interesting. The workload is also very reasonable, and every question on the exams are very fair. If you can, do try to take this class; it definitely gives a new perspective on the world around you.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AWESOME!!! Marvin Chun really knows how to keep you invested and interested in the class. If you decide to take this class, TAKE IT CREDIT\/D\/FAIL!!!! Seriously. It is a much more enjoyable class if you don't have to stress about the grade.",
    "I would summarize this course as useful to all majors and one that he or she should definitely take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PSYC 110 - the material taught is very applicable and relevant to daily life. You will start to see the world in a different way and begin to understand other people's actions simply by understanding the fundamental foundations of psychological studies. I learned so much about everything from development to language to mental disorders to worldwide epidemics. My favorite lecture was the one devoted to happiness, understanding its foundations\/consequences, and applying simple tricks to obtain it. Professor Chun is an AMAZING guy and I would HIGHLY recommend taking the class with him. Just be sure to stay on top of the readings and to do thorough research for the papers - simply reading abstracts here and there won't suffice! I am glad I at least skimmed the chapter readings before the few days before the midterms because there is a LOT of information tested on each test (both textbook readings and class notes included). Really fun class, really great professor. Take it if you are willing to put in the effort and are interested in psych!",
    "Do it, it's interesting",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to a fellow student, especially if it is taugth by Marvin Chun. You will have a great time learning the basics of Psychology and get to take part in some interesting experiments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Marvin Chun is awesome, very fun and engaging. Take it with him for sure. The material is interesting and, I found, applicable to daily life. The readings aren't too hard, they are all out of the same textbook which can be pretty funny sometimes. Only 3 short essays and 3 exams (multiple choice and short answer) Do the readings and go to lecture and you will do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class Psych 110. I always looked forward to going to lecture, and we had some interesting guest lecturers. The textbook reading was average, but it was necessary to do well on the tests. It was a good intro class, and I enjoyed the class with Chun a lot. Chun is a great lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but the student should be ready for a bit challenging amount of reading in the course. Besides that: best course ever - I am a freshman ...",
    "Take this class if you can! Especially if Marvin Chun is teaching.",
    "Good course for a social science credit, but be prepared for some late lectures that seem pretty general. Still a good survey course and if you're a psychology major I can imagine this class is a dream come true. You should do the reading, though it can be dry.",
    "Super interesting and should definitely be taken here at Yale, but as credit D.",
    "I would truly only recommend it for someone taking it Credit\/D. I think the main objective of this class is to make the Yale population take psych \"more seriously\" as a hard science than they already do, and so the grading can be pretty unfair. Not to mention, there are people from all grades in this class, so coming in as a freshman taking this for your first time and competing with experienced test takers at Yale who receive perfect scores on the exams is a little disheartening. To make you feel better about your potentially shitty grades, professor Chun will show you slides of famous psychologists who received C's in intro psych at Yale... I know he was trying to be funny but... Candidly... It's reallllly not funny when you have people throwing your grades around like this. In sum, however, the most important tip I could give someone taking this class is to pay attention to the lecture in every single minute detail. Record them on word notebook if you must.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. All the material is really interesting and a lot of it is also applicable to every day life. he set can get a bit tricky because they ask some very specific questions based on parts of the lecture or readings that may not have seemed very important. Overall it's a fun and informative class.",
    "Every one should take psychology 110 while at yale",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone working towards any major.",
    "A well taught introduction to psychology. A way to learn about the way we think and behave. I would HIGHLY recommend this class. Every lecture was incredible.",
    "I would recommend Psychology, but you will have to work to receive a good grade. Studying is a must.Psychology 101's greatest strength is the lectures. They are always interesting and relevant. I found myself having no trouble learning and paying attention in class. Professor Chun and all the guest lecturers were engaging and excited about the material. It was clear that they not only knew what they were talking about, but also could distill it in easy ways.Psych's major weakness was the tests. The tests cover a huge amount of material, which in and of itself is not problematic. However, the individual questions on the tests were too specific, which made them hard to study for. Some questions it was like if you didn't read one sentence in the book, you didn't know the answer. The tests could have covered more relevant information and major experiments\/concepts from the course.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great introduction for anyone who wants to be a Psych major, isn't sure, or just wants to take the class for fun. It covers a wide range of current topics in Psychology, but is taught so that even someone without any prior Psychology education can easily follow the course. The lab requirements may seem like a lot, but they're definitely manageable and actually quite interesting if you take the time to learn what they're about. I would highly recommend Psych 110 to another student - it's fun, interesting, and the professors are great!",
    "Psychology 110 is must-take for every Yalie! The most fun class I have ever taken!",
    "This is a must take. One of Yale's best. Marvin Chun is great and the course is applicable to any career.",
    "A great survey of psychology, that will make you think differently about the way you think, important even if you are not pursuing psychology as a major\/minor. It is certainly not a gut course; there was a good deal of textbook reading as well as research papers, and the exams were not always easy or straightforward",
    "Really interesting class. The material is applicable to every day life, the work isn't too hard, and the professor is fantastic.",
    "A great class, very interesting, substantial course material, I learned a lotDEFINITELY YES. (For the reasons above)",
    "Intro Psych was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Lectures are filled with relevant real-life applications designed to help you understand the course material. With three non-cumulative tests and three short reading responses, it also wasn't too much work. This course fosters a genuine interest in psychology; for any of those potentially interested in learning about psych, definitely take this course.",
    "PSYC 110 is not a class that you can skim on. It is a class that requires diligent study, both to detail and the big picture to understand. However, it is class that will truly broaden your horizons regarding how people interact with each other. I believe that PSYC 110 is a class that every Yale student should take at some point in their academic careers.",
    "GREAT COURSE! Definitely not a gut class but one of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale. Great lectures and a consistent work load.",
    "Great class for an overview of psychology",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU ARE CRAZY IF YOU DON'T! This class seriously changed my perspective on a lot of things, not only regarding by day-to-day interactions, but also with my future vocational path. I took AP Psych in high school and I really didn't love it and wasn't that passionate about it, but I was persuaded by friends to take this class. I am forever grateful that I did because it will stay with me for the rest of my life.",
    "Marvin Chun is funny and wonderful... if you're at all interested in psych you should take it with him!!",
    "I grade intro course to human psychology that will probably intersect with a lot of your other classes.",
    "The charisma of Prof. Chun and the intrinsic value of psychology in everyday life combine to make this class one of the best at Yale. I highly recommend this course for any student, whether or not they have interest in psychology. This course is not a gut course, but the material is interesting enough that you would be willing to put in the effort.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course because it is very interesting to now observe how psychology really does apply to almost everything in life. It is not too hard, and not to easy, and the work load is not terrible. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I would also recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail if they aren't planning on being a psych major",
    "Take this class. Not an easy A at all but you learn so much.",
    "Amazing class. Very interesting. Going to class is actually worth your time. I would definitely recommend this class to a friend. While Professor Chun was amazing, I'm sure any of the professors of this class would be equally fantastic.",
    "Definitely take the class because of Prof. Chun. The lectures and guest lectures are the best part of the course. The textbook is a bit boring, but the papers and lab requirement can be quite interesting. It's a good course to take to get a SO credit.",
    "Psych is relevant to anything you do, psych is a science and is backed up by empirical observations and the scientific method (it's not a joke science), and psych is fun and super interesting. Take this class and it will expand your perspectives. Master Chun taught me the secret of happiness (you gotta sleep 8 hours a night!), how to increase my efficiency as a student and as a human being, how to manipulate the behavior of others, how to avoid irrationality when making decisions, and a ton of other things. Take this class. Make sure to read the textbook and it will make the class much easier. There are 3 midterms, no final, and 3 short papers (500-750 words). Try to write about an original topic while writing your papers and you'll do fine.",
    "An excellent class. The material is relevant and interesting. Professor Chun is an extremely gifted lecturer. I'd highly recommend this class.",
    "I would summarize it as a broad overview of psychology and would definitely recommend to other students.",
    "Yes! Definitely worth taking. Credit\/D is a good option if you're not planning on being a major.",
    "Take this class (especially with Professor Chun)--you won't regret it. It is a wonderful way to get an introduction to all things psychology, plus, Professor Chun is amazing and highly entertaining. Not a ton of work, but not a gut either, plus you'll actually enjoy the material!",
    "I would recommend Psychology 110 to all students regardless of their interest. I think this is one of the classes--a basic and general introduction to psychology that is interesting and exciting--that everyone should take before they graduate.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It's not a gut, but not too hard either.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student, regardless of major. It's a fun class that is thought provoking and eye opening.",
    "It's a very good course. Master Chun is truly amazing. He's very passionate, and his lectures are actually fun to listen to. That being said, don't go into the class thinking it's an easy A. It is actually a very hard A to get. There's a lot of reading to be done. The tests cover way too much material, so expect to pull all-nighters on the nights before the exams. It's still a fun class though. Take it credit\/D\/fail.",
    "It's a class that teaches a little bit about every field of psychology. It's fun and interesting and well taught. I would recommend it to any and every student who hasn't already studied psych. Even if you think you don't like psych, you should still take this class.",
    "Good basis for students merely interested in psychology or interested in pursuing it as a major",
    "Chun was incredibly amazing. One word to describe him: compassionate. He takes lectures and teaches them with grace and humor, and ends many lectures with his personal advice and words of wisdom. Consistently rated as one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS. Professor Chun is amazing and the information you learn is not only informative but it helps you improve your every day life. It is a large lecture so you actually have to make an effort to meet with Chun and your TA.",
    "Even if psychology has nothing to do with your intended\/decided major, this class is for you. Take it. The concepts you learn throughout the course apply to literally everything anyone ever does. It gets better, though\u00e2\u0080\u0094Marvin Chun will make your day. Everyday.",
    "This course is a great introduction to psychology, especially if you don't intend to be a psych major. You will learn all sorts of neat facts about the human mind, and several ideas that can help inform your understanding of other people. You should absolutely take this course if you are in Berkeley. Master Chun is great, and you will appreciate the opportunity to get to see him in a class setting. If you are in another college, this is your chance to see what you are missing out on!All in all, this is really a great class!",
    "I would recommend it but would encourage the student to stay on top of the readings in order to minimise how much studying needs to be done for each exam.",
    "Prior to taking the course, I was told that Psyc 110 is a must-take at Yale, and I have to say I couldn't agree more. I learned so much from the course, both about psychology and about myself in relation to the topic. I think that everyone would benefit from taking this class even if they don't find it to be the most interesting because it relates to us on a very personal level, giving students introductory insight to the reasons why we do what we do.",
    "Take PSYC 110! It is a quintessential Yale class.",
    "I would recommend it but with caution: it has a lot of reading and the tests are very difficult. however, it is extremely interesting and i feel that everyone at one point in their yale career should take intro to psych.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Chun is an amazing and dynamic teacher! The subject matter is very interesting, and although the readings are long, they are very understandable. Make sure you go to class as most exam questions come from class lectures. Don't be discouraged if yourfirst exam grade is bad--mine was but I ended up improving a lot throughout the course. The one thing I will say about this class is that it is huge, so prepare for that. People around you will most likely be whispering and checking Facebook, so if you are somebody who gets distracted easily then sit in the front.",
    "It's rare to find a 1:00 class where you don't fall into a post-lunch coma, but if anything, PSYC 110 is it. To have a class that you look forward to, a class where you sit there for an hour and 15 minutes and realize you don't want it to end just yet...that is the mark of a truly excellent lecture, one of those courses that should be on everyone's Yale bucket list. Professor Chun is a superstar. Not just in his field (which he is) or on campus (which he also is) - but as a kind, genuine, and animated human being who has true passion for psychology and for teaching. Both the material and the professor are interesting and engaging, and the subject is taught in a way that's easy to understand and helps you organize the broad psychological concepts in your mind. This a wonderful broad overview into all the sub-fields and disciplines within psychology, and the course provides ways for you to delve into areas of interest through the three mini-papers and the textbook (which was quite engaging, a definite plus). I wholeheartedly recommend this course to people of all years and all majors, because through psychology, we learn more about ourselves - how we think, act, reason, intuit, decide, perceive, and connect - and this course is the perfect launch pad for us to explore those questions.",
    "yes i would",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Marvin Chun will change your life. The material is so relevant and interesting. If you care at all about why people act in the way they do, you will love this class. And Professor Chun is the greatest person in the world.",
    "Deff take this class!!!",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "This is a great introduction that is incredibly relevant for any field. I would recommend it wholeheartedly. It definitely isn't a gut class, so credit d it if you don't want to put in effort to do well.",
    "Psychology 110 was very engaging and entertaining. I would definitely recommend Psych 110 to another student but warn that its not a gut class and that studying is a must.",
    "It is indeed a class I would recommend, but I would definitely say to start it credit d, the tests require more studying than you would think. Don't underestimate them.",
    "The class lived up to the hype for me. I think this is the first time in my college career that I've attended every lecture. The stuff you learn gives you a firmer grasp and understanding of the things you observe in everyday life, though some concepts were oversimplified in terms of social factors such as race. The essays were annoying but they're easy to BS. The tests weren't difficult at all as long as you took decent notes and looked at the old exams provided. You do need to know information in the textbook, but that can be accomplished by reading the chapter summaries and learning the vocab rather than actually reading all the text.",
    "TAKE INTRO PSYCH. From Professor Chun if you can.",
    "Not a have-to take course, but something that one should definitely look into if one is at all interested.",
    "Psych 110 was absolutely great. I looked forward to class every Monday and Wednesday, and the lectures were always engaging, fun, and relevant to everyday life. Readings were sometimes hefty, but usually interesting. Professor Chun was an amazing professor who really seemed to care about his students, even in a 400-person lecture. He was fair in grading our assessments, and often volunteered to meet students for lunch or office hours to discuss any problems or questions. The class involved writing 3 short papers that were very open-ended, taking 3 exams, and doing readings. Overall, it was not very much for the amount of knowledge you get out of the course. I would most definitely recommend this course (especially with Professor Chun) as one of my favorites of the year.",
    "Not as easy as you think, especially if you are using it for a social science creditIf you are a science or engineering major, take something like ECON",
    "Intro Psych (especially taught by Professor Chun) is a great class, although it does cover a wide breadth of information, so exams, although not cumulative, are tough. Probably should've taken it Credit\/D, I did all the readings and still struggled. But lectures were awesome and engaging and I thoroughly enjoyed going to class every day.",
    "Take Intro Psych with Professor Chun. He's an incredible teacher you shouldn't miss out on.",
    "Yes! Very interesting class with a great professor.",
    "Yes!",
    "Psychology 110 is an outstanding introduction to the study of human thought and behavior that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend to every Yale undergraduate who hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken psychology before. The textbook readings can be dry at times, but Master Chun more than makes up for it and brings the material to life with entertaining lectures on diverse topics relevant to everyday life. The workload is similar to other Yale classes, and you must complete all the readings if you want to succeed on exams. However, if you put in the effort and pay attention during lecture, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do well and will have great time too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that has any interest in majoring in psychology and has good memorization skills.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to gain a broadunderstanding of some of the fundamental ideas in psychology that can be applied to the real world. I found it to be a very interesting introductory class.",
    "I would recommend this course as it is fun and interesting, just be prepared for the workload!",
    "Great class to credit\/d. Great lectures. Marvin chun is the man.",
    "Yes. It is really helpful",
    "Fun course if you've never done any sort of psychology or social science course. It's a nice survey of a few topics in psychology. It's a bit gimmicky the first few lectures (I think Chun tries to draw the freshmen in) but after that you get down to some interesting studies\/concepts. It's entertaining and a good fifth class. Also, it's not quite a gut -- you need to do the work, but if you put the time there's no question that your efforts will pay off.We had great guest lecturers, and the tests and assignments were straightforward. There's a small amount of reading each lecture, but it's all very manageable. I learned a lot, and feel prepared to disseminate my intro psych knowledge at all future cocktail parties that I may go to.Marvin Chun is also a good-humored, intelligent and well-spoken lecturer.",
    "Yes, because it covers a lot of material, and something in it will be relevant to everyone. Bear in mind, though, that it is a very large lecture, and that means little individual attention and a lot of the final grade based on tests.",
    "Definitely. Even though it's primarily lectures, they're always entertaining and informative.",
    "It's a fun and not-very-stressful class. I took it for the social science credit, but I do think it's had an impact on the way I think. Prof. Chun gives great lectures - you should never skip them, because some material covered only in lecture pops up on the exams, but you won't want to anyways. The textbook is pretty good, and the exams are of middling difficulty. The three short papers can be a bit frustrating, but they are useful exercises. I'd encourage people with even a scrap of interest in psychology to take it, as some basic literacy in the subject can really help you understand a variety of topics. Definitely worth it."
