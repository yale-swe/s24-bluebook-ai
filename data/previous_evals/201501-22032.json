    "I would recommend this class, but be aware of who else is in your class.",
    "Professor Homans is wonderful: encouraging, incredibly knowledgeable, and a great seminar leader. The books on the syllabus were well-picked and always interesting to read. My one criticism of the course was that in the first few weeks the discussion was a little formulaic or easily derailed, but this got better over the course of the semester and by the end the discussions were engaging and stimulating.",
    "Very interesting class with a fantastic syllabus.",
    "Take this class! An excellent syllabus with some brand new works and others that you will re read in a new light. Prepare to do your work--Professor Homans has high expectations but in striving to meet them, you will learn so much!",
    "Yes! There's some substantial reading, but keep up as per usual and you'll be fine.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It's really interesting, and looking at feminist and queer movements through literature was great. The readings are fantastic.",
    "I would not call this course an introduction to WGSS texts and theory\/history; I would recommend students to take an intro before this course, but if you're a junior like I was, then by all means, take the course! It's a fast paced junior seminar exploring WGSS literary canon and theory\/history, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in exploring these topics further. Lots of reading, but the assignments are pretty light.",
    "This class is a version of a seminar that Homans teaches regularly, from what I can tell: a class that takes foundational ideas of gender and sexuality and considers the ways in which they've popped up in various works of literature throughout the past 200 years. Homans is a brilliant reader and thinker; the class is worth it merely for the experience of sitting down with her one-on-one and asking questions, talking through paper ideas, etc. She's very big on theory and critical analysis, so a good chunk of your reading will be devoted to critics and scholars who've already considered whatever text is at hand. Class discussion was difficult, though (although we did have a particularly quiet class). I think Homans can be a skilled discussion leader; the only issue I had with her approach was her tendency to very quickly jump in and rephrase whatever you'd just said. It was a generous tic --often led to smarter readings\/smarter discussions that we would've had otherwise-- but it also could merely lead to misreadings, on her part, of whatever you were trying to say. Those with slower speech and slower processes of thought often didn't get the necessary space to unfold\/figure out their ideas before she jumped in. All in all, though, this class has a great reading list, one of the most brilliant (& radical) professors at Yale, and is certainly worth it."
