    "An enjoyable, if somewhat idiosyncratic, survey of French science and thinkers of the past. Readings can be a bit obtuse, but are manageable. Professor Reilly made class fly by (even on Friday afternoons) and is very helpful. Workload includes two class presentations, a book review, and a final project.",
    "Dont take it unless you are somehow actually interested in the subject. There was not much work though.",
    "I thought this course was rather good. Reilly has cobbled together a syllabus that covers a lot of different interesting topics. He does not assign busywork; I enjoyed the work that I did for this class.",
    "This is a great class! You do have to tackle some complicated readings at times, but it is well worth it.",
    "Yes."
