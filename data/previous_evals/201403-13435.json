   "comments": [
    "This class was brilliant. It was very focused on making things and learning about your own design process. Professor Hovland made us work hard and asked the right questions. She always gave considered critiques and very clearly cared about the class. Sometimes in-class critiques got a bit long, but classes almost always had a guest lecturer, which was very fun.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class! Pamela was a wonderful professor, and she puts in a lot of effort to expose us to new work, ideas, and processes, through visits to Yale collections and the inclusion of guest lecturers and critics in our class. I would suggest taking it after intro graphic design, either before or during Type I and\/or II.",
    "This class is project-based and it's very challenging but rewarding. Take it if you like graphic design.",
    "If you're interested in graphic design, or other types of visual art, this class will make you more careful and considerate about your work. I definitely felt like a much better designer because of it. However, the four hour class can drag on, but at least occasionally there are guest speakers.",
    "I might recommend the class. I would recommend it to an undergrad, but probably not to another graduate student. I wish there were an into to graphic design offered to graduate students in related subjects. Most of the time, feedback and discussion with others in the class was not very fruitful or critical. I think the class would have been much more interesting if a background in some kind of design were required.",
    "This class was interesting in more ways than one. Pamela is great and knows a lot and brings in so much precedent to look at and discuss. The makeup of the class was a grad\/undergrad mix but the smallish size (~15 people) helped us to get to know each other better. The different backgrounds made for very diverse projects, and Pamela did a great job of setting restrictions while allowing creative license. Admittedly, this course was more work than I thought it would be, so I wouldn't recommend as a fifth class. Previous experience is essential (at the very least, a working knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign). That being said, I felt like I learned a lot about all three of these programs through course assignments. The class period itself is great. The speakers that Pamela brings in are AMAZING. They are experts in their field and great exposure to a vast array of career options within design. Usually, a guest speaker (or field trip) would take half of the four hour class. The other two hours are crit (which most of you will be used to).",
    "Yes I would definitely, and have already, recommended Intermediate Graphic Design to other students.",
    "A lot of work, but you will learn a lot. Very useful for architecture students."
