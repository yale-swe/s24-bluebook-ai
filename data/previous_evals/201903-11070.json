    "Multiple aspects on terrorism, understanding how current debate is occurring.",
    "I learned in greater detail how to put together a rigorous academic paper using a proper lit review and research methodology. I also learned in detail how\/why researchers do things in their fields. I also learned an abundant amount on the various topics related to terrorism.",
    "This course greatly expanded my ability to understand quantitative design in social inquiry. The course also provided a \"more than survey \/ more than banner-level\" understanding of contemporary deliberations within the field of terrorism studies and how terrorism studies relate to theories of international development and international relations.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the causes of terrorism, as well as an appreciation of the gaps in the field, and I learned about the field of terrorism study in particular and political science methodologies in general.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester - mostly because it really fit the bill for what I was looking for in grad school. It gave me directed readings to learn about specific aspects of the subject, the weekly response memo requirement to make me think about the topic more, and the independence to direct a longer term research topic into an area of relative interest. The course definitely improved by ability to digest and understand academic writing and the research process, in addition to expanding my horizons on how to think about the fields of terrorism and violence.",
    "Tackling an issue from several different perspectives and viewpoints; learning not to make assumptions and seeing that there is no single cause for global issues.",
    "Understanding of the relationships between causes of terrorism and how they relate to development problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I acquired strong research skill; Professor helped me narrow down a topic and design the research.",
    "Great class - readings, syllabus, discussion, final paper.",
    "I think this course could have utilized readings that were less statistical based, and more that evaluated policy options.",
    "Strengths: the class's demographics really helped us have fun and substantive discussions. Specifically, the small size of the class and the intrinsic motivations of 90% of the students meant that we all came having done our homework and prepared to discuss in a way that went below banner-level. Additionally, the professor's approach of having a student facilitate discussion each week was very effective in this class. The final research project was one of the most rewarding I've undertaken during my time at Yale. Weaknesses: I appreciated the response papers as a forcing function...but thought the requirement to have them submitted by 1600 the day prior to class often drove me to skim through some of the assigned readings to make the deadline, instead of engaging more with the material.",
    "The reading response requirements were helpful in ensuring everyone did the reading and could participate in the class discussions. The class discussions were well moderated. The biggest weakness was the fact that it was billed as a development and terrorism class, but was very much focused on terrorism, and only tangentially on development.",
    "The only improvement (because I really liked the layout and format of the course), would be maybe adding some context behind weekly assigned readings. For example, providing a quick one\/two sentence of why we are looking at each reading - it would provide some additional direction for critically thinking about the reading as the student reviews the topic. On the flip-side, that might actually negatively affect the course's ability to encourage the critical thinking I found valuable in answer #1, so who knows? In another class, the weekly readings are not individually described (so that would still allow for some individual critical thinking about the individual readings), but rather there is a weekly narrative\/direction that the instructor provides. Hopefully that makes sense."

   "comments": [
    "It is a great course to obtain broad understanding of terrorism.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student interested in the topics, or interested in the research methodology side of the house.",
    "I think the final paper could have been shorter and more geared towards graduate students and the policy work that they will likely engage in rather than longer, more extensive papers.",
    "Yes. Great way of combining quantitative skills acquired earlier in graduate studies in pursuit of relevant and timely issues in social science and national security.",
    "I would recommend this to a student interested in terrorism, but not development.",
    "Yes, and I have already recommended it to some folks interested in topics around conflict\/violence. The \"choose-your-own-adventure\" model of the research project is awesome, and the range of topics around terror\/development are extensive.",
    "Yes, although the subject matter is very specialized! Would only recommend to those with relevant interests.",
    "Yes"
