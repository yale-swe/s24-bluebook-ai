    "Be prepared to work; there's a lot of it. If you just need it for the language requirement, look somewhere else.I really enjoy language and German in general. I found the only enjoyable parts of this class to be the literature discussions. Though I hate to admit it, my grammar has improved due to large amounts of memorization and busy work required for this class.",
    "German 130 01 is very demanding and requires a daily commitment in terms of attending class and doing homework.I would recommend the class to any student who is serious about improving his\/her German speaking ability.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It goes quickly, so you have to be prepared to study a lot of grammar in a short amount of time. But, you also learn a lot, and it really helps to improve your speaking.",
    "It is very focused on grammer, but thats important at this level. This makes the class worth taking and helpful for future classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend German 130. Great instructors and learning a language is well worth the time."
