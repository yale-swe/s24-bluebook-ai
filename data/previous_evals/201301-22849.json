    "Great! Well taught, wonderful materials, cool opportunity.",
    "In-depth, in-person analyses of various works of art and literature having to do with Black womanhood. Really engage with the texts, not just working from critical thought. Very reasonable workload, really rewarding work.",
    "an intense course that looks at visual and literary analysis to examine the cultural politics behind.representations of race and gender. worth your while.",
    "This class is pretty unstructured, and involves talking about your feelings and opinions about works of art in the YUAG. It was awesome to be in the Gallery space, and the artists visits were great, but most of the class just felt disconnected and pointless. I don't feel like I have any better sense of how to talk about art."
