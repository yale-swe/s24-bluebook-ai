    "The course effectively taught grammar and speaking skills without being too demanding. Additionally, the TA Friday speaking sessions were very helpful.",
    "This course could use language tables to practice speaking and make more use of videos for students to hear the language.",
    "It was very fast and hard for me to follow but still very interesting and fun",
    "Professor Elbousty is extremely friendly and willing to help with any issue. It helped that he spoke a lot in Arabic and then clarified some in English to get our ears adjusted to spoken Arabic. Only focusing on MSA rather than on MSA and a dialect prevented confusion and laid a good foundation without becoming overwhelming."
