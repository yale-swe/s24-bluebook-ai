    "I learned about different theoretical frameworks for storytelling and ethnography, as well as specific examples of those types of projects.",
    "I learned a lot about how stories can be used in social movements and how we can think practically about realizing social change.",
    "The best ever introduction I could ask for to the incredible field of public humanities. The selection of readings was diverse and very engaging. The open format of the course allowed me to creatively think about ideas for all assignments. Class discussion was incredibly stimulating--especially with guest speakers brought in on Skype and in person. We attended talks and workshops, which lent an essential hands-on approach. Through the final project,I had the chance to intently study and analyze the material from the course and further work on my academic prose.",
    "This class was a great introduction into the ways in which public humanities projects can be used to forward social justice aims.",
    "Learned so much! Exposed to amazing thought leaders in the field of collaborative public humanaties and methodologies to accomplish such ambitious projects.",
    "The course helped me better analyze research methodology and impact. I gained so many insights from course readings, speakers, and discussions about how to use public humanities toward social justice ends. I came away feeling like I learned so many valuable lessons about this field."

   "comments": [
    "I like that the course is split so that the first half of the semester is dedicated to examining theoretical frameworks while the second half looks at case studies. However, the conversation was sometimes stunted, and the theory was dense at times, which wasn't helped by the sheer quantity of it.",
    "Honestly it is a very strong course, with engaging readings and good discussions; a highlight was the guest speakers, who came in to speak about the public humanities projects we had just read about. The only thing I would say is that it would be good to do a little more groundwork with theory in the first two weeks or so--maybe Pedagogy of the Oppressed, since that came up a lot, or some more of the most fundamental texts in this field.",
    "It is the perfect class--everyone at Yale should take it!",
    "I thought this class was structured very well.",
    "Joey is so passionate and involved in the field and had incredible contacts he shared with the class",
    "Joey is a great professor, every assigned reading is phenomenal, the speakers Joey brought in really added a lot to the course, and you come away feeling inspired and with so many ideas about how you might design your own project. The weekly reading responses were a lot of work, so it could have been nice to hear some feedback on them."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about public humanities and meeting leaders in the field!",
    "Mixed bag. The course starts with theory and ends with case studies, which is coolif you can get through the theory in the first place. The guests we had during the second half were on the whole compelling, but I'm not sure how that would play out in a different semester, as it seemed many of them came and hosted other events\/talks on campus, and some of them knew Joey personally and were willing to Skype in. On paper, this course seems great, but it's confusing in reality: the conversation sometimes flowed but at other times was stunted and awkward. Some of the readings were great while others dragged on and people didn't do them. Maybe that can be attributed to the specific dynamics of our class, maybe it's a problem with the readingsI'm not sure. Should the course maintain its guests, it might be worth it for that alone (many guests offered contact information and an invitation to be in touch), but otherwise, I'm not sure I would take it again.",
    "Yes! This is a highly engaging and inspiring course. You read about case studies of public humanities projects, and then you actually meet the people who started those projects and get to talk to them. This course gives you a lot of stuff to think about with your career and your writing--a lot of the ideas we talk about are very immediately actionable, which feels really good! Definitely take it if you are interested in stories, art, social justice, etc.",
    "YES. It will change the way you think about academics, research, life, and much more! I cannot recommend this course highly enough. A MUST TAKE for every student with even a hint of genuine academic curiosity.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Absolutely! So cool and Joey really directs it towards student interest",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. It's so fascinating to learn about scholars and public humanities people doing work that actually inspires social justice activism. You come away with many ideas about how to develop your own project. The speakers were excellent, the readings were really interesting. Overall great class."
