   "comments": [
    "Chem 555 is a little bit of everything regarding mechanisms that maybe you didn't learn elsewhere. And also some electrochemistry thrown in because again, you didn't learn it elsewhere. Don't take it assuming you'll be talking about mechanisms in the first week because you probably won't get there for a while. Its a process, and they build everything from the ground-up. It is scatter-brained in its structure, but 100% take this course because you will learn a great deal from both of these professors.",
    "Take it after they've done it a few times to get the organization down. Ultimately, both of these professors are people you can learn a lot from, and the bizarre format\/interchange between them is worth it.",
    "I have mixed feelings on this question. On one hand, I think what I learned in this class is valuable to my research and general understanding. However, on the other hand, the class was a bit of a mess and unstructured. I would probably recommend this class to another student, but with some hesitation.",
    "I think that with further refinement, this course could be one of the best decisions of your graduate career. It won't be easy, and it's often frustrating, but it really offers an extension of knowledge beyond the classroom. It helps develop that skill, if nothing else, and for that I'm grateful.",
    "CHEM 555 covered thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and kinetics as they relate to inorganic chemistry. I think these are fundamental topics that every graduate student should understand, so yes, I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "Yes. It is a well-rounded course to mechanistic study in inorganic chemistry.",
    "A good course to learn some mechanistic aspects, should take it if you are doing inorganic chemistry",
    "I will strongly recommend the course to another student. It provides the good review of core inorganic chemistry relevant to mechanistic study."

   "comments": [
    "This course was, as I said above, a little bit of everything that you just didn't learn elsewhere. It's a great course that I can guarantee I will use the information from quite a deal over the next several years.",
    "The electrochemistry was particularly useful, as it is so often neglected in undergraduate courses.",
    "This course definitely addressed topics that deepened my knowledge of my discipline. A few of the topics directly related to my research and thus were refreshers to the information.",
    "I will definitely use my notes from this class as reference in the future, as the material covered in the class was very relevant to my research.",
    "I definitely learned a lot more in EChem after taking this course, which is highly relevant to my research.",
    "I learned more about electrochemistry",
    "This course has been by far the most helpful to my research. In my opinion, the course teaches students to design better experiments in their research. It helped me put more thoughts in doing experiments."
