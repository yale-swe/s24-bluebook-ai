   "comments": [
    "Good seminar, not too much reading. 20 page paper and one presentation, not bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in history. We studied a broad range of topics within the history of London, so it should interest just about everyone. Also, the final paper can be written on anything related to London in the 20th century, so you can very much make it your own. There isn't that much assigned reading every week, and the readings that Prof. Conekin picked out are REALLY good. I wholeheartedly recommend this class",
    "An opportunity to write a Junior History Paper. Interesting! There aren't enough History courses on contemporary social history.",
    "An examination of British history and society from the late Victorian era to the present. Each week we looked at a different case study of a specific group of British society: immigrants, homosexuals, women, etc. If you're not in to social history, this might not be the class for you, but if you're interested in the discipline, this is a great class without an overwhelming workload.",
    "The class discussions never felt forced. The topics addressed in the class are very compelling and the readings were a good length--I never felt overloaded by them. If interested in London, definitely take it."
