    "Chamber music is so fun, take it! It basically \"meets\" just twice a week (one coaching with an instructor and one rehearsal you set up with your group), or at most three times a week (coaching, separate rehearsal, and studio class, which meets for two and a half hours). Relatively low (but efficient) time commitment for what you get out of it!You grow a lot musically, expressively, and even soloistically because of the more exposed environment of a chamber group. This was my first time playing in a wind quintet, and I feel I gained a lot more control over my instrument (I play horn) especially when it came to playing quietly.I would most definitely recommend this course, since you also get to bond with your fellow chamber musicians. Rehearsals are also a great time to just relax and destress. There is literally no reason not to take it.",
    "A great class for skilled musicians who enjoy chamber music. Definitely take it.",
    "Take it! A really great class. A lot depends on who your fellow group member are, though.",
    "MUSI 220 is a half credit course in which you work on a chamber music piece with an ensemble for a semester. You schedule rehearsals with your group once per week, and schedule coachings with your coaches once per week. You perform for each other every other week. It's great because it organizes chamber music through the Music Department and offers instruction. I don't think I'd play chamber at this level and this frequency if I wasn't in the course.",
    "A chance to play chamber music with other skilled and musical undergraduates and be coached by School of Music students and professors once a week.",
    "It's a fun class. Meet some good friends, get some free coaching, and very light time commitment.",
    "An opportunity to play chamber music with your peers. Take it!",
    "This course is a wonderful way to play chamber music at a high level and receive instruction. However, this is also a course where you decide how much you want to get out of it. A lot ofit has to do with the group you end up with. It might be easy to get by and not play in studio classes often. But I've found that being consistent in scheduling rehearsals goes a long way. Student feedback is usually insightful and helpful.One last word of advice: Don't start the last movement the week before the concert.",
    "I would recommend this class highly for another student interested in serious study of a piece throughout the semester. It presents a rare opportunity at Yale to really work through a great piece of repertoire and perform the entire thing.",
    "No reason not to take it! A solid structure for chamber music performance.",
    "Yes if you want to play chamber music!",
    "WONDERFUL! Absolutely if you love chamber music, take this course! Of course this course is as much work as you and your chamber group make it- but between weekly rehearsals and coachings and then the studio class every other week, Chamber Music does take up time. But it's absolutely worth it, getting to collaborate with a group of amazing musicians, being coached by Joel or Wendy (two grad school lecturers) and then a wonderfully talented and insightful grad student, and then performing an entire chamber music work each semester. This was a highlight of my first semester at Yale. :)",
    "Any serious classical musician should definitely audition for this class! If you want an intense, yet extremely rewarding chamber music experience at Yale, this class is the one to go for.",
    "Music 220 is a great opportunity to play chamber music with similarly interested undergrads. Though groups and pieces are pre-selected, there is still plenty of freedom to make what you wish to out of the semester. The culminating performance is exciting, and makes all of the effort feel worthwhile. Definitely would recommend this course.",
    "Outside of PChem lab, which no sane soul should take unless required by the major, this class is going to be the hardest half credit you will take. Be sure to sell your body, soul, and all available hours to devote to this. Yes, it is incredibly rewarding in the end, but be prepared to put in a lot a lot a lot for this. Also, the final recital, which takes place over an entire day during reading period, is no small commitment either, and will mean the sacrifice of an entire day of vital finals-study time.",
    "This is a selective course, but if you get in, it is a ton of fun. Try to get along with your group members...or else you'll hate every second of the course. However, if you enjoy working with others on music, be sure to audition!!!",
    "This course is a great way to collaborate with other classical musicians, and you learn a lot about how to become a better chamber musician. You get feedback and private instruction every week and performance opportunities every other week. In addition to helping one grow as a musician, this course is simply a lot of fun! Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. The level of instruction is very, very high."
