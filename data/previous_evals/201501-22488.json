   "comments": [
    "Try to get into this class! This class gives first-hand knowledge of new science technologies in a supportive environment that feels familiar after the second week. Professor Wolenski and his carefully selected teaching fellows craft an experience for students, stuffed with knowledge and exploration. All of it--the science and the people--is incredible.",
    "All the reviews are right, email Dr. Wolenski asap to get on the waiting list.",
    "A great lab course; end times vary from 4 to 6 PM. You'll get to know the instructor, your TA, and your classmates very well, and you'll learn a few lab techniques you probably wouldn't learn in other labs. However, quality of the class is very dependent on the quality of your TA's - I would take this lab if possible.",
    "Best course you'll take at Yale, if you can get in",
    "This is a fantastic lab class. The twice-weekly meeting period may seem like a big time commitment, but it's definitely worth it, and the time you will spend in lab will be very fun and informative. Though the experiments change each year, you will learn about a lot of different lab techniques over the course of the semester and will be able to practice many of them. There is a great emphasis on being able to distill scientific concepts and techniques to their simplest points, and the short class presentations will make you a much better speaker and presenter. These presentations were one of my favorite aspects of the class. Almost every day, someone will do a short presentation on a recently published paper or technique and explain it to the class. This gives everyone a broad exposure to the most exciting things going on in the field and keeps you up to date with research in many different areas of biology.",
    "Absolutely! The class was amazing. Every lab was interesting and the time flew by. Dr. Wolenski was so passionate and engaging and made the class very fun. I learned an incredible amount in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 344\/345 to anyone, although the lengthy preregistration process means that you have to commit to this class very early on. This class has taught me a variety of cell biology techniques (immunoprecipitation, Western blots, etc.), but more importantly it has taught me a very valuable career skill of how to present on science. Professor Wolenski's love for science is infectious, and it shows in all the small projects that he takes on outside of class. All of the students in this class are incredible, and we really bond through the 10 hours of lab each week. By the end of the semester, we were hanging out outside of class and went on a class hike during reading period.",
    "First half of 344\/345, the skills you learn really depend on the year and the project the TF designs.",
    "MCDB 344L is a lab devoted to learning fundamental techniques used in cell biology. Students will learn how to use various laboratory equipment, how to grow cell lines, how to perform ChIP, centrifugation, how to make sucrose gradients, buffers, etc. It is very well thought out, straight forward, and most of all, fun! This is the premier biology lab to take and if you can get in, TAKE IT!",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. I cannot express how truly grateful I am to have been in this lab this semester. It has given me a much better understanding and appreciation for basic science, and has made me so incredibly excited for my medical career. The lab also gave me the opportunity to meet and grow close with some of the most brilliant students I've met at Yale, and I feel so honored and humbled to have been able to work so closely with them.",
    "This class is an unbelievable intro into the techniques of cellular biology that are used in labs every day. I cannot overstate how incredible this class was and if you can get in, I HIGHLY recommend you do it.",
    "If you have the chance to take this course, TAKE IT. It is a big time commitment (lab twice a week), but there is almost no work outside of class. Professor Wolenski is incredible and the TAs are amazing. You will never learn more or have a better time in a class.",
    "Absolutely recommend! A wonderful experience, I grew really close to my labmates.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN GET IN. This is the best MCDB class I have taken and the best class I have taken at Yale. It is so much fun and you learn a lot of lab techniques and the science behind them. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
