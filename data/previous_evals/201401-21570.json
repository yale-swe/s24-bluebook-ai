   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class was chill and informative. Ague was a strong lecturer, but it would be a better class not at 9am",
    "Overall a great course for a foundation to the major natural resources in use today, where they come from, the science behind them, and where we are headed going forward. Definitely a must take for anyone who wants to have a basis for understanding the big energy debates of our age. The course definitely gives you a solid foundation to understand the science behind the resources discussed without getting too technical. I would definitely take it so that you have this foundational knowledge.",
    "A good way to learn about fossil fuels and renewable energy. I took this to fulfill a requirement and it was painless and i learned a lot for the amount of effort I had to put in.",
    "Great overview for resources",
    "I would highly recommend this class to someone who is looking for a science credit, and is interested in the subject of natural resources and sustainability. The course sounds like an overview of the natural resources available to us, and an examination of how we can best use them sustainably, and that is exactly what it is. Interesting enough that I did not miss a single 9 AM lecture. In terms of the work, there are about 10 straightforward problem sets, 1 midterm which is fairly simple, and one final project, which can be very interesting if you pick a topic you care about. Overall, great course!",
    "G&G 205 was a decent gateway course. It covered sources of energy at a basic introductory level. There was a lot to cover, so I understand that we couldn't gain a deeper understanding of the subject material. This was a non-stressful SC credit, with good pacing & important material. There are 6 homeworks, a midterm, and a final project (presentation\/paper) that makes up 45% of your grade. The project really was not explained enough - no grading rubric, no previous examples, no clear sense of how to research\/write. So most people probably have no idea how they did in the class. The homework was really math-based, but we often didn't have math practice in class (class is mostly conceptual discussion) so I would argue it should count as a QR credit as well\u2026 The teaching assistants are really helpful for the homework, but for most of the homeworks I didn't need to ask for help & did well. Professor Ague is responsive & presents all sides of an issue (including his own ideas).",
    "Definitely yes. Definitely for a science major, and also just because this information is necessary for moving forward as a citizen of the world.",
    "Yes, overall it was an interesting class covering a broad variety of largely interesting material.",
    "A great introduction to energy and its sustainability. Don't expect to get too deep into the science behind the topics discussed. The class has a very manageable workload. The problem sets, while sometimes tedious, were always very doable. The midterm was extremely fair, and the final projects were fun as we got to choose our topics. Professor Ague is an excellent teacher. He's very knowledgeable, and the class is well organized. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course if you are interested in the contemporary and historical issues of environmental degradation and the science behind it. You will def. get all the background info. to feel comfortable in other classes as well.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to natural resources, especially if you don't have any prior knowledge. It isn't too much work - 5-6 assignments, a midterm, and a paper, which were all pretty enjoyable.",
    "G&G 205 was a less scientific class than I was expecting. The material was interesting and was a great overview of various natural resources with some surface-level scientific explanations (mostly just formulas) for how they worked. The problem sets, however, were a bunch of unit conversions which, after a while, could feel tedious and drawn-out although there were only 6 and they were not that time consuming. In addition, the one test had a bunch of over-arching questions about the natural resources and felt like it lacked a scientific component. I'd recommend this class if you are looking for a basic, comprehensible introduction to the various natural resources and their pros and cons.",
    "A great overview of resource and sustainability issues. The problem sets were longer than I would have liked, but overall the workload was not too much. The last week was a lot, though, since there is a final poster presentation as well as a final paper.",
    "Yes!! Take it. Great class if you're interested in sustainable energy!",
    "A great science\/geology\/energy studies credit",
    "Definitely recommend this class for SC credit! Take with friends because the psets are pretty hard",
    "Yes if you are interested in learning about natural resources you will definitely do it in this class.",
    "It is a solid but relatively easy science credit. I would recommend it to anyone who'd like to know more about the world's current energy situation, it's a very applicable class.",
    "G&G 205 is a great class that will teach you in an interesting way about the different types of alternative fuel sources. The professor is great and will make sure all of your questions are answered. There is less work than in some other classes, but it is slightly more difficult. Take this class if you are interested in the material or science in general.",
    "Yes if you are a non-science student interested in geopolitics and resources.",
    "If you want a basic overview of energy production and its effect on the environment take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's one of those rare Yale courses where you get a lot out of it but don't have to put an extraordinary amount of work into it. It also has so many real-world applications!",
    "Not a gut science class. Long PSets, but interesting",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in learning about the different types of energy we rely on as a society, how they work, the different yields, etc. It's a great class and the exams are very straightforward. PSETs are tedious, but not too difficult. All around good course.",
    "I would recommend G&G205 to another student. Ague presents a wide variety of extremely interesting topics in an easily accessible manner.",
    "lectures are useful for homework as a lot of the formulas aren't in the textbook. 1 midterm, decently easy if you study\/he gives you half the questions. 1 final paper with very unclear guidelines."
