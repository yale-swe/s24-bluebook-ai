    "This was an excellent course with a great professor. You should take this course if you can.",
    "I would recommend, and strongly recommend with changes suggested above.",
    "Identity and Inequality in Urban America gives a broad understanding of urban dynamics. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who has interest in looking at urban studies or who has lived in a city.",
    "Take this class if you are looking for a simple, engaging, and relatively easy introduction to urban sociology. Professor Hunter is approachable and will make you think about the reading.",
    "Take this class if your interested in reading and analyzing\/critiquing sociological ethnographies.",
    "Yes! You'll learn a lot about structural inequalities in urban america and about mjnority cultures in the city. It's a book a week but it's pretty chill otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone! Even if you're not a social science major the material will be accessible, and Professor Hunter welcomes different perspectives on the topics. You will read a lot of important work in the field of sociology and come to understand certain areas of the urban experience well. It is also very possible to do well in the course if you participate in class and work diligently on the midterm and final.",
    "Great class! Only take if you are interested in the material. But if you are interested in the material, take it to enjoy lively discussions with classmates on the issues. Also, Professor Hunter is great."
