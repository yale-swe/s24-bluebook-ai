    "I would highly recommend taking this class if you are at all interested in ethnicity, conflict, or comparative political science. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course highly-it is extremely interesting and the professor is great",
    "PSC 785 01 is a graduate-level course on ethnicity, nationalism and ethnic conflict. That means that the student should not only apprehend the subjects treated in the course, but should critique them while taking a position as well. The subjects treated go from definitions of ethnicity, to the relationship between the State and minorities, to methods of measurement of ethnic conflict. The class will eventually inform the students of the different scholarly approaches to each of these subjects.The class should be preferably suggested only to students with already an education in the Political Sciences. Furthermore, the class studies examples mostly from Europe or post-colonial Asian countries, Therefore students investigating ethnicity in other countries could take this course only under a comparative perspective."

   "comments": [
    "I\u0092ve chosen this course as an opportunity to understand the position of scholars on the issue of ethnicity and its management by the State. My research on the multicultural city, conducted at the department of architecture, has been enriched by these course informing it of the very mechanisms deployed by the State to measure and control the presence of minorities and ethnic identification over its territory: a set of mechanisms that Benedict Anderson calls \u0093cultural technology of rule\u0094. My research has a more specific interest in these tools by themselves, more than in specific countries or historical case studies. In this sense, the course has been very helpful, providing scholarly important references for the study of these tools, studying its application in many political environments, from medieval europe to postcolonial india."
