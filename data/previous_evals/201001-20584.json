    "A discussion of major critical movements of the 20th century. I would certainly recommend this class. I would even recommend making it mandatory. In this class you learn all the \"big names\" of criticism that everyone expects you to know, but no one ever explains to you (until now!).",
    "If you're studying twentieth-century literature in any language, this course provides a strong background in the major schools of theory that developed in that time frame. I would definitely recommend the course.",

    "As I said before, everyone expects students to be familiar with all these major critics and critical movements, but no one ever takes the time to actually explain and discuss them. This class is absolutely essential for any literature major.",
    "Literary theory has always seemed somewhat nebulous to me, difficult to pin down. And this course helped me to see it as a useful and practical tool that can be applied to my own research.",
    "It helped my understanding of lit theory, and this is very applicable to what I do."
