    "I would recommend this class to students who genuinely want to improve their french.",
    "140 felt significantly easier than 130. Homework wasn't always daily like it was in 130, which was really nice. In general, the class is less grammar based and more focused on speaking and discussing readings. I think it's a great class, especially if you can get into a really small section because you'll probably feel more comfortable speaking that way. Overall, yes, I would recommend it!",
    "It is no doubt one of my favorite classes here. You learn so much so fast.",
    "If you've taken any level of French at Yale below 140, this class will feel very familiar. There is a very similar layout in terms of how the material is presented. There is something nice to this regularity, but there is also a trifle of tedium. Thus, I think the best way to keep the class fresh is to enjoy the readings and movies, but even more so to find an engaging professor. Definitely spend time during shopping period trying out different sections so as to find a professor that you like."
