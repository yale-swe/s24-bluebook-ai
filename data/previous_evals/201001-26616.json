    "I think that the division of the class into two parts - starting with lectures and ending with student presentations was very effective.It allowed us to build a base upon which we could start to have incredibly productive discussions later in the term.The environment was very open and encouraged debate.",
    "I found the amount of information very manageable which is in large part due to the careful planning of the professor. The weekly readings were thoughtfully selected and well arranged. This class took a very complicated subject matter and made it understandable.",
    "The material presented was informative, but a little too narrow in scope. It would have been interesting to focus more on additional ideas of \"mobility\" beyond the 1960s. While I definitely enjoyed the content of the class, it would be interesting to look at how new forms of mobility have historically affected architecture and how they continue to do so today.",
    "Professor Perry gave us a lot of freedom in selecting our paper topics, and doing the research for these topics was quite exciting.",
    "Very interesting body of material - it was interesting to delve into this information."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations for this class were to explore the ongoing relationship between technology and architecture through guided research. The readings and guest lectures were very helpful in this regard and for the final paper, Professor Perry was open enough to entertain a wide variety of ideas and was extremely helpful in pointing me towards applicable resources.",
    "As mentioned above, I was hoping for more information on the impact of mobility and new velocities on the built form and urbanism.",
    "This class met most of my expectations.",
    "Expected to read a lot of Banham and surrounding material. I red a lot of Banham and related materials."

   "comments": [
    "This course was valuable because it provided a lot of information on a particular subject matter that, while extremely interesting to me, is often overlooked in typical architectural history and theory classes. I am sure I will revisit my notes and the assigned readings more than once over the next few years.",
    "An introduction to really interesting subject matter that is not otherwise taught.",

    "The instructor was extremely knowledgeable and quite adept at conveying that knowledge. The same can also be said for the various guest lecturers he invited to speak.",
    "Instructor needed to engage the students more in the beginning of the class. Midway through the semester, the class discussions improved but I think discussion could have been cultivated or encouraged earlier in the year.",
    "Professor Perry's presentation slides were hard to decipher. However, he verbal presentations were very interesting. I really enjoyed the number of guest lecturers. The TA did not play a big role, but she did help with obtaining the readings.",
    "Chris was a good instructor. He was very open to discuss a variety of interesting subjects."

    "Maybe requiring a rough draft of the final paper could help. This would help force students to flesh out ideas a little earlier, so maybe the final paper wouldn't feel as hurried.",
    "See above - Engage the students more directly in discussion.",
    "None that I can imagine. Perhaps there could have been more pictures in Professor Perry's slides. There could have also been more mediation in inciting discussion within the course."
