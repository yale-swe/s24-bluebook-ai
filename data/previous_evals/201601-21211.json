   "comments": [
    "If, as a thinking thing, you have any interested in thinking about just what sort of thinking thing you are, then take this course. Philosophy of mind is confusing and hard, but I am sure you will come out of this course with at least a different idea of what you are. Also, you would be silly not to take a course with Professor Szab and\/or Justin.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. It is a wonderfully interesting look into what the properties of our beliefs and desires are, as well as just the mind in general",
    "If you haven't taken any philosophy courses, especially first-order logic, there will be times when you are very challenged by this class. Of course, that's no reason not to take it, but do not be fooled by the seemingly light workload; the readings require a lot of thinking and getting behind is a very bad idea. The papers as well require a good deal of critical thought. This is not an easy class for someone without philosophical experience, but I would take it again because it offers in-depth exposure to one particular facet of philosophy, and there are a limited number of classes one can take as a freshman that are for depth not breadth.",
    "This is a nice survey of a wide variety of topics (the course is called intentionality, but that encompasses topics as varied as representation, meaning, philosophy of mind, etc.) It's a nice intermediate level philosophy course which is well suited for students new to philosophy as well as for those who are more well-versed.",
    "A good survey analytic philosophy course. You read lots of the important articles in philosophy of mind and language in the 20th century. Szabo is excellent and tough. The short-answer assignments are practically problem sets; you need to get the correct answer (rhetoric doesn't matter)."
