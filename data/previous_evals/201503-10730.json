   "comments": [
    "It's really helpful for outlining the timeline and landscape of the agriculture issue with a global perspective.",
    "I would, especially to those who are open to interdisciplinary approaches to these topics.",
    "This class meets for four hours once a week. The first two hours are lecture and the second two are discussion, beginning with two assigned discussion leaders. Assignments include four reading responses, two turns as discussion leader, and a final paper (5000 words max). The lectures are really engaging and there",
    "Recommended for anyone interested in international development, peasant studies and contemporary food politics. This is not a course for someone looking for more engagement with professors or seeking to develop expertise in a single geographic\/thematic focus. Phd students and FES students already working on a thesis related to human ecology are at a great advantage for the final essay. Other students have to lift a heavy load to produce a long final research paper with little instructor support.",
    "Recommended",
    "I would say that it is well worth it, as the readings were extremely interesting and the discussions well organized and well-delivered.",
    "A class any social scientist must take before leaving Yale. Interdisciplinary and classic readings.",
    "I would recommend Agrarian Societies to any student interested in a broad survey of mankind's evolving relationship with food supply.",
    "Are you interested in learning about the origins of agriculture? Do you want to have access to Yale's best faculty on the topic? Do you want to discuss interesting books (that you will read nowhere else) with a strong cohort of your peers? Take this class, because it is like none other."

    "It opened up a whole new way of thinking about my discipline and topic.",
    "I gained not only a much better understanding of ancient history and the emergence of agriculture, and the way this deep history has been the foundation for modern life. I also gained deeper understanding of contemporary migration movements, agricultural practices, etc. I feel that I began to acquire a critical framework for disciplines like animal studies and critical cultural studies. really enlightening.",
    "This course was cross-listed to many departments, but I felt like it addressed my interests, both research and otherwise, very adequately."
