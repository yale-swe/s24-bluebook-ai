   "comments": [
    "Take this course! Professor Campbell rocks, and the material rocks. I was afraid of the time period because the only works from then I'd ever read stunk. But those were all written by men. Turns out the women writers of the period were FIRE; unfortunately they aren't included in most syllabi for this period. This class is amazing, and you should take it!",
    "In this class, we read works by women in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mostly poems, but a few stories and one or two novels as well. There's a midterm paper and a final paper, and occasionally forum posts. Professor Campbell is very nice, and you'll learn some interesting tidbits about different aspects of life in Britain 300-400 years ago.",
    "English 239 is a crucial class that makes up for a lack in the English department's curricula. I had previously NEVER studied any of the material in this syllabus, and thought that what I learned was absolutely essential. How can one study Wordsworth in English 126 and not know how paramount Dorothy Wordsworth's journals were to his writing process? Professor Campbell is kind, patient, and always treats seminar discussion with care and thoughtfulness.",
    "Such a lovely class, and it felt so different from any other class I've taken. The readings are great, really interesting, spanning a lot more subject that one might expect \"women writers\" to, and never have I felt more at home in a seminar. Professor Campbell is great, and all of our discussions feel like conversations. I always felt like we were really listening to each other and engaging with our ideas, and it was great to be part of it!",
    "Definitely would recommend. Don't be deterred by the title--what you read and discuss will be shockingly relevant to your own life! Especially if you yourself are a woman writer.",
    "One of the best English classes. Take it! Professor Campbell is such a joy to have- she is truly enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject matter. The syllabus is very reasonable and you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes. This is an incredible course. The idea of studying just women writers is a complicated and an interesting one and Professor Campbell handled it with thoughtfulness and grace. We read a variety of engaging material ranging from novels to poetry to journals to letters. Professor Campbell is a harsh grader which made the midterm and final essays intense. Overall the class discussion was the most important part and that was really enlightening."
