   "comments": [
    "Chill class, fun topics, sometimes can just seem like you're discussing life with your classmates rather than actually learning fact-based material... this can be a good and bad thing.",
    "115 is a class that is not only great for an American Studies or WGSS major, but anyone interested in broadening their view of the world. You get a whole new lens through which to look at the world. The class covers a wide range of historical and current material.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to go into WGSS.",
    "If you can answer the question \"what is gender\" and \"what is the state\" you're over-qualified for this class.",
    "While the grading is easy, it is somewhat of an annoying class. Take cr\/d and you will never have to show up to anything.",
    "No. Unfortunately, the material is presented in such a way that it makes this course pointless and a drag. I came out with a few new ideas, but overall wished I hadn't taken the class. Lectures are long and mostly painful and the poor TA's didn't help the situation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, particularly for a WGSS major",
    "Gender in a Transnational World is an exemplary intro to WGSS. It encompasses various fields (sociology, American studies) and forces students to think critically about many of their assumptions on race, gender, and class. Prof. Grewal (chair of WGSS) has great lectures that incorporate many topics including media representations, globalization, and forced relocation. Unlike many may assume, this course does not solely focus on feminism but also discusses pressing disparities in wealth and education around the globe, analyzing the history of oppressed people in Africa, the Middle East, and the U.S. on a basis of their sexual orientation, religious practices, and economic status. Prof. Grewal's textbook is a good mix of articles, visuals, and narratives.",
    "I would very much recommend this class to another student. No one should graduate from Yale without discussing the issues explored in this class.",
    "This class was wonderful. As a junior anthropology major and fairly well-read feminist, I was a little worried that it would all be stuff I'd learned before. But, for one thing, this class involves feminist theory and readings that even a lot of WGSS majors haven't been exposed to. In most Intro to Women's Studies-type classes, the focus is on American, British, and French feminism, whereas this class focuses on gender issues in other places, and on transnational issues. And it was different from reading a feminist blog, because we were reading academic writing. It was refreshing and inspiring to read angry writing about feminist issues that was written in a scholarly tone.Having taken this class, I feel much more confident about talking to people about things that are problematic - not just in terms of gender and sexuality but also regarding race and citizenship. I had felt for a long time that I didn't have the confidence - or the vocabulary - to talk about things that bothered me.The class was pretty easy. If you keep up with the readings, go to lecture (probably not even necessary - but really fun and absolutely worth it), and attend most of the sections, the midterm paper and final exam are a breeze. The weekly reading responses were due atannoying times, but were fun to write.If you can take this class with Inderpal, definitely do it. She knows so much and is incredibly passionate. She did a good job of engaging the class - even though it was a lecture, she knew every single person's name and made class feel really friendly. It was also awesome to use a textbook written by the professor. She also sent me an email once responding personally to a reading response I'd written, which was so sweet.",
    "You can take this credit D pretty easily. However, Professor Grewal sometimes cold calls people in class, and section was added this year on top of two 1 hour and 15 minute classes each week. The work is manageable and interesting, but the class overall probably isn't worth it. Class was in an awkward confused status between a lecture and a seminar.",
    "This is a great class. The subject matter is interesting and applies to your everyday life. There isn't too much work compared to other similar classes.",
    "Inderpal is awesome and the class is really interesting. She really makes an effort to make sure the class is taught seminar-style, even if it is a larger class, and to really talk and connect with students. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes. Learn about America.and all those things you think are pure common sense which turns out to be constructed"
