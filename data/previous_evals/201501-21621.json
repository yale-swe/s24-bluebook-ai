    "AMAZING CLASS!!!! 2 quizzes, 2 exams, no final! It's basically a lab class so you go around and learn about different features of bones. SO COOL. It's a must-take.",
    "This class is awesome - you learn the features of the human bones first hand",
    "The class is what it says it is, you learn about all the bones in the body and a bit about their functions. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. It's SO much fun and pretty relaxed.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Wonderful. Not too difficult though it required lots of studying before exams.",
    "This course is the best class I have taken at Yale, hands down. The system of lectures at the beginning of each unit combined with self-learning with super knowledgeable professors and TAs there to help you out with the actual specimens is one entirely conducive to learning such a field where different sensory components are key to truly understanding the material.",
    "Must take course! Difficult to get into if you're not a senior. Professor sargis is the nicest and most approachable professor. Absolute hidden gem at yale",
    "It was amazing! As a major in a completely different field of study, I loved the presentation of the material and everything about the class. Sargis is the best. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "It is a very hands on course where you are extremely self-directed. Essentially you spend all class touching super old and new and rare bones and find ways that work best for you to learn them all. At first you think it will be a lot of memorization, but in the end you just end up learning it so well in class that you don't even need to cram for the tests. Also, you get your own skeleton!!!",
    "Really great class for senior year, but more work than what you would expect. Definitely good for Credit\/D, but you will need to work hard for a good grade otherwise.",
    "If you are a senior looking for an enjoyable class, take this course! I took it Cr\/D so there was very little stress involved but it doesn't take too much effort to do well.",
    "Sargis is awesome; the human body is awesome; this class is awesome. Dominated by pre-meds but definitely take it even if you're not! It's a lot of memorization but totally doable and a lot of fun. Also you get to see some pretty cool specimens.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who might be interested in bones or wants to take a class that is unlike anything else at Yale. It is not easy and there isnt much of a curve but the class is enjoyable."
