    "have good insight into some of the media strategies that people take and was able to bring in media politics theory to the real world",
    "A deep understanding of the media environment",
    "This class was great in providing me with a good understanding of how political communication and political media operate. The extremely relevant and recent studies on fake news were particularly useful and pertinent to today's American political climate. Professor Gooch provided the most recent and cutting edge research in the field, which was greatly appreciated.",
    "I figured how to critically examine political surveys in more depth",
    "I had no polisci background before this class, so you could imagine that I learned a ton! Professor Gooch makes the material very accessible for students like me with minimal polisci experience. I learned how to analyze fake news from an academic perspective, interpret empirical studies with a clearer understanding, and muster the confidence to speak in a first-year through senior seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Easy, fun, Gooch is a great guy to listen to. Data-driven, unlike many other PLSC seminars Weaknesses: Attracts young students -- especially first-years -- which can make discussion pretty boring an uninspiring.",
    "Felt that the professor didn't know the readings that well which was a bit demotivating; seemed to quite clearly choose favorites at the beginning",
    "More challenging readings",
    "I think a strength of the course was the relevance of the material to today and Professor Gooch's continual efforts to find the most relevant and recent research in the field (particularly on fake news). I feel like maybe the selection of readings could have been better organized but I recognize the difficulty of doing so when new research is popping up as the course progresses.",
    "Strengths: -small class, great discussions -most of the readings were though provoking and interesting -Professor Gooch is a funny, down-to-earth guy that knows what he's talking about -two take home exams were accessible and fun to write Weaknesses: - reading load is heavy and some of the readings are very intuitive - class is long, but that's just what you're signing up for",
    "Going into this course, I was unaware of the focus on the empirical data side of the studies that we would discuss in the class. If this were better reflected in the syllabus, I do not believe that I would have been confused about some of the studies that were assigned. that is to say that it was great exposure to this side of the social sciences. Something that I truly valued about this course as the fact that the majority of the research that we studied and discussed was in real time. Since this is a relatively new field, a lot pf out discussion were able to pull in many real world examples from the news as well ."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah hopefully your seminar class isn't as bad. It's an easy PLSC seminar and very relevant and timely. Interesting enough, and you can probably get away without doing any readings. The take-home midterm and final are a breeze and Gooch is an easy grader! Take it, especially if you think you can motivate yourself to do the readings though they don't seem necessary.",
    "I would recommend only for the fact that I think that Gooch is quite smart, and he is open to the ideas of students. The material is important, and the field is burgeoning with the internet and social media. It was a VERY young class this time around, and I think the structure of the course would have been more conducive to an older audience that had more political science under its belt. The free form style of the seminar, while welcome, was not necessarily fit for a class in which individuals could only provide anecdotes and couldn't rely on much literature.",
    "Yes",
    "The class isn't extraordinary, but you do get a deep dive into the research on advertising, campaign strategy, fake news and more. It's interesting for political buffs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As far as seminars go, the course was very approachable and low key. Professor Gooch is very even-keeled and approachable, which allows the in-class discussions to really hum along. Also, the workload really wasn't too strenuous, particularly for a seminar. There is a steady assignment of reading but it is very manageable. I really felt like I left the course with a firm grasp on the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in polisci and the science behind the 2016 election. As a student that's new to polisci, I thought that the class was challenging enough to keep me on my toes, but easy enough to understand without much experience in polisci classes. It's a once a week, chill seminar, with a good load of reading."
