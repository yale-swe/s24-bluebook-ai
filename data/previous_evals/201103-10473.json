   "comments": [
    "A lot of work, but know that 5 minutes talking to the really articulate professor will clear up any questions that you have. It is a course that gives you an opportunity to really get to grips with the issues that are at play within some of (what are known as the) \"key texts\" in the canon of western philosophy. I would recommend taking it if you are willing to put in the work to do the reading at a deep level.",
    "I might describe the class as following: MU 939 examines 5 philosophers who privileged music intheir inquiry and aesthetics. The class involves reading their texts relevant to music and discussing them in a round table seminar once a week. Certain basic tropes tend to reoccur throughout the classes, ex. the problem of representation, imitation etc. I think that students interested in both music and philosophy who don't mind reading a bit would love this class."

    "Not applicable, per se, to dissertation, but gives me a firm, life-long grasp on these very key texts, that will be helpful in getting a firmer grasp on the intellectual history of the humanities as a whole."
