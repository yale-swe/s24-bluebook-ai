    "I learned about Fourier and Wavelet analysis from a very real analytic point of view",
    "I was exposed to an overview of techniques in harmonic analysis.",
    "I learned about a lot of results in classical Fourier analysis, and at the tail end of the course, about applications to understanding the geometry of data sets.",
    "Despite the title, this course is just an introductory harmonic analysis course--which is fine, since harmonic analysis is cool and there are few people in the world who know more about the field than Professor Coifman.",
    "Some insight to the mapping properties of Fourier Transform. Also the notion of intrinsic metric of data sets, which is very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "This course could have assessments of student learning like problem sets and all",
    "This was a good survey of harmonic analysis. Could have had more graphs.",
    "Prof. Coifman can be a really inspirational lecturer. Given that he cared a lot about the content of this course, I found his lectures pretty engaging.",
    "I think that such a course should be have more pre-requisite, so that it can start by assuming people have seen the basic of Fourier (transform, series) and so allow to go into more advance topics."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you will actually follow along in class. Otherwise, you may not get anything out of the material since youre not technically responsible for knowing any of it.",
    "This course had no work and provided a survey of techniques in harmonic analysistake it if you are very interested in harmonic analysis.",
    "I'm not sure if it will be offered again, but I would! This is Professor Coifman's specialty, and it's pretty amazing to learn about harmonic analysis from him.",
    "This course is really more of a lecture series than a course. Professor Coifman builds up harmonic analysis from the ground up, starting with Fourier transforms on period functions and working up to wavelet transforms. Professor Coifman has a lot of beautiful insights into the field but I often found it hard to understand what he was trying to communicate. That being said, if you are at all interested in harmonic analysis from either a theoretical or applied perspective I would recommend this course. You will definitely get something out of it.",
    "I would not recommend it to a graduate student who has seen basic fourier and functional analysis. As an introduction to these topics the course is fine."
