   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because the topic is interesting, unique, and can vary into several disciplines. The writing and critical thinking skills that I gained from this course will be extremely useful.",
    "Yes definitely. There is a lot to learn about stereotyped words and their usage, particularly in an environment like Yale's",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who is eager about the contested meanings of common words and apply that back to your own life. However, if you are looking for a class where you can get more direct help with your OWN writing, this may not be the right class.",
    "Take it and take it with Arvind Thomas! Literally my favorite professor.",
    "basic writing course, focuses on academic-type writingi would recommend it if you just want to improve your writing in general or think you need to be better at writing academic papers",
    "I would! I really would. This class explores words with conflicting meanings or usages. Words we may hear in our everyday life. It's so nice to be able to talk about and research things relevant to our lives.",
    "A usually manageable reading before every class (although there was 30+ pages of reading maybe once or twice during the semester) and a discussion of the reading during class. Almost all of the discussion would be about the writing of the piece we read (structure, style, etc.) although we would very occasionally get off-topic. Sometimes, the discussion would be quiet because the piece was a little boring. Other times, the discussion would be lively and thought-provoking because the piece was well-written and fascinating. Most of the time, discussions were in between those two extremes. The first three papers seem daunting at first, but you will get through each of them just fine if you put in the work. You get to relax on the fourth paper; Professor Thomas let us write anything as long as it related to the main idea of our third paper. All in all, an extremely helpful class if you've never taken a seminar before or ever really dedicated time to your writing like myself; I have learned so much and improved so much from this one class. On a side note, although Prof Thomas doesn't require you to buy any books, I recommend getting the Archive of Research or whatever book is on the syllabus; it really doesn't cost that much and it's immensely helpful as a reference, especially during your third paper!",
    "Take english 114 with Professor Thomas. He's very nice and takes the time to meet with each student about his\/her essays. He really cares about improving the writing skills of each of his students.",
    "If you enjoy thinking and talking about a lot of different topics, you can get a lot out of this seminar. Dr Thomas is a great instructor who isn't overbearing in his workload demands, and he's really understanding about students' concerns.",
    "This class gives you the bare bones of writing. Scope, structure, and archive. Workload is ok and professor is a tough but fair grader. Also depends a lot on whether or not you like the people in your class. Take it if you need the writing credit.",
    "This class really only taught me how to deconstruct a paper. The reading and writing for this class is pretty time consuming. In retrospect, it was a good class, but the material and the structure of the class gets really dry and redundant. Professor Thomas is pretty disorganized but he's really smart and engaging. He's very dedicated to his students (for each of the times I met with him to discuss a paper he would sit with me for about an hour).",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in exploring specific words in more detail. The class was a great way to improve my analytical skills.",
    "This course is challenging, but very rewarding introductory writing course that will give you the tools to tackle a wide range of academic writing (again as the name implies \"across the disciplines\"). This course really shows you that you can pursue any academic passion as long as you use the effective analytical and writing tools that Dr. Arvind equips you with."
