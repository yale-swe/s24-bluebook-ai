    "The professor was unreceptive and dismissive to students' feedback. For the assignments, the instructions were confusing. And not in a way that challenges you to think harder, in a way that suggests inattention to detail and poor written communication skills. I hope the assignments next year are updated to reflect some of the questions that came up. The pre-class online quiz questions were poorly written and took a significant amount of time each week. The professor did not make an effort to change the quiz questions after receiving constant feedback from students that they were poorly written and a waste of our time. Example question: From lecture, why was China blamed for the failure of the Copenhagen climate talks? Answers: a). Failure to cooperate with the U.S.; b). U.S.s failure to pass domestic climate legislature was really to blame, which prevented an ambitious, legally-binding deal; c). For bullying President Obama; d). For rallying all developing countries, including India, to refuse to put forth any clear emissions reduction targets. The correct answer is B: the U.S. is really to blame. But wait, according to the pre-class lecture China was blamed in the media for the failure of the talks and B answers an entirely different question: the question should China be to blame? It doesnt answer the question of why China was blamed. That is confusing, you say? Welcome to our weekly lives. The quiz questions have clear room for improvement.",
    "Going to China really made this class what it is -- what a great experience. Highly recommend taking the class if you get a chance. However, due to the fact that this is a joint undergrad\/grad school class, the level of the work was weird at points, and I felt that some of the way the class was run was meant to keep the undergraduates doing their work, which was unnecessary for the grad students. Additionally, it was interesting learned for a semester with the professor out of the room -- I find that I don't learn as well without a professor in the room.",
    "Professor Hsu is very knowledgable about the subject matter and did a great job in assembling resources and speakers for the class. I really enjoyed the readings, and discussions."

    "Class was very structured and started with a few weeks of introductory material to help everyone get on the same page re: energy and china. This was one of my favorite FES courses.",
    "The field trip was incredibly valuable, especially meeting the students from Tsinghua University. Through getting dinner with them, we got to learn their perspectives on lots of different issues.",
    "I learned a lot through the online lectures and readings, and the field trip was really educational and fun. Professor Hsu did a great job explaining the topics covered in this course. There are not many other courses like this at FES -- it felt very relevant for anyone interested in international environmental policy.",
    "Going to China!!",
    "The best aspect of the course was the ability to visit China and really see how the issues we were learning about were playing out in real life. I also really enjoyed having the YaleNUS students as part of our course because their international backgrounds and past experience brought a lot of depth and breadth to the discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Quizzes do force you to do the reading, but were overwhelming to have each week.",
    "The technical set-up on the FES side was not conducive to remote learning. I feel as though I never participated because it was nearly impossible to interject in the conversation--we only had two mics that worked poorly and had to be passed around. By the time someone who wanted to speak received a mic, the class had already moved on. The half of the class in Singapore could just speak freely--we need mics like the ones they had!",
    "1) There were too many readings each week. It was a lot of work compared to other courses and I would have gotten more out of the readings if we were able to focus on 1-3 readings each week instead of 3-5. 2) Dont have the policy memo due during FES spring break! My group had a lot of trouble coordinating and this could have been avoided. 3) I think there is room for improvement in terms of engaging students during the discussion sections. I didn't like going through ALL of the student submitted questions during class time maybe choosing just a few questions to focus on each week and circulating them in advance would have helped students to think about particular topics and participate more in the discussion. 4) It would have been nice to have a set schedule for the field trip in advance. I have been on other field trips that felt better organized and where I always had a clear idea of what was going on\/when I would have free time\/etc.",
    "Undergrad\/grad student level balancing, and difficulties of taking the class remotely -- these are big challenges.",
    "Before the trip, it was very difficult to get to know the YaleNUS students. In the future, I would recommend doing introductions of all the students in the beginning of the class and having a \"get to know you\" discussion post before the first day of class. Another interesting discussion on the first class would have been to ask students about their pre-conceived notions of China's energy and sustainability and see how the answers compare across the two schools. Another aspect that needs improvement is the expectations of the problem sets as they were often unclear and it was not certain what needed to be discussed and what could be disregarded."

Some weeks we had problem sets on top of this. It was A LOT but I learned more than I have in any FES class. Now I am kind of a sinophile...",
    "The lectures were well done, and in combination with the course readings, formed the basis for class discussion. This was very effective, and Professor Hsu and TF Tyler Gibson were good about sending up follow up information from questions arising from the discussion. However, there were times when questions were raised but the answers did not have enough depth, because they went beyond the readings and the class participants did not have external experience to answer the questions."

    "We worked virtually with Yale NUS students on a policy memo, then worked with them more in person when we got to china. this was stressful but worth it because it was so different working with these rockstar undergrads than with FES students and our very different-thinking minds produced innovative products.",
    "It was difficult to find time to meet with our group in Singapore, but we made it work.",
    "The big assignment for this class, the policy memo, required us to work with the Yale-Singapore undergraduate students. Singapore students level of analysis is not at the Masters level. This assignment felt more like busy work since the analysis couldn't go that deep and a lesson on delegating than getting much out of the content. Which is fine if that is what you are looking for.",
