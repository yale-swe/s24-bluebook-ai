There was less attention at the end of the course on the broader topics, however thats to be expected now that they had built the foundation and the basic principles.",

    "I think the course could be improved through more attention on the back half of the material. I think the combination of ximeras and learning the material in class helped a lot.",
    "I found the teachers to be knowledgable but poor in teaching methods.",
    "I did not like how one instructor had more control of the test and could tell his\/her students what to study for on the exam.",
    "Strengths in this course could be found in the Peer Tutors and the Professors themselves, who were dedicated in attempting to teach students the provided content.",
    "Teaching in class is not reflective of the expectations on tests. I felt that sections taught by the course head were better prepared for assessments than classes taught by graduate students. The p-sets are extra work for little gain in actual preparation because the types of questions are different."
