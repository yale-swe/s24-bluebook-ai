   "comments": [
    "I learned abut different drawing techniques and different perspectives.",
    "I truly developed more patience and better understanding of the techniques needed to compose an effective piece of artwork",
    "I really enjoyed this class because it was so different from all of my other classes. I learned to draw in new ways and change up some stubborn habits i used to have.",
    "In the class we worked on many of the fundamentals of basic drawing and art.",
    "I definitely learned to evaluate objects for still life drawings in a more detailed manner. Simultaneously, I learned to free up and not be afraid of drawing gesturally.",
    "I learned how to evaluate and analyze drawings, and a lot of useful drawing and art skills.",
    "I learned how to look at artwork and critique it with my peers. I learned the basics of drawing with charcoal and ink, worked with collage, and gained an eye for abstraction, negative space, and interesting settings.",
    "In Art 114 I learned so much about drawing: I gained experience with charcoal (along with forays into pencil, collage, ink, and paint); my conception of what a drawing is became broader and more nuanced; my artistic style developed; and probably most importantly, I learned how to really look at a subject in a way that allows me to translate it into a drawing.",
    "This class enabled me to learn how to master basic drawing skills such as contour, shading, and many other useful and essential elements.",
    "This is a very general and broad art class that will not specialize in helping students grow as individuals and as artists.",
    "I improved substantially at drawing throughout this course. Professor Betbeze was was extremely patient and helped every individual, regardless of skill level. I also grew an appreciation for art that I did not have before. This class is a great comprehensive overview of drawing.",
    "I learned all about different techniques of drawing with different materials, how to draw different shapes like architecture and the human figure, as well as learning all about composition.",
    "I had never really worked with charcoal or collage before this class, so those were fun techniques to work on. I had also never really worked on larger paper, so this class helped me work more loosely and quickly instead of being laser-focused on details.",
    "I learned how to look at the world. How composition can affect a drawing, and how how you present something changes its meaning entirely. I also learned to work with different media."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are definitely in the instructors. They are wonderful. The weakness could be in that this course caters to people of all levels. It can be intimidating being in a classroom with students who draw at different levels.",
    "Strengths: very good structure Weaknesses: quite expensive in terms of materials",
    "No weaknesses. It's fun!",
    "Even though students work on their own in class, this is a seminar course and the instructor and TA are always available to help. All that is done in class is drawing, so it's very efficient despite time passing very quickly. I believe the course can be improved by emphasizing teaching technique in the course.",
    "A strength is that there is a lot of variety in the skills we hone and the lessons we pick up. A weakness is that I felt like I could've improved far more if I received more specific feedback on my work.",
    "Great course that provides an introduction to drawing. Sometimes I wish we had gotten more concrete advice on how to improve our skills (with stuff like proportions etc), but overall I still learned a ton.",
    "The strengths are the high amount of creativity encouraged, work with both wet and dry media, and several visits to nearby museums. Improvements could be a smaller class size.",
    "I think a major strength of the course was how it encouraged artistic development and insight through the various drawing assignments and exercises. We had little technical instruction, but all the drawings we did were designed to get us to try new things, see a subject in a different way, and come to realizations about composition, value, line, and all the decisions that go into making a drawing. I also liked how we started with still life drawings in charcoal and moved gradually on to more complicated scenes, patterns, abstraction, and figures while also gaining more freedom in terms of media. It allowed us to become exposed to many different subjects, styles, and media while moving from a more structured style of teaching toward a slightly more open\/free style. A weakness was definitely the length of the class-- 2 hours is sometimes just not enough! We would just be getting warmed up when we had to leave, and we did not have nearly enough time for critiques. Another negative aspect of the course was that I had to spend a lot of money on materials. I probably spent close to $200 over the course of the semester.",
    "You do a lot of drawing practice and improve your technique. It is also a very hands on approach to learning drawing techniques, and there is not a hugely academic focus on drawing.",
    "I think the course is great for the variety of ways it makes you work beyond your comfort zone. Another great strength is how it is truly accessible to people of any drawing background. For areas of improvement, I'd say that there could be just a bit more structure in concrete topics in drawing to work on, like a month concentrated on value, line, etc. I also would have liked more instruction on perspective. I loved the last portion of the course, figure drawing, and how we could work with actual human models.",
    "I absolutely loved the figure drawing unit because it was engaging and forced me to really take a step back and draw what I was seeing versus what I thought a body looked like. I think the biggest strength it the courses division into units that build upon one another. I think the weakness is that not all the assignments (homework) are as interesting\/engaging as others and it gives you kind of a limit in what you can and cannot draw."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Professor Anna and her assistant Charlotte are wonderful teachers.",
    "Yes, especially with Anna! She is very kind and approachable, and she really knows what she is talking about and how to effectively teach abstract art concepts",
    "Yes! Great humanities credit that is fun if you like to draw",
    "If you are interested in art at all, I would definitely recommend taking this course. Students are assigned one project a week for the entire semester, so it's definitely manageable in terms of workload. Students are also not graded on their level of skill but rather on their level of improvement over the course of the year, and, with the help of the instructors, TA, and other students, one is sure to improve in leaps and bounds over the semester.",
    "Absolutely! This class was not only engaging and fun but genuinely allowed us as students to grow from our starting place. It allowed me to practice my skills and learn new techniques that improved my creative thought.",
    "I would recommend it to people who want to draw on a regular basis and pick up some basic skills. The workload is light, and Anna is a nice woman. Not sure if I would recommend to a serious student though.",
    "Definitely would recommend if you want to learn about art, even if you have no art experiene.",
    "I would recommend Art 114 with Anna Betbeze (and TA Charlotte!) to anyone who is genuinely interested in drawing. It was my favorite course I've taken at Yale so far-- Anna and Charlotte were fantastic instructors, and it really reignited my passion for art as I gained confidence, skill, practice, and insight about drawing. I had not taken an art class since middle school before taking this course, and I was really timid about my drawing at first, and extremely slow, and now I feel like not only have my drawings improved immensely, but I also have gotten bolder and have gained more understanding of what makes a good drawing. We worked mostly with charcoal but the forays into collage, pencil, ink, and paint also allowed me to realize that I really enjoy painting, and I'm looking forward to taking a painting class (and probably a figure drawing class) in the future. The assignments and in-class exercises were superbly designed to allow for independent exploration and growth while subtly encouraging insight about technique, how to look at a subject, and artistic elements like composition and value. The feedback in class was also very constructive and individually tailored to push us to go outside our comfort zones. I would say that if you are considering taking the course, it is important to truly enjoy drawing and be willing to put in the time and work to improve. The assignments took 2-6 hours a week (mostly around 4), and class was 4 hours a week, which isn't excessive but definitely requires discipline and interest and a willingness to devote energy to the class and to your own artistic development.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students because it truly provides us with essential artistic knowledge and skills.",
    "Yes, I would reccomed this course to a student of any level of drawing capability who really wants to advance their skills and draw for long periods of time.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone - the workload is manageable, and it's a course where you get out what you put in. The class makes you think about artwork and your own work in a different way, and it's amazing to see the improvement by the end. I personally liked the looser style of the course, where there weren't exactly stringent requirements on line, value, composition, etc. Beyond that, it's just incredibly fun to see what kind of different things you can make, which the professor encourages with diverse assignments and topics.",
    "YES! I think it gives you completely different way of thinking and approaching what you are doing. It is a wonderful class with a lot of work but invaluable skills taught, even if you have no experience with art."
