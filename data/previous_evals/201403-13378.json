    "MB&B 300 covers A LOT of material and was definitely harder than I anticipated it being. As long as you keep up with the lectures (and do the readings where you feel it is necessary), it is manageable. The class is big, but the professors make it a fun environment. Most people take this class because they need to, for their major or for pre-med requirements, which shapes the class.",
    "Biochemstry is a class that has a lot of built-in support for the students that really makes the class accessible. As long as you pay attention in class, understand things as you go through them, and study decently for your exams and problem sets, you'll do just fine. This class is designed to cover a lot of complicated concepts but also does so in a very appropriate and supportive way. Both lecturers are good. The class has weekly problem sets, 2 quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "Terrible but you have to take it. Better than spring",
    "I would recommend this to anyone pre-med\/interested in the subject who is willing to put in the time and effort.",
    "If you're in this class, you're likely either premed or an MB&B major. Or both. As an MB&B major who was NOT premed, I found the subject material to be incredibly fascinating but the culture of the class to be terrible. Expect most people to only there so they can do better on the MCAT. Exams can be tricky because you literally need to memorize every detail on every slide, but the work you put in is the result you get out. Koelle and Simon are great. Section is probably not worth your time. Study with friends. May the force be with you.",
    "If you're looking for an extremely well-taught and organized class, definitely take this one. I'm a pre-health profession humanities major and found this science class to be the least frustrating in my four-year Yale career. Had a great time!",
    "A LOT of information to know, but you will gain a large amount in terms of your understanding of biology and biochemistry Take it if you like learning about the minute things your body does (like ion transporters)",
    "A pretty solid class",
    "I thought this was one of the most well-taught, organized, and fair science classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Simon and Professor Koelle are both great lecturers, and the solid organization of the class made it easy to focus on how cool biochemistry is. The exams are tough and require a lot of studying, but it's worth it! You'll leave feeling like you know a ton of biochem.",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of memorizing and spend a couple of late nights trying to understand concepts. The class demands that you have both a conceptual understanding of the principles that biochemical experiments have demonstrated, and the class demands that you know (memorize) certain facts to facilitate intellectual discussion of biochemistry. It's not easy, but if you like the material, it will be fun. It was fun for me!",
    "Take this semester's version if you need to as premed or MB&B. I hear it is much better taught than the MCDB version next semester..",
    "Pre-med class. If your pre-med you gotta take it, after orgo and physics this is fine. If your not required to take the class i'm sure your tuition can go to better use.",
    "Take this class, it is hard but totally worth it????!?!?!?!",
    "It's a standard biochemistry class. Lots of memorization, but nothing too ridiculous. The lectures are interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "A necessary biochemistry class, for any MCDB or MBB major. It is at times requires heavy memorization and a lot of work, but the work put in, is well worth it.",
    "If you pay attention in lecture you don't have to do the readings or go to section. The professors present the information well and make it very clear what you need to know.",
    "problem sets were super easy and short, then the tests were long and pretty difficult. It requires a lot of memorization and effort. Put in the time early.",
    "Better than I thought it would be, to be honest; the material was really interesting, and the professors are great. Obviously a lot of material, and the rest of the class is CRAZY smart so the curves are absolutely ridiculous, but if you're interested in biochemistry at all definitely take this class!",
    "Good course. I think if you're taking it though it's because you have to so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it to you or not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I spent a fair amount of time working on the material outside of class, but the assigned work is very manageable. It's a hard course, but extremely worthwhile. I learned so so much. Best science class I've taken at Yale so far. Prof. Simon and Prof. Koelle work well together and it's a very worthwhile semester. Be willing to work and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Challenging. Premed or major requirement.",
    "I didn't like this course. I loved the material, but the first two midterms were a bit ridiculous. I knew all the material but a few concepts, and those few questions slashed my grade down from the pre-med perfection I strive for.",
    "Oddly enough, one of my most enjoyable classes this semester. Though the teaching styles of Professor Koelle and Professor Simon are not analogous, both styles help to build a formimdable framework of biochemical knowledge. The course load was not overwhelming and quizzes (two) and midterms (two) were extremely fair. I appreciated how in the final weeks, I was able to see how all the concepts throughout the course tied together.",
    "Definitely a good course, and if you're interested in biology\/biochemistry then this class will probably be one of the most informative and useful classes you take at Yale. The focus on the basic units and systems of biology build a really strong foundation that you can use to explore more specific areas of biology afterward. Professors Koelle and Simon are both great lecturers, and the material really gives you an appreciation for how cool life is at a molecular level.",
    "The weekly homework is not hard, but the tests include a very large amount of information, so studying for them is very difficult.",
    "Work. And make sure you work hard.",
    "Biochem 300a is a great introductory biochemistry course that is a lot of memorization, but so worth the work. It is a rewarding class and you learn SO much. The exams are fair and the professors are great. Take it!",
    "This is a solid class. The tests are a fair amount of studying and work, but the p sets are easy and the material is interesting. It isn;t easy, but it isn't an insane amount of work. I would say take the class.",
    "You'll enjoy it a lot more if you keep up with the work.",
    "if you're taking this class, you're probably not taking it for fun (i did, actually. but i was a rare breed of bird). in any case, it's very well taught for a science class here at yale!",
    "Yes yes yes!! Do it cause you wanna and cause you have to!",
    "MB&B is a lot so make sure you're prepared. Lectures and material are interesting but there is so much information and you WILL be asked to recall minor details on exams. No matter how much you study it will not be enough so brace yourself.",
    "Despite the fear 'biochemistry' may bring, this class was surprisingly interesting. You get to learn a lot about metabolism. Both of the professors are fun and engaging. If you are interested in biochem, definitely take it. It is worth the work. Also, not as much of memorization as I would have thought.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about the chemical and physical bases of many important metabolic processes. The course offers insights into various serious human health conditions, such as diabetes and starvation. Like any other course related to biology, it is very memorization heavy, but you're probably a pre-med so you're used to this by now. Attend lecture, go to your discussion section, and study the material as it is presented (not right before the exam). The textbook was very helpful for me, as it gives in-depth explanations of concepts and processes that the lecture just glosses over. Make good use of Piazza and email the professor and\/or your TAs questions. The TAs will also meet one-on-one with you if you need extra help.",
    "A huge amount of material. Studying for the final exam was overwhelming. The professors are pretty good and helpful. Do not screw up on any of the midterms since each is 20% of your grade. The first one was a lot harder than the second or the final exam. The quizzes are a joke (rote memorization) and the homeworks are easy and relatively quick if you read through the lectures carefully.",
    "This class was honestly the best class that I have taken at Yale so far. I was so impressed by the enthusiasm of the two professors (Koelle and Simon), the organization of the course, the fairness of homework and exams, etc. I learned SO MUCH in this class, and half the time you didn't even realize you were learning things until they somehow just happened to be in your head--I attribute this to the level of preparation (and excellence) of the two professors.",
    "Take it!",
    "It is exactly what it sounds like, but very well taught. There's a lot of material to be learned, and studying for tests will seem overwhelming at times, but ultimately you come out of the class with a great deal more knowledge than before.",
    "Overall, MBB 300 is a challenging and rewarding course. The first half covers fundamentals of biophysics and biochemistry, such as thermodynamics, proteins structure and enzyme kinetics. The second (more challenging, more interesting) half dives into metabolism in great detail. I went into the second half unexcited by the topic (god, more ATP synthesis...) but by the end of the semester, came away with a deep appreciation for the beauty of the systems in our body that keep us alive, despite the stupid things we do to ourselves (not eating, not eating well, etc). This second half-treatment of metabolism was much more in depth than anything I had seen before. The second half also does a nice job of applying concepts from the first half. A few criticisms. Fact regurgitation questions on the exams should be eliminated. I do not mean questions in that section that actually have some thinking (From exam: \"Does the Bohr effect cause O2 to be released in the blood\" etc), but random number ones that are just absurd and insulting (\"How many angstroms is X or Y bond\"). Just a stupid question. Also, on the final exam, one of the questions in the supposedly synthesis\/critical thinking part of the exam was \"How many protons flow through ATP synthase per rotation and how many ATP are made\". Really? 6 points? That's just insulting to pedagogy, an embarrassingly lazy and offensive question. Also, the curve in this class should be less harsh, as it is currently 20% A, 20% A-, etc. It is a VERY strong group of students who take this class, and we should not be punished for that. Overall, an interesting and challenging class that made me appreciate the wonders of the body and evolution!",
    "Two great lecturers, material that is very well-organized, homework that doesn't take that long to complete, and very fair tests. I took this without taking much biology beyond a strong AP Bio course in high school, and I felt like this was totally doable, mostly because the course format was so well-thought-out. I'm keeping all the printed lecture slides (which we were given to annotate during class) and the study guides. The hardest part is just studying regularly - even though the tests are not that hard if you know the information (i.e. there are no \"tricks\" and the tests don't require you to spew in-depth information), learning the material is still time-consuming.",
    "The hard part about this class is the fact that it is biochem... I don't think this class could improve more, just have to accept the fact that biochem is not an easy topic in itself. But I think it is worth learning if you are interested in it!!",
    "Most of the material is interesting, but you will memorize a ton of random facts. The curves are rough and the exams are competitive (but not too challenging). Be prepared to spend a ton of time before every exam studying every single fact on the study guides. If you do that, you will be OK. Probably the most competitive course I have taken at yale.",
    "Activation barrier definition: the amount of energy necessary to get through Lectures 1-14 course. Once the transition state is reached and enough ATP and tears are burned, at some point, the enzyme called bigger-picture-ase kicks in, and the product is formed of a complete and thorough understanding of metabolism\/biochemistry. I'm still not sure how I'm going to do in this class, and it's hard to stop the competitive inhibitor of GPA. I only hope that at some point, y'all premeds can experience the revelation I did when studying for Lectures 22 and 23 on the final that wow, biochemistry is really beautiful, and it's taught really well by Professors Koelle and Simon. My best possible advice: STUDY BASICALLY EVERY SLIDE IN DETAIL. Only do the textbook readings insofar as you don't understand a concept on a slide; don't go out of your way to do them. Example: did all of the readings for the first midterm, got the average. Did zero readings for the second midterm, scored in the second quintile. You can get through this, and I hope you experience the epiphany that I did! It's really a great class and y'all premeds should definitely take it and try and enjoy it!",
    "It's a great class, but a really scary curve. Be prepared to work for your grade but you will also learn SO much. Definitely worth it!",
    "MBB 300 was awesome! I totally recommend it. The exams were vary fair and the material was extremely interesting. I learned a lot and enjoyed every minute of it. One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Biochemistry is a very hard class. It has a ton of interesting material, but you have to really be willing to work in order to memorize and comprehend the material. Don't leave anything till the last minute! Or else your grades in the class will suffer.",
    "You will end up memorizing facts you don't care about and that are pretty useless in the grand scheme of things just so that you can do well on the type of tests written. This was really annoying because the course itself was so interesting. So expect a lot of work, and expect a room full of crazed pre-meds trying to do nothing but get an A all the time. But the course does give you a solid foundation in biochem, and the profs were great (especially Matt Simon), so there's that.",
    "Take it. Most MCDB majors elect to take this over the one-semester version of biochemistry in the Spring, and for good reason-- it's much more well-taught.",
    "A informative course with a lot of material that will leave you with a better understanding of the subject, yes, but also a bitter feeling of resentment. The curve is wildly competitive, and if you don't spend the same amount of time studying (or rather, memorizing) the details from the slides as the other premeds, your performance will be well below par. The majority of points are based on how much you remember, since everyone in this class is smart enough to get the general concepts. You can either enjoy this class, or do well- one or the other.",
    "second half with koelle is a lot more straightforward, but simon's genuine excitement for science is enough to make one smile. be careful that you don't fall behind, because this is a lot of material and it moves quickly.",
    "Take it if you are a bio major, it sets up a great foundation for knowing about how the chemical processes of the body takes place.",
    "This biochemistry class was an artfully taught course. Everything was always so organized, and there was an abundance of sources for information\/practice: psets, section, practice tests, piazza. I thought that the exams were all very fair. Matt Simon taught the first half of the course and Michael Koelle taught the second half - they're both different but very good lecturers, and the switch was actually quite refreshing. I enjoyed the class and felt like I got a lot out of it. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "MBB 300 was by far my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. The course is very well taught; Professor Koelle and Professor Simon are both extremely knowledgeable and their lectures were very engaging. The TAs were the most dedicated group of graduate students that I have met in any of my classes so far-- it was clear that they really cared about their students and discussion sections. The class moves at a very quick pace and covers a lot of content. The workload was reasonable (weekly homework sets, two quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam), and the instructors were very transparent about cut off grades and exam averages. I thought the exams were just the right combination of factual regurgitation and critical thinking. The class atmosphere was very intense, and while the exams weren't difficult in and of themselves, it was challenging to score well relative to the high class averages. Overall, MBB 300 is a very high-quality, rewarding class. The class has solidified my decision to major in MB&B and has made me extremely excited to take more classes in the department and pursue research in biochemistry.",
    "Be prepared to memorize everything and deal with annoying premeds who have all the time in the world to study. The grading is tough. If you're looking for an elective, then this might not be the best for your grade, given all of the annoyances in the room.",
    "Probably a class you need to take, but the lecturers are really dynamic and it's one of the better taught science courses I've taken here.",
    "An okay class; Koelle's lectures got a bit boring towards the end. Homework takes like 2 hours or less a week and tests are basically half memorization and half long answers. Tons of material to memorize, but very doable. Only problem is the curve, which can be pretty rough - for one of our exams, 25% of the class scored a 95-100%.",
    "This is the best science class I've ever had (and I am a senior year premed physical science major, so I've taken a lot of science classes). I didn't open the textbook once and I did very well on the first exam, average on the second exam, and perfectly on the homeworks.",
    "MB&B 300 Biochemistry is an in depth look into two topics: biomolecules and metabolism. The day to day workload of Biochem is pretty low. The weekly problem sets are easy and almost guaranteed 9\/10 or 10\/10s. Lectures are big and it's pretty hard to stay engaged on some lectures that have dry material. Most of the work comes from studying for the two midterms and the final, which requires looking at a ton of slides and trying to understand them all, a fairly gargantuan task. The actual exams are moderately difficult, requiring some pure recall and some application of concepts. With the midterms and finals worth so much, everyone studies (way) too much, so be ready for some stiff competition. There is a lot of cool biology that I learned, though, when I look back on the semester. I really appreciate how complicated metabolism is now and have a better idea of what biochemists do. I would take the class if you have to, but there are less competitive classes where you learn equally as much that you should take otherwise.",
    "Good overview of biochemistry, though they do try to cram a lot of material into the semester and you might end up feeling that there's way too much detail on some topics and not nearly enough on others. Lecture material will go by fast, so make sure to go back and study the slides carefully before exams. Other than that, if you truly want to learn something in meaningful depth, definitely look for further coursework that actually focuses on pathways that aren't featured in this course's case studies.",
    "Yes!",
    "MB&B 300 is a pretty solid biochemistry course. You will learn a lot of information, and most importantly you will learn a lot of unifying principles in biochemistry. The take-home lessons from the course are very helpful, and will likely prove helpful in the future, as they help shape your thinking about biochemical phenomena. While these big picture ideas are really great, you will have to memorize a lot of facts to do well in this course, so basically just try to memorize everything from lecture for the exams. Also, the curve can be pretty tight, so try not to make careless mistakes. Overall, this course gave me a solid foundation of biochemistry, and Simon and Koelle were effective lecturers.",
    "Take it because you probably have to and you will enjoy it, though there wasn't much of a curve to speak of!",
    "Take this biochem course over the MCDB version. A lot of memorization. A lot of intense, studious people, so don't expect a curve.",
    "If you have to--take it. If you want to--take it. It is worth it for the knowledge.",
    "Although the format of the course is similar to 101-104 (lecture slides), you WILL walk away with a great understanding of regulatory mechanisms in biochemistry, as well as the structures and functions of basic biological molecules. Prof. Simons is a very excited lecturer, and Prof. Koelle is very clear. Midterms are not overly difficult, and homeworks are pretty manageable. Would recommend for those interested in biological or medical sciences.",
    "Good course, very interesting material. Tough to get a handle on all the material, and usually a tough curve due to the high performance of students, but rewarding in the end despite the countless hours needed to internalize all of the stuff you are responsible for on tests.",
    "AAAAAbsolutely. This course was fantastic, and definitely deepened my understanding of a ton of biochemical principles. If you are a scientist, take this course. If you aren't a scientist, take this course anyways. Be prepared though, it's a lot of memorizing, but as long as you're concentrated it's not bad at all.",
    "This class is extremely well taught, and if you're the type that enjoys going to lecture, you will have a blast. However, the exams are tough and you really have to 1) know your stuff REALLY well and 2) be able to coherently string together your thoughts to do well on the exams. However much you think you have to study, study more. Brutal but honest truth. It seems though that the 20% A\/20% A-....rule doesn't always apply, and that he will curve up depending on how well the class did. So keep that in mind. All in all, I'm glad I took the course.",
    "This was a really well-taught class. The material is really interesting. Great science class. But, it is VERY challenging. Be sure to study every week, regardless of the fact that there are not weekly quizzes.",
    "A lot of material to learn, bit very manageable and worthwhile. You will definitely learn something",
    "MB&B300 is a well taught class. The material is relatively interesting and useful, and the professors both lecture well and prepare good notes for you to use. Unfortunately, the pace in the class is blisteringeven though you may not have to read as many pages per night for biochem as you do for, say, physio or cell bio, the instructors expect you to become an expert on everything you cover. To prepare for exams, you will have to memorize literally every word on every lecture slide. As a result, this class is a much, much bigger time commitment than other upper-level bio classes that only expect you to know the general outline of mechanisms or their big picture concepts. The weekly problem sets are extremely easy and will take no more than an hour each week, but beware: make sure you keep up with all the material, or you will be destroyed by the multitude of premeds in the class on every exam.",
    "Take this course if it's being taught by Simon and Koelle. Their teaching styles are different, but they're both excellent professors. The material is very interesting and the workload and exams are reasonable.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. Frustrating and challenging, but one of the best courses I've taken at Yale and definitely the best biology course I've taken. You will be challenged by this course but it will be so worth it because you will find yourself exiting the course with a huge understanding of not only biochemistry, but also medicine and metabolism. I can now read biochem papers and be able to understand the background behind it. The material for this course is fascinating - in the first half of the course Prof. Simon covered intramolecular forces then amino acids, proteins, globular and fibrous proteins, proteomics, membranes and lipids and transporters. In the second half, we covered metabolism, led by Prof. Koelle. Both are great and clear lecturers and are approachable and knowledgeable. That being said, do not take this course unless you are willing and committed to put in ALL the time needed to review the lecture slides, have a textbook knowledge of them and master all the concepts they cover (most of which are not explicitly mentioned). You'll see what I mean should you choose tot take this course, but the key to success in this course is spending your time reviewing and mastering the material - constantly. Don't waste your time reading the textbook. I did all the readings in the first half of the course and when the first midterm came around I didn't do as well as I expected since they focused much more on testing concepts from the lecture slides. So study with friends and make sure you know the purpose of each slide. I recorded the lectures as well and found that listening tot hem again after lecture was very helpful, as they solidified my understanding and allowed me to see what the Professors stressed in lecture that I missed. The midterms and finals are difficult and will require more than one week of studying to do well on, but they are manageable as long as you are a devoted student. This shouldn't be too hard, since the material is fascinating, but be warned it is a lot. The HWs are somewhat similar to the exams. Other people said the HWs were easy and took them only half an hour or so, but I didn't agree - they can be difficult at times and require you to review the lecture materials beforehand. Section for this course is pointless - don't go, unless you have Ruben as a TA who is super helpful and makes it a point to review the most important concepts from the previous week. But even then, not necessary. Just focus on the slides, ask questions, work with others, and you'll get so much out of it. This is really one of those courses where you get out of it what you put in. it can be frustrating, but as a bio major and pre-med, I loved the material. Take the course!!",
    "This class is good, but hard. You have two very good professors, but the class is really really hard. Do not take the class if you don't have a pset group. And do not take the class if you're taking lots of other hard credits. The curve in this class is extremely unforgiving and the only thing harder than diamonds in this world are Biochem tests. It's not a bad class, just really hard, with a lot of work.",
    "The volume of material covered is substantial, but keep up with the readings and you'll do fine. The professors are also great lecturers, so that is a plus.",
    "Pretty good as far as biochemistry goes. Two midterms, two quizzes (that don't really count for anything), a final and weekly problem sets that were relatively easy. You spend most of the semester learning a bunch of seemingly random facts but it all does come together at the end, which is pretty satisfying.",
    "FIrst half is pretty basic and easy. Second half is pathways which can be harder on tests, but still pretty easy. 2 midterms + final and weekly psets. It's a pretty standard science class and isn't bad at all. Psets help you actually learn the stuff if you miss the lectures, which i stopped going to halfway through.",
    "This class could be very frustrating at times. The professors liked to emphasize that it wasn't a memorization-intensive course, but with the large amount of information that we needed to master, it was impossible not to just memorize most of it. It was very easy to fall behind in the class and hard to catch up. However, the one page summaries that accompanied each lecture were very helpful in narrowing down what topics to focus on the most.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have even a tiny interest in Biochemistry- it is absolutely fantastic! Even studying for the exams is enjoyable because you recall how interesting and fascinating the lectures were. As a senior science major, this is overall one of the best courses at Yale that I have taken to date.",
    "Lots of information, not always in the most organized fashion. Came away with a lot of knowledge.",
    "Go to every lecture! It will help you remember everything better and the class is a lot of memorization!",
    "Be prepared to work and be very meticulous with your answers on tests. Even if you know the answer, you have to write what the answer key wants, so be careful with wording.",
    "I would recommend MB&B 300 if you are interested in biology and chemistry.",
    "It's a good course and you will learn quite a bit regardless of your previous background and coursework. Simon and Koelle are good lecturers, however here is the lowdown of how to do well in the course. Lecture will not be too helpful as this course requires a lot of memorization. The book is not necessary at all to do well in the class either. Just take the lecture slides and go through them one by one and memorize every last detail on every slide. It requires time to do that, but I guarantee you will do well in the class by doing so. The best way is to re-write the lecture notes out yourself for it all to stick. The class is not that bad, but memorize, memorize, memorize.",
    "It's a good class. I thought it was interesting material and it was well taught. The class requires some memorization which is a bit of a bummer but it's definitely doable. I'd recommend this class to anyone who is interested in upper level bio or chem.",
    "Best biochem class ever! Take it over the mcdb kne for sure. The professors are great and the workload is very manageable",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Both Professor Simon and Koelle are great lecturers and bring a lot of passion and knowledge to their teaching. They do a great job emphasizing important concepts and presenting the subject matter in a really interesting, engaging way that made me appreciate how fascinating life at the molecular level is.",
    "MB&B 300 was a great class. I would definitely take it again. Tests are pretty specific though so make sure you give yourself enough time to study everything.",
    "Biochem is actually a great class. The amount of information that you learn is a little ridiculous and, as a result, the class isn't easy, but it is very fulfilling. The class is taught well and everything you learn has the potential to be fully understood. I really enjoyed the class. Take it.",
    "This class was amazing!! The material was fascinating and inspiring, and the professors were excellent. There was very little work (weekly p-sets), except around the midterms (lots of studying). To do well, I recommend keeping up with the material by reviewing the lectures within a few days of their delivery. The textbook ended up being useless for me, so I just did all the practice exams, reviewed the homework, and learned as much of the lecture info as possible. My advice to you is not to stress - focus on yourself, focus on learning, and enjoy!",
    "I very much enjoyed MB&B300! As a junior MB&B major, I was concerned I would not enjoy biochemistry as much as I thought I did when I declared the major - but, the course and the approaches to science truly exceeded my expectations. Both Prof. Simon and Prof. Koelle were extremely engaging, clear, and very fair, both in and out of lecture. There is A LOT of material, so definitely stay on top of it with flashcards and frequent reviewing of the lectures. It is doable, and the class is very rewarding.",
    "If you have to take a biochemistry class, I recommend this one for sure.",
    "It is very likely that if you are shopping this class you probably have to take it for pre-med or one of the biology majors. This class is pretty memory focused but the professors are both very intelligent so it could be a lot worse. At the same time, I felt that this class was missing something that could make it one of the best biology classes at Yale. I think a greater focus on concepts and trying to view the big picture of the biochemical pathways, as opposed to just being able to memorize what enzymes are used when and which hormones regulate what, would make this class not only a little more interesting, but also more useful in the future. In summary, I felt like this class reminded me of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team; it is headed by two superstars (Simon and Koelle) and is a very good class, but it seems like it just always falls short of being truly spectacular.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants a very firm grasp of biochemistry. However, I would say that the amount of work that has to go in for a good grade is much higher than a lot of people with demanding schedules can put in, so I would suggest going in with a strong commitment or low expectations of the grade.",
    "Biochemistry I was a great overview of the basic concepts of molecular structure in the body and principles of metabolism. The lectures were informative, relevant, and engaging and in terms of presentation of complex, newly emerging, scientific material this class made me excited about this material in a way no other class at Yale yet has. That said, it often felt like there weren't many resources for supplementing our learning outside of lectures. TAs were variable in availability, there weren't many practice-type questions at our disposal. The course is FULL of pre-meds and you often find yourself fighting for a good grade. Averages on tests were high and pre-meds were miserably committed to memorizing facts on factseffort that rewarded them on the dense, material-based tests. Then again, if you're taking this class, you might be one of those pre-meds...or you might have to take the class anyway. My advice: enjoy the class for what it is.",
    "Most students take this class because they have to and the curve is pretty bad, but this class is fantastic. Professors Simon and Koelle and great lecturers and keep you engaged with the class. The material is very interesting since it shows you how we basically live on a molecular level. There are a lot of details to memorize for the exams and people generally do very well on the exams (only 20% get an A). Overall, you learn many important concepts and also get to see how the material is applicable to medicine and biotechnology through the supplement lectures.",
    "MB&B 300 is a well taught science course and a solid overview of Biochem. The grading was fair and the profs + TAs were very helpful. I recommend this course to whomever needs it for a requirement.",
    "A general introduction to principles in biochemistry and metabolism in the body. Definitely one of the better science lectures I've had at Yale; the professors are intelligent and fun, and all the important material is covered in lecture, so no surprises. A fairly challenging course, but manageable if you spend some time studying.",
    "MB&B is a super interesting introduction (?) to biochemistry. There are lots of traces of orgo in the material, except without the mechanistic specificities, which makes learning about pathways like glycolysis and the citric acid cycle a lot more fun. If you're taking this class you probably have to, but the horrible rumors you might have heard about it might be true in a different way than you expect -- the class the super cool, and the exams are mostly straightforward, but watch out for the specificity of your answers and the pre-med curve. Otherwise, the class is split into homework assignments every week, two midterms, two easy quizzes, an a final; section is not mandatory, and they give you a page summary of every lecture with most of the info you need to know for the exams. Overall, not as bad as you might think, as long as you put in the work to really know the material before the tests.",
    "It's a requirement for MCDB; if you're a premed but not an MCDB I would still recommend this course. Otherwise, probably not (because you wouldn't need the information for any reason).",
    "A great class! I wasn't that excited coming into this class but it was a really great experience. Everything is very organized which I appreciate. Both professors were very clear, enthusiastic, and presented material in an interesting way that made me more engaged. I am an MCDB junior and this is probably my favorite science class I've taken so far. Fair grading too.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learnt the principles of biochemistry within a larger framework of thought. I would recommend this class to other students with a strong interest in biology and chemistry, but be mindful that this is not a math heavy class and much of the math is ignored.",
    "Recommend. You learn a lot...well taught. Koelle is a great lecturer. I also really liked Lehninger...easy read. Sometimes too much in detail and in that case, you can go back to the lecture slides to see what the professors want you to understand.",
    "A wonderful class teaching many basic skills of biochemistry.",
    "It is a well taught, organized class, with great professors, and the biggest difficulty is organizing yourself, because it is a lot of material to know. As the professors say, you really do need to keep up with the material and review it somehow every week, so that exam time isn't just trying to memorize everything.",
    "This was a well taught course. I appreciated the study guides to direct the learning and thought the professors were effective in communicating he material. I did think that the promise of supplements that were simply interesting should have been kept a bit better. There were lectures that felt like they could have used better timing and felt rushed towards the end.",
    "A comprehensive course that emphasizes the mechanisms of protein folding, membrane composition, and the integration\/regulation of the metabolic pathways. I had to take the class so if you have to take it, take it. I wouldn't recommend this as a \"fun class\". It's really not. It's designed entirely for biology, biochem, and pre-meds or any combination thereof. Simon and Koelle are alright lectures. There is an incredible amount of information that you have to know. Memorize everything on every slide - it's hard to do obviously but try because it'l help you on the final. Memorize as much as you can and then be sure you know how to apply the info. Put in a decent amount of work between lectures in order to understand stuff.",
    "MB&B 300 is a good introduction into topics in biochemistry. You learn about amino acids and metabolism. The tests are very heavy on memorization. The textbook is good.",
    "If you have to take biochem, take this one! The professors are awesome and the course is really well-organized. Quite challenging, but you learn a lot.",
    "Definitely take this course! The material is difficult and there is a lot of it, but the class is definitely manageable. The lectures are very long, but everything is pretty clear on the slides. There were also study guides provided this year and that helped a lot with studying. You know exactly how the exams are going to be by doing the HWs and practice exams, so definitely take the class!",
    "You're taking it if you have to , but it's a good course",
    "This is a great class. I would recommend it. Make sure you study the lectures before and after. I did not. And I had trouble in the end studying for the exams. I regret it. I didn't have the time. But, if you try hard enough make the time. Study the lectures after the lecture at least. Reading takes too much time. And in the end, who has time for reading? Also, memorize. You will need to memorize. I suggest you go through every lecture and do a study sheet or two covering every lecture so you have a large study guide for part 1 and part 2 of the course. Memorize this study guide. Have your friends do study guides and read each others guides. Do it by hand, not by computer. Good luck.",
    "This class is easier than you would expect. Be prepared for a lot of memorization, but it's not that bad.",
    "A great class to learn more about the underlying principles of the fundamental processes of life.",
    "Tons of info. Stay up on studying.",
    "MB&B 300 is required for the MB&B and MCDB majors, and is also on the new MCATs so if you have to take it, I recommend taking this specific course. It is well-taught and well-organized.",
    "I would recommend MB&B 300. The course is well taught, the material is well-documented in the slides, and the textbook is not necessary but enriching. It's a requirement for medical school and a few majors and it delivers all that it promises. Keep up with the material, form a study group, and go to section. The TA's can be very helpful."
