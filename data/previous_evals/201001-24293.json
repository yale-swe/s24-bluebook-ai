    "Chinese 159 is a wonderful window into the world of modern Chinese issues -- it will give you an apt introduction to some of the most critical, but also long-lasting issues. In addition, since the course is taught with materials in traditional characters, you will also pick up the ability to read traditional. Although this may be challenging at first, it is rewarding to be able to expand the base of your reading ability.",
    "Chinese 159 is great for some people: you will only get out what you put in. Definitely better than the first semester of the sequence. Better texts (more of a political \/ economics focus instead of fiction), more incredible stories from Su Wei, and you'll get experience in traditional characters. It isn't for everyone, but I liked it.",
    "the readings are difficult but the class isn't hard. you will learn a lot about chinese politics and culture and how to read traditional characters, but your language skills will not improve that much."
