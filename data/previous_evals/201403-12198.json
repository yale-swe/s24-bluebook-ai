    "a great introduction to philosophy and writing about\/analyzing philosophical arguments",
    "Yes I would.",
    "An engaging, fun, enlightening course. You really get to engage the texts and think critically about what these great philosophers were thinking and why. It can't be overstated that MDR is incredible, absolutely take this class with him if at all possible.",
    "It was a great intro to philosophy although it sometimes felt like a crash course, considering the amount of reading we packed into one short semester.",
    "Just DS Philosophy. From Socrates to Aquinas.",
    "It is a lot of work, but classroom discussions are very interesting.",
    "The first semester of DS philosophy will inform me for the rest of my life.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy to another student. I feel like I acquired a solid understanding of the philosophers studied in this course.",
    "Yes. Just do it. no regrets.",
    "All in all, Fall DS philosophy is a good introduction to philosophy as a subject and a range of ancient to medieval Mediterranean thinkers. The focus is on breaking down the arguments, with minor attention to possible objections or memorizing some principles of schools of thought.------------------- The greatest shock to many comes from the essays. The aim is to clarify the given argument, with almost mathematical simplicity. It is not about big themes linking to real life or beautiful language. Also note the difference in readings. They are dense. I slowed down to understand the reasoning, rather than take their statements as introductions to some schools of thought. Thus, The trap for learning is that you can survive without reading and thinking through the material. The lectures and sections should be clear enough for the outlines of the arguments, and you are not tested on the details. ----------------------------- Professor Della Rocca, if you have the luck, is fantastic. He maintained both a friendly atmosphere and a good pace in going through the arguments. He had a great control over the direction of the discussions: rather than lecturing or letting the class loose, he guided us to ponder and clarify key questions in the text or raise possible objections. He also joined us to several section lunches and devoted office hours whenever we needed them.",
    "I love Philosophy as a subject, and with Della Rocca teaching, it becomes phenomenal.",
    "Lots of reading, lots of papers--it's DS."
