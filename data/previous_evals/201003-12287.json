   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have to for the major, otherwise just read the texts on your own if you're that interested in the subject matter. The amount of reading, arbitrary grading (don't even think about proposing viewpoints contrary to Victor's), amount of work (two 8-10 page papers, 3 exams, and an in-class presentation), and tedious lectures do not make this class worth it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another person because it is a very shallow experience with the works rather than an in depth analysis. Students only read excerpts from each of the works rather than the entire piece.",
    "This course might be difficult for those without at least some prior background in the Classics, as it is a requirement for the Classics major.",
    "Intro to Greek Lit as taught by Professor Bers is a poorly instructed mess of a seminar.The assigned readings are good, pulling from the wonderful ancient Greek literary tradition and including several works that one probably would not have already read in high school, Directed Studies, or random Humanities classes. I would highly recommend downloading his syllabus and reading the books on your own time, possibly over the summer.I would not, however, recommend taking this course with Victor Bers. The two primary components of Prof Bers' teaching style are as follows:1) A question tangentially related to an assigned reading (not necessarily the one assigned for that class or one that been assigned yet) in the form \"So, when _something happens_, is it _wrong answer_ or something else?\" The answer is always \"something else.\" That something else is never revealed, nor does Bers ever compel the class to find out.2) Awkward silences following Bers's indecipherable jokes.If you are a Classical Civ major and have to take this class to graduate, consider waiting until next year, when the course might be offered by someone more adept. (Kirk Freudenburg sometimes teaches it, and, having taken his Intro to Latin Lit course, I suspect he does a much better job.)",
    "Yes if you like Geeks myths and plays.",
    "I would not recommend this class for anyone who is not required to take it by their major. It is definitely accessible to anyone, but it just does not offer anything better than other classes at Yale that teach the same materials.",
    "Take this course if you have to. You read a lot of amazing books, but if you are a classics major you've probably encountered a majority of the readings before.",
    "Classics majors - take this class early in your academic career, and don't save it until senior year. Non-classics majors, this class is probably not for you.",
    "This class was one of my first ventures into Greek Lit, and I found it to be taught at an appropriate level, though many people in the class have been studying these texts in the original for years. Professor Bers was exceedingly helpful and a good laugh to listen to."
