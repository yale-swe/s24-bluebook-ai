   "comments": [
    "I won't do the course justice here, but this class dares us to think about the fundamental questions that we must address: what is the good life? what's a life worth living? Beyond being exposed to some rich traditions of thought, an open, friendly seminar format encouraged us to ask tough questions and draw upon the incredible talent in the classroom.",
    "This class taught me about myself, Confucianism, Christianity, along with many other modern thinkers. This class opened my eyes to new approaches to my life and the world around me, and made me really consider my assumptions and my approach to life.",
    "I think this class got me to think about where I come from and how the sum of my experiences shape each and every answer that I have. This opened my eyes to the world of different perspectives that exist and helped me understand others better.",
    "The confidence to speak in a seminar-style class & the ability to read academia more efficiently than before",
    "The central question in this course is: \"What is a Life Worth Living\". The knowledge one gains from tackling this question includes reading Confucianism, Christianity and a series of thinkers in modernity. The skills one gains includes reading at the college level and analysing readings for the humanities. The insights one gains are plentiful: core among them are the goals you will set yourself for your 4 years at Yale, and what kind of person you want to become.",
    "I learned how to better discuss complex ideas in an organized setting as well as improved my reading of difficult texts.",
    "During this class, I learned how to analyze text and bring that analyzation to class discussion. I also pushed the limits of my own ability to self reflect, which was a priceless experience.",
    "I am so glad I took Education and Life Worth Living as a first semester freshman. This course made me think deeply about what an education is truly for, what I want out of my Yale education and whether a Yale education (or any college education) is even necessary. The most challenging and though provoking aspect of this course was definitely the final paper (the prompt was to write about the person you want to become and how your education will help you become that person). Anyone would find that task daunting, let alone a college freshman, and although I'm sure no one is completely satisfied with their answer, the paper is a great starting point.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes of the semester. It was refreshing to be able to sit and discuss about different traditions and their proposed flourishing lives. I really enjoyed the class because it was so meaningful to life and allows one to question their own beliefs about the kind of life they want to lead. Every discussion tied back to how we can shape our college education to enable us to become the kind of people we want to become. Taking this class opened my mind to different cultures and the possibilities of living life differently than what is commonly presented by society. This class unlike many others was less about the grade or learning the material and more about figuring what we should value in life as human beings.",
    "Read many insightful readings about life and education, talked about what makes a life worth living in class with discussions led by professors. Knowledge of educational theory and also a bit of philosophy was added, and writing was improved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is really well put together in terms of the readings - I think the sequence of content we explored made a lot of sense. My one negative is pretty small: we didn't have many grades. For most upper-level Yale classes, that's probably fine, but this is a freshman seminar, so we're all new to this. It's disconcerting to have only written two (very short) papers by the time we're writing our final papers. It's not a big deal, but I definitely would have appreciated a little more feedback on my writing overall. Maybe, next time, Matt and Ryan would consider assigning a few reading responses or something.",
    "I loved this class! Strengths- mind opening, true camaraderie around the seminar table, thoughtful professors who are truly invested in their students. Weaknesses-not really weaknesses, but could be improved with more open ended first essay prompts.",
    "Road maps for where class discussions of the day should go could help the students who decline to speak still follow along. Strengths are most definitely the professors and their guidance.",
    "Strengths: 1. Interesting and pertinent core question\/thesis, that is absolutely important to tackle as a Freshman 2. Instructors were deeply engaged and available 3. Approach from different angles (Eastern tradition, Western tradition, modernity) Weaknesses 1. Instructors could offer more guidance during class discussions - tends to go off track sometimes 2. More freshman advice could be given since this is a Freshman seminar: how to write\/read\/discuss 3. Last third of class on modernity was a bit disjointed (but inherently so given modernity) - can link modern thinkers together better, at least in more comparative study",
    "I think the class was strong in discussion. I thought that there was engaging discussion from a diverse group that worked well together. the professors did a good job facilitating and fostering this discussion. I was disappointed in the assignments for this class. The final paper was great but the first two were so dry compared to the discussions that were being held in class. It really bummed me out having to write about a section of the discussion that I thought was more of a formality in understanding the subject rather than digging deeper on the topic like we would later in the class.",
    "The strength of this course was the class discussions, which always pushed me to think outside the box and examine what a life worth living truly is. The weakness of this course was that sometimes the class discussions only took place between a few students and the teachers, and some students, including myself, sometimes felt a little lost.",
    "Strengths: The readings are all super interesting (although they do get harder as the class progresses) The nature of this course creates a really tight knit group of people and I am sure I will remain friends with many of them I loved getting to read other people's final papers and the workshopping process was very helpful Weaknesses: As someone who struggles to participate in seminar discussions, I think it would have been helpful if the discussions had more structure (or if we occasionally split into smaller groups).",
    "They need to help explain what is going on in some of the readings. My classmates and I felt too often that we were not being taught the material, but told to figure it out.",
    "Because this class was given as a seminar and the discussions were so meaningful and profound, you get to know your classmates and your professors really well. The class required sharing and questioning personal experiences and beliefs and was unlike any class I have ever taken before. The setting facilitated profound discussions that sometimes went astray from the topic but were significant to what was affecting our present lives. In fact, I think the class would really benefit if these stray topics could be explored even further because they usually come from applying these traditions or concept to our present lives.",
    "Strengths: very interesting and opened my eyes to many perspectives and ideas I had never thought of before. Weaknesses: occasionally the readings were too confusing without further clarification."

   "comments": [
    "Every Yale student should take either Education and the Life Worth Living or the upper-level Live Worth Living course. Period.",
    "If you get into this class and don't take it, you are actively deciding not to live a Life Worth Living.",
    "Yes, I think this class is one that can be helpful to all in just the discussions that take place and how they make you think about why you think the way that you do. The professors and your peers will not be shy to call you out on your biases and that's something very interesting.",
    "Yes I would. It was a good class.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think it is an interesting and healthy class to take your first semester of college, but I would remind them that they will only get out what they put in. If they barely do the readings and barely speak in class, it will seem very boring and pointless. If they participate, however, I think the student can learn a lot about him or herself.",
    "Absolutely. Course Material As a Freshman coming into Yale, the most important task is figuring out what you want for yourself after your 4 years. This course will do just that, and more. It will challenge you to think about what kind of life you want to lead, and challenge you to think about how to bring yourself down that path in life. The class is part of the Life Worth Living Program, which has another class HUMS 411 that focuses less on the education side of things and more on the life worth living side of things. That class is one of the most popular classes at Yale, and this is likely to be too. Instructors Matt and Ryan are wonderful instructors. They know what they are talking about, and when they themselves cannot know the answer (as would happen with epistemological and existential questions). One of them will be assigned as your supervisor for closer work; make sure you go for office hours. That's where you can discuss your thoughts about your personal life and your goals for yourself. Community Course is quite close after the term. Ryan and Matt host two house parties at their respective houses at the start and end of term.",
    "I think that this class raised great discussion that is fundamental to any college student that is beginning their higher education.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to an incoming freshmen. This could be one of the most important classes for freshmen, because it makes you decide what you want your next four years to be like.",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this course if they get the chance. In fact, I told my mom about this course and she said she wished something like this was available to her when she was in college because she regrets the choices she made about her college education and is now unhappy with her career. (not that ELWL will solve all your problems. But it will make you think, which is so important). ELWL was probably my favorite course as a first semester freshman.",
    "No, because it was way too hard to understand course material and no one bothered to help explain any of it.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this class to any student whether one is set on a path they want to take in their college years and beyond or whether one is still trying to figure out what they want, this class could be helpful in shining a light on the worldview that they take for granted, perhaps even challenging it by presenting alternative views on life. It is a class that will take one's mind away from the daily hustle and stress of school, family, etc.. and ask questions about what a human being is and what a flourishing life looks like.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course has made me reconsider what I am interested in, it had a great faculty to student ratio, and was very personal. I really enjoyed it."
