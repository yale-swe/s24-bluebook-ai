   "comments": [
    "An intensive look at musical set theory applied to ear training in early twentieth century music (focusing on Bartok, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg). I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in these composers as well as in refining their ears\/listening process. A must take.",
    "Intense study and application of Prof. Friedmann's own system of solfege and Allan Forte's tone set classification system up through tetrachords. By the end of the semester, you are expected to know all 12 trichord types and 29 tetrachord types and their inversions, as well as several melody excerpts from the works of Bartok, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg. I would highly recommend this course to anyone up for the challenge, provided that they are interested particularly in the music of the early 20th centuryyou will definitely come away with the aural foundation for a much deeper understanding of post-tonal music!",
    "This class is basically an implementation of Friedmann's approach to \"atonal\" music, that is, structuring one's listening and analysis around sets of notes. It's a true ear training, sight singing, etc. class, so the work is more day-to-day practice than anything else. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who's interested in sharpening their ear and musicianship skills--both for tonal and atonal music. A great class both for one's understanding of (atonal) music theory and for one's application of it in playing music."
