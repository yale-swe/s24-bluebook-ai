    "Vital to anyone interested in exoplanets",
    "You learn about the techniques to detect exoplanets, and about models of planet formation and evolution. Problem sets typical involve reading papers and doing calculations\/programming, not doing mathematical derivations. Several homeworks and the final project involve working with data, so you gain proficiency in programming and get a taste of what doing exoplanet science is like."
