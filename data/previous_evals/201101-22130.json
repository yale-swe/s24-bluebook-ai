   "comments": [
    "Excellent class. Bushkovitch is excellent at leading a seminar, and the course material itself is actually really interesting, even though it is about an unusual part of the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone",
    "I enjoyed this class - interesting readings and classroom discussion.",
    "Definitely take this seminar. The course material seems obscure at first, but it's actually extremely interesting. Sometimes the Russians and the people of the Eurasian steppe did ridiculous things and Bushkovitch tells it as it is. When dealing with Mongols, Kazakhs, and, of course, Bashkirs, be prepared for the bizarre. Buskovitch a great professor - hilarious, un-intimidating and, above all, extremely knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Russia and the Eurasian Steppe is an excellent class that I would recommend to anyone interested in Westernization, modernity, Imperialism, Islam, or who just plain likes reading about Mongol warfare. The class covers about a thousand years of history in detail that is difficult to find even in other Junior history seminars, and Professor Bushkovitch always manages to undermine some of your fundamental assumptions about statecraft, religion, and historiography. The reading list is great, featuring both classical primary source texts including the Koran and Tolstoy, as well as the requisite secondary literature. The workload is not a breeze though: be careful what you're getting into with the research paper!",
    "Yes! This course is offers a unique perspective on a long period of history that is overlooked by most of Yale's curriculum. Professor Bushkovitch is an excellent professor who seems to prefer that students take charge of their own education for the sake of learning to self-educate, but is willing to step in and provide guidance to those who ask."
