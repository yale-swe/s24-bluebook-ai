   "comments": [
    "It's a very approachable, enjoyable, and interesting class that contains a lot of material that students don't otherwise often have the opportunity to take classes in. The class tends to be more of an overview than deep depth into a particular subject given the number of imaging modalities that they have to cover, but they give a substantial enough overview that an engineer (even who does not continue to do research in imaging) will be able to properly understand and communicate ideas, needs and techniques related to imaging studies.I would recommend it, unless a student cannot visualize math very well, in which case they may very quickly feel lost into the meaning of the material (as many students in the class admitted).",
    "No, I would not recommend this class unless you are interested in Biomedical imaging or sensing research. I did not have much interest in those fields, so I could not enjoy much. The class materials would feel little hard if you do not have any background on Bioimaging.",
    "should be taken as early as possible. but prepare for a huge time commitment.",
    "I would recommend the course if a more clear and engaging curriculum is developed. The course topic can be very exciting.",
    "Yes I think it is very necessary to take a class like this to prepare for my graduate work. I would highly recommend this to another student.",
    "Well certainly not for people in my lab as we do not do imaging at all. For everybody doing imaging this should be compulsory!!!",
    "Not unless it was required. Put simply, there are better classes to take.",
    "I would not recommend it, unless the student is really into imaging. It had too much detail on MRI and NMR and not enough on other biosensing techniques that would be more useful for students research. For example, discussion of molecular beacons and other sensors would be more helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class only if the person were doing research in PET, MRI, and MRS. It is a great class for students hoping to do research in those areas, but it feels lacking for students in other biomedical engineering fields.",
    "A course where you learn the details of MRI&PET bioimaging, with a hint of biosensing mixed in at the end.I would recommend this course to other bio-related students, but only for physical scientists who plan to use MRI or PET in their research.",
    "It was a nice, light summary of current imaging and biosensing techniques. Likely some of it will be review for any given student. I would still recommend it, as it is doubtful that any student will be expert enough at everything presented that all of it will be review.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was an interesting course",
    "Overview of different applications and types of biomedical imaging."

   "comments": [
    "extremely helpful and I think it is very necessary to take a class like this.",
    "I understand fluorescence and fret a bit better now, but I honestly don't even remember much about MRI and NMR (the focus of the course). I probably won't use much from this course in the future.",
    "The portion of the course on fluorescence imaging was extremely relevant to my research since we use this technique, and I was able to apply what I learned in the course to try a new method of imaging my structures of interest in my research.While the bioimaging portion of the course was not directly relevant, it enhanced my biomedical background that should be useful in my research going forward.",
    "Having a broad understanding of how one may non-invasively measure\/detect \"things\" in the body is important for any biomedical engineer, and this course provided that. I don't know that it will contribute directly to my dissertation, but it has certainly helped me navigate my field better.",
    "Broaden my understanding of different imaging techniques and their possible uses and applications in my own work."
