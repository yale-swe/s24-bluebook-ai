    "I learned a little bit of linear algebra and multivariable calculus by taking this course. I also learned how to think about math in a different way that helped to understand it more.",
    "It was taught in a very distinct manner which was really effective - he made us first attempt problems prior to explaining the concept in hand. This stretched us and gave us the opportunity to think about the question at a deeper level.",
    "This course helped me grasp a basic fundamental understanding of multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I learned some important concepts that will help me in my future economics courses. Also, I now understand matrices and linear equations well, along with how they both can interact with each other."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the emphasis on collaboration and discovery in the class, especially for the first 1\/3 -1\/2 of the class, however after that it became a bit more difficult to understand the material because many people were unfamiliar with the concepts. This created an environment where often, much of the material was not covered in class and it was became more common for problems\/concepts we may have not had a chance to get to in class would appear on problem sets. It may be more fruitful to discuss the reasoning, practice, and tie it back to what the day's lesson will be on at the beginning of classes especially later in the semester before commencing group work.",
    "This course is different from other math classes because it is a small class, and focuses heavily on group work. It is not very lecture-y. However, there is a little bit too much emphasis on group learning, and this is not beneficial when no one in the class understands the material. It would be more helpful if more teacher input was involved during class.",
    "The strength is that you get worksheets at the beginning of each class and the teacher goes at a really great pace. The weakness is that we do not complete the worksheets in class and answers to them are not posted.",
    "Professor Bookman really cares about the learning process and always makes his students think critically instead of just lecturing. I didn't like this at first, but I soon saw the benefits of this method. In terms of course content, supplementary readings in various textbooks are needed to fully understand the material, and there are very few economic applications made in class, so you would have to practice on your own to get the feeling that you're taking an econ math class.",
    "The very interactive teaching style had its pros and cons. On the positive side, it made for engaging classes, where we could explore and discover ideas on our own and use them in practice directly. This often helped my learning. On the other hand, if I wasn't following immediately, it sometimes happened that I'd feel lost during most of the class, leaving more confused than enlightened. Having assigned readings beforehand, or video lectures, or some other way of getting a bit prepared before launching into exercises would help. I also thought that sometimes we would spend a bit too much time on the exercises, so that the teacher rushed through the theory at the end, in a way that I didn't always follow. I thought the textbooks were rather poor, and would have preferred some other textbook.",
    "This course had many advantages over other 100-level math courses at Yale. For one, the small class size was very nice. It was great to be able to directly talk with Professor Bookman during class and to be able to work with classmates frequently. Bookman did a great job making sure that everyone was actively thinking about the material in class--you wouldn't be able to \"zone out\". Weekly vocab quizzes also kept you on top of the material at all times. A weakness would be the fact that, sometimes, the class would move on to new material when certain groups (that worked together thinking about the concept) didn't fully understand it yet."

    "If you don't need math for your major, but are interested in the subject I would recommend this course. However, this class will not give you a strong enough background at all in either linear algebra or multivariable calculus; you only get a taste of each, so I would not recommend taking it as a substitute for a class like Math 120. I don't really feel like I have learned enough of multivariable calculus or linear algebra at all. However, this class is easier than Math 120, and is much fairer in terms of grading. The professor is also very approachable, and the class environment is very suitable for learning.",
    "It is taught in a manner which encourages you to think out of the box which is a great skill to have.",
    "Yes, it covers a breadth of linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and Professor Bookman is engaging and responsive.",
    "Yes. This course is a great way to develop a basic understanding of both multivariable calculus and linear algebra. If you don't want to take 120, this class is a great substitute. The small class size allows you to interact frequently with the processor and with your classmates. If you're planning on taking Intermediate Micro, this course teaches you some concepts that you will use extensively. Overall, I enjoyed it as my first math course at Yale."
