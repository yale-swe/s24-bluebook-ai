   "comments": [
    "Pretty straightforward class. A little less work than L1, but still expect to put in the daily time for homework\/class preparation.",
    "Time consuming but you learn a lot of vocab. You'll settle into a routine. Keep chugging on, the teachers are wonderful.",
    "Yes if you want to continue your Chinese studies. If you're coming back from a summer program in China don't expect to keep learning at the same pace. Basically your comprehension will get better but personally my speaking level declined from when I was in China.",
    "I would advise another student to be absolutely sure of their interest in Chinese before taking the class. It is certainly not a walk in the park and demands a lot of time and attention. It is very well taught so if Chinese is something you wish to pursue, it is worth it.",
    "Good continuation of advanced Chinese, especially coming off of Light. Work is manageable and predictable. Focus on idiomatic language that is particularly helpful. Good solid course.",
    "It is your typical Chinese class, with different texts from which you are supposed to memorized characters and vocabulary and weekly listening exercises done at home over the weekend, followed by an in-class dictation on Mondays. The assignments are not particularly engaging, and the tests require some degree of memorization, which I don't find very compelling. It is a good class for keeping up with Chinese, but it can be very intensive sometimes (especially as we meet everyday and are required to a write a 600-character composition every two weeks), and it's probably not one of the most interesting classes you are going to be taking at Yale.",
    "Here is my word of advice to a returning light fellow: the class will not be like your summer program. There will be a slim amount of speaking practice, so don't expect to see much improvement on this area. Leaving this aside, CHNS 150 is a solid class. You will still learn lots of grammar and you will see a great improvement on your writing skills. Professors are very kind. If you happen to be free during their office hours, go! they are a great fun to talk to. (and then you can practice more Speaking!)If you want to keep improving on your Chinese, I guess there is not other choice but take this class."
