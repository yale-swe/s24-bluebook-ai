    "In the first semester of preparation for a lengthy thesis project, I learned about selecting a topic, researching, and organizing a long paper.",
    "I learned how to do primary research. I even got a fellowship to visit the National Archives, which was so much fun and so educational for me.",
    "Doing research on my own for a long paper (40 pages) has been a new experience, but grateful to have had help from my adviser and Yale librarians. Still working on organizing all of the sources\/notes I have gathered for next semester.",
    "I appreciated being able to have a taste of what graduate studies in history would entail. I think I became a better historian by meeting with my advisor one-on-one and taking responsibility for my project.",
    "Long term independent research and study",
    "I have learned to conduct my own own research."

   "comments": [
    "The course is really built around you and your thesis advisor, which is really good for forming that relationship and getting feedback on your process. As there was only one meeting as an entire group, however, it felt like this class was put on a back burner and it was not very cohesive.",
    "One main weakness: I wish there was a formal process to choose advisors in the spring (or at least that there was more information then about the project). This is when History does it, so if you want an advisor from the History department, then it's probably too late by the fall. Strengths: The project is well-organized, and I like the flexibility (ability to do creative projects, have non-HSHM advisors etc.)",
    "I thought there was a lot of help at each stage of the project thus far as to what I need to have done. I wish there were a few example papers from previous students in the major to give me a better idea moving forward on how to write a 40+ page thesis.",
    "The level of independence is pretty frightening and so dependent on having a responsive thesis adviser.",
    "I think the current schedule\/structure for the yearlong thesis is pretty good. It really helped pushed me to stay on track with the different deadlines for ideas\/sources\/outlines.",
    "Strengths - meet with an advisor regularly and receive personal feedback, moral\/emotional support (this was the most valuable part of the class. I felt so down-trodden by my project, and my advisor was very good about giving me a pep talk every week), I learned that I do not have the temperament nor intrinsic motivation to pursue graduation studies in the humanities Weaknesses - I would have liked to have the opportunity to interact with other HSHM majors, perhaps through bi-weekly meetings. I think it would have prevented me from feeling so burnt out by my project.",
    "Having rough deadlines is very helpful for this course, however, the strictness with which these deadlines are enforced depends on your advisor. It was nice that my advisor was not strict about deadlines, but at the same time, I would have appreciated a bit more structure. Relatedly, the degree of feedback you receive is also highly dependent on advisor. I do not think that this needs to be changed, but should just be made clear to students beforehand so that they can consider that when selecting an advisor.",
    "I wish there was more time at the beginning of school year to pin down topics and an advisor."

   "comments": [
    "This class is the reason why I chose to declare an HSHM double- major (over just taking a variety of history and HSHM electives). It was invaluable to have been able to develop a one-on-one relationship with a faculty member and receive regular feedback on my writing. My biggest piece of advice is to figure out what type of learner you are and what kind of mentorship you are looking for. Then, carefully seek out a faculty adviser who matches that. Your advisor will make all the difference. For instance, I discovered over the course of the semester that I am not intrinsically motivated and need someone to push me toward regular deadlines.",
    "This isn't really a course you can choose to take. However, I would say that if you are an HSHM major, beware that this course is not structured and deadlines are not enforced, so you need to be self-motivated and stay on track for yourself.",
    "Yes great way to research something that interests you",
    "Yes, conducting your own research is a hallmark of yale education."
