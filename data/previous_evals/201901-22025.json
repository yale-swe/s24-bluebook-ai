   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Sudesh. Incredible professor, very clear instruction, works extremely hard to make sure his students understand the material. Weaknesses: The homework assignments (Webassigns and psets) can be tedious and can feel redundant.",
    "strengths: good order of topics taught, easy to follow weaknesses: could be boring",
    "It was very well organized- but the workload was immense. The PSETs and the weekly 2 web assigns were a lot, but they did help in cementing the ideas we learned in class.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it provides a great foundation for calculus real world applications of it. A weakness of it was the homework -- I thought that problem sets were helpful in learning and reinforcing the material but I thought that the WebAssign homework assignments were particularly tedious and sometimes the online grading of it was unfair.",
    "The course is very detailed and outline so it is easy to stay on task. The review sessions for exams were not well done though.",
    "The problem sets were a lot harder than necessary for the midterms, but the final didnt resemble the midterms at all.",
    "Strengths: You get a lot of practice for each topic based on the number of required homework assignments (at least 3 a week). You also do a lot of practice in class, which included several group work problems, which really helped me work through the problems after we learned the concepts in class. We also received lecture packets as guided notes for each class, which were very helpful. Weaknesses: The content taught in class and the problems we worked through were not at all reflective of the difficulty level of the weekly problem sets; the p-sets were much more difficult in comparison to what we covered in class, so it took a long time to work through them and understand what was being asked in each question. Also, the first two midterms were not overly challenging, but the final exam was extremely difficult in comparison. I was very confused as to why the final was so much harder than the rest of the course, and I thought it was very unfair that it was not reflective of the work we did throughout the entire semester; I was definitely not prepared for that level of difficulty. Also, this course moves so quickly that you are only given the basics to work with in class, so you really cannot fall behind on course material. Finally, I think it would have been interesting if we had learned some more practical applications of what we were taught in class; it would have given more meaning to what we were learning throughout the semester.",
    "I thought the course was great! Sudesh did a great job at covering how to think about the subjects at hand and not just apply formulas."

    "I would recommend it if you need it as a prereq for a major. If you take it, try to take it with Sudesh. Sudesh is amazingbest math teacher I've ever had. He works incredibly hard to ensure that his students understand the material, and his packets are extremely helpful. His lectures make so much sense. If you take a math class at Yale and Sudesh is an option, definitely take it with Sudesh.",
    "yes, pretty decent QR credit",
    "Yes, if you are looking to further your studies in math. This was a fairly challenging class, but good for reviewing and going deeper into the math you learned in high school. If you do not have to take math, then you should not feel compelled to.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student -- especially to take it with Sudesh. I think that I enjoyed this course so much and succeeded throughout the year because of the style of teaching and energy that Sudesh brought to the classroom. I do not know if I would have had as enjoyable of an experience had I taken this course with a different professor.",
    "Yes, if you have Sudesh as your professor.",
    "Yes, if they are looking to be introduced to math at a basic level.",
    "Yes, but only if you are sincerely interested in calculus or if you enjoy taking math classes; otherwise, this class requires a lot of hard work and should not be taken lightly. (With that being said, I am not overly skilled at math or overly interested in it, yet I still found this class to be enjoyable because I liked working through the problems and being challenged on the p-sets.)"
