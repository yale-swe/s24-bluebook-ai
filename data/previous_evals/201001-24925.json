    "This class is essential for Math, Physics, and economics majors. It's an effective way of transitioning from computational to proof-based math. Howard Garland is a good professor (his voice sounds like the guy from pineapple express). This is a better class than Math 222 (which is a joke) and is the best option for people who are serious about math. The workload is very manageable.",
    "Take it if you are considering being a math or math\/econ major. If not, its probably not worth taking it with Professor Garland.",
    "If you are really into proof-based math and have enough initiative to learn the entire book by yourself, then this is the class for you."
