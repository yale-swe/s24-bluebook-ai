   "comments": [
    "The professors jokingly described it as \"schizophrenic dodgeball\" and that was sometimes a very apt description. However, this is also an apt description for the field of Human Rights, so the class does it justice in that sense! Overall, I'm very glad I took this course, because it made me really think about a lot of tough issues related to human rights. If it's a topic you're interested in, you should take this course.",
    "Take Cr\/D. Great class with especially amazing opportunities to hear guest speakers, but pretty overwhelming with the breadth of the material. The assignments hardly had to do with readings.",
    "A nice class if you are interested in human rights \/ international law. I didn't personally enjoy it that much, but that is probably just because I prefer something more firm and conclusive.",
    "I took a lot away from this course, so I definitely recommend it; however, I think it's important to understand that the class is not merely about human rights issues and abuses. First, you must learn the bodies and institutions of human rights, which can be complicated\/theoretical\/boring. Overall, I enjoyed the course though.",
    "This is the first year of the class. I bet it will be restructured to be more rewarding next year.",
    "PLSC 148 is a good way to understand the frameworks of human rights--how they have come to exist, where they are problematic, and how we might use them as tools for social justice.",
    "I would recommend it as a way of introducing oneself into the field of human rights.",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in human rights, and be prepared for a bit of vagueness and some hard readings. Overall a great class!",
    "Good class. split lectures did not work very well though. the writing assignments were interesting. a lot of reading that is impossible to do. you have to pick and choose assignments.",
    "PLSC 148 is a rather scattered but very interesting look at the fundamental tensions of human rights as a international policy tool and way of thinking. The readings and lectures challenged a lot of my assumptions and biases about human rights, which was really helpful. Though its first semester was a bit rocky, I'm confident that it will only improve from here.",
    "Great introduction to human rights! Take this class! Very challenging, but an awesome experience!",
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 1\/10, would not take again. Unstructured lectures, pointless readings (not connected to lecture), skin-deep assignments. This course is 2 years away from being worthy of any undergrad's time. If taken Cr\/D, would require 20 hours of work the entire semester MAX",
    "Yes!",
    "PLSC148 was an okay class. I wouldn't particularly recommend this class to another student, unless they were extremely interested in human rights theory or political science overall. I chose to take this class since I had a bit of an interest in learning about the fundamentals of human rights. Honestly, I didn't really enjoy this class, but it could have been because I wasn't as interested in the subject as I though I would be. The whole class is based on theory and the lectures can get really abstract and confusing at times. This may also be because the lecture is led by two professors who have differing opinions. However, this also provides a really great space for dialogue. The readings are really heavy. But many of the readings and the guest lecturers (there were many) were excellent. Overall, a good class for those who are super interested in human rights theory.",
    "Great intro class, you'll learn a lot.",
    "I am tentatively recommending this course in the HOPES that the instructors have seen its weaknesses in structure, chronological ordering, grading policy, and organization, and have reformatted it accordingly. The material is so important, the guest speakers were incredible, the professors are people I very much want to get to know, and I learned a lot. Human rights is a program of study at Yale that needs a class like this to legitimize it - just one that operates more smoothly.",
    "This class covers interesting topics but has a massive reading load. It can be hard to keep up and stay engaged. In its current form I would recommend that people considering this class to rethink it, but if they add section, I think someone interested in this topic could get a lot out of it!",
    "This class was an incredibly disjointed intro to Human Rights. It felt really all over the place most of the time, jumping from legal theory to the history of the HR regime\/movement, in the first half, to a strangely shallow thematic structure in the second half (women's rights\/LGBTQ rights, privacy\/information, torture, environmental rights, etc). I had to take it for the HR program, but I really don't think it was a worthwhile class as it stands. With some tweaking, a discussion section, and more coordination between instructors\/class participation, it could be great in a few years.",
    "This was literally the worst course I've taken at Yale. Unless they make some major changes--do not take it.",
    "A broad overview of the development of the modern human rights regime. Covers a lot of material, sometimes not in the most organized way. LOTS of reading, but overall an interesting course",
    "Do not take this class unless it is required. I mean I'm sure it will improve with time but I personally did not have a good experience with the class.",
    "Take this if you have to for now, but hopefully it will improve in the future. The Special Academic Program in Human Rights is wonderful, but this class was not really fulfilling. Ali Miller is a badass, so go to office hours with her if you get the chance.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was very disorganized. The readings for the class were immense and they didn't even connect to the lectures. I received very very very little out of taking this course.",
    "This is a hot and cold class. There is quite a heavy focus on law, instead of other avenues through which human rights can be discussed. Prof. Millers lectures are extraordinary, though. My major criticisms are that there was no section, the assignments are really terrible (they ask you to arbitrarily pick a human rights topic and apply the frameworks of class to it, instead of writing about something you choose yourself and care about and know)."
