   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent class, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in taking Italian here at Yale. By far, it is my favorite class of the semester.",
    "It is a first year Italian course where you learn to speak, read, and write Italian. The class is immersive which means that you do not speak English after the first class. I feel that it is an excellent way to learn Italian and I would recommend it.",
    "This class is an extremely systematic and thorough lesson in beginning italian - it is very methodical, as a beginning language class should be. It is very effective in teaching you the language!",
    "This is a fantastic course. The Italian department truly understands how to effectively teach a language... something that cannot be said about some of the other language departments at the University.",
    "If you are going to continue learning italian and wish to have perfect grammar as well as kbnowledge about the italian culture, then take it from Prof. Iglesias.",
    "The basics of spoken and written Italian: present, perfect, imperfect, future, and conditional tenses; all kind of pronouns; prepostions; passive constructions; vocab; etc. No English in class beyond the first day, which is ideal. A fair amount of culture involved. I recommend it: Italian is a fun language, and very simple to other Romance languages.",
    "Rewarding, hard, jam-packed, fast-paced."
