    "I would highly recommend this class. It's an incredibly refreshing change in pace from science and humanities classes, and Sebastian is an awesome professor. The class is fun, and I always left happy! Take it!",
    "I definitely recommend this class to other students interested in learning a useful but not too hard language. (Knowing french also helps a lot) The syllabus isn't too hard, and covers the necessary things to not freak out in a Hispanic country. Also the fact that there are max 10 people per section helps us participate more in class",
    "Chill, straightforward and so easy to follow. Definitely try to get Sebastian Diaz. My favorite professor at Yale. Genuinely care about his students and makes an effort to get to know them individually."
