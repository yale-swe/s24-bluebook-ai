    "You MUST be passionate about the material to take it, you must. Some of it is interesting, but only if you really focus.....",
    "I would definitely recommend it to somebody who is interested in music and theater. It helps to speak French, but isn't necessary. Week by week, you learn about different French baroque operas, mostly by Lully. You also read about the historical context for a lot of these spectacles, which is important to understanding them. The course kind of revolves around the final project and there isn't very much other written work. Most people chose to do creative projects and the requirements for it are not too strict.",
    "This is a wonderful class that introduced us to various aspects of the spectacles that were produced in mid-seventeenth to early eighteenth century France, primarily in Paris. We discussed both visual, musical and literary aspects while also having attention the various discourses around this repertoire as well as links to contemporary culture and its spectacles. I especially liked how Prof. Ahrendt allowed all of the students to bring their own special knowledge and experiences to the class, some commenting more on the music, others on theatrical culture, etc. This was also great for the final project that could be a creative reinterpretation of French baroque spectacle, more research driven, or a combination of the two, which ended up providing a very varied and final presentation day. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in theater studies, music or any kind of performance."
