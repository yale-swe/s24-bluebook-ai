   "comments": [
    "Brushed up on a bunch of basic math skills that I had either skipped over in high school or have forgotten about--which was so helpful. I really learned how to understand math problems conceptually, and was able to prove to myself WHY my answers were correct.",
    "This class taught me a huge range of topics: physics in the motion problems, series, fractals, probability. And throughout the entire course we were given basic tools that apply in lots of different contexts like the distributive property. It is aptly named, because it made me think of the ways that math applies in my real world.",
    "This class is a great class to apply mathematics to real world experiences.",
    "I learned various ways mathematical concepts can be applied to everyday phenomena.",
    "I learned real world math skills like investment rates and probability. The nice thing about this course was that most of what we did was applicable and we studied the topics by using real life examples.",
    "Rudimentary math skills, including basic algebra, statistics, and series.",
    "I learned a lot about math that can be applied to real world situations. This class covered a lot of different topics, not just related to math but also a lot of science topics.",
    "I developed the ability to think critically about the applications of the math problems I was solving, and it was interesting to learn math that was strictly applicable to real world processes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The groupwork was great, and really helped the class figure out different mathematical concepts on our own. I wish there was a bit more variety in classwork, like not just worksheets every day.",
    "Good introduction to a number of math topics with, as the title implies, \"real world\" implications (think interest rates, mortgage payments, basic probability). The class format focuses on small-group learning rather than traditional lectures, which could take a bit of adjustment, but the structure is ultimately to your benefit.",
    "I think this course was great because it was taught in several units which allowed us to go in depth on different types of math. If one unit was harder for me, another one was coming around the bend. I appreciated the way that it operated in small groups during class to allow us to try to help each other work it out before we came back together at the end of the class to recap all that we had learned.",
    "There are no weaknesses of this course. It was my favorite class this semester and one of my favorite classes ever taken at yale. Professor Smith is a great teacher who cares about his students.",
    "It is a very interesting course with a variety of topics that cover different types of math. It is a solid curriculum.",
    "Great course! Very interactive and engaging and Brett was a very good teacher. He took time to sit down with every student to assure everyone understood the material, and his office door was always open to help out students who may have been struggling.",
    "Very good for those who are not strong in math. Group work and in class assignments are engaging.",
    "This was a great class for me to be able to develop my math skills and improve my knowledge of mathematical and scientific topics. This was the perfect class for me because math is not one of my strong suites so I was able to develop my knowledge and improve my math skills."

    "Dude, incredible class. Not too hard, but definitely teaches you. Brett is so cool and really good at explaining difficult concepts, just make sure that you vibe well with you're group (since you'll be with them for the whole year).",
    "If the QR is a perpetual thorn in your side, this is the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who, like me, is less confident in their math skills. It is designed specifically for people who did not take calculus in high school. The pace of the course was good to help make sure that everyone in the class had time to practice. We had a JITT activity before class that was to inspire our thought and graded only on participation and we had weekly psets after we learned the material. The class is run in a group format, which helped me learn. There were two fair midterms, a final project and a final.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to every Yale student. No too demanding and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it is a fun way to learn math and an alternate to complex math courses, especially if math is not one's strength.",
    "Yes! As a humanities-oriented major having a math course that wasn't too complex but still gave me the tools to use what I learned in the real world was perfect.",
    "You will not find an easier math course at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student looking to improve math and science skills and be able to relate it to real world situations.",
    "Undoubtedly, this course is designed for those that are not heavily interested in math classes but want to improve their math skills, which is exactly what this class did for me. I definitely recommend it."
