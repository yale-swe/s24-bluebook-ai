    "Bit of a survey into topics related to Development in South Asia, though mainly focusing on India. I would recommend it to both people who have no background in South Asia and want to learn a bit about the region and how it came to be this way, and to people who study the region and want to learn about development economic policies, their relation to poverty, and a bit about democracy in the region. Discussions are engaging and you really learn a lot! The three response papers are pretty abstract but open-ended. Know that it's not a typical seminar where you sit and discuss a weekly topic with the professor; Professor Thacil stands with a market at the board, calling on students to summarize the readings and discuss a few points about each. Overall a really good class!!",
    "Not the best and not the worst. Good readings, but class discussions are a bit too guided by Thachil, not allowing alternate perspectives. Interesting if you are very curious about India, but not a must take if not. Not a bad seminar if you need a spot filler though. The three papers rather than a big final paper makes finals period a little nicer, but the readings are a bit heavy.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Thachil is brilliant, and he leads fast, thoughtful, exciting class discussions. Do the reading - he holds you accountable to it, and it's easy to fall behind in class without it. The class spends a lot of time on the economics of development, which I definitely struggled with a bit, having very little econ background. That said, he's telling the truth the first class when he says this class isn't an econ class, so much as a political science course, and it's definitely accessible to non-econ people. I was intimidated by this course for much of the semester, but I left every class feeling like I'd learn an incredible amount. Probably my favorite class at Yale. Take it if you get in.",
    "Overview of different political and economic lenses with which you can study development in South Asia. Great class even with no background in that area.",
    "Definitely take it. The seminar is popular, so it can get a little big. However, simply doing the readings, being there, and listening to Tariq and other students will help you think in ways that you have not been able to before. You really do learn a lot about India; and, on top of that, the class equips you to think critically about policies, development, and political procedures. At times, I felt the class was too divorced from everyday realities, but it's also important to learn about policy-side of things. And, Tariq does a great job of connecting the two sides of the debate: policy and people.",
    "A political science-approach to understanding the development of India and Pakistan from early 1900s to present. Really quite fascinating - the things you learn in this class are applicable not just to India and Pakistan, but to all sorts of countries all over the world. Really looks at understanding the social causes of poverty and development, not just the economics of it.",
    "Strongly recommend! This class was interesting and fun to take. Professor Thachil is amazing!",
    "Amazing course! One of the best I've taken at Yale. This was my first seminar class outside of English, and as a non-social science major I found it incredibly refreshing. I felt like I'd learned an immense amount of information regarding how the region has developed, and it's certainly knowledge that I can take past my Yale career. Professor Thachil is amazing. So smart, articulate, and approachable. Crucial point: low workload! About 100 pages of reading a week, and 3 5-page papers (put in the time on the papers though, as he likes when they are well thought-out). I would highly recommend this class to anyone!",
    "This is an excellent seminar. While titled Development in South Asia, the course is actually more of a comparative development policy course that draws heavily from South Asia-based case studies. There is a truly great breadth to this course, which covers everything from gender inequities in development to Keynesian and neoliberal debates on macroeconomic policy and the influence of the military in the Pakistani political system, but none of it feels cursory, and the readings, while lengthy and occasionally dense, are excellent in highlighting the material, are well-balanced, and allow for enriching class discussion. The professor is excellent; very lively and engaging in seminar and one who excels at keeping the classroom discussions flowing and stimulating. Definitely take advantage of his office hours, for which the online sign-ups fill quickly. Outside of weekly readings, the workload for the course is not burdensome, with 3 5-page response papers evenly spaced throughout the semester. While their open-mindedness could sometimes prove difficult, Prof. Thachil provides helpful comments on them, and one can get a feel for expectations for the papers with time. Overall, this has truly proved an excellent seminarone that can be enjoyed by individuals with a wide variety of interestsand definitely should be taken whenever the opportunity arises.",
    "I would recommend this class - whether or not you are particularly invested in South Asia-specific issues - solely based on the sheer strength of the material and readings, and on prof. Thachil's leading of the seminar. The group that ends up in the class is awesome, too.",
    "It's a solid course if you're interested in the subject. Very reasonable workload (three reading responses throughout the semester, three or four articles a week), but you're expected to participate in every class.",
    "Yes, definitely! But it would help if you had a bit of background in economics.",
    "Take it, professor is fun and knows his stuff, syllabus is interesting and changing each week, and reqs are not too demanding (three 5-page papers + reading each week).",
    "Development in South Asia is a great course -- almost all of the readings were interesting and informative, and I left each seminar feeling like I'd learnt something new or examined an issue from a different perspective -- Prof. Thachil is a great seminar leader. I liked the format of the class as well, and the essay every unit was a good amount of work. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale so far!",
    "Definitely take this course. If you are afraid of not being able to spend enough time in the course or getting a bad grade, take it Credit\/D\/Fail. It is definitely worth all the time you can dedicate to it and in the end you will thank me. This course has been one of the best, if not the best class I've taken at Yale thus far."
