    "Physics 260 explores intro physics from a far more sophisticated and mature viewpoint. It's not too terribly difficult - the problem sets take only a few hour and the exams are very very fair. Baltay is a baller - he makes the class funny, engaging and unique. You don't need math 230 to do well, by the way, and you can get away with multivariable.",
    "Take it. You will be exposed to the purest crystallization of truth.",
    "This is a very good physics class, however, I think it is not the best intro physics class. Professor Baltay tries to skip over things that he considers 'trivial' in order to get to more interesting, such as relativity, and quantum mechanics. Many of the topics that he skips are things that I would like to have done in an intro class, which the 200 class does cover. At the same time, Baltay is brilliant and he really knows his stuff. He is a great lecturer, if not a little boring at times. They tell you that you need to be in Math 230 in order to take the class, but I feel that taking 120 would probably be a better fit because you actually cover how to use the mathematical tools that are proven in 230. The problem sets are not extremely time consuming and you do cover some interesting topics.",
    "Great course! It's basically all freshmen - some of them are obnoxious and full of themselves. But the professor is very engaging and explains things pretty well, and the TA is great. It's not hard as long as you don't get intimidated by the occasional vector calculus. There is a problem set every week - ten problems, and it takes some time, but not too difficult - one midterm, and one final.",
    "Good class for a person interested not only in physics, but in the exact details of how to quantify the world. This class helps you understand pretty much everything in basic physics and how to apply it, and I feel that any physics-related class I take after this will be that much easier as a function of my suffering\/hard work now.",
    "Definitely take it if you did well on the APs. Don't let the math bother you. You can definitely take it if you did well in BC calc. As long as you take multivariable concurrently (120 and 151 actually get to the stuff you need faster than 230), you should be able to know all the math you need.",
    "Physics 260 is a great class to take, whether or not you plan on majoring in physics. The class focuses on thoroughly establishing fundamental concepts in physics (although assigned problems are easier if you are already somewhat familiar with the material). Professor Baltay is a great instructor; he's very helpful and always answers questions in class.",
    "This course is only for very talented physics students who intend to be majoring in either physics or engineering. For others, I feel like this class is far to difficult to struggle through for premed requirements or a basic interest in physics. You will be surrounded by physics geniuses who (in the case of those such as myself that are *talented* physics students but not absurdly so) will make you feel inadequate. For those that are up to the challenge, it is a very interesting class which I thoroughly enjoyed and do not regret taking, and you will come out having learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend Physics 260 who is very comfortable with their physics background from high school and is really interested in Physics.",
    "I highly recommend this course. I was really on the fence about whether to take 200 or 260 because I hadn't taken multivariable calculus which is technically a prerequisite. I took math 120 concurrently and I'm really glad I did that and not 230 which sounded like a really headache and not very helpful. 120 gives you the tools you need pretty much in time to use them, and Professor Baltay is pretty good about explaining the math you need. 260 is definitely more about the big picture and how physics fits together than nitpicky problems, which I really like. You should expect to see a lot of derivations though, and more theory than you would get in 200. Professor Baltay is really great, \"any fool knows\" you will come to love his silly catch-phrases, and he will help you see just how beautiful physics is. One issue is that Sloane is so overheated that sometimes I found myself nodding off, but basically I loved this course and if you think you want to take it, do. Don't be scared off. You have up until the midterm to switch into a different level anyway, so I think its at least worth starting out in it.",
    "PHYS 260 01 is a great overview of many interesting areas of Physics. The professor, the TA, the textbooks are all excellent. If you have a good background in Maths and Physics, and you love the subject, this class is definitely for you. You will enjoy it, and your Physics ability will improve appreciably. What's more, it lays the groundwork for even more exciting things.",
    "This is a wonderful introductory physics class. Professor Baltay is both easy to understand and wonderfully entertaining, and the workload isn't too heavy at all.",
    "Really interesting course that moves quickly. The problem sets are not necessarily too long or too hard but the concepts covered are covered in a much more complex format than in 180 or 200. A little bit more explanation of some of the involved math might be nice--Professor Baltay asked for a familiarity with certain concepts but an \"intimate familiarity\" might be a better description of some of the knowledge necessary.",
    "Physics 260 is a fairly fast-paced introduction to college-level physics. In high school, I had a background of only one year of physics (Physics C: Mechanics--no electricity and magnetism experience), and I have been successful this semester. However, I would say that most students in the course have more background than I. I would guess that the class has a slight majority of freshman, with many sophomores, also. Classes are taught in lecture format, and Professor Baltay teaches well, although he can get dry at times. The course is fast-paced enough that having a background in mechanics and E and M helps. You also have to be able to bridge the gap between lectures that focus on the \"why\" (deriving equations, etc.) and problem sets centered on the \"how\" (applying known equations to the solution of problems). Either Math 120 or 230 should be acceptable concurrently. Nonetheless, with either you will have to work forward in the math class, because Phys 260 will move faster than the math class, requiring concepts like curl and shperical coordinates sooner. Compared to other introductory physics, this course seems to be especially valuable for its breadth (inclusion of relativity and quantum mechanics, for instance). If you're interested in physics or the sciences ingeneral and you're willing for a bit of a challenge, shop Phys 260.",
    "This class is easily manageable after having only done AP Physics C: Mechanics. You can learn all of the electro-magnetism material in class. Overall the exams are relatively easy. Its an enjoyable class that is not that difficult.",
    "First of all, if they're still claiming that this has Math 230 as a corequisite, that's a load of bunk. For this class, you need to at a minimum be taking multivariable simultaneously (and because you need the applied mathematical knowledge more than the derivations, check out the Engineering Department's options for that). Having previously had multivariable is probably better, and having had differential equations would be helpful, but the class is definitely doable just taking multi at the same time.Second, this is not an easy class. It is a good class, and you will learn a lot of physics, but it moves through complex material at a challenging pace.NEVER MISS THIS CLASS, because you WILL regret it. The textbook cannot replace a missed lecture.Attend review sessions, because it will definitely help you on the problem sets. As above, don't fall behind on the homework. Playing catch-up is very hard in this course.Finally, Professor Baltay rocks. If you're on the fence, hear him lecture once and you'll probably be convinced to take this course; he can better show you what I mean than I can tell it.",
    "Not as difficult as it's often advertised to be, though you still have to study to do well. Between reading and problem sets, it took maybe 5 hours a week (much less than Math 230 often took). Baltay is really awesome (and pretty funny too) so if you're at all interested in general relativity and stuff at the end that he covers which the other physics classes don't, then take this class.",
    "Physics 260 is a fast paced introduction to the foundations of physics, (mechanics and E\/M) which relies heavily on calculus both to derive laws and to solve problems.I would recommend Physics 260 to anyone that feels driven to learn as much as they can about physics. Professor Baltay is an amazing professor. Don't worry if you haven't had multivariable calculus yet. You just have to teach yourself some of the math (which you will get in math 120 or enas 151) which isn't too bad.The homework is not too difficult and the exams aren't too hard either.",
    "Professor Baltay is awesome. Definitely shop this course ifyou like physics. If you're worried about not having enough physics or math background, that shouldn't be an issue if you feel you're good at the physics or math you've done. I went in having taken physics C and calc BC, and I was nervous that I would have needed multivariable or things like that. All the math you need you either cover in class or will learn by the time you need it from MATH 120 or ENAS 151. The class is really not too hard, even though it may seem intimidating at the outset. I had originally decided to take PHYS 200 because of my lack of multivariable calculus, but I switched after the first 200 lecture because it was so boring and my first 260 lecture was much more interesting. First semester is somewhat review of all of physics C mech and some E&M, but it also includes fun things such as Lagrangians, special relativity, and 4-vectors. The material might seem hard, but the tests are very reasonable, and I don't think anyone (or hardly anyone) is really worried about their grade in the class.",
    "This is the most intensive of the Introductory Physics courses, though this shouldn't necessarily scare you. If you are acquainted with the math involved (the professor will make clear what exactly the math is in the first couple days) then there is no reason to take the other courses over this one. The course is more mathy and more general than the others, and so has fewer particulars and situations you have to just know the tricks for.Professor Baltay is a treat, and the TA this semester was great too. Tests and grading are all fair to easy on you, though you may be scared by some of your whip-smart classmates. Stick with it though. I recommend, especially if you're majoring in the sciences. It's just a more complete explanation of basic physics.",
    "A quick run through of AP Physics. A brief introduction into advanced concepts like the Lagrangian and Special Relativity. Not for the faint hearted. I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys Physics and is looking for a challenge.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course for anybody interested in physics who's had about the right math background. Even if you are currently taking multi-variable, give it a shot if you really like physics. You can always look up some of the math stuff as it comes up (I know I had forgotten some things), so the math is not that big a deal. Although some of the problem sets had some tough equations, the tests focused more on physics and less on calculus. This was a great freshman physics course that caught us up on high school topics and went into other interesting areas. Special relativity, for example, was a topic covered in depth. Lectures were a bit long, however, so if you're like me and bad at focussing, keep in mind that you might actually need to read the textbook.",
    "I recommend Physics 260 for students who are very interested in Physics, and want to move past mechanics\/aren't so keen on a thorough overview of mechanics. Also, DONOT FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO TAKE MATH 230 WITH THIS CLASS. You can take Math 120 if you haven't done multivariable calculus yet, and you will be very prepared for this class.",
    "If you like physics, this is a class for you. The books used this semester (in contrast to previous ones) were very good and easy to follow. Professor Baltay has a great sense of humor, making each lecture very enjoyable. At the same time, however, you will learn a lot of physics.The first part may seem like a review, but the class will go into new territory and will teach you a lot of new physics. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in physics.As for the Math 230 co-requisite, I would not say you absolutely must take it along with 260. In fact, Math 120 would serve you better in the short term, especially for this class. Be familiar with vector calculus, or be willing to spend some time to learn the concepts (which are not that difficult).Overall, I highly recommend this class to anyone who likes physics.",
    "Physics 260 is a swiftly paced overview of classical mechanics,special relativity, and electrostatics. Despite the fast pace of the class, the material was covered in great depth. Though it certainly was trying at times to absorb so many concepts, with the right amount of effort you will learn a great deal. The course allows you to get exposure to topics, such as Lagrangian Mechanics, that normally aren't covered until sophomore or junior year, which both adds to the difficulty of the class and makes it even more interesting. To the student who has a solid background in physics (AP C will do) and either has had some basic multivariable or is willing to take Math120\/ENAS151, I would definitely recommend Phys260.",
    "It was an interesting course that delved into a lot of less common topics which were very interesting but very little of the material was practically applicable",
    "This is by far my favorite class. Professor Baltay is a spectacular instructor - his lectures are clear, well-planned, engaging, and entertaining. He does a great job of keeping students aware of the \"big picture\" while still building up the details of physics beautifully layer by layer. His lesson on the Lagrangian is the first time I have ever been so transfixed by a lecture that is purely mathematics. Problem sets are challenging, but between notes and the book (one for mechanics and one for E&M, both are great!) they are doable. Group work is also really helpful - this is one of those classes where everyone is really smart, but in a way that makes me feel smarter being around them. Ethan (the TA) is also great, although you have to be very specific when you ask him for help since he'll only give you a few hints at a time. Problem sessions are helpful and interesting but not essential. Grading is generous. By the way, don't be put off by the Math 230 \"corequisite,\" you definitely don't need it. The multivariable concepts used in this class are fairly straightforward, and Math 120 will be fine. Only note of caution: the final was way harder than the midterm (not unreasonably so, just don't fall into the trap of thinking you don't have to prepare A LOT for the final). Overall, I highly recommend this class -- take it!",
    "This course would be a good choice under the following conditions:1. You have a good preparation in multi-variable calculus;2. You intend to be a physics major;3. You are more interested in modern physics. In other words, you are willing to learn some modern physics at the cost of giving up some time on classical physics."
