   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class. If you can get it, absolutely take it.",
    "Oratory in Statecraft is a fun experience. It's a chill space where you learn from your peers how to improve your speech giving and speech writing. Definitely a must-take if you can get in senior spring.",
    "I strongly recommend seniors try to enroll in this class, given its utility after graduation.",
    "Wonderful course definitely take it, you really end up becoming a tight family with the group of kids by the end of the semester. Professor Hill summed it up well when he said that we wouldnt have been as vulnerable or as open or as comedic as we were in our final speeches if not for the fact that we knew our peers would be so encouraging of us, and thats something that sums up this class pretty well. No homework, no papers, so a great class for seniors, and he takes mostly seniors anyway. You do three speeches over the course of the semester, the first is you write your own speech about a famous figure in history, the second is you deliver a speech that has already been delivered by someone in history, and the third (the final exam) is you write your own speech and you deliver it. You dont receive grades at least not that Professor Hill tells you of on the speeches, but after every speech your peers critique you, and although this may sound scary it actually ends up being very kind yet extremely helpful, constructive criticism and Im sure helped us all improve our own speaking styles. First half of every class is a lecture about the classics, and the second half is speeches. Make sure to start taking notes from Day 1 there is no PowerPoint and he doesnt tell you that the information hes lecturing on will be on the midterm exam, but it is. Theres a midterm exam covering all the trivialities of his lectures, and thats the toughest part of the class, so make sure to always be taking extensive notes! Overall a very fun experience I couldnt ask for a more laidback yet engaging experience at the same time.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can get in. One of the most inspiring, fun, and well-structured courses I've ever taken at Yale. The reading materials range from classical text such as Illiad and Paradise Lost, to modern speeches given by orators from very different backgrounds. Although this class is named Oratory, the things you will learn go beyond politics and statecraft. It also touches upon literature, religious studies, and everyday speaking. Professor Hill is an experienced diplomat and often shares his own stories. The exams of this class are also very interesting. Everyone in the class gave a short speech at the final exam, on any topic of his\/her own choice. I learned about some very deep, funny, and even strange ideas from these speeches. PS: You don't have to be a Humanities or Political Science major, although most people are. I am a STEM major and got to deliver speeches of my field.",
    "An absolutely fantastic senior course - you will hone skills that can be used life-long and gain new perspectives on some of the famous speeches you may have heard but not fully understood. Writing and delivering speeches is a soul-searching experience and it's fascinating to see how different individuals approach the challenge of communication and self-presentation. You will grow in confidence and be impressed by the growth of your colleagues.",
    "Definitely recommend. Great professor, interesting readings (although the focus is more on speaking than reading), and good group of students. If you want to get better at your ability to speak publicly, take this class.",
    "Yes, but it is not that hard and I wouldn't assume it to be a cornerstone of your schedule. A good auxiliary class. I don't know if I learned much about oratory or statecraft, but I did learn a lot",
    "Possibly the greatest class at Yale. If you can get in, take it. Teaches you how to speak, how to think politically, and how to succeed more generally. You will lean a great deal about yourself.",
    "Take the class (especially if you have Credit D's senior year). It is very low workload and Hill and the class provide some of the best feedback to make you a better public speaker\/writer. Great course.",
    "A class unlike any other you will take during your time at Yale, with minimal work to boot. Absolutely take it if you can get in.",
    "Yes you learn more about statecraft than oratory, but you get to practice public speaking which makes you better. Prof. Hill is extremely knowledgeable about politics and history, and he's super fun to listen to. The workload is pretty light, great class for senior spring."
