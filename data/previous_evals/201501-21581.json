    "Yes! It is a great freshman seminar and not too stressful. If you are at all interested in anthropology or reproduction or medicine, I would recommend the class.",
    "Honestly, the thought of reading 10 books throughout the semester can be quite intimidating, but don't let that stop you from taking this class! The discussions are captivating, thought-provoking, and the topics covered really open your eyes as to the impacts of various reproductive technologies throughout the world. Also, you should definitely considering taking this class if you're a guy because while the topics of the seminar may seem to be centered around women at times, there are various points throughout the semester where the impacts of reproductive technologies on males are discussed. In fact, Marcia herself has published works on this topic with regards to Arab men. If you need any other reason to take this class it's Marcia herself! She's an amazing person, an extremely knowledgeable professor, and she really steers the discussions to make sure they're interesting and integrate as many different views as possible. TAKE IT!!! You won't be disappointed!",
    "RepTech is an amazing freshman seminar! If issues of reproduction, medicine, health, gender studies, etc. interest you, do not hesitate to take this course. There's quite a bit of reading, but the books are all well selected and pretty interesting. There are only three written assignments for the class: two solo book reviews and a final comparative book review between two books. The class is also run entirely by the students. Everyone is assigned to lead the discussion for a whole class for half of a book, which entails writing up some discussion questions beforehand. I know for me that when I was blue booking and saw the syllabus, the material and course load seemed a bit daunting, but I am so glad I took this class. Marcia is amazing (she called herself our RepTech mom in her final email to us) and helps to make the discussions during class extremely friendly and welcoming. Take this class! Everyone in the class seemed to really love it like I did.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Marcia is so kind and supportive, and gives really great feedback on papers. She also took us all out for Turkish food at the end of the semester! The format is that you read a different book every two weeks and a new person leads discussion every class. You get graded on two book reports (15% each), leading seminar discussion once (20%), class participation (20%) and a final 10 page comparative book report (30%). The reading load is fairly heavy but manageable - everyone actually did the reading all the time because it's so interesting. After taking this class I decided to be an anthropology major, and Marcia is going to be my sophomore advisor. Literally just take this class even if you're a straight guy and don't think it will be for you - you'll probably never again have the chance to learn about menopause in Japan and all these other incredibly interesting, random things. Definitely the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Repro Tech is a class that makes you think extensively on a subject rarely made into discussion. It allows you to understand not just matters of reproduction but also matters of health (and globally) which is also incredibly interesting.",
    "This was the best class I have ever taken! The books we read were incredibly interesting. Sometimes I couldn't put them down! The course is a unique way to explore feminist theory: through global women's health. It is formatted like a book club, so we read ethnographies, and then discussed them as a class. It was a joy to hear my classmates perspectives on things like abortion, menopause, and plastic surgery. The course will give you a chance to delve deep into how women experience different types of technology associated with reproduction. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in women's rights, women's health, global health, or feminism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It was an absolutely phenomenal experience. Its a discussion based class, so you really do need to do the readings to get the most out of the class time, but as long as youre diligent about the reading, it isnt a problem to get it done. There were only a few boys in our class, but it wasnt an awkward experience to have them there and they still fully participated in all the discussions. At first, I wasnt totally thrilled to be put into this seminar because it wasnt my first choice, but this is the best class I took at Yale my freshman year. Marcia Inhorn is a fabulous professor and she gave me the tools to make my own choices in my life--not only my reproductive choices, but ones that extend to all areas of my life. If I entered the class as a feminist, I left the class actually knowing what that means. My outlook on the world and womens rights is fully changed after this class. If you have the opportunity, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Feminist book club, very intellectual, interesting, and fun. Don't take it if you're squeamish, but if you are interested in the subject matter and okay with doing a lot of reading, absolutely take it. Extremely interesting and informative, a fantastic class.",
    "Take this course! Even if it has nothing to do with what you want to study, you can't do any better for an interesting and informative course about issues you might never think about otherwise. You will find yourself talking about feminist and women's reproductive issues on the phone with your parents and with your friends. This semester, people were talking about the seminar who weren't even in it. Marcia Inhorn is an inspiring professor and she brings out the best discussion from her class. For workload, there is quite a bit of reading, 2 short book reviews, and a final paper. You also have to lead the discussion for one class. If for no other reason, take the class because it is a tight-knit seminar experience that is hard to get any other way as a freshman.",
    "We read about ten ethnographies in ReproTech investigating various reproductive issues including the (relative) banality of female sterilization in Brazil, contrasting experiences of pregnancy in Japan and Israel, and female circumcision in Sudan.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! JUST DO IT! RepTec, as we fondly referred to it was on of those classes that everyone in the freshman class ends up knowing about because everyone in it talks about it so much. We read 10 ethnographies and watched several documentaries and films throughout the semester on topics including birth, surrogacy, IVF, sterilization, abortion and menopause. It truly is a very unique seminar and is relevant for anyone at all. Workload - The reading is pretty heavy, with about 300 page ethnographies to read almost every week. Some weeks we just watch documentaries in class so no reading is required. Discussions are student-led, so everyone will end up having to prepare discussion questions for one class during the semester. Graded Assignments - We wrote two single-spaced 2-page book reviews, which were due the day we started discussion on a book. There was one final double-spaced 10-page comparative book review at the end of the semester. Professor - Marcia is phenomenal!!! She is a very experienced medical anthropologist and took on the role of RepTec mom. Her style is more hands-off, and she blends into discussions like another student, adding insightful anecdotes from her experiences researching in the field and attending conferences. Added Perk - At the end of the semester, the Freshman Seminar program paid for a class trip, which ended up being an absolutely delicious dinner at a Turkish restaurant. It really felt like a family gathering by the end and Marcia even brought us all a box of Turkish Delights as a parting gift! Truly one of my favorite Yale experiences! I highly recommend this course to everyone and especially encourage male students to enroll. The issues we talk about are universal and pertain to both men and women."
