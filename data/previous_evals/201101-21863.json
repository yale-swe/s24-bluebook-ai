    "Take it if you want to learn some pathologies.btw if you've taken physio, this will be relatively easy.",
    "MCDB 315 is a generally good course. The subject material is fascinating. It is wonderful to see how everything you learn in courses like cell biology relates on a larger scale to the human body, and how dysfunction can lead to injury and illness. The workload is very manageable. The course is graded solely on three midterms that constitute 40%-20%-40% of the grade, respectively. The midtermsare fair for the most part. There is very minimal reading for the course. There is no textbook; rather, each professor distributes a packet of notes. Having five different lecturers is definitely a downside; while each professor is specialized in his own area, it lent a sense of discontinuity to the course. Lecturers ranged from poor to very good. Overall, it is worthwhile course with meaningful practical applications.",
    "Yes, if you are pre-med, this will prepare you well for the MCAT and future courses you will take.",
    "I highly recommend the course for any pre-med student!",
    "Probably the best class I have ever taken at yale - do not be put off by rumors of harsh grading! The tests were quite fair (for two of them you get a choice of which questions to answer) and the TAs are all amazing. Unlike most other biology classes such as cell bio and others that give you a whole lot of background info without much application, this class gives you the chance to tie together everything you've learned in organic chemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, etc. You learn so much, and it's so interesting. Take it!",
    "This was in general a very interesting class and I felt like I learned a lot. The professors all had different teaching styles so some were better than others. If you're looking for a class that is about how the human body works and responds to things that could go wrong this is the class for you.",
    "I would recommend this course for its interesting and useful content, but it is not easy to get a good grade in this course",
    "This class is probably one of the more clinically relevant classes offered in our major so yes, I would recommend it. However, because some professors are better than others, you'll have to be patient at times.",
    "3 exams, but no cumulative final. Your grade is based only on those three tests and the class has a harsh curve. However, the material was very interesting and much better than the core classes we have to take for the MCDB major."
