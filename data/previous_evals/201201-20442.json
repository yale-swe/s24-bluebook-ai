   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this seminar to other students, even those outside of Western\/Frontier history. The readings offer great breadth--from colonial to American Indian to 20th century Western history--which allows for different perspectives from different students each week. The article pairings to each week's main reading, while extensive, are very useful for providing historiographical context and should prove helpful for those getting ready for orals. Also, the book review assignments proved quite helpful, both in terms of developing the skill of writing book reviews and allowing space for synthesis.",
    "Each week addresses a major topic in Western history. Readings include a primary reading for each week and a series of shorter articles to facilitate a discussion of the historiography of a particular strain of historical thought.",
    "I would recommend the class whole-heartedly."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were very helpful at providing a blueprint for orals reading. The syllabus' breadth offers many entry points for further research. So, overall, the course broadly added to my knowledge of the field and offered new insights to my research, both in the assigned works and in our engaging discussions.",
    "I did not know the Western literature well at all before this class, and the course contributed substantially towards my research."
