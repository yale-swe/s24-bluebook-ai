   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only to the student who is serious about OE. The course required a good deal of work, and, like all languages, there are no shortcuts. Nevertheless, anyone should count themselves lucky to get to learn from Dr. Frank.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It's a language class.",
    "I would recommend LING500 to anyone interested in Old English literature and culture. It is a very good course for attaining a reading knowledge of the Old English language and for exploring key texts in Old English literature. The first few lessons were devoted to the grammar of Old English, and from there we dived into translations, first of prose, then of poetry. Prof. Frank is very approachable and fun to have class with. Her enthusiasm for the subject will rub off on you!",
    "I will definitely recommend the class to my friends. It's very interesting and informative. We also had a trip to Beinecke to see the old manuscripts. It covers a lot of interesting material. I not only can read old English now but also understand Anglo-Saxon history better.",
    "If reading Anglo-Saxon literature sounds appealing to you, then take this course. The course comprises a fast-paced overview of Old English grammar and then many weeks of line-by-line translation of some fascinating works, mostly religious texts and poetry. We did not read much Beowulf in this course, but after this course you should be able to pick up Beowulf and read it with the help of a glossary. The work for this class consisted almost entirely of the biweekly preparation for class, which I enjoyed as it spread out the workload over the course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to others, especially those interested in Middle English\/Medieval literature and Renaissance poetry.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, reading Old English poetry is fascinating.",
    "This class provides a cursory treatment of grammar and then immediately dives into a wide diversity of texts--particularly poetry. The class does not go into great linguistic detail, but instead inculcates a functional understanding of the language. I would recommend the class to students who have an interest in the history of the English language as well as a love of poetry."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated Dr. Frank's approach of pairing history with the language. In fact, this course was one of the reasons I feel compelled to dedicate my research to Anglo-Saxon people and theology.",
    "Although it didn't contribute directly to my research, everyone receiving a Ph.D. in English should have to complete at least the first semester of Old English.",
    "I took it formy personal interest so it's not related to my profession.",
    "Old English vocabulary and poetic themes are very interesting to me, as are the religious texts we began to read.",
    "I understand a great deal more about the history of the English language, which I may be called upon to teach some day.",
    "This class has given me access to a wide range of texts that will likely be included as part of study on reception history in the medieval west."
