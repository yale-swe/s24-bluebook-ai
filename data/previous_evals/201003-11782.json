   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if he\/she has a desire to practice his\/her speaking skills. Conversely, if what the student want is to improve writing or reading in Spanish, I would suggest that they take a different course.",
    "Looking back, I would probably have just skipped to some other L5 spanish course with a more directed curriculum instead of advanced conversation.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is already very grammatically confident in the Spanish language and wants to refine their speaking skills. The biggest improvement a student would make in this class would be to make thorough arguments in the Spanish language. If a person is not a confident public speaker they might not get as much out of this class because it really depends on the student to contribute to the discussion and improve.",
    "It would depend on what the student wanted to get out of the course. I would not recommend this to a student who wanted dramatic, immersive improvements in their Spanish -- this is not a course where you will gain fluency, though perhaps such a course doesn't really exist. However, if a student wants a way to polish up their Spanish a little, getting some moderate practice to brush up on or maintain their skills, this is a course that would meet their needs.",
    "Yes, Profesora Tortora is a good teacher to get as well. She is understanding and fun.",
    "This class needs MORE CONVERSATION in order to be a CONVERSATION class. More class debates, moral oral exams (not written quizes), more class time for group discussion.",
    "Yes, take this class! It's easy and if anything, your spanish tongue will get some practice.",
    "Take this course if you want to work on improving your speaking skills, not if you need help on grammar, since poor grammar shows through quite noticeably.",
    "This is a good course for people trying to keep up spanish. It's not as little work as you might think because you do have writing assignments once every one and a half weeks that are 1-2 pages long and quite a lot of reading. Discussions in class are interesting and with Professor Tortora you are not forced to speak in front of the class if you get embarrassed. But participation is 30% of the grade. She is also not the easiest of graders. There is no final written exam, just a midterm oral and a final oral which is great."
