   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to the formal analysis in film. Heavy emphasis on film vocabulary, dissection of production, and following the growth of Hollywood. Good way to begin watching movies in a new light.",
    "The easiest class I have taken so far. A must if you love films",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the film world. I think it's a great course and really interesting. You will never watch movies the same way again. IF you only like watching movies but aren't interested in the technical aspects however, this might not be for you.",
    "If you like film, take it. Even if you're not going to be a film studies major it's probably still worth it. Professor Ronald Gregg is awesome and the film's are very good, minus the musicals which all suck",
    "It's a survey class. If you know nothing about film, take it. If you know a lot about film, chances are you'll have to take it in order to get to the higher level courses. It's painless, you get to see a lot of films, and you'll definitely get something out of it, come final paper time.",
    "I really liked this class. Ron Gregg is a great lecturer and a fascinating guy. The movies were a mixed bag though--some were awesome and some were painfully bad.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you are sure you want to major in film. It is poorly organized, and I am not sure what exactly I got out of the course in the end. It would be better to take an introductory course in film production, though that might be difficult to place into without this course. It also might be better to take a course with a clearer focus, such as World Cinema. The films werechosen and arranged for the screenings poorly, and the readings were somewhat unnecessary. The lectures were engaging and the films were interesting, but much of the course seemed to be overintellectualizing superficial details without finding the real meanings of the films.",
    "It is a fairly easy course and I enjoyed learning about the basics of film. If you are interested in film or just want an easy writing credit this is a good course.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course. If you are interested in film it is the introduction to many basic film concepts that are necessary in order to advance. Also, the film screenings (although late at night for four hours) are really cool. You are able to watch films that are hard to get copies.",
    "Fantastic lecture! Professor Gregg is enthusiastic and engaging, and I learned a good deal about both film production and film analysis. A great course to fulfill a WR credit, and it has made me even more interested in Film Studies. I enjoyed most ofthe movies screened, and the readings gave me new perspectives into film as art, entertainment, and product.I definitely recommend this course, simply for the incredible lectures, which I looked forward to each week.",
    "If you are interested in film in any capacity this course is a must.",
    "Only take it if you're a film studies major. This class is a very broad survey of film theory, and there are lots of readings and lots of screenings. If you're interested in film, take another film course.",
    "Yeah sure.",
    "I would only recommend this class for someone who needs it as a prereq. Otherwise, look elsewhere - the syllabus is a little incoherent.",
    "Excellent class. Learn a lot about a big part of our culture.",
    "You have to take it if you're going to take any 200 or 300 level classes, and gives you a fundamental learning of the basics.",
    "This is a good introductory course for film. It will teach you how to analyze and discuss films within an academic setting, two particularly useful skills if one is planning to major in film or take more film courses. Nonetheless, it is easy to get lost amidst the terminology, and the lecture class setting further distances the material from the individual. Students who are passionate about film will get the most out of this sometimes inaccessible course.",
    "Eh...I don't know. The film screenings were great, but lecture wasn't that engaging. I did all the readings and went to all the screenings, but it probably wasn't necessary. If you love film, you'll love the screenings (or be at least bemused by some...), but if you don't need the class for the film major, perhaps you're better off taking film classes of a more specific nature.",
    "Too much work for a class I didn't get much out of. Also, the screenings are somtimes painful.",
    "take this class, it doesn't feel like work and it opens up the possibility of taking so many other cool film classes.",
    "Film 150 begins at the beginning of Classical Hollywood narrative all the the way to the present with digital cinema and CGI. It is very relevant and and ever changing and i absolutely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this class. You get to watch a lot of great films that you probably wouldn't otherwise see. You also watch some not as great ones, but since you build an ability to talk more proficiently about why you do\/do not like a film it's okay. Three papers, but they were pretty fun, as papers go.",
    "It's a very interesting course and you do learn a lot about the evolution of film up to the present day. Besides that, it is pretty demanding time wise. You do have to attend the film screenings on Tuesday nights that can vary in time from 1-4+ hours. That being said, if you don't have time at night do have time during the day at some point during the week you can reserve most of the films during the day at the Film Study Center. There is also section and there is a ton of reading. I never managed to read more than 2 articles in the entire huge TYCO packet, and barely had time to read the textbook.But Professor Gregg is great and really into the material and gets very excited about film and helps you notice all these things that you never would if you hadn't taken the course.",
    "Film Studies 150 01 was a general survey of film. We learned about film history, as well as the different elements of film. There was a new topic each week and this topic was discussed during lecture and section, and reflected in the week's screening. It was an interesting and informative foundation to film studies.I would recommend this course to another student, because even for non-film majors, it was an interesting study of a medium and its analysis. I learned a ton, and was really engaged in the information I was studying. Also, this was the only class in which I was actually interested in the reading I was doing.",
    "It is a good introductory course. You watch 2-3 films a week and there are two lectures every week plus section. You write three papers and then have one final.",
    "Surprisingly difficult course. However, you really do become well versed with the language of film.",
    "Film 150 is a thorough introduction to the language and history of cinema through reading the most important theorists and watching some of the most important movies that have influenced the way movies are made today.",
    "This class is helpful for anyone remotely interested in the film industry. It teaches about all aspects of film, and is very intriguing and creates a creative outlet for students. I would definitely recommend this class to a peer although I would warn them about the time-consuming nature of the course.",
    "It is a sweeping introduction into the art of film. I'd recommend the class to any student that enjoys films. After taking the class, every film is more enjoyable as one more fully appreciates the aspects of film that go unnoticed to the general public.",
    "This is an excellent intro course that I would recommend to anyone interested in experiencing film as an artistic medium. The class looks at how a movie made up of specific narrative and stylistic elements. The movies you watch and read about sample a diverse mix of periods and nationalities, so you're not just watching the old Hollywood classics; for someone who loves all different kinds of films, it's great to study how each one breaks down into its component parts. You're really learning how to watch a movie from the inside out, which is cool. A word of caution, though: this is by no means a gut course. There are a lot of readings and several writing assignments (it's a WR credit), and with two lectures, a section meeting, and a screening each week, just showing up for class is a pretty big time commitment. On the other hand, if you really enjoy the material, then that shouldn't be too much of a problem.",
    "Intro Film was a much more time consuming class than I had expected. You write three papers and a final exam. But you do get to watch some great films and learn about the directos and film critics. I would only half heartedly recomend this class.",
    "A fun, but necessary evil. If you like movies, take. The reading is hell, however.",
    "I would recommend this intro course to anyone who wants to major in film studies. Otherwise I am willing to bet that there are more interesting film courses out there.",
    "Film 150 is a great introduction to important film concepts. I notice things that I would not have noticed before in films and am better able to explain what I do notice due to my increased film vocabulary.",
    "Fun if you are interested in film. Not every film will be to your taste, but the exposure is good to have.",
    "It's a good introduction and an overview of film studies, and it's meant to touch lightly on several subjects. It does provide a very good understanding of the basics of film analysis, but there is a lot of work involved. Be prepared for three hour film screenings once a week."
