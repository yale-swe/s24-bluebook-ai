   "comments": [
    "If you are lucky enough to get into this course, definitely take it. The students you will meet are phenomenal. The work you will do is life changing. Although many students are scared away by rumors of a heavy workload, the casebooks are only 150-200 pages in length and compiled of a variety of sources, so it really goes by pretty quickly. The 500 word reading response is not that bad and helps you so much in class when discussing with other classmates and going through the exercises. The workload seemed manageable to me because every bit of work I did related to the course and gave me a measurable sense of productivity and accomplishment.",
    "A discussion based seminar on public eduction policy. Heavily focused on the reading, so if you don't do it, you'll probably struggle. Each class takes you through a series of modules that JBS prepared on the days issue. I'd leave every day unable to talk to anyone that wasn't trying to solve our nations education crisis. Thoroughly enjoyable experience.",
    "PLSC 240 is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. If you have any interest in education policy and are willing to put in the work then go for it. You get out what you put in.",
    "If you are one of the anointed few chosen to worship at the altar of JBS, take the opportunity. But don't take the course unless you are sincerely passionate about education issues; it's called a cult for a reason.",
    "Absolutely. If you get in, you need to take this class.",
    "BEST CLASS I HAVE EVERY TAKEN AT YALE, in terms of both Professor and class quality. Not only does Prof. Starr get you to work hard for him and like it, he lets students revise every single paper they write for him (and you're going to write a TON). Not only does he draw in brilliant students, but he makes them play off each other brilliantly. It'll be tough to get in, but try.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale as far as increasing my knowledge. Each week you get an in depth look at one facet of public schools. The best part is the format of the seminar which is various small groups discussions. This works so much better than you would expect because everyone in the class is passionate about the subject.",
    "A really special class. You get what you put into it, but only the people willing to put in a lot will make it into the class.",
    "I mean, come on. Take it.",
    "Best political science class I've taken at Yale! Unique small-group discussion format allows every student to be deeply involved. Readings are long but extremely well-chosen. Highly recommend if you have serious interest in education.",
    "A rigorous course in the study of public education.",
    "I definitely recommend the class! JBS is great, and everything we do is carefully constructed to make sure we get the most out of it. The course's unusual format (each class session is comprised mostly of small group discussions) ensures that everyone is fully engaged in the material and gets to consider the topic much more deeply than in a typical seminar."
