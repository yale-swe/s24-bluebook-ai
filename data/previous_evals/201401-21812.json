    "SCIE 199 is a series of lectures and discussions that expose students to the variety of research opportunities available. I would only recommend this course to a student who is undecided but wants to major in the sciences or engineering. It wasn't very relevant to me so I did not get as much out of the course as I would have liked. But it's still a great course and I see the potential help it can provide to other students.",
    "This course is a waste of your time. It's good to meet people in this class, but that's a small benefit. Since one not taking PSE can also get the freshman summer research fellowship, there's no reason to take this class unless you want to write a pointlessly long, technical paper on something you haven't actually conducted any research yet.",
    "Again... pretty useless. I only took it because i wanted to get the fellowship research thing over the summer, but lots of kids who applied and weren't in PSE got it as well...",
    "Yes, a great way to learn about science in a broad sense.",
    "Don't, just don't. I went in thinking it'd be super prestigious and all that, but the tediousness of the class has driven me AWAY from science, if anything. Congrats on getting in, and do it MAYBE if you're planning on doing research, but otherwise, take your talents elsewhere.",
    "I would not recommend PSE for any student who, 1) has a good understanding of what interests him, or 2) already has plans for the summer by the time that he has to submit his spring schedule (in this case, I would drop). It doesn't hurt to take it in the fall though, as the problem sets aren't graded, so you might want to try it for one semester to see if you feel differently.",
    "SCIE 199 is the continuation of PSE from the first semester. Everything is pretty much the same, except you have new discussion groups and you have to write a research paper about the research you will do over the summer, or any other topic of your choosing. I think how much you enjoy PSE depends somewhat on your discussion groups, which you cannot control. I had a great discussion group first semester, so I think I enjoyed the class more then, but the lectures are still interesting. The paper is a big step up work wise, so it is best to get started on that early, because even if it can be done during reading work, you are not going to want to work on it. Overall, PSE met my goals this year, which was to figure out what I might want to major in and what kind of research I wanted to do. I still do not know what I want to major in, but I know what I do not want to major in, which is a step in the right direction. If you get into PSE, you should definitely take it.",
    "Don't mistake this class for an easy course. Biweekly problem sets can really drain your Thursday nights, and discussion sections are only mildly interesting. However, if you plan on doing research the summer after freshman year or if you are genuinely passionate about the sciences, the exploration paper alone is probably worth taking this course. The requirements of the paper really push you to explore a subject you are interested in and you will come out of the writing experience with a deeper understanding of something that you wanted to learn more about.",
    "PSE is almost certainly a waste of your time if you have literally any idea about what you want to do in the sciences. It is aimed at those who want to do science, but basically don't know the differences between physics, chemistry, biology, etc. If you do, then this class is somewhat useless.",
    "this course is a broad overview of many different disciplines and fields. At times, especially for lectures outside of your proposed major, the course can be a bit overwhelming, but the lectures for the most part were still enjoyable and interesting.",
    "To be perfectly honest, I really hated this class. The whole thing is a scam. You don't need the class to get the freshman research fellowship; the lectures are really hard to understand unless they are in your field; the psets are hard; the discussions are invariably dry and boring; you can't drop the class halfway through the year without getting a W on your transcript; the exploration paper is a nightmare to write unless you are doing the research. That being said, I found about 4 of the lectures (of the 10ish we had all year) really interesting and it was cool to see some of the research being done by Yale faculty. I would not recommend this class to ANYONE without a strong background in all areas of science who are SURE about doing research over the summer, because otherwise it will be an absolute waste of time. If you find yourself trapped in the class halfway through the semester, just take it credit\/d and give it the appropriate amount of care.",
    "If you were in SCIE 198 last semester, take during the spring as well! The lectures are great and the discussion sections definitely improved (as per my experience). The paper is fun to write! Also, most of the Perspectives on Science and Engineering Students will do research at Yale over the summer!",
    "In most cases I would probably not recommend this class to a freshman. I think this class took up a credit which I could have used elsewhere (in a prerequisite for my engineering major) and now I feel lagging behind in my credits. If a freshman comes in with a lot of AP\/IB credits and has room to spare, then I would definitely recommend this class as an enrichment opportunity. Losing that credit didn't really seem worth it because I didn't gain that much knowledge -I only grazed the surface of a bunch of topics, most of which I will never get a chance to delve deeply into, so I don't remember and probably won't remember a lot of what I learned. This class also does not really give you that much of an advantage when it comes to getting a research opportunity\/research grant money. It forces you to prepare for the summer more, but a disciplined student could do that on his\/her own as well.",
    "Even if you think this class is interesting, your classmates won't, which will suck all of the joy (if any) you got from attending lectures\/discussion sections. It's not a class that's taken seriously by freshmen.",
    "PSE's lectures cover some interesting topics, but the discussion sections are very hit or miss and the psets are usually unclear. The paper is not a fun experience if you try to do it a few days before it's due (right before finals), so I'd definitely start early and finish at least the background section in advance. PSE no longer guarantees money for research, but everyone I knew who applied for money got it. People outside PSE can and do apply for the same fellowship, and it's unclear how much more difficult it is to get without PSE. If you're interested in many different areas of science and have extra space in your schedule, you might get something out of PSE, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Too much work for a half a credit each semester. I wouldn't recommend that other students take it, especially because it's a lot of work right at the end of the semester (which is a super busy time for everyone).",
    "It's a very scattered and disorganized survey of a bunch of random, fairly specific things in science, followed by some pretty meaningless discussions. It helps get the fellowship for the summer, so that is helpful, and doesn't take much work through first semester and the beginning of second, but it isn't really worth much.",
    "PSE attempts to introduce students to a wide variety of fields in the sciences. While I liked the idea behind this course, in actuality I did not always enjoy it. PSE seeks to build a community of student-scientists, but compared to other programs like DS, it fell short of creating a tight-knit community. Lectures were always interesting, but the homework was a tad frustrating at times. The questions asked are often not very accessible to those unfamiliar with the material. Further, know that you do not need to be in PSE to get research funding for the summer! It does, however, give one a nudge to search for research opportunities, which are quite abundant.",
    "BIGGEST ADVICE TO LISTEN TO: START THE EXPLORATION PAPER OVER SPRING BREAK. If you're taking this semester it's because you don't want to get a W on your transcript or you found the class interesting. SCIE 199 was intellectually stimulating for me and I was exposed to different branches of science that I had never explored before. My only advice is given above. I would recommend this class to another student!",
    "There really should only be one criterion used when deciding whether or not to take PSE: if you plan to do science research at Yale during the summer after your freshman year, take it; if you don't, don't take it. If you're reading these reviews for the second semester, you've probably already taken the first semester and now you're pretty much committed to taking the second semester (I think that if you don't, you get a W on your transcript for the first semester, which sucks). However, the second semester is a lot more work that the first semester in that you have to write the research paper, which is 4500 words and is difficult to write if you don't actually have a scientific research project to conduct. The lectures this semester were pretty interesting, the student-led discussions could get pretty boring, and the research paper was draining to write because I wasn't conducting research over the summer and so had to find and research a topic by myself. If you do plan to do research, though, the funding is pretty much guaranteed (as long as you write a decent grant proposal) and the paper is a good way to become informed about the topic you plan to do research on. TL;DR take it if you want to do summer science research, don't take it if you don't.",
    "Take it if you're doing research over the summer, because it forces you to prepare beforehand. And I definitely will reap the benefits of my preparation. The lectures are more interesting this semester, and if you have a good discussion group, it'll be fun :)",
    "I'm still going back and forth whether taking this course was a good idea. Chances are though, if you're looking at SCIE 199, you took SCIE 198. I'd recommend not dropping out if you don't want a \"W\" on your report card; a friend of mine did and was not prepared for the results. I guess my only advice would be start your research paper in advance! I started mine a few days before the deadline, and it killed my entire reading period. I barely had any time to study for my other exams.",
    "PSE is a little bit of everything. Some lectures you'll love; some you won't understand at first, but you will if you put in the work, do the readings, and participate in the discussions. You get out of PSE what you put into it. Make the most out of the opportunities PSE provides. It will guide you towards finding summer research and applying for a fellowship. The final paper is difficult and long, but if you don't slack and you pick a topic that coincides with your interests, you may actually enjoy writing it. PSE is a fair amount of work, but you'll get a nice panorama of a lot of the research going on around you at Yale. I highly recommend you take this course. It will give you valuable research and scientific writing skills, and you'll have a lot of fun in the process of learning them.",
    "would recommend if you;re REALLY into science in general",
    "This course is excellent for students who already know what type of science they wish to research. Unfortunately, it is not very helpful for those who do not have much experience. I would not recommend making the decision to take this course lightly.",
    "PSE is a good class if you are interested in many branches of science. You are introduced to many different fields. Although the homeworks and lectures can feel irrelevant or too complicated, the class overall is definitely valuable and I would recommend it.",
    "Take this course if you really want to have a lecture in a different field of science every other friday -- if you don't like sitting through physics lectures as a bio student, don't take the course.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a survey course that enables freshman interested in science to better gauge what topic of science research appeals to them. I would recommend this course to any freshman who is interested in learning about a wide-variety of current research in science. The faculty members who lead PSE are also very approachable. They help serve as discussion leaders and advisers. Overall, this course can help a student orient what area of science he or she is interested in pursuing in the future.",
    "Not a lot of work until the final paper at the very end.",
    "SCIE 199 does provide a chance to experience a lot of different fields. However, I would warn students who already know what they are interested in studying to consider carefully how much they would like exploring the other fields that PSE presents.",
    "Great way to be exposed to different subject areas in science. Problem is we were thrown into the middle of an advanced research project and had one week to learn everything about it. Can't expect undergrads to know each and every minute detail about every science topic. Has great potential, but the way they do it is terrible. Would not recommend, because you only get a shallow knowledge of subjects.",
    "Definitely think before deciding to take this class. Do not have inflated expectations. You will learn about some cool stuff in lecture, and you will have an excuse to do research in the summer in New Haven. However, you do not NEED to be in this class to do research--as far as I can tell, it doesn't give you any special advantage--and many people in this class even opt not to do research. Your experience in section might be great, but it depends on who's in your section, and my experience both semesters was just so-so. Take this class if science is your jam and there's no other class you think you'd like to take instead. But if there's a neat freshman seminar that piques your interest, I'd say go for it. Neither you nor your Yale career will suffer.",
    "Don't take it simply because it's selective and you got accepted, there are several much more interesting courses out there. You won't learn a whole lot in this class. Every other week you have a professor come in and try to give an overview of the research field that has taken them a lifetime to understand, in one lecture. The weeks in between are wasted trying to \"discuss\" the science, when people barely know the basics.",
    "Just don't take it. If you are a part of the crowd applying to this class, I am guessing that you are genuinely passionate about science. The lectures don't do much to spark your curiosity and they definitely don't make you want to study something new all of a sudden (I have heard of 0 such cases). The discussion sections are a dreadful way to spend Friday afternoons. When you get a bunch of kids who realize the class is a joke \"leading\" discussion, it obviously breaks down into a nonsensical waste of time. The psets can never actually be done without scouring the web for answers or digging deep into the presentations that the lecturers gave (because any notes you probably took will likely not include the answers to what is on the pset). I was falsely mislead into believing this would be a demanding but rewarding class because of the application process. In reality, almost everyone gets in and you don't actually do anything. Take another class or a lab if you just want to stick to half a credit.",
    "Though the lectures for PSE were usually interesting and sometimes awe-inspiring, I ultimately don't think the time and effort the class requires is worth the result. If I could tell my freshman self what to do, I would have just gone to the PSE lectures and not enrolled in the class. The class took place up science hill at 1:30 on Fridays - a location and a time that were both MUCH less than ideal. Sometimes the assigned p-sets were much too hard considering students are working off an hour-and-a-half's worth of unfamiliar information. Furthermore, the final 20-page paper is only relevant for students doing research over the summer. Otherwise, it's just a rather arbitrary, kind-of-interesting-but-I-could-be-doing-other-work-right-now time sap. If you took PSE in the fall and don't want to deal with the stress, but don't want the W on your transcript for withdrawing in spring, take it pass\/fail!",
    "Definitely take if you plan on doing research at Yale freshman summer. Otherwise it is not too much work, sometimes you learn something cool, sometimes you are bored, and everyone complains about the final paper at the end (though it is helpful for preparing you for summer research)."
