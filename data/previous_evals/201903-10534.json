   "comments": [
    "Sometimes too fast, but that is fine (can always learn back at home). Covers a lot of material, which is good in my opinion has an exposure to the variety of topics within material chemistry.",
    "Strength: Good material. Weakness: None.",
    "The lectures were a strength, along with the homework assignments. Perhaps a little more guidance on the final exam contents and what to study.",
    "This course is not very much work, but also not that rewarding. It was a breeze until the final, which was much more challenging than the rest of the course. I wish there was more work throughout the course, and a more fair final.",
    "The lecture was not very engaging. The professor read the slides and the material was sometimes interesting, but often you didnt need to go to class. The problem sets were really well made and I liked those and learned a lot from them. However the final presentation was somewhat pointless and I didnt like the 3 minute format where everyone discussed the same paper. It was quite repetitive and boring. The final exam was crazy and didnt seem reflective of what we spent the most time on during the semester. It would have been better as a take home test I think with more time.",
    "I enjoyed the later half of the course when we learned about the instrumentation and characterization used. The first half of the course was very theory heavy, so I would have liked to learn about the connection between the theory and how that is used in characterization methods.",
    "I think the strength is definitely that we get exposed to many techniques, I think it is really good that we get homework which forces us to really engage with the material and see if we really understood everything. I also thought the presentation was great because we had to critically analyse a published paper.",
    "I thought the material presented in class was very clear and I enjoyed professor Wang's lecture style. I enjoyed how state of the art methods and materials were discussed and the presentation assignment allowed us to engage with current research.",
    "strengths - I think I learned the most when I did the problem sets, they were a reasonable difficulty and really forced you to understand certain topics weaknesses- the lecture was pretty math heavy. I usually couldn't follow the math, even when going back through the lectures. Maybe being more careful about defining variables and explaining the overall purpose of that particular equation would help. It was hard to get an overall picture.",
    "Cover a lot of fields and can give us a great insight of it. Just lecture but no vivid description",
    "strengths: breadth and depth of material weakness: might benefit from some more simple exercises to establish course fundamentals (especially in latter half of course)",
    "The course could be improved by having more practical examples demonstrated in class and more use of the boards rather than just the slides.",
    "Cover a big range but it can be better if going deeper"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Good intro class to materials chemistry. Great for any research topic within inorganic chemistry.",
    "Yes. This will prepare you in materials research a lot, especially if you did not have a materials background.",
    "I would. It's a great course as an introduction to materials chemistry for both chemists and engineers.",
    "Good survey course for Materials Chemistry. Definitely one of the easier electives for the major, so I would recommend it for that. Prof. Wang's super nice and a clear lecturer, and all the presentations\/notes you need for the course are available on Canvas. The only drawbacks are that sometimes problems on the homework will require you to do a bit of self-learning. Nothing too bad though. Final was HARD.",
    "Yes, because it is easy, though I didnt get much out of it.",
    "Of the available chemistry electives if you havent taken pchem two, this is probably one of the better ones to take. There arent many undergrads and those who stick around usually get at least an A- even though the final was a disaster. Hailiang isnt the greatest lecturer, but hes helpful in office hours if you have questions. The workload is pretty low and its a low stress class overall.",
    "Depending on if it is relevant to their studies\/research. If they are going into materials\/inorganic chemistry, then this is a necessary introduction to this area. If they are on the more organic\/physical chemistry side, this course is not as relevant.",
    "Yes definitely because I think what you learn is so beneficial for your research in material chemistry and",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and enjoyed it.",
    "yes. materials chemistry is often a gap in education in a chemistry major and it is such an up and coming field that I think it is important to get exposed to it",
    "Yes This course is broad and could cover a lot of materials",
    "Yes, especially if they have interest in analyzing crystal structures",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone who will be researching the development of novel materials to establish a foundation.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, Very interesting and useful.",
    "Yes, students can obtain a comprehensive understanding of materials chemistry"
