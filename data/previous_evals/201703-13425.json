    "many speakers were from the same area, would have been nice to see a bigger variety.",
    "It is a seminar course, frankly, I didn't understand most of the contents in this course.",
    "This seminar was a poor use of time since none of the concepts presented were at a level that the students could understand. The journal club element was not helpful at all for explaining advanced statistical methods that the main seminar would spend an hour on each week. The seminar is not meant for masters students and is really for professors in the department, so unless the talks are more accessible, this class does not help. I do not know how much I actually learned during this required course for 0 credits.",
    "Master students do not understand anything about the seminar discussed, not useful for me",
    "A lot of topics are beyond the scope for 1st year master student.",
    "Sometimes there are some pretty good topic for me to learn about such as machine learning. Most of time, I actually cannot quite understand the speaker."
