   "comments": [
    "great",
    "instructor- strengthlab- weakness",
    "Too much repetition on course material, too slowExams are weird... Sometimes had to guess what's it asking for",
    "Understanding SAS is good.",
    "Strengths: Textbook is easy to read. But the textbook and lectures are nearly identical.Weaknesses: Needs to cover concepts more thoroughly. First year MPH students need to understand fundamental biostatistics in order to be prepared for advanced courses. This course does not adequately prepare us. The textbook needs to be more advanced. We could utilize this class to do so many things--improve SAS programming skills, improve results\/discussion writing, improve understanding of literature, etc.",
    "This course covered a good introduction to basic regression, but it was very repetitive, moved very slowly, didn't really teach underlying concepts that well, and probably shouldn't have given us the code for the labs. I would have loved to have some real problem sets to really understand the concepts better. That said, I did emerge with a much better understanding of stats, Zelterman is great, and I loved the book.",
    "good. zelterman is a really chill professor.",
    "strength: quantitative",
    "The course was well organized and the expectations were more or less clear. The lectures followed the textbook closely, which in my opinion is an excellent teaching method.",
    "I felt that the materal covered in this course did not prepare me well to practice biostatistics in the field. Many of the examples used in class did not relate to public health, and it would have been helpful to practice with public health-based examples.In terms of assignments, the laboratory exercises did not help substantially in my understanding of the material. I think it would have been helpful to have problem sets to practice concepts learned in the class.Finally, the examinations did not fairly assess information learned in the course. Some of the questions featured on the mid-term did not cover information yet covered in the course. Therefore, the exams did not seem to provide an accurate assessment of information learned.",
    "The course doesn't align itself well what we learn in Epi or what we learn in research methods. It needs to be more cohesive.",
    "I found this class to be completely unhelpful. The pace at which we covered material was far to slow, but at the same time, the lectures sometimes were unclear. I generally learned the things that I needed to know for this class from other classes, including Biostats I, Epi II and Data Management. It's not clear how this class is meant to supplement our education beyond what we are already getting from other classes.",
    "Strengths: focus on practical application of methods",
    "The course is good in that it goes through different statistical models and their relevancy to specific types of data. It is good to have a lab component where the TAs help explain complicated concepts and show applications of the data.",
    "Strength: the lecture mirrors the reading in the book. The lab assignments reinforce the concepts from the previous lecture and the book.Weakness: not enough information\/examples given on criticizing the graphs.",
    "well designed",
    "This course has a very different flow than Introduction to Statistical Thinking I that I took in the fall and that took some getting used to. Dr. Zelterman has a monumental task of covering a lot more information in one semester than we did last semester; however, I am not sure that we went in depth enough with each topic. For example, in Stats I we had homework assignments and labs that helped us to understand each topic as thoroughly as possible. The labs in this class were helpful but at times confusing and didn't seem to provide enough practice to fully understand the statistical method we were covering.The textbook was helpful in that it aided my understanding of the lectures; however, I think it should have been combined with other textbooks (or chapters of textbooks) to help us see the material from a different perspective. Also, the exams were unrelated to any kind of questions we practiced during the semester in lab or in class. Chapter 13 of the book was really helpful in putting all the pieces of the class together. It would have been great to have word problems like this throughout the semester.I liked how Dr. Zelterman provided a graph at the beginningof each class that he interpreted for us. It was always interesting to hear his interpretation and understand the graph in a new way from his point of view.",
    "I felt that I did not grab a strong understanding of the concepts. While the course focused on utilizing different methods to find answers for specific scenarios, I feel that I did not fully understand the material and was very uncomfortable with SAS.",
    "Strength: I had a great TA, and I learned a lot of statistical thinking from him.",
    "TOO EARLY! It is very hard to make it to 8:30 am class.",
    "I wish the method of assessment was more predictable. Past tests have been ridiculous: some ridiculously easy, some ridiculously hard.",
    "The course went a little too slowly for a while (linear regression). Also, we were learning more advanced topics in some of our other courses at the same time. It would be helpful to coordinate Research Methods\/ Data Management with Biostats this semester- there really was no integration of the material across the classes. Finally, lecture and the book readings were identical, so toward the end of the semester people stopped going to the classes. Would be beneficial to introduce different material or present it in a different manner in class.",
    "The course spent a huge amount of time on linear regression and hardly any time on any of the other statistical analytic methods.Because the SAS programs were written for us it makes it a lot harder to understand both the program and the output. I'm not sure if I want to have to write the program, but it might be helpful to have the lab TA's go over the program while we type it into SAS.",
    "Strengths:*Skills learnt in the class are very applicable to real life situations*Instructor is the author of the recommended textbook. This results in a lot of synchronization between in-class and out of class learningWeakness:*The pace of the lectures is too slow. There is room to include more topics in the course",
    "The course does a good job on statistical thinking and at time used examples that makes sense to people who have a hard time with mathematics in general. However, at times I wasn't sure what I was actually learning and the book was not good in helping me understand some of the concepts or uses of SAS. The lectures also tended to ramble on and on. The labs were good in respect to interpreting results.The labs could have been shortened or certain ones combined to fully understand the concept. This would also relieve the burden of weekly assignments and instead have them every other week.",
    "Biostats is certainly an important subject, and key to public health. The course overall was good, but the pace could have been faster to make the class more exciting.",
    "It was the worst course I have taken at Yale and possibly the worst course I have ever taken.",
    "The course content is a little bit too elementary, and it is taught in a very particular way that does not reflect the majority of other biostatistics courses. While I appreciate the emphasis on statistical understanding rather than statistical procedure, the course content lacks depth. We never had the opportunity to practice applying concepts to real-world problems beyond simply specifying what type of statistical methods we might use to approach a problem.",
    "I wish there were optional problem sets.",
    "Exceptional course, exceptional instructor, and extremely fun. You'll learn a lot. A must take.",
    "Exams went well. Appreciated that the notes were available online.",
    "The lectures aren't important since restates everything that is in the book. Lab are pretty useless as we don't learn that such unless you spend a lot of time on your own outside of class. But also depends on your TA.Second half of the semester once got to regression was a lot better in terms of learning and understanding the applicability of it all.",
    "Dr. Zelterman is harsh and can be offensive. He moves very slowly and does not cover biostatistics in a useful way. He goes over simplistic items in class and then tests on complex questions.",
    "The professor's textbook is excellent. The labs are useful exercises, although the system of the weekly lab section is not as useful as it could be. The professor's exams were spartan and confusing; it was rarely clear what he was looking for in answers (many open-ended questions, like \"what is wrong with this graph\") which made it hard to really demonstrate knowledge adequately. Open-book format led to very little spread in grades, also. Lectures were alright but rarely enlightening beyond what was in the book; they were also long and very early in the morning.",
    "Good for overall understanding in Biostat and research methods chosingIf can linked to an Public health article when doing the lab for a specific chapter,if will be excellent.",
    "I did not take the first semester of biostatistics course, so this class was a good review. It is not as challenging and in depth as many of my fellow classmates had expected. For a graduate school course, this class could have been more challenging and practical.",
    "This was a good course and I think that it provided me with skills that will be useful one day.",
    "It is really helpful for people without a background on statistics",
    "I enjoyed his teaching method, but the course would be better with more calculation and problem sets",
    "Great course to learn how to problem solve and determine which statistical analysis to use. More concept base than mathematical.",
    "I was embarrassed that this course is considered a graduate level course and thought this was an incredible waste of time and tuition.",
    "Overall the course was good. Sometimes concepts were not well explained.",
    "Strenghts: It's application to real world situations, great overview of the important aspects of Stat relevant to field of public health. Excellent TA, professor was very straightforward and approachable.",
    "It is a great course to push you to think about biostats and data from a more practical perspective. However, I found the teaching methods to be too abstract and not systematic enough for me to follow. Also, having the professor use his own textbook was redundant. His lectures mirrored the book identically, so there was no variation\/diversity in presentation for those who may not have followed his methods.",
    "the strengths were that we have opportunities to think through the stat. methods we use in SAS, and know why we use them.",
    "It was just too slow, I would have liked to learn more about different methods that we might use in the future, even if just a broad overview.",
    "I feel that I learned a lot from the course, but it was mostly self taught. I really liked the text book. Class itself did not seem to add to what I had already learned from reading the text book. Professor used the same examples that were in the book for the most part and also went at a very slow pace. Usually I felt like there was no point in attending class because I was not learning anything new from being there. I think it could be better if the professor added examples that are different from the ones in the book and also if the pace of the class was a bit faster.",
    "I think the exams were not a fair representation of what we learned in class- and the professor often chose to ignore any feedback.",
    "Weaknesses:1. The class does not add much to the textbook.2. The weekly sections feel more like a burden than a learning experience. Again, the exercises can be completed by referring to the book. Limited additional understanding is gained from completing these exercises.3. For an advanced statistical course, the class draws astonishingly little on mathematics. At times, it is frustrating to have to interpret output statistics without an explanation where the data comes from.Strength: clear curriculum",
    "Teaches some valuable concepts, but too theoretical.",
    "I'm at a loss as to why this is a required course. I learned very little and I hear that those things we did learn are presented more effectively in other classes, mainly data management.The first exam tested very little of the material we learned in the first half of the course, and the second exam was incredibly easy and also did not effectively test my grasp of the material.Not thrilled with the fact that the class followed the textbook. The stories told in class? Were in the textbook. The examples? in the textbook. This made it easy to catch up if you fall behind, but I wonder why I'm paying thousands of dollars when I could have just purchased a $50 textbook for the same net effect.Very disappointed in this class.",
    "I think the course was good and that Dr. Zelterman is a good instructor. However, I do think the midterm was a little off in terms of the material we had prepared for. It was a bit discouraging.",
    "Lecture was somewhat repetitive from class to class, and moved relatively slowly. I feel like the entire course could have been covered in approximately half the time. The lab sessions were only moderately helpful in terms of application of the concepts. It would have been more helpful for us to write our own SAS code.",
    "This class could include and cover more material or be combined with the first semester. Thinking about the type of statistical tests that should be used in particular situations was valuable. However, more examples could be public health examples and the instruction during each class could be less repetitive.",
    "Great TFs particularly Connor Essick",
    "Poorly taught, labs were a joke, and exams did not reflect the material taught; there's a reason only 15 people were attending at the end of the term.",
    "A basic course, and can learn a lot of basic knowledge in this course.",
    "The course supplemented my biostatistics knowledge well by providing me with an understanding of the concepts behind statistical tests, when to use which test, and why a certain test is required over other tests. The course provided me with the analytical knowledge to conduct statistical testing on my own with different dataset types. I found the course itself very helpful and found great value in the textbook and labs.",
    "Lectures moved through material slowly and repetitively (and boringly). Too many references to walls. I did not feel the labs really contributed to an understanding of biostatistics, the best they did is give me practice at writing about statistics.",
    "You don't have to go to class...at all. The tess are are pretty lazy",
    "Weaknesses:1)The laboratory lab report grading is subjective. Since everyone has the option to answer and do different problems for the laboratory reports, grading cannot be standardized. Either give all students 3 (the maximum grade one can obtain) or have everyone do the same problem and then take off points according to the content\/context of the lab report.",
    "The course would be more beneficial if labs required students to learn SAS, rather than giving students the code. I think that the scope of the course could have been expanded. There was great redundancy between lecture material and the book. Since exams were open book\/note, given the parallel between the book and lecture (and that lecture notes being posted), going to the 8:30AM class was probably unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: The lab presentations by my TF Owais were very informative. The office hours of the TA were helpful. The previous exams were posted which helped us prepare for the tests.Weaknesses: There was a lot of data that was not biostatistics but rather economics or climate data. The lab reports were very open ended. This allowed us to only write about concepts that we understand and avoid more complicated concepts. The SAS code for the lab report were given and I often did not know exactly what we were doing. The lectures were repetitive with the text instead of adding to the material. The tests were more of a task of knowing what Dr. Zelterman was looking for than fully understanding the subject.",
    "I think the best part of the course are the labs. They should, however, be modified to provide students with a better learning experience. Students should be responsible for writing the SAS codes and more emphasis should be placed on how to evaluate good model fits.",
    "excellent. required course for all MPH majors.",
    "Professor and book are great. Time of class isn't ideal but given that class is mandatory for most (all?) students it's reasonable. The notes online are extremely helpful for reviewing and the exams are very fair and well written.",
    "The lectures were pointless and read the book or went t the TA sessions they could moderately pick up what he was trying to teach. It was a big waste of time for me and I picked up A LOT more from the first semester."

I urge the School of Public Health administration to consider having a conversation with Dr. Zelterman's to improve this. He has made racially insensitive references on a number of occasions.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0humorous.always ends class 10 mins later....",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor at times made off-topic comments that I found bothersome and offensive. I think the instructor is a solid teacher, but would benefit from limiting the outside commentary that is entirely unrelated to the course. The mid-term exam had some questions that were clearly poorly written and the instructor did not seek to further explain the questions and their relevance to the material; the instructor seemed disinterested in the students' concerns. In terms of substance, the instructor explained concepts thoroughly and in an accessible manner. I struggled with this course in the fall semester, but excellent (so far) this semester on the labs and mid-term exam as a result of the instructor's clear explanations and consistent teaching.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman presented the information in a manner that was difficult to relate to and follow. I found the lectures to be repetitive and ambiguous, and not particularly helpful in learning the material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He didn't seem to respond well to questions which was confusing and sometimes he wasn't very nice about it. The midterm was very frustrating as we were tested on things we hadn't learned yet but yet, he wasn't very empathetic as to why this was problematic.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I think that Prof Zelterman should definitely consider ways in enhance his sensitivity to students. He was sometimes rude to students or got very defensive when people asked questions in lecture. This created an environment not conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor is very repetitive. In going through my notes, the same concepts are gone over 2 and 3 times in lecture. Moreover, he teaches directly from his book, outside of repetition, you gain nothing from going to class that you can't find in the book. This instructor also does not seem very approachable. Additionally, on his tests, questions are not very clear. They are open ended and can be interpreted different ways when only one interpretation was in mind when the question was written.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strength: repitition of material\/concpets within a lecture. Repitition with the readings. The best way to learn is to see the information in all different ways and the instructor does this very well.weakness: none",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I know the lecturer is trying to emphasize, but sometimes I still feel that he spent too much time on some topics to get students tired, and spent too less on some so that we could not understand clearly in class.after all, he is knowledgable and humorous",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman clearly understands his field and seems to love to teach statistics. I struggled in this class however, because I think there was a lot lost in translation. I read every chapter and attended every lecture and lab, and I still felt lost with some topics. I felt I wasn't understanding it the way it was being described.I was also frustrated with the \"term project\". Since we had been using the chi-squared statistic throughout the semester, I thought that the explanation of how it worked (continuous vs discrete distribution and one versus two-tailed test) should have been covered at the beginning and then again throughout the semester each and every time it came up.Learning statistics for me is about repetition and there were certain things that I felt were emphasized throughout in a helpful manner (i.e., the \"wall\" in statistics and remembering which side of the wall we are on), but the chi-square shouldn't have been left until the end.Finally, I think there should be better oversight of the TA sessions. I believe my TA truly wanted to help, but did not do a good job of walking us through the lab slides or setting up the lab problem for the week. I don't think she came prepared to lab each day; however, she was always available over email and always willing to meet outside of lab time.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor genuinely wanted the students to learn, but many students and myself were unable to adapt to his teaching style. There was not an alignment of learning styles, which caused a lot of students to perform poorly on the midterm. However, I did appreciate all the times he reviewed topics as we progressed in the semester. It helped to reinforce topics we learned prior and apply them even further.A suggestion for Professor Zelterman would be to speak when and what he is writing. Professor Zelterman is left handed, and it is hard to see what he writes since his hand covers the script. I would suggest he says aloud what he plans to writeas to allow the students to quickly take notes.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0strength: he provided a real-life example of statistics in newspapers at the beginning of every class. I appreciate his effort, and I think it is helpful\u3002weakness: he didn't prepare for the last 2 classes. He just stood there and demand us to ask questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great, enthusiastic professor. Teaches in a fun way with unique, yet real life examples. Very willing to help students. Overall, great guy. No complaints.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Good instructor but went a little slowly sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor was occasionally crass and mean when interacting with the class during lectures, but other than those occasions the instructor was adequate.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0A great and merry individual. Always brings a smile on one's faceGreat balance between being strict and joking while taking lecturesVery approachable of class",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0At times, Dr. Zelterman rambled on too often about a concept that definitely needed clarification. Sometimes, I was apprehensive and hesitant about asking questions in class in fear that he would ramble on in his response. He also put the labs behind at certain points which meant that we were doing a lab prior to conceptually understanding the topic at hand.For the labs, he states that you just need to build upon his SAS coding. I still wish we had a 0.5 credit SAS course during Biostats in the Fall so that we are much more comfortable and prior to taking Biostats 2 or Data Management because I am still not using SAS to its full potential. I don't want my only experience with SAS to be just my thesis. In the beginning I spent way too much time on the labs because I had to play around with the code which took up time, then synthesize my results and present it as a lab report. I made an effort to really understand but it took more time than I think necessary if we had more experience during biostats\/SAS in the Fall.The answer keys to past exams were also at times incomplete and not all the original exams (without answers) were up on classes v2. Also, the answer key was inconsistent because the \"lazy\" null hypothesis was written out (that Dr. Claus said we should not do) instead of the more complete interpretation of the question being asked.He was good about asking if people had questions and making sure we liked our TAs and lab sections. But as I stated before, at times I wasn't even sure what to ask since I had a hard time understanding some of the concepts and wasn't sure what to ask.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman is overall really passionate about teaching. He wants students to understand critical concepts of biostats rather than simply approaching the work in a mechanical\/didactic way. However, he could have gone over topics at a faster pace.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I was very disappointed by this course. I was excited to learn about statistical methods that I could potentially use in my work as a research assistant or in my thesis, but I honestly learned more about statistical methods and statisticaly thinking in Epi II and Data Management and learned hardly anything from this course. Dr. Zelterman was rude and condescending when students asked questions and had the tendency to repeat the same things over and over again to the point where it was no longer reinforcement, but a waste of time. His tests were unreasonable and many of the items on the test assessed knowledge of methods we had not yet learned in the course (especially on the midterm) or that were not even in the textbook for the course (which he wrote). I went to every class, but it was honestly a waste of time as he just repeated what was in his textbook and spent a lot of time talking about non-relevant graphs from newspaper articles. I have always gotten A's and gotten along well with my professors, and this is one of the worst courses I have ever taken. Even the TA's said that answering some of the exam questions required \"getting into Zelterman's head\" and that sometimes his answers to student questions were vague and didn't make sense. The course was also very unorganized. He did not have any TA's for the frist few weeks of class, so we were behind in the lab schedule, and the TA's he ended up getting did not really want to be TA'ing the course and did not seem to care much about their job.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor seemed to know the material, but has a particular style of thinking and communicating that is quite polarizing. The instructor did not seem to be receptive to feedback from his students. For example, a student expressed concern about a question on the midterm that was unclear. Rather than trying to clarify the question and sincerely address this student's concerns, Dr. Zelterman instead gave a curt, mildly sarcastic response that betrayed an indifference to his students' learning process.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Zelterman is a great professor - very receptive to questions, and concerns of student. He puts an interesting spin on the material, and makes it applicable to everyday life. It's great to see someone who enjoys teaching so much - more classes need to be like this one.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Appreciated that the notes were available online.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0It takes awhile to get used to his style and his exams are kind of subjective but he took feedback surprisingly well and adjusted to a rough start to the semester.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Offensive, not welcoming to questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He's not good at explaining things.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman's textbook is great, and he's knowledgeable and sincere. The course is a bit disorganized; I think he could have made the initial lab sign-up process go more smoothly than it did. His open-book exams are also confusing and not very good at producing a good spread or evaluating students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very good in using metaphor to help understanding the essence of theoryClear and logical and well plannedIf the first five classes can speed up a bit nd leave more time for the latter part of the book it will be really nice",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is a very talented and approachable professor. The only thing that bothered me was that his TAs seem to be more involved in the class than himself.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I think professor Zelterman is a good professor that genuinely wants students to learn the material that he teaches. The pace of the course might be too slow but overall he does a good job of teaching material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is a good speaker",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I appreciate the fact that he teaches us to how to think in a bigger picture theoretically instead of how to simply crunch in the numbers and focus on traditional textbooks.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Lectures are good and entertaining. Would like to see additional examples outside of textbook.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I am sure that Dr. Zelterman is an incredible biostatistician, or else he would not be in his current position. Yet, from the way he conducts himself in class, presents material, and has \"structured\" the course, my classmates and I cannot see how incredible he is. I had several issues with this course that primarily stemmed from the course instruction. First, Dr. Zelterman presented nearly all of the material in a \"statistics\" sense, rather than \"biostatistics\". In other words, many of his examples were related to scenarios like baking brownies and shark attacks, with very few examples related to public health or medicine. Second, the the material was presented extremely slowly and repetitively, which really limited the amount of material that could be taught over the course of the semester. Lastly, Dr. Zelterman presented material in a very personally-biased manner in which hewould describe a problem and then describe how he would solve it. However, in the problem-solving description, he would only teach how he thought a problem should be solved - not the range of methods available in a biostatistician's \"toolkit\" to assess issues. I understand that Dr. Zelterman has been teaching this course for several years, but I am embarrassed that YSPH has been allowing him to teach for so long.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was good. Sometimes did not answer student's questions when they asked but instead answered other questions that weren't being asked.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Excellent knowledge of the material, very friendly and presents information in a way that makes Stat much friendlier and easier to understand that Fall course with Dr. Klaus.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was nice, and clearly knowledgable, but he was hard to follow. He didn't explain things in a detailed or systematic way, a lot of complex topics were glossed over. He also tended to make some innappropirate jokes, often regarding immigrants, which was very off-putting.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was a good instructor, and brought out a lot of interesting questions to think.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I think the class benefits from Dr. Zelterman's expertise and the useful examples he provides.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He could increase the pace of his teaching. But overall a great course instructor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was a good instructor. We just spent too much time on one particular topic.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He taught too slowly. I appreciate his desire to teach us the statistical thinking part of the course, and not just to act like robots and actually understand, but I don't think it was pulled off completely. I don't know if it was really intermediate level.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Nice guy, but often makes racist comments in class that were unacceptable.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor is committed in class, however, appears to be little prepared to engage beyond his defined role outside the class setting.Again, the class delivery mainly iterates what is already written in book. This might be helpful for some learning styles but, in my mind, does not cater to a broader audience.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is a good professor, but can be too theoretical at times. He also needs to listen more to what students really want from the class. Otherwise, he is very knowledgeable and has an interesting sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Does an adequate job of relaying the material.Talks down to students when he is unimpressed by the question asked. Threw essentially a temper tantrum when students were frustrated by the first exam. Consistently calls a student by an insensitive nickname he created.Encourages students to skip lab sessions, and implies that the sessions are only for students who need the extra help. I, for one, am unimpressed by a professor who cannot make a case for the neccessity of the course he has created.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a good instructor. He is very passionate about the material and I like that his lectures follow the book very well. I would like to see more in-class practice of modeling equations. As a student I understood the concepts but had some trouble applying them.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor was good at providing real life examples of how methods could be used, which was helpful, but the overall class moved too slowly.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Repetitive at timesI appreciate what the instructor was trying to accomplish in terms of getting us to think about which types of statistics are best in different situations; however, I think this could have been executed better. Examples were too repetitive.It was difficult to tell whether the professor wanted us to answer questions he posed or whether they were just rhetorical.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Good person but not a great teacher. Was not helpful to students when they had questions and was frequently rude.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a very enthusiastic and quirky individual. His lectures directly mirrored the textbook (written by him), including all examples. Furthermore, he was at times condescending and had a tendency to be very repetitive on certain issues while completely glossing over others.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor was enthusiastic about the subject matter, which was great. However, he often did not clearly\/directly answer students' questions. His goal was for us to be able to think about every-day problems using statistical approaches, but his lectures were often long and drawn out, and did not convey clearly the information to be covered.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I did not find the lectures helpful at all. I attended very few, and when I did, I regretted it. Too many references to walls, and the jokes about them (and other things) were kind of offensive.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was ok. very enthusiastic but, sometimes he seemed to lose touch of what we were actually talking about. Spent way too much time on very simlple concepts while glossing over someof the more difficult ones",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Weaknesses:1)1\/4 of the midterm tested students on materials that were not specifically discussed in class. The instructor did not prepare students well for this exam.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor was fine.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman could have been more receptive to questions in class. He would often not answer the exact question that was asked. Furthermore, he could have progressedthe class much faster than he did. We could have learned so much more biostatistics from him than we did.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I think professor Zelterman is extremely knowledgeable. He should work on being more approachable for the students. His lectures were not very helpful in understanding the material. Perhaps the course should be taught differently. He could teach using the labs as a reference.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0excellent.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Good professor. I appreciated his enthusiasm and lectures. Didn't really need to go to office hrs so don't know about 1-on-1 interactions."

    "Owais was very knowledgeable, helpful, and available to students. Always well prepared for class.",
    "Sara Nguyen is a great TA. Although she is not an advanced biostatstician, she is knowledgable and prepared for our lab section. Her extra effort to prepare is most helpful to us. I urge Sarah to speak with confidence in front of her class because she is a prepared and competent TA!",
    "Sara was the best! She was very helpful, good at explaining concepts, and responsive to student needs. She really made this class the best it could be.",

    "TA is fine",
    "TAs were wonderful",
    "Connor was a helpful TA.",
    "Connor Essick was my teaching assistant for this course. I found him to be a wonderful resource throughout the semester. I learned the majority of information in the course through his lab sections. He was responsive to all questions, and spent a substantial amount of time preparing for lab sections.",
    "Connor Essick--Connor always went above and beyond to help people and he was also very organized. However, I also sought help from the other TAs and Oweis was excellent and Hiwyete was very good. Sarah wasn't very on top of things. Overall, the TAs for this class were much nicer, much better and much more knowledgeable than first semester. Connor was the only good TA last semester.",
    "Sara was an ok TA, but she was not exceptional. She provided the minimum amount of information we needed to complete assignments. This was helpful in some ways - by helping us to understandthe most important aspects of an analysis. However, she did not seem to have a deep understanding of the material and she did not go out of her way to be helpful.",
    "Strengths: responsible, responsive to emails.",
    "My TA was great. He attended lecture each week and sent us weekly emails with updated information, a summary of the previous week's material, and a heads-up for the coming week's material. He explained concepts incredibly well and helped walk us through problems whilst pointing out important details. The lab component that he taught was much better than the lecture component taught by the professor. My TA went above and beyond and even took it upon himself to set up review sessions for exams.",
    "TAs were really good. Lab sessions were very helpful. The focus was on truly understanding the concepts. Always available to answer questions.",
    "My TA is Owais. he is knowlegable and clear in elaborating. I like him!Connor helps in preparing for exams, and he is great, too!",
    "As i mentioned above, my TA was always available over email or outside of lab to provide extra help. She was very knowledgeable about statistics but I don't think she came to lab prepared or familiar with how to explainthe material to us. Since the lab period is crucial to understanding each topic that we go through, it is also crucial to have a TA that doesn't just understand the material, but who is able to convey it in an understandable manner.",
    "My TA was Connor Essick, and he was an amazing TA who genuinely cared about the well-being of the students. Connor made excellent powerpoints which I learned a lot from, and was readily available to the students' concerns.",
    "TA: Connor Essick.Connor is great! He is really responsible and helpful.",
    "Sara Ngyuen was an amazing TA! Very thorough and helpful with lab assignments. Patient when the class did not understand a topic, and genuinely wanted us to learn biostats and understand it. Broke down complicated material into easy to understand pieces, which is a skill. Great TA, no complaints.",
    "Connor was amazing as usual.",
    "Owais Gilani: Helpful, generous with his time.",
    "Connor is AMAZING. Very conscientious and helpful across the course...",
    "Connor: he was fantastic! Very helpful.",
    "Sara Nguyen - excellent TA!",
    "Sara Ngyuen:Sara was great because she provided hints and tips to ace the class. She also was readily available to answer questions and look at your code for help. My only issue is that I wish she had more experience with biostatistics because her expertise was limited when it came to more difficult questions.",
    "Sara was a good TA overall. She could have done more to explain concepts rather than simply relying on the powerpoints.",
    "Connor Essick was an excellent TA and went above and beyond to help students that were not even his lab section. My TA was Hiywete Solomon who was fine, but did not do much during lab but read off the powerpoint. I do not think she was planning on TA'ing the course but did it as a favor to Zelterman.",
    "The TA, Connor Essick, was excellent. He was always prepared for class and was able to clarify concepts above and beyond what Dr. Zelterman was able to accomplish during lecture. He was sensitive to our learning process and knowledgeable about the material.He was also very responsive via email and took the time to provide detailed weekly lab updates to aid our understanding of the material and to guide us in completing our assignments adequately. He seemed genuinely concerned that we felt comfortable with the course material. He also graded and returned our labs in a timely fashion. I would not have complained if Connor taught the whole course.",

Reviewed material in a way that made it \"stick\", also has a good sense of humor. Made lab sections interesting and worthwhile to attend.Connor also did a great job as a TA for the sessions of his that I attended.

    "Connor was a great TA! Very knowledgeable, and always ready to help!",

He was always willing and prepared to answer questions.Connor and Owais were very thorough in conducting and preparing review slides before the final and midterm. They did an excellent job.",
    "Connor Essick- I really learned a lot through Connor's lab. He is very thorough and really provided invaluable help and input throughout the course.",
    "Sarah--Terrible. Did not teach us at all, and during labs would click through the slides saying \"I'm not going to go through this, you guys can read this all later,\" then hit \"run\" in SAS, and not say a thing about the output.Also, before the midterm she said, and I quote \"The test is going to be really easy so if you get anything less than a 85%, you should be embarrassed.\"",
    "good, very helpful.",

    "The TAs were excellent. I could not have asked for better TAs.",
    "Sara NguyenAlthough I appreciated the credit I received on the labs, I would have also enjoyed more feedback, especially given that I did not receive most of my labs back from her. This is partially my fault, for rarely attending lab (when she usually passed them back), but it seemed to me that they should have been returned to my box in the event that I was not present. When they were returned, comments were minimal and although I'm sure I was not perfect, I did not feel I got much constructive criticism.",
    "The laboratory grading is subjective. The expectations of one TA (Owais) may be higher than the rest.",
    "Owais was an excellent TA. He was very good at explaining the new concepts. He cared that we understood the material and was also attentive to questions. He would help us change the given SAS codes to get a better biostatistics training.",

    "This course is totally unnecessary for students taking other YSPH courses.",
    "Yes I would recommend because it is a necessary part of public health research.",

    "Overall, the course is organized well.",
    "You have to take it anyway. You will learn something out from the course. Not too hard, but you'd better keep pace with the instructor along the semester.",
    "This course is required in my program. I would recommend it to people who already have some statistical background in the topics covered.",
    "I learned the regression methods which I have never known before. So in a sense it is helpful. But it will be much better if the lecture is more structured.",

    "A must take class. Although a little slow given the 4 month tenure, the skills learnt from the course come in very handy at a workplace\/research setting",
    "Unfortunately, this class is required, but my response to incoming students would be, it is more about theory and deciding on which test to use. I think there are extremely polarized responses to this class. It definitely helped with some concepts in understanding statistical tests, but there is a lot that I do not feel competent with. I'm not sure if I am prepared to do my own analysis of data after biostats I and II. I won't say that I didn't learn at all, but the competence and confidence of my understanding will be tested when the time comes.",

It is interesting to learn everything in the context of implementing it in SAS, but the course doesn't really involve SAS instruction so I was really confused at the beginning.The tests are open-book and the course doesn't have much work, and the lectures are essentially optional if you read the textbook, so it's a low workload, but it's also not terribly rewarding since the exams aren't very challenging or rigorous.",

    "I would recommend it, however I would caution around the text book used for the class, which at times didn't provided thorough explanation of the concepts being taught. In addition, the questions in the book were not explicitly stated, so it was often difficult to ascertain what the question was looking for.",

    "The course, being an advanced statistics course, did not meet expectations. It might cater to an audience that feels very uncomfortable in statistics and does not intend to leverage subject knowledge in a subsequent career.Since it is a requirement, I would recommend to fellow students (interested in statistics) to focus on the book, minimize time devoted, and seek occasional help on concepts from TAs.",
    "It's good if you need a more theoretical understanding of the statistical concepts. Otherwise, can seem boring and not very helpful.",
    "Unfortunately, you have to take it. Fortunately, the work you won't be doing for this class will give you time to devote to your other classes.",

    "Haha, well it is required, so yes, I'd recommend taking it. I'd say read the book and do the practice exams; and the right TA can make a big difference (although that changes from year to year, so hard to say who the best will be).",
    "Sleep through it. Everything you need to know for the exam is on the tests from previous years, which he gives you.",
    "This course gives you the general statistical tools needed to evaluate and interpret public health data. This course does not emphasize knowing how to code SAS, for the SAS program code is given to students. This is not necessary detrimental because this class is not about learning how to understand and code SAS; rather, it is about how to evaluate and interpret data.",
    "It does a good job of introducing a number of statistical methods that are necessary for public health practice.",

    "excellent. recommendable to all MPH students.",
