   "comments": [
    "I became acquainted with various artistic movements within the theater. I came to better understand the threads of development\/conversation\/interrelation among modern theater.",
    "I got a pretty broad span of theatre history, including dance history, and a touch on postcolonial drama.",
    "I gained fluency in the theatre arts in a way I never had before.This came from reading a wide range of plays in many different genres, learning about the history of theater and studying the many different styles of stagecraft .",
    "Whatever I learned from this class is whatever I'll remember about the ~20 texts we read. Neither lectures nor section really helped understand more about the plays than just reading them at home.",
    "Learned a lot more about the development of theatrical work and how each movement played a role in influencing the others.",
    "I learned a lot about theatre of the past few centuries and how to look at theatre through the lens of things like design and other more modern constructions.",
    "Good exposure to a lot of different works and theories of theater"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were too many finals at the end of the course; a final project, paper based on that project, and exam were unnecessary together. The course could be improved by limiting the amount of final projects.",
    "I think that the course is what it should be for a survey course. We did not go super in depth to any period which was sometimes frustrating, but we wouldn't have been able to cover as much as we did if not for skating through some things. I also think bringing in the guest lecturers during the second half of the semester was really great. I would say one thing that I recommend to change are the final requirements. Doing a final performance, a final paper, and a final exam for one class was extremely difficult and I think 2 out of the 3 would allow students to perform better on those two components.",
    "This is a very strong course, I really enjoyed it. The lectures were really amazing and the reading material was wonderful.",
    "Too many finals right at the end of the semester; the workload for this class in the last two weeks was quite overwhelming. The content of the lessons, while always extremely interesting and useful in the broader sense, did not always fully prepare us for the exam. I would suggest either modifying the style of the exam or ensuring that every single play we read is studied and discussed either in class or in section. In the latter half of the class we did not discuss a wide range of the plays, leaving many students confused and uncertain about them.",
    "This course is very poorly structured. Reading two to four plays a week is not only a ridiculous amount of reading, but it also allows for only the most superficial of discussions, even with section. Then there are the assignments: two papers and a midterm in addition to THREE final items, a performance project, a paper, and an exam.",
    "This course has little focus. Besides the fact that we move chronologically for the most part, the course does not seem to have much structure. The grading is very unclear: how assignments are weighted is not on the syllabus, there are no rubrics, and the prompts are very vague. The production project at the end is an unnecessary component of a class about theater literature and history. Since we haven't learned anything about production the onus is entirely on students to figure out how to get everything together.",
    "At times the section often felt disconnected to the course itself.",
    "I think it is a very good class with a lot of opportunities for class engagement. I feel like towards the end we stopped focusing on talking about the plays so much, which is something I think could be improved upon. Also, the in-class performances were removed from last semester, and I think they were a really great opportunity to retain engagement.",
    "The material varies a lot in degree of interest. There is little incentive in the structure of the class to be particularly engaged with the readings or material. Lectures are fun and informative though."

   "comments": [
    "Joe is amazing, but the class isn't. Take it if it's required or you have a true passion for theater. Most of the class waited to do the readings until reading week because it was just so much plays so quickly and there were some we barely discussed.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in theater! Roach is incredible and knowledgeable--you leave the lectures not entirely sure what exactly you learned, but you definitely learned a lot (and then it's all solidified and bullet pointed in section). If you are at all into theater or think you may be, take this class.",
    "I would if you are thinking of being a theatre studies major.",
    "If you are at all interested in theater, take this class!! Professor Roach is incredible and you will be amazed at how much you know at the end. I highly recommend.",
    "Yes, if the student is serious about theatre.",
    "Absolutely not. This course is about cramming info into students' heads and not about become better dramatic thinkers. A HUGE disappointment.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because it is poorly organized and you won't takeaway much. I went in loving theater and considering a theater studies major, but this class dampened all of my enthusiasm. I never looked forward to lectures or section because we never seemed to learn anything. This course can't decide if it's a theater history course or a theater literature course and so it fails to succeed at either. Professor Roach lectures mostly on theater history, but we don't read anything secondary sources so his lectures don't connect much with the readings. We vaguely discuss the readings in section, but we sometimes read up to four plays a week so you can't much in section. Also, during the second half of the semester the sections are devoted to the production project so you don't discuss the plays there either.",
    "If you're not a Theater Studies major but interested in theater history, take it-- if not, try to get into another one of Joe Roach's classes-- he is the true gem of this course.",
    "I would take it again. You need to if you want to do Theatre Studies, but I think it was interesting and I got something out of it. You really have to do the readings though, otherwise it is a bit useless.",
    "Only if a perspective theater major. Not worth the work otherwise."
