   "comments": [
    "The course gets better as the term goes on. The first few lectures may be difficult, but the material becomes less difficult as you get used to it. Don't get scared off if you look at the textbook and find it to be too technical - you don't have to know the material to the depth that the textbook goes into, although the material is indeed very mathematical and theoretical. We don't really consider empirical evidence. If you think this course is too difficult, take Econ 121. After the first midterm, a handful of people dropped the class.",
    "If you are an econ major, shop this class and Intermediate Microeconomics and then decide which class you want to take. If you are not an econ major, don't take this class.",
    "It's not nearly as scary as you might think. The class is by no means the most exciting one you'll take at Yale, but Professor Rozen is really clear and it's possible to get a very good grip on the material. Problem sets are generally fair; challenging but not incredibly frustrating or long. Exams were very fair. Take the class if you need to or really want to, but don't expect itto be the highlight of your semester.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are a very mathematical thinker. I wanted to be an Econ and Math major until I took this course. Take Intermediate Micro instead!",
    "The class basically delves into various economic concepts from a mathematical perspective.",
    "A very mathematical introduction to microeconomic theory. Problem sets can be quite difficult. Midterms and final aren't bad.",
    "It might be a fresh experience for many, but if you happen to be interested in math or economics or both, try it out.",
    "This is a course expressly intended for people to major in economics. Unless you derive exquisite pleasure from seeing the abstract mathematical proof of well-known (if you're in this class, you probably already took Intro Micro or the equivalent) concepts and would like to trudge through the problem sets, which are in no way fun or exciting, I would recommend you take this class. It's not an easy course. The problem sets required very meticulous mathematical work, including proofs and fairly advanced algebra and calculus. If you want to get a broad understanding of the theory behind Economic concepts *and you think you can handle this*, by all means, take it. But I know many people who dropped out because it was too difficult. I didn't, and regretted it the month before finals. I don't anymore, of course; I learned a lot, and have a much better understanding of Microeconomics, but let's be real. This isn't nearly as applicable to the real world as Macro is, so unless you go nuts when you turn people into points on a graph and preferences into inequalities, you might not enjoy this.",
    "Pretty mathematical for an Econ course, but not too much work and not too hard. The problem sets were pretty short and the professor knows her stuff",
    "bad curve but if you're looking to learn theory\/if you're planning to do a masters or phd in econ this is the only way to go.",
    "Econ 125 is a very good class -- if you are sure you like econ, that is. If you spend the whole semester questioning assumptions economics makes about people,then you will be a little bit unengaged. But you will definitely get to know consumer theory, producer theory, general and partial equilibria, and basic game theory very well. Professor Rozen is great. The problem sets can be mathematically tedious, but all in all, don't take too long.",
    "Only take this course if you are comfortable with a lot of math! It's definitely a more rigorous course than the normal Intermediate Microeconomics course. I struggled with the proofs and it took me extra time to understand all the concepts. The teaching is done in a top-down manner -- shop this course and you'll understand what I mean. If you're not excited about the way Professor Rozen teaches the class in the first session, then don't take the course because that is how it's going to be for the rest of the year. The class was very rewarding, and I definitely learned a lot more than just the computation of problems, but it took the most work out of all my five classes.",
    "I enjoyed the class. Considering what I heard about the other intermediate micro class, I am definitely happy I chose this course. That being said, it is certainly more difficult and has a much harsher curve.",
    "Yes, take it, interesting class.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you enjoy working with mathematical models. The whole course is math-based.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in microeconomics. The material commands alot of math, and for many the course is quite challenging. However, it is also very interesting.",
    "I really like the material and the professor for this course. I'm so glad I took it, even thought it was really difficult for me to take, especially during Freshman Fall. It's a really fantastic course and the professor is so overqualified to teach that she can be intimidating sometimes, but not in a bad way. She's actually really nice but because she's so brilliant, sometimes even going to office hours can be difficult because she might not be able to understand what and why you don't understand. I loved it and I would recommend people who really enjoy econ to take it, but it's definitely difficult and a lot of work, so unless you're really into the subject, this is not the course for you.",
    "The materials introduce students to the method of using mathematics to model human behaviors. It's challenging and mind bending and worth your efforts."
