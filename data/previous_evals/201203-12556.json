    "Yes, take this class even if you have taken Calculus BC in high school. You'll get a better grounding in the concepts and be ready to move onto the higher level courses.",
    "Math is math. Zhiren Wang is not the best teacher, but he's certainly not bad.",
    "Make sure you get a good teacher because the material itself is not that hard, but you do need someone who's going to be able to explain it to you.",
    "Yes. If you want to take a math class, this is challenging yet possible to succeed in with work. It is difficult and fastpaced though.",
    "This class basically taught topics in calculus in a straightforward, dry manner. There weren't many real-world applications of calculus in this class. I would recommend this to those who take this class as a stepping stone to further math classes. I would also recommend this class to those who want to get a sense of what number-based and concept-based math is like.",
    "Math 115 is a solid introduction to integral calculus. You'll spend also a lot of timeon series. In general it's a pretty thorough introduction. Most of your time will be spent on problems - there's little talk of applications, and sometimes there are digressions to theory, but the main vehicle of introducing ideas is through working through problems. Attending the problem sessions, and also using the peer tutors, is definitely helpful. The quality of the professors is also variable, so you need to be careful. They'll all be helpful, so don't despair if you don't get your first choice professor. You'll definitely have to work at it, and the course can be challenging, but if you take advantage of the resources and talk to your professor, you should be fine."
