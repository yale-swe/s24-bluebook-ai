    "There was very little instruction of substance.",

   "comments": [
    "I feel much more confident about submitting papers to conferences, putting together an academic panel, and constructing a bibliography than I did before the course.",
    "The assignments didn't really teach us anything about research. I do not feel better situated to approach comps and\/or orals. \"Learning\" how to format a footnote is not a worthwhile course goal. I don't feel that I learned anything new from any of the assignments. Doing the practice \"conference presentation\" may have been useful for some people.",
    "I think a course like this--that is, one which first year PhD students would take in their five\/six-year programs--is essential, even for people who will only complete the MFA portion of our Dramaturgy program. Knowing how to write an academic paper, how to give a conference talk, and how to do research isn't intuitive knowledge we all come into this program already having. This class and its mission was as close as I felt all year to being close to proper academia, and heaven forbid that should happen in a three-year MFA program. Some people might complain that this was too academic(icky), but I say that a program like ours has a responsibility to give us ALL equal training, no matter our intended final area of focus. This program has a great task of balancing different career tracks, different practices, and a class like Research Methodologies (perhaps poorly titled) has an important counterbalancing role to play in a program of study that has six years of criticism classes that focus not on academic writing but writing for magazines, the art of writing, etc. (all of which is great and I love and is definitely a strength of our program). The academic research paper is its own beast, that should be tackled honestly and with full force. Our program should be as competent as any other humanities PhD and as any other (arts) MFA. While some might say that we write enough term papers for our academic courses, I say that none of these term papers come with a whole semester-long course on how to write them. Writing a research paper shouldn't have to be just a frantic end-of-the-year exercise in regurgitation and poorly done research. All dramaturgs (at YSD) should know what it means to enter a scholarly debate. It can only make the quality of our thought better, and will put us right on par with other institutions of higher learning (see Chicago's one-year MA in the Humanities and NYU's one-year MA in Performance Studies).",
    "I would say half of the assigned reading helped me in my research endeavors. Much of the reading overlapped with theory (particularly the performance studies reading.",
    "Though the original syllabus had some projects that felt separate from the aims of the course (writing a program note, for example), Scott was willing to drop it so that we could focus on the long-term research project."

   "comments": [
    "We discussed each reading during class, which was very helpful to understanding many of the major theoretical approaches that are operative in the Academy today. Having a student do a pr\u00e9cis for each of the readings was also very productive and helped prompt the discussions.",
    "It was too much reading. For the most part the reading was far outside the field, so we were only reading it for the sake of the discussion rather than a larger purpose. But the discussions never felt all that worthwhile (I don't think we needed practice at \"applying\" literary theory to dramatic texts; this is something we do all the time without practice, and learned how to do in college). So it felt like a lot of unnecessary readying.",
    "*The amount of reading assigned was PERFECT. Other dramaturgy courses that favor breadth over depth could take some notes from this class's precise syllabus. *As for the assigned reading itself, I felt that the critical reading we did often was shoehorned into a discussion of the primary text. Maybe there are more fitting theories to read? Or conversely, more fitting plays for the theory?",

   "comments": [
    "Having Lindsay King come to class and talk about online tools to help build a bibliography was very helpful!",
    "For the sake of this question I'm considering the websites we looked at to be \"supplementary materials.\" The most worthwhile part of the course was the various web resources (ie. digital humanities sites, \"the professor is in,\" etc.). But we could have just been given a list of these sites rather than spending class time on looking at them.",
    "*Lindsay King is an asset to any classroom. She was a great resource for our research. *Going to the NYPL Performing Arts Library (even though I didn't get to go with the class due to a work-study conflict for the Rep) is a great trip to make. Sometimes people don't know the wealth of resources available to them. Maybe there should be a requirement to have some of this archival research become part of the research paper??? That way the trip could serve some grander purpose than just a visit. I've been to that library before as an undergraduate and was asked to incorporate part of my research there into my term paper. It was a tough experience scheduling wise but completely worth it. *Maybe the class can ditch the close reading of plays in favor of having a course focused on writing an academic research paper including conference papers, talks, etc. This would involve trips to do primary research either here at our wonderful libraries or New York. It would definitely be more interactive and perhaps fruitful for all parties involved, even those who consider themselves exclusively production dramaturgs. Everyone wins! Also, it could be a great exercise before casebooks in the third year. *The course should take RESEARCH to heart. How do we do it? Where do we do it? An advantage of this course was having us read contemporary theory being written in academic circles. This is essential, especially for those of us catching up to the current conversations being had in our discipline.",

Secondly, the course was about familiarizing the students with major theoretical approaches that people are currently using (Derrida, Judith Butler, Joseph Roach, etc.) and how these theoretical frameworks might inform a reading of a theater text.",
    "They weren't presented. I only feel like I have a sense of the goals from speaking with other faculty and students who took the course (or suggested the need for the course) in years past. The goal of the course, as I understand it, was to help us prepare for comps\/orals\/academic papers. I would not have known this from the course itself, though.",

I found memorizing or paraphrasing my nascent research in any way very daunting and I'm sure it made the material I was presenting far less coherent.",
