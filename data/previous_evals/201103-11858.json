   "comments": [
    "If you are taking this class, it is probably because you are a PSYC major and it is required. If you can, take the class with Professor White, she is hilarious and really laid back which made the class much more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise. We had 5 problem sets, 2 midterms, weekly labs and a final. None were too difficult.",
    "easiest class i have ever taken!! and a pretty good intro to SPSS",
    "If you are a pre-med looking for a math credit, definitely take this class! Its a lot less stress than multivariate, and the concepts you learn are a lot more applicable.",
    "Definitely take this class if Professor White is teaching it- she made it awesome! There are only 5 problem sets and the tests are not bad.",
    "Statistics for psychology!",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a comprehensive overview of basic statistics. We moved really quickly in the class but it was a pace that was not impossible to keep up with. Definitely take it if Professor White is teaching again! I know they've had some problems with staff in this class previously but Marney was simply the best! I did a brief amount of stats in high school and this class was way better organized. I learned a lot and now really understand how to interpret studies!",
    "Yes. It's useful to learn if you're studying social sciences.",
    "Take it if you want to understand the language of psychology.",
    "YES! Take it with Marney White, she is great (in an awkward\/nerdy sort of way...it may take a few lectures, but you will fall in love with her.) Also the material wasn't that difficult, and the workload wasn't that bad. A good way to get a stats requirement for your major, or just a QR credit.",
    "I don't think it's worth taking unless you are a psych major.",
    "Take it!",
    "The material wasn't that interesting, but very applicable to psychology classes, so at least it was helpful. If you're not a psych major, probably not worth taking it - covers stats tests that are mostly for behavioral sciences.",
    "If you need the credit, take it.",
    "If you need a not too difficult QR credit or are a psych major, take it. Even if you haven't taken stats for you probably already know like the first third of the course. If Marney White is still teaching it, the tests are super straightforward. Labs can be a little annoying, but it's actually really helpful to know how to use SPSS, especially as a psych major.",
    "This course was actually surprisingly good, especially for a required course. I would definitely recommend it to psych majors (as opposed to taking the other stats class that can be used for the major), and I wouldn't discourage non-psych majors who want to take a statistics class from taking this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "This would be a great 5th credit; I never went to class but homework wasn't too hard to figure out, section is pretty easy and I still managed to do well on exams.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're a psych major (you have to anyway) or if you're looking for a fun, relatively easy QR credit. Professor White actually managed to make statistics fun, which is impressive. She's REALLY funny and makes the lectures really enjoyable. The textbook is easy to follow, there's not much homework, and tests are not hard at all. There's no downside - I highly recommend you take it.",
    "Recommend if you want an easy QR",
    "Yes. Great, solid intro.",
    "Sure! Learning how to run different types of statistical tests isn't always the most interesting thing in the world, but this class definitely makes it more engaging by usingreal examples from the headlines. Overall, I would say this course is a fantastic way to fulfill statistics requirements!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to fulfill a QR and to all psychology majors who have to take this course anyway. Professor Marney White is very sweet and accommodating. She administered two finals, one during finals week and another on the last day of class - students could choose to take the exam on eitherday. There are three exams none of which were too difficult although since the grades aren't based on a curve, you need to get over 90% to get an A-. The homework assignments can be rather long but they are still very doable and not too difficult. In fact they are a great way to practice all the material learnt in class. There is also a mandatory lab section that all students need to attend; you'll learn how to use the statistical software SPSS which can be useful in checking answers of homework assignments. However, there is no exams for SPSS. Since this is psychology statistics some of the material that we learn is perhaps more useful for the social sciences such as Analysis of Variance but overall its a great course.",
    "Acceptable as a QR.... but unless you're friends with psychology majors in the course it could get a little dull.",
    "Pretty straightforward class. Help is always available when needed.",
    "Take it, this is a very good stats class.",
    "I would highly recommend this. Although statistics is a fairly boring subject, I felt this was the most interesting one I have taken thus far. Professor White does an excellent job of explaining the material in lecture and the problem sets (although long and tedious) greatly prepared you for the tests.",
    "If you already have taken a statistics class, this course should be a breeze. The problem sets are out of the book and the tests are not designed to be tricky. It is a nice class to take if you already have a loaded schedule.",
    "Take it only if you need to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Psychology major. It teaches invaluable skills that will be crucial for the study of psychology at Yale and beyond.",
    "PSYC200 is a good statistics course - it starts off on a very basic level, but soon you get to the really interesting and complex analysis and you begin to understand what statistics really means. The SPSS sections were also useful in conducting analyses. As an MCDB major, I definitely learned a lot about statistics and was even able to apply it in my research. Professor White is great and very approachable! The homework assignments are not too hard as well, and allow you to actually apply the material as it normally becomes jumbled in your head.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Professor White was lovely - funny, straightforward, no nonsense. She cares about the material and her students' learning. She does not create unnecessary challenges, just enough to ensure that each student learned what they needed to conduct and understand psychological statistics. She uses real world examples to keep the dry material relevant.Psych 200 is a great, manageable QR, and if you need this class for the major, take it with Professor White.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course \u0096 I shopped the Stats 103 course during Shopping Period, and chose Psychology 200 instead, because I felt the environment was more tailored to learning and grasping subject matter. Psychology 200 was manageable and fair; problem sets were useful and were constructed to assist one on the two mid-term exams and final exam.",
    "Yes, this was a great class to take in terms of learning about various tests to conduct. It helped in learning about research methods. However, it does not teach you the mathematical rigor behind statistics (which is actually good, b\/c this stuff is more important). Take this class -- it's manageable and Prof White makes it relatively fun. Plus you learn SPSS, which is a cool program.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking for a QR. I took it as a History major and its one of the best decisions I have made so far. Prof. White is awesome and she never fails to make the class laugh during lectures. Labs are a breeze and actually pretty fun, being able to just put in numbers and have graphs and charts tell you everything you need to know. Problem sets are easy, although the later one's take a few hours to complete. Overall, this was a pretty fun and easy way to get a QR.",
    "Yes, teaches you all you need to know about research",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone that needs to take statistics. Professor White was great, and the class was not too hard. From what I hear it is easier and better taught than other stats courses offered.",
    "Yes, it's required for the psych major, but it's not bad at all! So far it's the only QR class I've taken at Yale, and it was much less painful than I thought it would be!",
    "This class is a refreshing change from other courses you will take at Yale. The class is very slow paced; expect to spend a week talking about the mean, median, and mode. Yet coming out of the class, you really do feel like you've learned everything you need to know. Also, everyone gets an A. Take it.",
    "Yes, take it. Very little time and effort required, but you still learn statistics.",
    "Really amazing course, teacher (Prof. White) makes the otherwise-complicated subject easy to understand and learn. You will learn valuable information about how psychological studies function in terms of statistical significance in the findings.Hint: studying the lecture power-point slides and the HW questions will get you an A, since they focus on the important topics, helping you learn them really well. Missing a few lectures here and there is completely ok.I took stats AP couple years ago in high school and got a 5.",
    "Decent course, you will learn a lot about statistics. Workload, overall, is not very high.",
    "Psyc 200 is a great intro stats course. It covers a very manageable amount of material. Not too time consuming."
