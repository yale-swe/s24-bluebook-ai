   "comments": [
    "The class was all about the analysis of literature and how authors use words and syntax to convey meaning. I would recommend the class only if you are interested in literature and not necessarily looking to improve your writing skills. You will learn to read text better, but there isn't much emphasis placed upon improving writing itself.",
    "yes. interesting subject matter. great teacher.",
    "Yes. This class is a great way to transition into college writing.",
    "English 115 is a great way to hone your writing skills through analyzing novels. It is great practice for learning how to do close readings and developing skills that will help you in later writing ventures. I highly recommend it as a class.",
    "Do not take this course. It did not improve my writing very much, and I rarely found any of the books we read in class to be of any merit at all. The discussions were such a pain in the ass and waste of time because no one in my class ever offered any real perspective to anything (you will probably find a similar group of people in your class since this is a freshmen engl class, and rarely do freshmen exceed mediocrity). This class was the bane of my semester. Christine is nice, but really, just nice - that's it. She was never all that enlightening or awe-inspiring. Do not take this course. I am telling you.",
    "Yes, would recommend it, good way to improve your writing skills without ruining your GPA",
    "If you are really into classical literature \/ romance then this is a good class to take. I took this class thinking that the theme \"Sacrifice and Martyrdom\" would be a really cool one to explore through literature, but the books and poems we read were tenuously connected to that theme at best. The class was taught well, but be sure that the reading material is something that you would be interested in reading on your own before taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115b for a fellow student, as I have learned a lot."
