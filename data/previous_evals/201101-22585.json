   "comments": [
    "It's a good amount of work, but a great way to learn French.",
    "If you want a basic knowledge of conversational French and are willing to do the nightly work\/exercises for it, definitely take French 120. The video, French in Action, is both instructive and fun.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class. I am blown away with how much French I have learned over the course of this year. I would say, however, that the section teacher is EXTREMELY important; I had a great one second semester, which really made all the difference.",
    "Incredible course with fantastic teachers. French in Action can be a bit tedious and outdated at times, but this is part of the charm of the class. Anyone slightly interested in learning French should definitely check out Yale's French Department.",
    "It is a more interesting upgrade from French 110. I highly recommend taking it with Mme Skorupa.",
    "The weekly oral and written tests are definitely difficult, but overall help you immensely. Most of the french professors are outstanding and really engage the students. Although there is a large amount of daily work, it is definitely a valuable course and I finally felt like I could communicate well in the language at the end of this course.",
    "MADAME SKORUPA IS AMAZING. I ended up with her by accident when Ngame's class was full but I'd strongly recommend her over everyone. She was miles ahead of my first semester French professor, in that she was able to push everyone into participating even when we were quiet and didn't get frustrated or give up. Definitely take her section. FiA is still sort of stupid but it works. Don't do what I did and do the workbook the day of the exam - really try to space it out over the week (but you knew that from first semester).",
    "Continue with French. You will not regret it. Just find a good professor and do your best. The French and Action program is very effective."
