    "Out-of-date and\/or repetitive slides. Many were the same from CEMS. Lectures were also way too slow without enough detailed content. Felt more like high school than grad school level.",
    "I understand the need for a practical aspect of the course. Yet, some of the projects fall under the lets-get-this-over-with category, which defeats the purpose. I believe people in general were more interested in getting to know the tools a little better rather than having to do a project. Project satisfaction also hinges on level of commitment with classmates, which is highly unpredictable and predictably inconsistent, given the amount of work needed for this and many other projects during the semester.",
    "lectures",
    "Examples. Same examples were used again and again to explain different concepts. Many concepts\/topics were repeated way too many times. Every class, every topic and slide must be new. So many diagrams and topics were repeated more than once.More real life examples of who is using these concepts and for what, to take what kind of decisions at national level, legal level, political level and to address business risks, if covered, would make class more interesting.",
    "More consistent application of software tools throughout the course,",
    "The lectures were sometimes slow and redundant. A more interactive teaching approach may have been valuable.",
    "The concepts presented in the lecture were all interesting and usually for students who would like to focus on Industrial Ecology. However, since this is a graduate level course would have appreciated more opportunities to learn and practice the tools presented in these lectures including modeling, forecasting, etc. Not many classes, other than LCA, are offered that would impart these skills. The MFA and LCA assignments were beneficial and would hope for more of those types of assignments.",
    "Communication about the group projects was fractured and incomplete, and we found ourselves pretty much alone in the planning process. For our project things needed to move faster than our TF was willing to move, so we had to take things upon ourselves and hope they worked out, which thankfully they did.",

If we all read them we should have been able to extend the conversation and learn more in class without the need to reiterate everything we had just read. A summary could have been provided in power point form to accomplish that purpose.",
