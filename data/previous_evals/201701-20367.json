    "Remember all of those ridiculous math operations you learned about in differential equations that seemed useless and unnecessarily complicated? This class is where you use them! This course is all about using mathematical operations to generate and manipulate signals, images, and data. It starts off slow but picks up quickly; by the end, you'll know how to code the rudiments of a facial recognition algorithm from scratch. Nevermind that the lectures can be low-energy quite often... If you focus on the course material, you'll gain a lot from this course.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely useful for developing skills in computational data analysis. It's also very low-key, which was kind of refreshing for a BME class. Exams were open book, open notes, open problem set, open computer, which really helped to put the emphasis on understanding how to use the math we develop in class rather than on memorizing the equations. The biggest weakness of the course is the lectures, which can become rather slow and dull at times. But those moments are relatively few and far between.",
    "The course is fairly dry material and this makes people generally unengaged with it, but I don't know if that's something that can really be fixed.",
    "Would have appreciated a bit more updated material: I don't think people use Bode plots or Simulink in both academia and the workplace. Powerpoint lectures could have been a bit more engaging.",
    "I really liked how the course was structured, moving from 1D signals to 2D images, and I thought both professors did a good job of explaining the material. I also really liked the real-life application problems; the cardiovascular modeling was my favorite part of the course.",
    "Both professors are nice, but not the best at teaching ever. Duncan is pretty good but his handwriting is really hard to understand. Staib is a really mellow talker, low volume and kinda hard to pay attention to. They definitely tried and cared about the students though, so I liked them. The material isn't the most exciting, except for the vessels modeling part. Definitely try to go to section, since that's mostly where I actually learned how to apply the knowledge taught. The exams are open notes, but long so make sure you study anyways."

   "comments": [
    "You're likely only taking this because you're a BME major, if so its an okay class. Duncan is much more interesting and engaging. If you are not BME, don't take it. Heavy math involved.",
    "If you want a low-key but rigorous course that will leave you with a useful set of data skills, this is a great class. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth giving this course an honest try.",
    "It's a fine course that you have to take for BME major. You won't be thrilled by it, but its not at all that bad. Weekly psets and an open note midterm and final.",
    "BENG 352 is a straightforward class. Definitely go to Allen's sections he's great. Tests are open note\/book so nothing is too bad.",
    "This course is required for all BME majors, so while I would not recommend this course to non-majors, I thought it was very well organized and applicable to future biomedical engineering problems. I also really liked that there were connections in the material to BENG 351 and BENG 353, like when we modeled the cardiovascular system as a set of signals.",
    "If you're BME you have to do it, so no point in trying not to recommend it",
    "This is a pretty boring class, but it is very straightforward. The exams are open book and open note and are very fair. Duncan and Staib and the TFs are always there if you need extra help."
