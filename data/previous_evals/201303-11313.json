   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to any student interested in a hands-on class that involves working with an Arduino.",
    "Fun class working with Arduinos to complete little projects. Great for EEs and CS majors, EEs learn a bit more about programming and CS learn more about circuitry so they can help each other. There was a project due usually every class period, which was a lot of work. Also, there wasn't much feedback about how you were doing in the beginning of the semester so it was hard to know where you were at.",
    "Overall a great course that teaches both the fundamentals of digital systems at large and the more specific skills needed to make it applicable. The professor loves the material and teaching which are both contagious as the semester goes on. The projects start off easy but do grow in complexity quickly, make sure to stay on top of them. 10\/10 would take again",
    "This was a very fun class. You learn how to use a microcontroller. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend. You get credit for learning Arduino. If you like messing around with technology, it's a great find.",
    "Great class if you want to learn about microcontrollers and programming embedded electronics. Although the course uses Arduinos, you will be learning much more than you could learn from an Arduino hobbyist book. In fact you reimplement much of the Arduino standard library in C code, using registers and low-level commands which are applicable to any microcontroller system.Professor Kuc is a very enthusiastic teacher, and wants to see the effort students put into their assignments. This is not a class where you can half-ass the work.I had no previous electrical engineering experience, and picked up the necessary knowledge on the fly. A background in C programming is helpful, but not completely necessary either.",
    "While 348 gives some background on digital systems, its purpose is to get you familiar with the arduino for use during your final project and is focused on teaching that system, not to learning the general characteristics."
