    "We wrote a few papers and I have never been in a history class before so I wasn't familiar with that style of writing.",
    "This course covers beginnings of molecular biology, how the scientific community operates, and some of the effects the sciences had on society (for example, eugenics)",
    "Did not learn anything relevant to life",
    "I learned an overview of molecular biology in the 20th century.",
    "I learned how to write and think analytically and how to consider the numerous biological challenges and advances we have today in the context of historical settings.",
    "I learned mostly how to write in different methods, since the class was a cross between a science class and a history class. We had different assignments throughout the year, including a book report, a research paper, and an article analysis. I also learned about the history of certain methods and scientific technologies., and how model organisms were used.",
    "I learned a lot of about the history of important diseases and the study of life.",
    "Great overall course.",
    "In this course I learned some very interesting material on the beginnings of modern medicine. As a freshman, it was also a good introduction to academic structure at Yale, such as sections and writing assignments.",
    "I learned about the challenges and behind the scene stuff of great scientific discoveries.",
    "A thorough understanding of the history of molecular biology and the study of disease",
    "Good class if you're interested in the material. Lectures were a little plain, a lot of history facts, wish Summers could've given more of his analysis on the material during lecture instead of just tell us when a scientist was born, where he studied, what he discovered, etc.",
    "How scientific thought developed, gradually transformed throughout the decades",
    "I learned how to take a different approach towards biology. This class taught me how to look at biology in terms of a historic perspective rather than a science-based perspective, which has been the case in all biology classes i have taken at Yale so far."

   "comments": [
    "to focus more on disease",
    "The strengths is the low work load the weakness is that the lectures were not too exciting and we didn't focus on diseases as much as the title suggested we might.",
    "The subject matter was very interesting. The delivery was a bit dry. I do think lectures could use a bit more stimulation or interaction between Prof. Summers and students.",
    "Weakness was keeping students engaged in material",
    "The course was generally on interesting material, but the lectures tended to be dry and slides were overloaded with information. Additionally, feedback was late and sparse.",
    "The course could do with a general outline. The material is incredibly interesting and overall well chosen but when we're jumping between time periods or even groups of scientists it can seem in cohesive.",
    "I liked how this course presented molecular biology to me in a new light and how section nicely complemented the readings and lecture. However, I found that the lectures were a bit scattered at times with no clear logical order between classes and assignment guidelines were sometimes unclear. I also disliked the discrepancies in expectations between sections and the fact that we were not told of the final exam date until Thanksgiving Break.",
    "The lectures were not good and engaging but the slides contained good content. The lectures could be modeled a little bit differently in order to peak student interest.",
    "The course had really great readings that were engaging and fun to discuss during section. However, the content was very specific with too much information on certain topics.",
    "Very interesting lectures and assignments.",
    "The course was generally interesting with a lot of emphasis on independent reading. However, the material was sometimes very uninteresting and the lectures were quite varied.",
    "The assignments were very vague and the students did not receive support or guidance on how to complete the assignments or what was expected.",
    "Overall this was an interesting clas that presented a different perspective of evaluating molecular biology.",
    "The course material was interesting, but the organization of the lectures was difficult to follow.",
    "Not enough emphasis was placed on the content taught in the class, most of the focus was on the readings. Organization of the course was a bit scattered. The final project was very engaging and allowed for a lot of learning.",
    "Readings were very interesting, wish they could be incorporated into lectures more, lectures were actually pretty dull, section discussion was nice",
    "More examinations would be helpful",
    "The lectures could be more structured. Sometimes I did not know what the goal of the lectures were.",
    "The lectures are very interesting, but the weekly readings, although also very interested, can be a bit long and tough to understand for a non-science individual."

   "comments": [
    "It's a decent course. You get out what you put in. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to invest much, so I walked away with less insight than I had hoped, but I do appreciate what little I was able to distill from the course. Overall, I do suggest.",
    "Totally. I've been to a total of 3 lectures this semester. Take the final paper and this course will not be a factor in your life at all.",
    "If you are not interested in DNA, this is not the course for you. It functions as a science class without the SC credit.",
    "I would only recommend if the structure of the course was radically changed. The content is interesting but the way that the course is structured causes for less incentive to take in information (no evaluation of lecture material because final can be swapped out for research paper) and the lectures are very dry and dull.",
    "I would recommend if youre familiar with the expectations of a history class. As a biology major I was not. The class is not demanding at all and also will not cause you stress.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a humanities that is low key, but somewhat interesting (if you are interested in the history of science). I do however, believe there are other humanities classes that would be more interesting.",
    "Yes, if you want an easy 5th class with barely any work. Also, none of it was related to the lecture material",
    "absolutely",
    "If you're interested in STEM and want to learn about molecular biology, you could definitely like this; it's a fine course overall. It's not really stellar in many respects though. Lectures and readings can get pretty dry, and sections sometimes don't connect the readings well to lecture. The workload is very low and the professor doesn't care much for grades, which is nice theoretically but sometimes means the grades were given back extremely late and with less feedback than was helpful.",
    "This class was not a bad way to get an Hu credit out of the way. It ended up being a bit more work than I expected (~100 pages of reading per week, 200-500 word reading responses each week, a newspaper article review, midterm book review, and 15-page final paper or exam), but that also depends on your TA. I liked getting a chance to see a different perspective on molecular biology. Lecture slides are always posted and he pretty much just reads off them, so I stopped attending class regularly later on in the semester. It does leave a lot to be desired in terms of organization though. There's no clear logical order between classes and significant discrepancies between sections. Guidelines for assignments can sometimes be unclear\/hard to find. We were also led to believe the final exam would be during reading period\/the last week of classes (I specifically asked about the date a few times). It wasn't until Thanksgiving Break that we were told it would be on the last day of exams which sucked because a lot of people had already bought tickets to go home and were forced to write the paper instead.",
    "Yes; this course while not modeled for optimum student engagement, was very interesting and challenged my writing and recall skills.",
    "No, I would not recommend this class to another student. I stopped going to lecture after the 2nd or 3rd class because I found myself either falling asleep or doing other work in class- it is not an engaging course at all. And the only assessments are outside of class with your own research so class was irrelevant. I do not recommend this class, it was a waste of money.",
    "Yes. Easy and interesting history class. Professor Summers is nice and knows what he is talking about. Relative information and discussions",
    "Yes.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course, the structure of work is open and facilitates a students schedule, particularly during finals.",
    "This course was interesting but the assignments never had clear instructions and the grading was ambiguous.",
    "It is a good humanities credit for a STEM student. You will learn about the history behind some of the 20th centuries greatest scientific discoveries.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course especially to a student who is studying biology and would like to complement their science with a humanities course that allows you to contextualize their study of biology.",
    "If you are interested in a historical perspective to biology, this is a great course to take.",
    "Good class if you need a humanities credit. Two short essays and a final paper. The grading on the class, however, isn't as easy as you think. The shortest essay was only one page double sided but graded pretty harshly. But overall no regular homework or exams unless you op in for the final exam instead of the final essay",
    "Fun and interesting class! Not a huge workload, though readings are a lot",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, especially to a science major because this course offered me a different point of view on many biological concepts."
