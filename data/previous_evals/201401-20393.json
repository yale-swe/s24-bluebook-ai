    "This language is not easy but it's super interesting and fun to learn. Take this if you want to challenge yourself with something really different.",
    "Great class if you're prepared to learn Russian.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class as a low-stress, but effective way to learn Russian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Russian--I learned a lot and the class was also a lot of fun.",
    "Great class and same drill as the first semester. As compared to the fall, there is a lot more content in the spring, so make sure that you are staying on top of the textbook reading and vocab. By the end of this semester, you will be having conversations, reading short stories, and even writing in an essay contest. It is amazing how much you learn in these two semesters with Prof. Titus.",
    "Spectacular way to get a toehold in the language. The workload is reasonable, and the instruction is very thorough. If you have an interest in Russian, I highly recommend the course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It's a chance to learn a really interesting language with the structure and discipline to make you learn it well."
