    "Interesting language and fairly easy to learn. It's a lot of fun because the professors don't make it unnecessarily time-consuming. Class time could be used far more efficiently, however.",
    "strengths are that the professor is very nice and understanding for athletes, it could be improved by not being everyday and up in ben frank",
    "Possible difficulty understanding sometimes during class due to nature of the language.",
    "The course is a very welcoming environment and nice to learn bahasa Indonesia in. Pak Indriyo and the TA's are very invested in making sure that we know the language and care about us and our own concerns. The course does not have a lot of structure, however, which can make it hard to follow sometimes. More regular homework would be nice to help supplement the class work.",
    "The professor is so kind, helpful and the class is fun and engaging. On the other hand, lessons can get a bit disorganized.",
    "The course was awesome maybe more test prep",
    "Improved a lot with my comprehension",
    "The class room environment was great - really enjoyable everyday.",
    "Strengths: prof and TAs are very nice and understanding of everything Weaknesses: could use a bit more notice about when deadlines are"

    "Yes, the professor and TFs are phenomenal and create an inclusive environment where people are excited and engaged to learn about the indonesian language and culture. They emphasize truly learning over memorizing for tests and exams, this is dissimilar to another Yale language course I have taken.",
    "Yes- so much fun and not a new source of stress.",
    "yes i would because its a really fun class",
    "Absolutely, enjoyed the teachers and what the language had to offer.",
    "If you are looking for a fun language where you get to learn about a cool culture and have a nice, small community, this is a great course. If you are looking for structure in learning, it may be better to look elsewhere.",
    "Yes the professor is awesome!!!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the combination of enjoyment and learning makes it a very healthy classroom environment.",
    "Yes! Indonesian is such a cool language and Pak makes the class so that you learn a lot but its not boring at all"
