    "CPSC 445 is low workload, but you don't learn too much. Office hours are helpful to understand the problem sets, but beyond that there is not too much learning. If you're looking for a low-workload CS elective, this is the course for you.",
    "You generally know what you're getting into with Rocklin's classes. The first two pset were really easy. The third one was a bit unfair. Complexity and run time was a huge component in the third one and if you hadn't taken CPSC 323 (like me), you were basically screwed. It became an assignment about knowing computer science and C rather than knowing the algorithm and the math behind it. Overall, I didn't learn that much and felt very frustrated by ease of the first two psets but then the horror of the last one. If you want to take an easy CS elective, take CPSC 440. If you want to learn actually data mining, take STAT 365.",
    "If you need a CS elective and want an easy one, take it. Data mining is an interesting topic, but this class doesn't really go into depth. If you're interested in the material, self-study. Honestly, I think the main reason to take this class is because it's a fairly low-commitment class for the major, unlike the rest of them.",
    "If you're reading this, you know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "You don't really learn a whole lot in lecture, so no one really even shows up, but the problem sets are pretty interesting and you learn some cool numerical techniques.",
    "If you already know C, very straight forward course.",
    "easy, but beware your grade is determined by 3 psets that are easy to fail because there are no test cases.",
    "Looking for a relatively easy CS credit, with some sort of interesting assignments, that requires no lecture attendance? This is it. Must know C, and have a willingness to translate wikipedia entires into code. That's about it. Last would've been challenging without having written large C programs before, but was a cool data structure to implement. I do wish I had the time to attend lecture just for the experience of Rokhiln, but my impression is that most take this class for an extra credit.",
    "No. As easy as it is, it's pretty stressful, and you with only 3 problem sets you really don't know what's going to happen. That said, it's as easy as everyone says and if you've got a busy schedule it's a nice break. The p sets can actually be kind of fun too."
