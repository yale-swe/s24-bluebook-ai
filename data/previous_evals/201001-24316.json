    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "I would recommend CLCV 411 to any student with a substantial background in Roman history and historiography. You shouldn't take this as your first CLCV or Roman history course, but it would make a good third or fourth semester in the field.",
    "Historians of the Roman Empire is an extremely interesting look at Rome through the lens of those who have written about it. It raises questions of historiography especially pertinent to ancient history. The first half of the course covers ancient sources, and the second half covers modern writers. Professor Matthews is very knowledgeable on the field, and furthermore when it comes to the modern historians often has great personal anecdotes about them (at the end of the lecture on Syme, he showed us Syme's honorary degree from the Sorbonne which had been given to him as a gift). This class is a must for anyone interested in Roman history, and especially useful if taken in conjunction with the survey course (HIST 218), also taught by Matthews.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You get a delectable pu pu platter of the greatest ancient and modern writers of the Roman and early Byzantine empire, as well as the wonderful 'storytime' environment that Matthews provides. Where else would I have learned that Ronald Syme was a pinch-penny (Matthews was his colleague)?For the final paper you can write about pretty much anything you want on writers from Augustus to the early Byzantines as well as any modern historian."
