   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of named reactions and total synthesis. This course teaches me how to design a retrosynthetic route.",
    "I was exposed to many types of reactions that I never knew existed and learned a bit about strategic planning for a total synthesis of a complex molecule. I have a new found appreciate for chemists in the field of total synthesis.",
    "I learned SO MUCH chemistry this semester. It was so difficult, but I'm also glad to have gotten the chance to take the course. I kind of wish that I had gotten the chance to take synthetic methods first though.",
    "Well designed class, went through a lot of material but everything was important.",
    "This course exposed me to a variety of synthetic methods, research papers, and total syntheses.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the synthesis of natural products, as well as synthetic techniques and mechanistic details for important reactions.",
    "Introduced the classic synthetic toolkit as well as more modern, cutting-edge transforms and strategies. Sharpened analytical thinking and creativity.",
    "Interesting syntheses, retrosynthetic analysis, forward synthesis development",
    "Looooots of reactions, total syntheses, and retro analysis!",
    "I learned reaction mechanisms and reaction conditions I did not previously know.",
    "This course widely improved my knowledge of robust, commonly used reactions. I also feel as though I better understand the basics of synthetic planning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We focused on one to three total synthesis in each lecture, which is really great. We can learn every details in their routes and have time to remember them. Sometimes the writing is not clear. It would be better if all of the homework can be corrected and returned.",
    "Seth is a really excellent teacher, even if he didn't want to be teaching the class some days. There is so much material discussed in the class that it is nearly impossible to absorb even half of it though. Additionally, the problem sets are extremely challenging and since the published synthesis is the answer key, if you deviate from that one route, you don't get full credit. It discourages the students from being creative and thinking through the problem on their own since they know that their idea will not align with the published route. I wish the answer key could be a bit more flexible.",
    "I really wish we had had at least one midterm exam throughout the course. Even having stayed on top of the material to the best I could while balancing my other courses (including copying down my notes from every lecture) and having done all the problem sets, I felt really stressed when it came down to having to study an absurd amount of material in such a short amount of time. It also was just really hard to know what to study (and I was disappointed by how little of what seemed to be the important content of the course ended up being tested on the exam). I do feel like I really learned a lot during the class, and would prefer that this is reflected by how I did in the end, but even if not, I feel much better prepared for graduate school. My biggest suggestion would be to have more general transformations and then apply it to synthesis, rather than showing us specific syntheses and expecting us to be able to apply things more generally.",
    "The course was really well designed and I think the powerpoint mixed in with the blackboard was a good idea. A previous course I took could not cover as much with only sticking to the blackboard. I think there was never anything that I thought was a waste to learn, but just wish the whole class system was better organized because I feel like this would be an excellent class in a two class system in which the first one talks about organic reactions.",
    "The course was very well organized and presented a large variety of information.",
    "The strength of the course is in its content. It's super useful stuff to know. The weakness is that it tends to be a lot all at once and that the material assigned does not 100% align with what is taught. The assignments tend to assess your ability to analyze for disconnections and think retrosynthetically, whereas the majority of the course tends to deal with reactions in the forward direction.",
    "Greater flexibility in assessing students' syntheses would be nice, although it is understandable that having a fixed answer key is the most pragmatic approach.",
    "The mix of power points and chalkboard was smooth and easy to follow. I liked having the slides to go back to as a reference if I miss something said in class. The reading quiz system worked well too. It's hard to read every single one of the readings assigned but both the papers and especially the textbooks for the class are valuable resources."

   "comments": [
    "This is the most important class for organic students. You can learn a lot of named reactions and total synthesis. Meanwhile, it teaches you how to organize your knowledge and how to think like a real chemist.",
    "I would recommend auditing the class so that you can be exposed to the material but don't feel the pressure of trying to master it.",
    "If you take it as an undergrad, make sure that you have support in the class, because it's a lot. Stay on top of your notes, and stay positive. You will learn a lot, and you won't be able to retain all of it, but if you plan to go to grad school for orgo, there is no better course than this to prepare you for it.",
    "If anyone is interested in organic synthesis, this was definitely the most useful class I took this semester",
    "Yes. This class was very challenging but I feel that my synthetic planning and retrosynthetic skills have improved.",
    "Yes. It is a little tougher than other courses, but it's a good class.",
    "Definitely yes if you want to do synthesis",
    "Great class for undergrads to take if they want to improve their synthetic organic chem. Its intense and not grade-focused, which is nice, but it may be a bit frustrating because it might not feel like you're making much progress til the end. highly recommend!!",
    "This course was useful for those thinking about total synthesis, so yes I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. The course is very challenging but worthwhile. I have an improved grasp of many useful chemical reactions.",
    "I would recommend this course to undergraduate students who are planning to study organic synthesis in graduate school."
