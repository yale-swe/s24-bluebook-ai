   "comments": [
    "Learned about linguistic patterns, trends, and why dialects are where they are in the US. The ArcGIS software used in class was also really interesting to learn and dabble with.",
    "Learned a lot of dialectical theory, along with how to use ArcGis software.",
    "I gained a practical knowledge of ArcGIS, learned some of the history behind American linguistics, studied the methodology of former linguistics and critiqued their choices, and had my prior perceptions about Linguistics and American English challenged.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of American dialectology and the possibilities for the future of the field. I gained a working knowledge of ArcGIS and ArcMap, as well as the ability to analyze large amounts of data and draw broad conclusions from my analysis.",
    "I learned about dialectometry, linguistics, and the practicalities of mapping. Additionally, I learned how to gain useful information by analyzing raw data.",
    "How to use ArcGis (and a series of other tools), and how to think critically about data.",
    "I expected this course to be a lot of learning about who says what where, and that was very much the case. The thing I didn't realize was how much computer work there was. We learned how to use ArcGIS, a mapping software so we could visualize dialect variation across the US.",
    "I developed skills in a mapping software called ArcGIS, which allows users to manipulate data in order to see\/discover various geographic patterns in linguistic variation. I also (somewhat) used Excel to explore non-geographic patterns in linguistic variation (i.e. by race, age, gender, etc). This course emphasized exploratory analysis of linguistic variation within the United States, which (I think) is an enriching experience and facilitates creative analytical thinking.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of how to use ArcGIS and also learned a lot about linguistics. We focused mainly on syntactic differences throughout the United States. However, we also looked at dialect and lexicon differences across the USA and around the rest of the English-speaking world.",
    "I learned a little about the basics of linguistics, but a lot about the dialects of English. I also learned how to use the mapping software ArcGIS and think critically.",
    "I learned basics in linguistics and dialectometry and developed proficiency in ArcGIS Pro, a mapping program.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of linguistics and how to map linguistics patterns using GIS software."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class moves at a very reasonable pace, with usually a single interesting reading\/homework assignment a week. The professor gives very interesting insights on linguistics that I would never had to chance of knowing without taking the class. A weakness is the ArcGIS tool could get annoying and could altogether stop working",
    "Course was somewhat disorganized, and so some of the classes didn't feel like they contributed much to the overall course. Also, sometimes readings weren't discussed until weeks later.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject with an extremely enthusiastic professor, very student-driven, project-based, supplied practical and theoretical knowledge at once! Weaknesses: very few, given that this was the first class. Discussions can be dominated by a few outspoken voices at the expense of other students. Many of the issues revolved around using ArcGIS and trying to resolve the technical difficulties surrounding it, as well as the lack of computers equipped with ArcGIS Pro around campus for Mac users.",
    "The class is very interesting and covers a range of topics within American dialectology. Professor Wood makes an effort to include articles about American English beyond Anglo-American dialects. At times I wished that we had time to delve deeper into certain readings and topics.",
    "This was a great introduction into linguistics, particularly on syntactic variation. Having students from all over the US, additionally, made it personally engaging and Dr. Wood gave great presentations summarizing linguistic concepts. There were some issues with using ArcGIS this semester but I assume those have been ironed out. Use of ArcGIS Pro and its batch functionality saved a lot of time. Papers from Swiss German were used to learn about ways to analyze data but could be a little confusing.",
    "Course is stronger when it's bit looser in terms of schedule, but it could use some harder deadlines and requirements for Midterm and Final project. Prompts for projects may be helpful\/",
    "I really didn't know how much computer stuff was in this class. If I had known, I might not have taken this course. the ArcGIS software is not compatible with Macs so it was really hard to get the homework done because of my Apple laptop. It was really annoying how I had to go up to science hill (Yale has a few computers with the software) just to do my homework.",
    "Strengths: lots of exposure to ArcGIS to gain familiarity, professor is very interested in what he is teaching and what the students are exploring in their projects\/homework, lots of in-class participation\/discussion Weaknesses: sometimes dull and repetitive, not much teaching how to use Excel (not a huge problem - Google and the professor are always good resources)",
    "A strength is that the material was often very interesting and the topics were explained very well by the professor. A weakness is that sometimes the minute details of certain linguistic differences became a bit boring to me.",
    "Strengths include how much useful feedback Dr. Wood provided on our projects, the pretty light workload, and how much I learned about a topic I probably wouldn't learn about in any other setting. Although, sometimes the readings felt like a bit much and too detailed for what we were learning.",
    "I liked that the course was student-led and so open to what we were interested in exploring.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that this course is both practical and conceptual. One of the strengths of this course was in-class discussions of articles with such a linguistically and geographically diverse group of students. While the course was generally accessible to students without a linguistics background, the course did assume some prior knowledge of basic linguistics ideas and terminology."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you have any interest on how various dialects formed across the US, take the course. You also get to pick up on interesting grammatical structures by looking through the YGDP dataset over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, but only if they're interested in the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, especially those interested in a more statistical aspect of linguistics. This class should be fairly interesting for most students who are interested in evaluating the methodology behind past linguistic research and\/or those who want to try working on their own linguistic projects. Even those with no prior experience in these areas will learn how to use Excel and ArcGIS quite proficiently.",
    "Yes, the class is extremely interesting and well-organized. Professor Wood is an excellent instructor who makes an effort to make the class enjoyable.",
    "Yes! It was a great way to learn about American dialects and the concepts needed to understand them. It also helps in developing one's ability to map out complex data.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to Apple users because it is ten times harder to complete the tasks. This isn't really a flaw of THIS course, but taking a Linguistics class has permanently damaged my use of language. We kept hearing sentences that were NOT proper grammar and because of that repetition I found them more and more normal sounding. By the end of the course, I hardly flinched at sentences like \"Here's you a piece of pizza\" or \"First class tickets are expensive anymore\".",
    "I would recommend this course only to a student who enjoys analyzing data or would like more experience analyzing data, and perhaps is intrigued by language and its variation. If a student with no such interests is looking to take a fun course, this is not the course for them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. But, realize that you will be making a lot of maps and using ArcGIS, which is an extremely finicky application.",
    "Yes! But expect to learn more about how to literally map the dialects of American English than about the basics of linguistics.",
    "The class required a lot more computer program usage (ArcGIS, Excel, etc) than I had expected, but if youre at all interested in dialects\/linguistics, its a great class. Prof Wood is also so helpful and truly passionate about linguistics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because this course allows students to dabble in the field of linguistics and to close engage with a super interesting researcher"
