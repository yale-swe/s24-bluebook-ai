    "I learned how to make, read, and interpret vessels, especially those of ceramic and wooden media. From a pedagogical perspective, I learned that spatially dynamic courses (such as this one) are beneficial in a multiplicity of ways."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Cooke was duly committed to teaching us about vessels as made objects. By giving us an assignment for which we had to make a vessel, as well as the resources to do so--instruction by experts, video demonstrations, talks that featured live productions--we were trained to think about the creation of the vessel, which influences its iconography, form, and circulation. I believe that this unique emphasis of the course will train us to become better scholars more generally, who think about art and material culture in the terms of creation. Another strength of the crouse was its spatial dynamics. By experiencing and theorizing the subject matter of the course at the Yale Gallery of British Art, Furniture Study, Davenport pottery studio, and classroom, we learned more than we could have by being stagnant for 3 hours in the same space every week. This facet of the course was also a brilliant way of valuing the mental health of its students. I think diminishing the reading load for certain weeks would give rise to more focused and productive conversations.",
    "The course's strengths mostly have to do with how it was taught. Ned is an excellent instructor, and I really appreciated how the course made use of Yale's resources, such as the pottery exhibition at the YCBA and the Yale Furniture Study. I have a hard time even thinking of any weaknesses - the class was excellent in all aspects and if it were offered again I cannot think of a single thing to change."

    "Absolutely! I would recommend this class to anyone that works on objects that were, at some point, meant to be handled. It is a unique opportunity to tackle different approaches to the study of material culture that is applicable to many temporal and geographic areas."
