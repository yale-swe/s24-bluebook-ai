    "Very much enjoyed a direct evaluation of the role of media throughout all recent conflicts. Incredibly useful lens in evaluating how public perception is formed",
    "I learned quite a bit about the canon of war reporting, and also did a good bit of comparative study on how the West thinks about modern warfare that it's been involved in since Vietnam, which is a very interesting analysis.",
    "Analysis of journalism pieces, and just a genuine general greater increase of knowledge about the world and major conflicts of the past century. Coming from Asia, the information I've received has always been vaguely coloured with a pro-Asia, or just China-centric lens, and so it was truly eye opening to read all the stories.",
    "Media and Conflict explores a number of wars with the hope of getting you to think of the conflicts more broadly from a moral and philosophical perspective. Discussions usually start small and framed within one war, but then, they balloon outward to encompass larger questions about war and how it's covered by journalists and whether these portrayals are effective.",
    "I have a better understanding of how to read journalism with a critical eye, particularly conflict journalism.",
    "I gained a more critical eye for evaluating journalism",
    "An appreciation for journalism and writing essays with this niche of literature.",
    "An interesting class that relied heavily on class discussion.",
    "Wonderful course."

    "Great discussions, could have incorporated more active discussion of our reading responses",
    "Strengths is the cohesion of the course very well designed.",
    "I absolutely loved the course and all the reading. Though occasionally, there was a lot of reading we never got around to discussing, which was a bummer.",
    "The course might be improved through a different structure for final and midyear papers.",
    "I think the professor could have voiced his own ideas more. I would have liked to hear more of his own experiences in reporting in the field.",
    "Graeme Wood was a strength - a great professor, section leader and insightful in the art of journalism as well as political science Weakness - as a 9am, I think that discussion was curbed by people's sleepiness",
    "The course and its subjects are extremely interesting. The class discussion often lulled, but I think as a result of the students."

Discussions usually start small and framed within one war, but then, they balloon outward to encompass larger questions about war and how it's covered by journalists and whether these portrayals are effective. In this light, I would recommend this course to a fellow student as I believe it helps not only to expand a persons' discussion capabilities but also, reading repertoire if they decide to go into journalism.",

    "Yes, it was engaging and different to other political science courses.",
