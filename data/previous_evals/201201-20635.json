    "Hard class, should be taken for someone who wants to work in a field connected to solid state.Otherwise, the class doesn't really help for other domain of physics.",
    "yes",
    "This is a good class to take albeit one that will require its fair share of work and effort.",
    "yes",
    "Definitely! Doug Stone has really expanded my understanding of Solid State Physics and given me a whole new appreciation of the results discussed in my previous courses.",
    "This class is certainly recommended to any applied physics student and anyone entering the field of condensed matter physics research. Solid state physics is a field where the student should see a lot of topics come together. It was really fortunate that I saw the topics from my other studies intersecting in this course, including Landau theory of phase transitions from statistical mechanics and second quantization and many body wavefunctions from quantum mechanics.This may be more a reflection on last semeseter\u0092s course than this one, but I found thatreceiving an honors in solid state I did not necessarily mean that one will excel at in solid state II. They are very different courses."
