    "Totally would recommend this class! Be sure to do all the readings if you really want to get everything you can out of this class.",
    "take it!!!",
    "Definitely if you want to go into great detail about the art in the art gallery. Not a great overview of art history though. Really great opportunity to get to know the Yale Art Gallery.",
    "Take this class if possible. It's a good introduction to the methods of art history, but, much more importantly, also a great class. Taking the opportunity to study art in a small classroom with a professor and other students who are eager to learn was possibly the best decision I made in freshman year."
