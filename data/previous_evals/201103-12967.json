   "comments": [
    "A project a week, an allnighter a week, etc. Pretty sweet. Totally recommend it if you can handle the workload. Your portfolio looks pretty boss at the end of the semester.",
    "Long hours and late nights. But if you've made it this far you can take it. By the end you'll be amazed by how far you've come in your studio skills. Even the slowest workers will learn to move quickly to keep up with the pace. Only take this class (and by extension, join this major) if you think you will enjoy the incredible benefits architecture has to offer more than you will regret the things you will be giving up.",
    "Requirement.Get ready for A LOT of sleepless nights. Best way to deal with this class is to be in studio every minute of the day you have free - this is the way you can get sleep when you need it.Save up money - models are expensive.Photograph Everything the second they are done.They like hand-drawings. No laser-cut edges. Craft is important - but don't kill yourself over it.Professors are actually very nice if they like you - try not to hate them, but rather be friendly. It helps.",
    "The TA's are great. Always available (literally) and have really good opinions about what you're doing.",
    "If you're taking this course you're an architecture major and you have to. In that case get ready because it is a lot of work. Just remember that since most projects are only 1 week long its helpful to come up with ideas quickly so that you have the majority of the time to execute the project.",
    "This class is a real marathon. 12 assignments in 12 weeks. You are always producing! There is a feeling of satisfaction having completed it because you do a LOT of work, but I wish I could have developed a few of the projects more. It made me realize that architecture truly is an iterative process, and your initial idea is almost never the best solution to a problem.",
    "This course is very demanding. It will take priority over your other courses and probably most extracurricular activities. That being said, it is very rewarding at the end of the semester knowing that you were able to accomplish such a difficult course successfully.",
    "This is a difficult class that will force you to question whether you made the right decision when you signed on to the major. Hopefully you will walk away from this class with a greater appreciation of why you are here and what you think of architecture and architectural education - even if the opinions you form are quite different from the philosophy of the course. If you're deciding whether to take this class, my advice is to do what you love. If you love architecture take this class. If you love something else, be warned that architecture is a jealous friend who doesn't want you to have other loves.",
    "Keep an open mind - you will learn more from this course than you realize.",
    "It's a lot of work, but the work is enjoyable. Pray that the people in your class are friendly, because you will spend more time with them than with your roommates, girlfriends or boyfriends, or even friends! Buy a lot of RedBull and go for it! You'll have fun!"
