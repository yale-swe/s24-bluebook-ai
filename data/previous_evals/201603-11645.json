    "The course has given me a fresh set of eyes and the theoretical vocabulary to articulate and deepen my understanding of sociocultural phenomena. The syllabus focuses primarily on civil sphere theory and its application to a wide range of subjects. The benefits are not limited to an academic understanding and theoretical models, but extend to all kinds of social phenomena that we encounter on a daily basis.",
    "The course developed Civil Sphere Theory -- a really interesting culturally-inflected look at civic life and how it co-exists, regulates, and is interpenetrated with other spheres of social life (economic, familial, etc.). Also some good content on incorporation of minority groups into the mainstream, and the possibility of \"a global civil sphere\" -- a global regime to impose some sort of universalistic moral regulation."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course were the depth and nuance of civil sphere theory that were taught and the breadth of topics to which civil sphere analysis was applied. The seminar sessions were engaging and enlightening, thanks to a healthy dynamic between professor and students. Perhaps the course might be improved by spending a session going over criticisms and reactions to civil sphere theory within academia. But I am not certain that inclusion would be worth the necessary sacrifice of some other part of the syllabus. Overall, this was a very enjoyable course, and the ideas and skills that I learned through the readings and discussions will remain with me for a long time to come.",
    "Strengths: Good readings mostly -- lots of material from The Civil Sphere (Jeffrey Alexander's book, which established\/crystallized Civil Sphere theory). Weekly reading response assignments made sure everyone did the reading and had something to say about it. I enjoyed the opportunity to write on a subject of my choice for Final Paper. Weaknesses: The seminar was TOO SMALL to facilitate really interesting discussion, in my opinion. Also, I wish we'd had more guidance from Prof. Alexander for the final paper. The TF was very good, but talking about paper topics in class could have been helpful. Also, I found the book on Apartheid (the Thorn book) to be really a slog -- I'd cut that from the syllabus if this gets taught again in the same format."

    "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. The course has given me a fresh set of eyes and the theoretical vocabulary to articulate and deepen my understanding of sociocultural phenomena. The syllabus focuses primarily on civil sphere theory and its application to a wide range of subjects. The benefits are not limited to an academic understanding and theoretical models, but extend to all kinds of social phenomena that we encounter on a daily basis. I cannot recommend this course more highly.",
    "I would recommend heartily -- make sure there are enough people taking it though. (A really small seminar can fail to produce interesting conversations sometimes.) If possible, take a look at the main text: The Civil Sphere by Jeffrey Alexander before you take the plunge and take this course. It'll give you a flavor for his style of thought. If you have a chance to take \"Cultural Sociology\" with Prof. Alexander, I would take that before you take The Civil Sphere."
