   "comments": [
    "Take it if you like dancing! You will learn a lot about the thought proces of two incredible choreographers!",
    "I highly reccomend this course for anyone who's interested. You will learn through reading, writing, and dancing, making this course extremely engaging in many ways. The studio work is just as important as the homework, culminating in a final performance, so make sure to take learning the choreography seriously. However, don't worry if this seems daunting; Emily makes it extremely manageable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! You will not regret it. This is an amazing class. You will grow so much as a dancer and really learn to think about dance in a new way.",
    "Take this! course:) It's different and you won't be able to stop rehearsing the pieces on your own once you've learned them. I still find myself practicing Trio A, even after we've performed it!",
    "Emily Coates has a way of making her genius accessible to all levels, so even for a non-dancer this class was incredibly rewarding. Getting to put readings on the dance floor for closer examination--not something you can do in just any class.",
    "If you want to dance, this is a great class, as you will spend most of the two weekly meetings moving! I've never learned modern pieces like Trio A and Torelli, so it was a great learning experience, and we learned a lot of historical context. Coates is a great instructor, and she's worked personally with both choreographers.",
    "Advanced Dance Repertory is an incredible course if you are interested in dance. I don't mean just interested in dancing, though by all means take it for that reason. I mean interested in dance, in studying it, learning about it, and acknowledging it as worthy of academic pursuit and inquiry. A unique study of the movement and ideas of Twyla Tharp and Yvonne Rainer. Take it. Seriously.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student- if he\/she had a preconception that it was going to be an \"easy\" class, first I would slap that person, and then I would tell him\/her that in many ways, it was my most challenging class this semester and don't be ridiculous. I would advise the student not to neglect the readings, because they enormously enhanced our studio work. I would also encourage that person to really jump into the dancing with any qualms, because what you get out of the movement is proportional to how much you commit yourself to it. But overall I would just say that it was awesome and just do it."
