    "A great introduction to the field of ritual studies. Take it if you want to discuss why people do what they do.",
    "This class is a wonderful place to learn how to engage critically with issues in American culture. Feedback is given both during class and via email, so you constantly feel connected to your own progress and participation in the course. I would strongly recommend this course for not only American Studies majors, but also others interested in the topic of ritual in our culture.",
    "Definitely take this class! Kyle and Professor Muller are great people and even better professors. You'll be surprised by how applicable you'll find the subject - rituals really come up in everyday life. The books\/authors you read are really interesting, and you'll want to re-read at least one of the books again because it's such a great read. The workload isn't too bad - weekly 1 page reading response to 60-100 pages a week. Whenever we have a full book to read, it was either a quick read or split over 2 weeks or assigned over a break. I thought the workload was fair and the teaching was excellent. I had a really great group of students, but I think I would've enjoyed it even without that, just from Dean Muller and Kyle.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was interesting, engaging and unique. I walked away from the semester with a new way to approach societal happenings.",
    "Wonderful class--a great chance to think about a far too understated component of social life in a very flexible way. While the name of the course may seem extremely niche, don't hesitate to take it. I would recommend the class to anyone looking to gain a more nuanced understanding of tradition, habit, and social interactions of any kind. Also the profs. are hilarious, thoughtful, and well-prepared.",
    "A really great class! Super interesting readings and discussions. It is very heavy on theory, and is good for anyone with an interest in or wants to learn much more about ritual.",
    "If you're interested in American culture and society, and would like to gain a deeper understanding of the rituals that shape our life, then I would definitely take this class. The reading does a great job at framing the concepts and giving specific examples of analyses of rituals. The discussions in class are really engaging and can be entertaining because they often build from personal experience, making it perhaps unusual in that personal experiences are highly valued. Dean Muller and Kyle are great instructors and they create an environment that's both intellectual as well as fun every week, which I greatly appreciated. The reading responses every week require some effort but are not really difficult or long. The final paper is intense and will require a lot of hours and a lot of research. A pro is that you're completely free to choose your topic and so you can really write about something you care about. If you're looking for an engaging seminar and this is within your area of interest, I would definitely take it!",
    "Ritual and American Culture is a seminar-based academic study of ritual, in an anthropological manner. It covers a wide range of material, including definitions of ritual, secular ritual, and religious ritual, and draws from numerous well-read writers in the field. The final paper of 15-20 pages proved very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who is remotely interested; the class and its sources are not overly difficult to understand, and as a non-anthropology or American studies major, I enjoyed it immensely."
