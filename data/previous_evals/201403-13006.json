    "I would 100% recommend GLBL 391 to another student. If you're looking for an engaging seminar taught by an experienced professor who really cares, this is the course for you. By nature of the course's title, it tends to attract more females than males, but nonetheless I recommend this class to anyone remotely interested. The class topics are varied, but the readings are actually interesting and the weekly discussions will make you want to come to class. Professor Malvesti chooses a vibrant and diverse group of students- our class included undergrads, Jackson grad students, and even Yale World Fellows (including a woman who ran for the president of Iceland in 2012!) The weekly readings are manageable, and Professor Malvesti gives her students free range in terms of choosing what to write about for the three papers. Plus, she is very willing to meet with students and work on their writing with them. Stick it out during shopping period and apply to take this seminar, it's definitely worth it!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. Definitely the best class I took this semester, if not the best class I've taken during my time at Yale. Professor Malvesti is amazing and the subject matter is incredibly interesting. There is not one negative thing I can tell you.",
    "Great class! If you get in, definitely take it",
    "This was a chance to discuss some of the most relevant issues about women in general (not just in global affairs). We often had heated debates in class that I always left feeling stimulated and wanting to strike up later on in the day with other people. The guest speakers in particular were a highlight of this class- it's worth taking it just to hear from them. Great course.",
    "Men need to take this course. They need to sit down and listen. Very, very closely. I learnt a tremendous amount from my classmates every week - the everyday slights, worries, dreams and hopes that they had was illuminating in myriad ways.",
    "Excellent, life-changing in many ways, I'm so glad I took it!",
    "Absolutely the best course Ive taken at Yale. Professor Malvesti is a charismatic and passionate lecturer who makes the most out of every minute in the classroom. The class readings were insightful, class discussions were enlightening, and the three modules of the course built off of each other extremely well. The readings were what you would expect from a once-a-week seminar, and the three essays were manageable and open ended (i.e. write about a topic that interests you from the first module). I walk away from this class with a much deeper understanding of feminism, the way politics are shaped by the gender-power dynamic, and the history of women in global governance and conflict. Fantastic course, absolutely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. One, it's an interesting class with an awesome professor. Two, it's a perspective on Global Affairs that most people (especially men) don't usually see, but which is important to see. Three, it provides some unique opportunities to hear from people who have had careers in the realm of Global Affairs. I would warn people, however, that it is not an easy class. There are high expectations for the papers, and there are a lot of readings (though the amount is on par with other once-a-week seminars I have taken). Also, don't be intimidated by the shopping period crowd. I never thought I'd get in, but I did, and I'm glad I didn't give up on the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting a more well-rounded and nuanced view of global affairs beyond the traditional hard-power state-to-state perspective.",
    "Learn about power women- the challenges they face, how they get around them, the biases around women in different segments of society be it politics, the armed forces or the intelligence. I would recommend this class particularly if you're interested in women's role in international affairs.",
    "I highly recommend this class."
