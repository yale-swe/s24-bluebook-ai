    "Just take it.",
    "I took this because it's required for MB&B, like virtually everyone else in the class. It isn't easy, but it's a small group and we bonded a lot over p-sets and studying for exams. Better to take it with Baxter than with anyone else. But even if you're MB&B, definitely shop both p-chems to see which one works best for you.",
    "This course was honestly the low-point of MB&B for me so far. I found it extremely frustrating and didn't learn that much. The chemistry majors version might be a better choice.",
    "Don't ever take pchem if you don't have to... but do take this course over the chemistry one if you need to! and mentally prepare yourself..",
    "If you don't need to take this for your major, then RUN. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. Chem 328 was like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. It had the trifecta of terribleness: it was boring (a lot of dry equations with little or hard to grasp concepts). It was poorly taught (Professor Baxter, though he seems like a nice guy, doesn't care about this class and boy does it show). And it was hard (I'd gotten 2 B+s in my Yale career before I took this class, and by the final I was fighting for a B- in chem 328).",
    "A pretty below-average course. The lectures were fairly disorganized, the problem sets were not very clear, and it was quite difficult to gauge what would be on the exams. If you can afford to wait, I'd try to take it with Elsa Yan instead of Baxter, as Baxter's rendition of the course is much, much more difficult.",
    "Definitely not as bad as pchem was set out to be! There are weekly problem sets, 3 midterms (one of which you can drop), and a final. Some of the material we learned was actually pretty interesting and applicable if you are into bio and biochem. If you are looking for a more math based course, however, I would recommend taking 332.",
    "CHEM 328 was okay as far as physical chemistry goes. Was the material difficult? Yes. Was it at times soul-sucking? Yes. But you come out of it knowing that if you can survive physical chemistry, you can do anything! Seriously speaking though, the class was not horrible, just horribly organized. I know Professor Baxter tried to stay on top of things, but he would often post incorrect answers or not post the correct ones until a few hours before the exam. In general there was just a lot of confusion from all people involved and things were not always corrected so it was difficult knowing what was right or wrong. AKA studying will be the bane of your existence and you will feel like you are clawing your way out of a deep pit.",
    "Take it if you really have to; don't take it for fun; complain to the chem department to better incentivize good, clear teaching?",
    "I can no longer feel emotions. In reality, this class was pretty bad. The material wasn't too interesting (can't really change that) but the big problem was the teaching. Prof Baxter is a nice guy, but his lectures are among the worst I have ever experienced. He consistently showed up late and ended late and his slides were full of typos. He spent far too much time on history and not enough time on what we were tested on. The learning of this class comes down to what you learn on your own (or in a study group, which I highly recommend for this class). The TA didn't know much and couldn't answer many questions in section (so attendance was very low\/it often got canceled). Prof Baxter gave us tests the same length as he used to when the class was 75 minutes long (ours were 50). So if Prof Baxter is teaching, I would think twice about taking it. That being said, the P stands for pain, so I'm not sure how much better chem p chem would be. Best of luck.",
    "I would like to begin by saying that Richard is a well-intentioned, sarcastically funny, and well-groomed individual. Having said that, he was burdened with the task of teaching a classroom of students who are mostly there because it is required of them to graduate. Physical chemistry is extremely dry and although Richard tried his best to moisten things up by adding historical anecdotes, lecture was still extremely dry. Midterms were okay, the final was tough but fair. I am currently downing a bottle of wine by myself in celebration of this class' ending.",
    "A nice introductory course to physical chemistry, we covered all the basic concepts pertaining to how physical chemistry and its research is actually done in the real world. Three words: STAY ON TOP OF YOUR SHUZZ. I know some people who could not unfortunately keep up with all the Psets, and the semester really catches up on whoever does not stay on top of everything. This class especially. More math-related (I mean, it's physics of chemistry...), so make sure you're comfortable with the math, so that math is not your stumbling block, when you will have (trust me) way more stumbling blocks along the way. Though a nice thing: while taking the final, I was thinking to myself, \"Wow you've learned all this material? You've come a long way!\" Indeed by the end of this course, you will have learned so much, and will appreciate yet another aspect of chemistry aside from the biology of it or the organic side to it. Take this over 332, even though I'm sure some people will tell you otherwise. 332 is way more math-heavy, and are chalked-full of hardcore ChemE or Chem majors that you do NOT want to meddle with. 328 is the way to go!",
    "A fairly decent class. If you are genuinely interested in physical chemistry and want to learn a lot, I would recommend looking into CHEM 333. Otherwise, if you are an MB&B major trying to complete your physical chemistry requirement, this class is the easiest way to do so. The workload wasn't too bad - weekly problems (around 5-7 hours\/problem set), 3 midterms (lowest grade dropped), and 1 final exam. My biggest complaint with this class is that it just seemed very disorganized. There were typos throughout the lecture slides, as well as on the midterms and final exams. These definitely impacted my performance on the exam, and I wish Professor Baxter could have been more careful with proofreading. Also, the Hammes\/Hammes-Schiffer textbook is terrible at explaining physical chemistry concepts. I would highly recommend supplementing the textbook with Tineco's Physical Chemistry book.",
    "Would not recommend this course unless you are MB&B and would prefer this to 332. Prof Baxter is absurdly disorganized and not invested in his students. The TA's are patient, but mostly absent. The real gems of the course are your MB&B peers, who will en masse self-organize to conquer problem sets and material together. There are not enough practice problems (6 problems per chapter) and the professor's slides and sample exams are fraught with errors. You will feel obligated to attend every lecture should they suddenly become more interesting and informative. Dreadful disillusionment will follow. A generous curve will save you. But you will never be able to reclaim this \"Yale\" credit.",
    "It is difficult to teach the complex subject of physical chemistry to a group of students who likely will never apply this knowledge in real life, yet that is what this course aims to do. If you are thinking of taking this course, you are likely an MB&B major and have to take it. If that is the case and you are choosing between this and CHEM 330, choose this one if you are not very very comfortable with multi and derivations. Most people in this class are not, so it is WAY easier mathematically (as in the most you'll ever do is take the derivative of something). Piece of advice: know that Baxter likes to test calculations and graph reading, not derivations, so don't waste time memorizing Michaelis-Menten derivations when you could be doing Henry's law problems. People in this class are the definition of keeners, so don't take these exams lightly. That being said, it's a CHEM class so half A's half B's is the worst it can get.",
    "Not a great course, but a requirement for MB&B majors.",
    "This is a pretty solid PChem course. As an MB&B major, I chose this over the physical chemistry course, and I'm glad I did. It's actually pretty interesting how bio and pchem fit together, and this class helped me understand a lot of biological concepts much better. Baxter was pretty helpful and always posted all his slides, written out notes, and textbook chapters online. However, his materials were sometimes a little disorganized and had errors.",
    "Take it as a MB&B major requirement. If you're looking to learn principles of physical chemistry that you will actually retain, try 332."
