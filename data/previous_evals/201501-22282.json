   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course. It's harder than the reputation, but so worth it. Snyder is AMAZING.",
    "lots of readings. if you're not willing to commit to all that, take it credit\/d!",
    "Yes even if you are not a history major. A bit tough at first without a background in European history but it quickly becomes manageable.",
    "An amazingly interesting lecture for anyone at all interested in this region or in history of any kind. Not too much reading, fair exams, and incredibly engaging, fascinating lectures that you will never want to miss.",
    "Amazing!!!! Please take the class!",
    "If you want fascinating lectures on a relatively unknown subject with contemporary importance, take this class!",
    "AMAZING class! I took Eastern Europe to 1914 in the fall, and loved it so much that I took the continuation. I thought that Eastern Europe to 1914 was a stronger course, and I especially liked the exam format (1 map quiz, 3 50 minute midterms, no final exam) of that course better. This course had a map quiz, one 50 minute midterm and a 3 hour final. Overall, Snyder is a genius, and each lecture is incredible. For history majors, this class is a must. Snyder is the best lecturer of my time at Yale. Take this class!",
    "Fantastic course. So informative, engaging, entertaining. Love the no laptop rule and love the distribution of assignments, too (no essays? Yes please.) It would be HUGELY useful to have this class be 1 hr 15 as opposed to 50 minutes. There is SO much to cover and I feel like we sped through the 70s-present because there simply aren't enough minutes. But I guess that's a good type of problem Tim Snyder is made to lecture. Perfect mix of information and entertainment. Sometimes you're actually so engaged and hanging on every word that only when you go back in your notes do you notice he actually skips around sometimes and you're like wait we went from Hungary to Romania how now? Still an incredible professor in the way he can connect ideas in new and interesting ways and communicate the stories of a complicated region to us.",
    "This is a great history course and teaches information about European history that is often ignored in our Western style of teaching. Snyder said that to be able to understand Europe today, we have to understand the history of Communism (and how it began) seen in these countries in the Eastern bloc. Snyder is briliant - Definitely would recommend all to take the class, but maybe start it Credit\/D because there is a lot of weekly reading required",
    "Please take this course! It's a Yale gem. You get to cover World War I, World War II, and the Cold War, with lots of time devoted to imperial, fascist, and democratic history. Snyder makes taking this course worth it despite the hundreds of pages of reading. Plus, there's only a midterm, a map quiz, and a final. Not bad!",
    "Yes, the lectures are amazing and Prof. Snyder makes the material accessible and engaging. It's like story time every class but you also realize how the events impacted millions of lives.",
    "Yes. I am a STEM major and this was the perfect class.",
    "An Intensive and rich history of eastern Europe from 1914-now. If you have any interest in current world events (even the Middle East), you should take this class. It helps one understand the origins of the Cold War and it conveys the relatively obscure history of eastern Europe. The exams are not tricky. You could get an A in this class if you put the work in. There is just a huge amount of material to remember. If you're not genuinely interested in Eastern Europe, however, you might finding the reading a bit banal and therefore might not feel inclined to do the work.",
    "THE class of 20th century European history.",
    "Great class to take if you are interested in the less reported history of Eastern Europe. Professor Snyder is a greater lecturer. A whole lot of reading that you kind of have to figure out if it is important or not. Also, if you can't focus in lecture or take notes by hand, not the class for you. Professor Snyder does not have lecture slides and does not allow computers in class. Most of the important content in this class is provided by lecture so if you can't keep up, it gets rough!",
    "2 exams, a map test, and section. Very straightforward history lecture that reaches for depth and breadth and achives both through Snyder's lectures",
    "Totally recommend it to another student.",
    "Totally awesome class, I recommend it 100%!",
    "Great lectures and a lot of readings that fill out the takeaways on the subject",
    "A general, but comprehensive overview of Eastern European history. If you're a REES major, I would definitely recommend taking this course -- it gives you an interesting sense of how Eastern Europe was constructed as a region. Professor Snyder is not the most approachable professor in the world, but he gives a great lecture, and you'll look forward to hearing his thoughts (and odd jokes...).",
    "Yes! I was a non-history major, and I really enjoyed it. Workload is manageable. Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer. It was first humanities lecture I've taken that laptops were banned, which I liked a lot.",
    "If you can take this, and decide not to, you're an idiot. TAKE IT.",
    "Great historical review of the foundations, course, and consequences of Eastern European self-determination and communism. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend Hist 264 to those who are interested in European history. It's a must-take.",
    "This is a great course! Definitely take it if you can. I'm a senior computer science major and took this Cr\/D for fun. It's one of the few courses you can actually get something out of Cr\/D: you'll learn a ton from Professor Snyder's lectures alone.",
    "A look at conflicts and changes in Eastern Europe beginning with the lead up to World War I and culminating with modern day issues in Ukraine. It's a lot of information to take in, a lot of reading that hardly anyone does, and a lot of amazing lectures that one should not miss. Do yourself a favor and take this class -- it's not that hard, and most of the information is stuff that anyone who wants to be a person should know.",
    "Really great class. Professor Snyder is incredible and made a topic I thought would be brutal really interesting. Fair amount of work. Definitely recommend.",
    "Strong lecture style. Nothing to offer in terms of negativity.",
    "Yes yes yes. Outstanding class. Loved the tech-free philosophy, the outline and terms before each lecture which neatly orientated the focus of the class, and the fascinating lectures. A lot of reading, which I hope could have been addressed at a deeper level.",
    "Professor Snyder is a gifted lecturer, and his passion for the material is palpable and made his lectures very engaging. However, lecturing is not the same as teaching, and the course itself seems to cater to the academia-bound student (which I am not). For one thing, there were way too many readings assigned. Nobody did them all, which is a problem. I attempted a number of them, and they were certainly interesting, but the expectations were completely unreasonable. I know its Yale, but you cant expect undergrads in a lecture course to read an entire 350-page book for Thursdays lecture during the last week of classes (in addition to a heavy load of reading for Tuesday). I dont care how interesting and well-written the book is: the only way to get that done is to skim, and I dont think Yale professors should be in the business of assigning books to be skimmed. Instead of assigning a bunch of reading under the assumption that students will skim, I strongly urge Professor Snyder to assign a more manageable amount of reading that supplements and reinforces the material covered in lecture instead of merely complementing it. I also felt like there were too many guest lectures. For a course that only meets twice a week, four guest lectures is a lot, since there were only 23 lectures in total. Thats 17% of the course, which I was not expecting. I know Professor Snyder is busy and often travel outside of the country, but its his job to teach this course. Each lecture, the TFs handed out lists of names and terms with no clear indication of their relative importance (or lack thereof). Tests were straightforward and not very difficult. All in all, I found this course to be an interesting survey of Eastern European history that lacked a clear framework for exploring the material.",
    "Eastern Europe since 1914 provides a captivating narrative of a region of the planet that so often gets neglected in World History. The first half of the class covers the other side of World War 1 (the side that started it and was more radically affected by its resolution) and the inter-war period, while the second half focuses on political life east of the Iron Curtain. Snyder has no shortage of fascinating insight, and every lecture feels like an intimate story time, as Snyder provides in-depth commentary mixed in with jokes and anecdotes that keep the audience engaged. The strict rule against electronics in the electric hall is certainly annoying but has the positive consequence of preventing unwanted distraction from what's going on. There's a brief map quiz that feels like you're taking a test from middle school, but its a quick and easy way to help you grade and lessen the stress of the midterm and final. I know that many people will like this, but I found it rather unfortunate that there were no papers in the class. For me it meant I had no real opportunity to engage with the material, only chances to regurgitate facts and narratives on exams. The reading is extensive but engaging, and his own book Bloodlands nicely supplements the narrative of the land in between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Not the best history course offered, but certainly interesting and worth your time.",
    "Great class and prof Snyder gave incredible lectures that really helped me Understand how groups of people were thinking.",
    "If it isn't already, this should be one of the classes every Yale student should take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class -- it's not easy, but it's not too hard either and the material is fascinating. The opportunity to learn from an expert like Snyder is awesome. One of my favorite classes so far.",
    "Fantastic survey course. Worth taking even if you're not interested in Eastern Europe you should take this class just for Snyder's lectures.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! Even if you don't initially think that you're interested in the region, Snyder's lectures are so good that you'll be obsessed with it by the end. Also, take even if you're not a history major because it just shouldn't be missed.",
    "Good readings, very general and sometimes rushed but good lectures, pretty uninspired section. Unabashed worship of Bloodlands throughout. I enjoyed the class, I just don't think it really lived up to the hype. It was not in any way demanding. But I guess history lectures aren't supposed to be intellectually taxing?",
    "A fantastic class to take. Much heavier on political history than the first semester (which I think is a slightly better course, though both are great!)",
    "Absolutely! This is probably one of the courses everyone must take in their time at Yale, regardless of their major. It's always interesting, Professor Snyder makes the material really relevant, and as long as you get his main points and the evidence used to support it, you will do fine in terms of the tests.",
    "Hist 264 is a great way to learn about modern eastern european history if you don't know much about it.",
    "This is definitely on the list of classes you have to take before you graduate. Tim Snyder is an absolutely amazing lecturer, and super knowledgeable. Take it.",
    "Yes absolutely. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale. You won't regret taking it.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! That said, it's probably a great class to take cr\/d as the lectures are the real joy of the class and the readings are dense, plus often irrelevant. Honestly, I think you might even be fine listening to the lectures thoroughly, skimming the readings as they interest you, and then just taking the time to think through the main themes and lecture notes prior to the exams. I wish Prof. Snyder wouldn't have others guest lecture so much though - particularly Marci Shor, who seemed to reference not having thought about some of the material she was lecturing since her own undergraduate days.",
    "Please take this class. Tim Snyder is brilliant and has a sense of humor - I am looking forward to taking more courses with him. Even though I had very little knowledge of Eastern Europe beforehand, his lectures always flowed well and made so much sense. The history of Eastern Europe is very important but often ignored in ways we don't realize. It's one of the most real-life worthwhile classes I've taken; I learned so much. My only warning is that there are very few grades - a map quiz, section participation, the midterm and final. The exams are fair and not too tricky, but being prepared is crucial."
