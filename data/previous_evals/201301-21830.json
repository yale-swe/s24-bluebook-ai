   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially if you are a chemistry or MCDB major (MB&B majors need to take it), I'm a chemistry major and the course was incredibly interesting (and counts as an advanced elective for the chem major!)",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, you're probably an MB&B major. If you're not an MB&B major, you probably won't want to take this course because it goes into a lot of detail which isn't relevant to much else besides biochemistry. If that's your subject of choice though, then it's an awesome class. You learn a ton, the professors are interesting and good in class, and the exams are fair.",
    "Pretty standard Biochemistry class. A lot of information and a lot of memorization. Not too much of a workload, but it isn't the easiest class.",
    "A solid class that takes you through how we know what we know about DNA metabolism. The class begins by examining prokaryotic DNA structure, replication, transcription, and translation, before moving on to survey eukaryotic systems. The class then ends by applying the concepts learned during the first 80% of the couse with lectures on the molecular control of development, cancer, and the immune response.The lectures themselves are interesting, though not necessary riveting. PSets are easy and generally take around an hour to complete, sections aren't mandatory, and the midterms are a mix of rote memorization and logic.",
    "MB&B 301 is a pretty hard class, but if you put in the work and don't fall behind in reviewing the lectures, you'll be set.",
    "Really cool material, but a lot of it and it's sort of overwhelming. The class moves really quickly, and I often got lost within 15 minutes of the lecture. Schlieker and Sung are really nice, but they don't seem to notice when everyone gets so lost.",
    "Pretty hard course, but worth all the effort. The lectures are great, and it's wonderful continuing MB&B300 with a nice semester of nucleic acids. The course is focused on a historical introduction to discoveries in the field, and the different techniques associated - psets and tests are very focused on interpreting data, and then determining how this data reflects something you learned in class. There are quite a number of things to memorize, but if you understand the concepts and start studying early, the 2 midterms\/final should be manageable. Overall, a rigorous yet great class - don't pass it up just because it's hard though!",
    "I'm an MBB major. I love the subject. This class is enjoyable, but more difficult than first semester. You'll take the class if you need to or you like the subject (and if you like the subject you should be an mbb major).Lectures are more experiment based than first semester, but the class is well taught and interesting. Lectures are given out on slides and exams are based only on mexture material.",
    "It's part history, part science, where you think in the way people who built the fundamentals of biochemistry thought. You will learn a lot but be ready to put in the work. it's one of the hardest biology classes at Yale, but for good reason. Beware of the curve: only 20% get As.",
    "SO much better than MBB 300! If you are an MBB major you have to take this course, but don't worry, it's really really great! Yes, there is a lot of information and you learn a lot of in-depth information about molecular biology, but it's all so interesting. Get excited!",
    "This is a must-take class if you want to understand biochemical scientific literature. I am very surprised at the amount this class has helped me understand scientific literature. You learn an incredible amount and the tests are very experimental (which can be frustrating), but you will not regret taking it.",
    "I mean, if you're looking at this class you're probably an MB&B major, so you don't really have a choice. There will be ups and downs, and you will sometimes have to take a ride on the struggle bus. But you will come out with a sufficient background in biochemistry to design experiments, interpret data, and intelligently read scientific literature. In the end, you'll be glad you took this class, even if you have to swallow a B+. Good luck.",
    "MB&B 301 is a good course. I actually liked it more that 300 which is not what you usually hear. The course focused more on nucleic acids, transcription and translation as opposed to protein folding, enzymes and metabolism from the first semester. The course was also much more data analysis oriented which I think I greatly benefited from. Would recommend.",
    "Not a bad course to take. Usually taken by MB&B majors though, so very intense.",
    "This is a class that pretty much everyone in has to take. That being said, I enjoyed it. In the end, it comes down to whether or not you like the material. In that sense, it is pretty similar to that covered in the first semester before all the metabolism stuff.",
    "It's much harder than the first semester of biochem. They presume you have a lot more knowledge and the people in the class are smarter as all the MCDB people only take the first semester. The lectures are much more difficult to follow and the tests are much harder and less directly drawn from the lectures. They also lie and tell you they use the same textbook for 300 and 301 but they don't actually. If Steitz is teaching it's probably worth taking if you are interested in learning a ton about the complexities of RNA and DNA.",
    "You really just have to like the material to like this class. I did not find I enjoyed learning the material very much, so it was always a struggle for me. Difficult class, but if you are good at reviewing material constantly, you won't have too much trouble with the tests.",
    "It's an OK course, but only take it if you really like this stuff or need to. This course likely changed my major from biochemistry to applied math... I found that we would just memorize stuff pointlessly, then regurgitate it on the exam. There really aren't \"principles\" taught in this class -- some might say that experimental analysis is a principle, but most of that is really just common sense and knowing the details to be able to spit out a conclusion.",
    "MB&B 301 is an intense science class, full to the brim with minute details. What you gain from it, however, outweighs the large amount of material covered in the class. It is very well taught, and the substance of the course is relevant for all science majors.",
    "If you are thinking of taking this course as a MCDB major, take it Cr\/D\/F. You can convert it to a letter grade if you get a decent grade on your midterms. The people taking this class are really serious about biology so be prepared!",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student with the caveat that it is one of the most difficult courses I have taken at Yale. The students in this course are intense. The material is daunting and endless. However, this course can be rewarding and enjoyable (I have a friend that took it Cr\/D\/Fail) so it is worth it mostly. If you up for it, take a chance and take it, but be prepared for an academic challenge.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I have to admit, during most lectures, I don't fully understand what is going on. This is usually because there is a lot of information to cover - as lecture time runs out, the lecture goes faster. I think someof the presentations could be made more concise. I'm often not able to do the quiz in class because I don't understand the preceding material but after doing the reading afterwards and going over the presentations on my own, everything becomes clear. There is a lot of time pressure on the midterms (and even a bit on the final), which is the greatest weakness of this course. I feel many people know how to figure out the questions, they just need time to mull it over. That being said, the average tends to be very high (B-\/B) for a class that has a reputation for being insanely intense. Don't stress out too much about the curve - it is not as harsh as all the students make it out to be.",
    "Decent biochem course, slightly more difficult than 1st semester I'd say. One thing that I was a little surprised at was how heavily scientific research intuition factored into this class. Of course many of the students have conducted or are currently involved in science research, but I feel like the class can definitely over-assume the students' familiarity with research techniques. Having research experience helps, but you can still excel without it.",
    "I enjoyed 301 more than the fall semester biochem course. Really interesting topics with great lecturers.",
    "The course was an excellent overview of biochemistry. The tests were difficult in terms of recall at certain points, but the overall material I learned was excellent. There were a lot of applications to the field and it was nice and useful that experiments were discussed in depth behind the facts discovered. Professor Sung's lectures were excellent. Very engaged and an excellent sense of humor. Professor Schlieker was very good as well, and gave us a lot of information about the topics, especially the two at the end (oncology and immunology) which was a good setup since it used our prior knowledge in the course. I enjoyed the semester and felt like I got a lot out of it!",
    "The first third was really amazing, the second third was pretty cool, and the third third was extremely boring. I learned so much about DNA replication, transcription, and translation. I liked the style of the problem sets and tests - they give you an experiment and its results and ask you to make whatever deductions you can make. Often, the question will have many parts that walk you through a complex experiment.There were some frustrating parts too. I have never worked in a biochemistry lab of any sort and a lot of times I felt that I just didn't know what the professors meant when they talked about experiments. Not that they were talking about anything conceptually difficult; I mean that they would talk in a shorthand that made total sense to people who had some experience in the field but no sense at all to people like me. Basically, they introduce new terminology without ever bothering to define it, which is exceptionally annoying when it happens on a midterm or final.",
    "This class is probably one of the most challenging I've taken at Yale, but its definitely worth it. The professors are AMAZING, and you learn so much."
