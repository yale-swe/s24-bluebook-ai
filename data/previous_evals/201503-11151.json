    "This was an excellent, though intense, investigation of the notion of identity in the Age of Enlightenment with a heavy dose of literary criticism thrown in. I encourage anyone with an interest in this subject to take it. The course was, furthermore, very open to student input and thus ideal for graduate students whose research interests coincide with it."

   "comments": [
    "Though my research interests are still developing, this course has vastly expanded the critical corpus that will serve me as I begin graduate work. Though I am primarily interested in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, this course has led me to consider these periods in the context of their relationship to the Enlightenment as well."
