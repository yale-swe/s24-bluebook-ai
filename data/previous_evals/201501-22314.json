    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. It was one of the best courses I have taken while at Yale, and it has made me seriously consider pursuing art history as a potential major.",
    "Broad survey to western history of art since ~1300. Great for people looking to dabble in the humanities or as an intro to a particular angle of it. Super easy.",
    "I shopped this class originally because my mother told me to. I hate to say it, but my mother was very right. Don't leave Yale without taking this class. The lectures are all incredible, and you learn so much in each one. I didn't know I could love a lecture class so much. Barringer is incredible. This class truly expanded my world view and gave me a better understanding of visual analysis and history overall. It also changed the way art affects me -- I feel truly moved by a Jackson Pollock or a Rothko in a way I really never understood was possible before this class. You've got to take it. I took the class Credit\/D, but it's not terribly difficult -- a lot of assessments, but none is not doable. Not the best class to Credit\/D because you have to do research on your essays just to get the C and then there's not much reason to not try to get the A, but the Credit\/D did allow me to enjoy it 100% and know that I was in lecture and section because I wanted to be there, not because I had to be.",
    "A great class that unfortunately just has a lot of papers. Still well worth it!",
    "Absolutely worth taking during your time at Yale. Many people will take this class CR\/D, but I didn't find the workload to be overwhelming or the midterm to be very difficult so I think it's a fine class to take for a grade as well. It's a nice way to be introduced to the art gallery and the broad overview of art history is just nice to know even if it won't be that consequential in my life going forward.",
    "a great survey course everyone should take.",
    "Take this class! It's three papers, a midterm, and a final, which is a lot but worth it (and very manageable if you take it credit d). I think it is important for everyone to have taken a survey course in art history.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Western Art history. The workload of the course is not light--three papers and two exams, plus weekly section in the Art Gallery.",
    "highly recommend",
    "Take it! This course is incredibly interesting. The lectures are really enjoyable. For section, you walk around YUAG with your TA talking about art.",
    "Great course, lots of work for an intro course. Two 5pg papers, 10 of final paper, midterm, and final exam. Recommend as audit first and CR\/D second.",
    "This was one of my favourite classes at Yale... EVER. Professor Barringer is amazing, the material is fascinating, it's such a great experience to have section in the Gallery itself. All together an AMAZING course. But be weary... it's a survey class, so there's quite a bit of work. Two short papers, a long paper, midterm and final. Quite a bit...",
    "Take this class. It is one of the best classes at Yale because the material is interesting, the professors and TA and extremely smart and kind, and nearly everyone who takes the class is new to art history. I would highly recommend it, although the workload can be overwhelming at times (memorizing a lot of artwork).",
    "Fantastic course. Hugely applicable survey art history course, with an incredible Professor. And you get to spend time each week getting to know the Yale Art Gallery, which somehow housed famous paintings from every era we looked at. Should be a requirement for every Yalie. Can't recommend enough.",
    "Take it!! The most useful class you'll probably take at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend HSAR 115, especially if taught again by Professor Barringer. Great class, reasonable workload.",
    "Survey of art from Renaissance to present.",
    "Yes! Art History will change your life, and Barringer is hilarious. This class really only scratches the surface of art history, though, so don't expect to go into depth about the lives of or influences on any of the artists, even the biggest names.",
    "The class was very interesting; my only concern was the fact that there was both a final exam and a final paper which was a little annoying to deal with during finals and reading period.",
    "Fun class that's actually a fair amount of work but is very interesting. Lecture sometimes feels repetitive and meandering but it's a great 5th class or class to credit-D.",
    "I was shopping three classes in the same timeslot of HSAR 115 when I walked into lecture one day, fully intending to stay only 15 minutes and dashing off to another class. But 15 minutes in, I was so captivated that I deleted all three classes from my shopping schedule, cancelled an application I was writing to get into one of those classes, and enrolled immediately in HSAR 115. This is possibly the greatest class I have ever taken in my six semesters at Yale. Lecture is only 50 minutes long, but sometimes I find myself wishing it was a 75-minute class instead. Professor Barringer is brilliant, funny, and exceptionally skilled at analyzing a painting, both its formal elements as well as how it connects with the history and culture of the time. This is a wonderful survey of the field for those who can't choose a period they want to focus on, or for those who are unfamiliar with the field. Don't be afraid if you've never taken an art history class or enjoyed an art museum before - this course is entirely accessible, and it will instill in you an interest and a passion you might not have had before. Each week, section is held in the art gallery, and it was such an amazing opportunity to explore a part of Yale I never go to, and talk about different pieces with a TA and students who actually care about learning about and enjoying the art. The workload may seem daunting (a midterm, a final, two 4-5 page papers, one 8-10 page paper), but it's rather spread out through the term and much more manageable than I imagined. It was fun was explore the art gallery and choose a painting to analyze for the short papers! So calm your anxieties, shake off your qualms - this class is highly recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student at Yale, ESPECIALLY someone who has never taken an art history class before.",
    "Your standard introductory course and much, much more. The lecturer received a 5-minute applause at the last lecture. Take it.",
    "Intro Art History is AMAZING! One of those classes you really have to take. Professor Barringer is a fantastic (and also hilarious) lecturer, and you really learn a new way of thinking in this course. One note: it's a lot of work for a large intro lecture, but definitely not that hard to do well if you put the time into it.",
    "A gestalt of art from the Renaissance to pre-modern times. In lecture, each artwork receives only two or three sentences of attention. However, the class is a great opportunity to appreciate a wide range of art, to learn about local resources, and to do some independent analysis of artworks.",
    "HSAR 115 is one of those courses that you cannot miss if you are at a liberal arts institutions. There is so much to gain from looking at history through art, and plus you actually learn what weird modern art means and how we have arrived at art in our current world. The professor is super enjoyable to have as a professor, and section is awesome because you get to walk through the gallery and talk about all the wonderful and impressive collection of art. There is a lot of papers to write, but they were all fun to do and super interesting to research.",
    ".Yes, tentatively. Amazing lectures. Professor Barringer is always worth seeing. The workload in this class is a bit much and often misguided. Demanding 5 sources for a 5 page paper is just pedagogically inane. Still, definitely worth taking at least credit\/d or auditing What destroyed this class for me was my horrible TA, Ariel Bardi. She was an absolute nightmare. She repeatedly told us that she found nothing of value in pre-20th century art (that is to say in any art that didn't affirm her narrow, navel-gazing deconstructionist bullshit). She actually told us that she found Renaissance and Romantic art boring and its inclusion on the syllabus an affirmation of western racist and sexist attitudes towards the art world. Administratively she was a nightmare. She lied and told us her email didn't work as a way of refusing to answer questions. Her advice on writing papers was literally to construct a thesis before looking at any paintings! Thank goodness she will be gone next year, although the fact that Yale granted her a phd at all has evoscerated my confidence in at least the department of comp lit.",
    "A really good introductory class on art history - helps you know all the trends, artists, and historical movements. Class is engaging and the professor as well as the TAs are very knowledgeable on the subject. You will learn a tons! Take it Credit D\/Fail if you are new to art analysis.",
    "Aaa You'll get what you're expecting which is a good intro to art history since the Renaissance. Barringer is passionate and funny and lectures are a joy, although they sometimes went long and it was sometimes hard to know which works were actually important and which ones he just likes. Three papers is honestly a bit tedious for an intro class and they actually require serious research because you need books from Loria. Test were a lot of memorization but pretty easy. You don't ever really need to do any reading.",
    "Survey course on art history",
    "I would recommend it. It's a well taught class that allows you to really engage with the incredible resources of the Art Gallery.",
    "I would recommend but warn that it is very much an overview and does not go much in depth.",
    "Definitely a must-take course at Yale, regardless of your major. Not only is the subject incredibly interesting and one of the most well taught at Yale - it also familiarizes students with the Yale Art Gallery, which most don't even know about.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class to a fellow student in any major. Barringer is so knowledgable and fun, and opens your eyes to a whole new world.",
    "A class every Yale student should take.",
    "I have always had a wide variety of interests, art history being a central one. But I never considered taking an art history class much less majoring in the subject. This class in a way has changed my life and my perspective. I love being able to walk around Yale and identify the style of building and where aspects of its architecture were derived. Because of this class, I may major in art history or at least take many more art history classes in the future. I would say this class is a must-take for anyone. Definitely a fun class that almost counts as a study break because it is so enjoyable.",
    "Yes",
    "I strongly recommend this class to another student. It's a very good intro to art history for any major. If you expect to get a deep understanding of one or two artists, then it's probably not a good choice because we covered 800 years in the lecture and the profesor really has to rush through a lot of materials. The sections are very helpful and they are held in YUAG. Yale has an amazing collection and you can really apply what you've learned in lecture to analyze the artworks.",
    "Great course to Cr\/d as a 5th course. Yes I recommend the course. The work is super easy to do and super easily graded.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to any Yale student interested in learning how to think critically about art.",
    "Absolutely a must take. You will appreciate art galleries and the world of art so much more, and Barringer is incredible.",
    "HSAR 115 is a great complement to HSAR 112, and the two should absolutely be taken in sequence. HSAR 115 is a fantastic survey course for those looking to gain a greater appreciation for the incredible history of art and to further explore the magnificence of Yale's art collection. Professor Barringer is one of the most engaging, well-spoken professors I have heard, and his lectures are filled with interesting pieces of information about the artworks and, in an added unique aspect, often clips of music that would have been played during the time period that the given artwork was created. This adds more depth to the study of the art than one would ever imagine, and it was a pleasure to experience. The midterm and final are fairly difficult and require a great deal of preparation, and the papers will also involve a lot of detailed research, but those with a passion for the subject will find this both manageable and enjoyable. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "take to gain a basic understanding of art history",
    "Professor Barringer is great. He made this course as great as it was. Very interesting lectures, and not too much work.",
    "Must take for anyone - even those who may not be that interested in art to begin with. It's a survey course so there will be material you like and don't like but Prof. Barringer did a phenomenal job selecting relevant works of art and creating a narrative in each of his lectures. The sections in the gallery are fun because of the amazing collections at Yale from most time periods. There is a lot of work but the assignments allow you to explore certain works or time periods more in depth. This is when you can practice the skills you pick up through lectures and sections. I have a much greater appreciation for art after having taken the class.",
    "Such an amazing lecture! Professor Barringer is fantastic. Would highly recommend it.",
    "This is a great class to round out your education if you are not focused on the arts, and also provides a great deal of cultural context to much of western history.",
    "This was a fantastic class. Professor Barringer was incredible. His lectures were engaging, funny, and very well organized. A class like this one definitely needs a great professor to be effective, and Tim Barringer was the perfect person for the job. The class did have a surprising amount of work (2 short papers, 1 long one, a midterm, and a final), so I would recommend considering taking it Cr\/D.",
    "Definitely--one of my favorite classes so far. That said, my section was very relaxed and it probably depends on your TA. But, the material is very interesting, the exams are easy (just memorization), and section is awesome (you just go hang out in the art gallery). Barringer was a great professor, and lecture was always entertaining\/interesting. I took it because I needed a humanities credit.",
    "An general art history lecture that gives a good summary of the history of art after the Medieval Age. Also was nice to get to know the Yale University Art Gallery.",
    "Absolutely amazing! Barringer is a phenomenal lecturer - he's hilarious, makes every class extremely interesting to attend, and really helps foster an appreciation for all sorts of art (even modern art for me). The sections vary depend on who your TA is, but regardless being in the YUAG every week is amazing on its own. It's actually a decent amount of work for an intro class, but very much worth it. Definitely a must take for every Yale student!",
    "The course is definitely a lot of work, but is also one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The lectures are wonderful and the sections are actually fantastic and I would feel bad if I missed any. Overall, take this class if you have wondered about famous artworks or artists that you recognize but do not know about in detail. This class will teach you why the pieces look the way they do and the progression of genres of art in history.",
    "I already have recommended it to several students who asked me about taking an entry-level history of art course. I think it's a good introduction into the art history department, and one that will engage people.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale!",
    "A great survey to the Western canon from the Renaissance to present. A lot of time spent in the YUAG and writing interesting essays. It will change the way you look at historical changes. Take it!",
    "Great class for majors and non-majors, slightly higher workload than expected, but very worthwhile.",
    "Def take it! You'll learn about the greatest art in the world and get to know the yuag very well. Totally worth the work.",
    "Yes. Yale is an excellent place to take art history regardless of what major you are. The combination of Professor Barringer's lectures and access to YUAG and its treasured collections make this course a must to take.",
    "Yes take it. So much history and culture.",
    "I'd recommend this course; it's not overly difficult but provides an engaging and thorough summary of art in the last seven centuries. The instructor and TAs are both excellent, and the material is well-presented.",
    "A good survey of artwork from the Renaissance to present, as the course title implies. For the most part, Prof. Barringer was thorough and engaging, but sometimes his analysis was a little cursory (I'm assuming this was for lack of time). This was my first art history class, and some of the most rewarding aspects were the fact that section was held in the YUAG and enables deeper engagement with works found there, as well as the fact that now I have a deeper understanding of the history of art movements when I go to other museums. I definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "HSAR 115 is both a fantastic introductory course to the art history field and a great humanities credit in general; it is not too easy or too hard, and going to the gallery is a wonderful change of pace\/destressor. I feel as though I learned so much relevant knowledge, and Professor Barringer always kept me attentive in class.",
    "Great overview. Definitely take it if you can!",
    "I would definitely take this class, if there's anything you should know about art it's taught in this class.",
    "I would 100% recommend it-- in fact I might require it for all undergrads.",
    "Definitely take it, lots of memorization but awesome anyways! I don't recommend taking it credit\/D because it's a lot of writing.",
    "Yes definitely!!!",
    "Definitely try to take this course before graduating! It is not very labor-intensive although it might be a good class to use a Credit\/D on if you want a low-stress but very positive experience (basically what Credit\/D\/F was supposed to be used for).",
    "It was an amazing class but don't take it if you don't want to do a lot of work for it. Or take it Cr\/D",
    "I would summarize this class as an amazing class to understand art. The lecture is always fun and interesting to listen to and I really loved it. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "No, I actively do not recommend this class as it is to other students, especially students who are just wanting to take an art history course. I think this course - combined with my section - would make people hate the entire study of art history. I felt like we rarely talked about a single work for long enough to engage in the kind of discussion that brings joy to studying art. I tell people to take more focused or advanced art history courses if they want to try one.",
    "I would definitely recommend intro to art history to another student. This course was amazing. I never took an art history course before, but this class ultimately caused me to switch majors. Professor Barringer is a fantastic combination of hilarious and intellectual and lectures always flew by. Sections meet in the YUAG, which gives students a great opportunity to explore a resource on-campus that I think many of us (myself included) overlook. Take this class!!",
    "I entered this course with just a simple interest in art and art history, but now I feel so much more passionate about the subject. Every lecture made my day better, and I loved the overarching theme of globalization. There were hints of various artwork from throughout time and place in many pieces, and it was fascinating to see these connections. Being more knowledgeable about art will make every future gallery visit so much more comprehensive and appreciative. Professor Barringer is also a HUGE reason I would recommend this course. He's an expert in his field and loves what he does, and this passion clearly shows in class. He never refers to his notes(do they even exist?), and is able to eloquently speak for over an hour without pause or signs of tiredness. The class loves his wittiness whenever he casually throws in a joke in the middle of lecture, and the lecture hall is always sure to be relatively full. I'm forever grateful to him for making this course such a truly wonderful experience. Section is in the YUAG itself(!!!) where you can see examples of, or even specific paintings discussed in real life\/up-close. The workload was not bad(and gave you more time to appreciate the art), with two short papers, a midterm, final paper, and a final. If you pay attention in class, the midterm and final really shouldn't be a problem. The short papers were manageable, and if you plan well in advance for the final paper, it is manageable too.",
    "As a second-semester senior, I can easily say that this was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Tim Barringer is a fantastic professor. I knew basically nothing about the history of art before I took this class, and I felt like his lectures gave me insight not only into the actual history, but also into the reasons why studying art history is vital to understanding the modern world. Professor Barringer's lectures are consistently eloquent, thoughtfully organized, and witty, and at the end of the course he was able to draw a lot of profound connections among the works we had studied. Also, do not be deterred by the fact that this course has a discussion section. It's the best section ever! You just walk around the Yale art gallery discussing various works and relating them to what you've learned in lecture. If you've ever wanted to get to know Yale's amazing art collection, this is your chance. Absolutely take this class.",
    "HSAR 115 is a great survey course. I took it knowing that I already was familiar with most of the material, but it was of course still very interesting, and it gave me a new perspective on a lot of the art. Barringer is a great lecturer, and my experience with his TAs was that they were also quite good. There is a good bit of memorization though, so be aware of that before you decide to take it. Other than the midterm and final, there are three papers. Definitely take it if you're interested in the subject--visual literacy is very underrated in the world, and being aware of how our world came to look the way it does and learning how to see in a more informed, critical way can be very important skills, even if you aren't an art or art history major.",
    "Definitely take it"
