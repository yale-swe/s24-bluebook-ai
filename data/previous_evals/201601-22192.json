   "comments": [
    "Yes! This a must-take course for people interested in Southeast Asia! ANTH 588 01 - as the title of the course suggests - is really about politics of culture in Southeast Asia.",
    "In ANTH 588 we read a book a week about some aspect of politics and culture in Southeast Asia. Each student chose a week to write a book review and be the 'resident expert' on that text. The books ranged from detailed ethnography, to historical studies, to international relations. I think that this mix of disciplines was good because there were students from different academic fields in the class. Students also had the opportunity to meet in groups and workshop final paper ideas and drafts, which was helpful. I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about the intersection of culture and politics, and who wants the opportunity to work on research and writing skills.",
    "not an entry level class, but definitely a useful class.",
    "Absolutely, the course introduced me to a wide array of discussions on SE Asia, its politics, cultures, and history. It is a great course for anyone who wants to become a better thinker and writer."

   "comments": [
    "I am a Southeast Asian and I have definitely learned a lot of new interesting matters on Southeast Asia through this course. Prof. Harms is also an excellent writing instructor.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge not only of histories and cultures in Southeast Asia, but also of the different approaches to fieldwork and analysis in anthropology. In this way, it contributed to my research because it allowed me to gain experience with the range of fields that anthropology engages and see what sorts of skills are needed to pursue these various fields (i.e. language study, writing, interviewing, historical archive research).",
    "Got a more informed lens for viewing SEA and a was exposed to a different way of looking at, and writing about cities, places and people.",
    "The course prepares me very well for my own research in SE Asia and allows me to explore the several topics pertaining to my interest."
