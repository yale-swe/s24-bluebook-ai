   "comments": [
    "This is a great class to learn both religions and material cultures. All the recommended books are worth close reading. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course highly as \"an exploration of diverse methodological approaches to studying visual culture in religion.\"",
    "Religious Studies 585 is a combination seminar and research workshop. The seminar component includes close readings of select works on the intersection of Religious Studies and Art History, with an eye toward the field of Material Culture studies. The research workshop component challenges each student to come up with an original study of an object or set of objects that she or he will analyze with methodological and theoretical guidance from the works on the syllabus and accompanying class discussion. I would definitely recommend Religious Studies 585 to another student, whether that student is in the field of Religious Studies, East Asian Languages and Literature, or another field that incorporates the data of religion into their work. This seminar is an unparallelled opportunity to try your hand at combining training in Religious Studies with an analysis of art objects or other products of material culture."

   "comments": [
    "The recommended readings and class discussions really deepened my knowledge. They even made me want to know more about the relevant topics. The recommended lectures were really interesting and helpful as well. I have learned how to use images in research from this class and Iam planning to use it in my future research.",
    "I honestly think I learned more from the course readings and the research I did on my project than I did by way of having great insights about the material I studied, but the entire area of material culture is something I had no background in beyond what I had learned about relics from last semester's seminar, and I was glad to expand more from that."
