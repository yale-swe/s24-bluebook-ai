    "The expectation in the studio was exploring new architectural typology and I believed the studio was well taught to meet the expectation I had.",
    "I was hoping to get more time with the main critic.",
    "Anything would have met my expectations.",
    "My expectations for this studio were wholly unmet. I was excited to work rigorously on my last studio project, based on a strong typological precedent and with a professor who seemed to offer a set of uniquely transformative tools for conceptualizing architecture out of the stated problems. Unfortunately, the studio was hindered by Greg\u0092s apparent inability to set out a schedule that he can follow or even concepts that we would stick with for the duration of the semester. I felt continually frustrated by the fact that my project would change enough from one of Greg\u0092s visits to the next, to a degree that his critiques felt more like final reviews than crits because he was critiquing a project he\u0092d hardly seen before and whose development he hardly seemed to care about. I admired Greg a lot more before I had him as a studio critic than I do now. I felt Brennan was, on the other hand, an excellent critic whose feedback was very useful. I\u0092m not sure if he\u0092s enough in sync with Greg, but I felt Brennan offered consistently useful advice.",
    "Professor Lynn\u0092s has interested me for several years now. Experiments with the new form, often with the help of cutting edge software, analysis of form \u0096 all that was very interesting to me. I was positive this was my top choice studio.I\u0092m absolutely happy with what I learned here and how my expectations were met. One of the my misconceptions that I lost after Lynn studio had been a conviction that creation of a complex and diverse space is only possible through the cutting edge software, like Maya, Grasshopper, Processing.I was able to achieve the necessary level of complexity in a model built with a sampler program.Bu I was also happy to achieve a certain novel spatial quality in my project.t it took me a careful step-by-step formally logical procedure."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, although I have to say that pushing the travel week to spring break, and not being able to work on a site meant that we were stretched thin to produce 3 different site models with limited time left in the semester. This too had a lot of strain on our work. It is not just building the site models that takes time but coordinating their fabrication with enough flexibility to incorporate multiple projects. We just had too little time. We SHOULD travel during travel week and at no other time.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Not relevant to this studio.",
    "Our resources were completely adequate. My only complaints would be that the computers often felt burdened by the heaviness of the network and took too long to log in. In addition, I find the training for all of the advanced equipment the school owns entirely inadequate.",
    "The only resource that was in scarcity was 3d printing devices.Towards the end of the studio all 3d print jobs were booked and many of us had to outsource our 3d printing jobs that increased our expenses 6-fold."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "Pin-ups enable us to see each others' work, but on the other hand it also means some extra work to produce representations which would not have been as pertinent had there been more desk crits with Greg. With Brennan it was manageable given that he sat down to talk more with us one to one.The jury at the final review was a good mix of experts, though the critique of the projects overall were not always directed at what the students thought was the object of the studio - that of a formal exploration (and of what nature.) Given that we are understandably a cooperative bunch we would definitely like this to be pinned down at the start of the semester so that we can channel our energies towards an agreed objective. An explorative studio can still be held to constraints and fixed goals.",
    "I think having a small group desk crits or individual pin-up could be helpful.",
    "The pin-ups were valuable, i just they would have come at more regular intervals.",
    "the most valuable asset to the studio is having lynn as a critic. he has amazing insight and is able to guide students--when he is available to--the desired goal.",
    "The studio was terrible - across the board.",
    "Although the trip was fun, we didn\u0092t see much besides our sites. The amount of architecture was limited, and Greg was hardly there for any of it. The relevance to our projects seemed tenuous. The scale of the site models that we were encouraged to build was prohibitively large to understand the urban context and too small to build useful models. What we were encouraged to do for the first few weeks regarding modeling techniques that would be precise and transfer to the building scale seemed to quickly have been forgotten, and many students\u0092 work - including my own - suffered because our projects changed so drastically over the course of the semester. The most valuable days were the ones when Greg was there, but they were so intermittent that their value felt very short-lived. In all, I felt that this was a disappointing studio to end an otherwise quite well-run and educational sequence.",
    "To me the most valuable aspects of the studio were pin-ups with Greg Lynn and desk-crits with Brennan Buck. On the reviews Greg Lynn and Brennan Buck helped me understand what the major goals and problems were; with this knowledge on desk-crits Brennan helped me tune-up and solve particular details of the project.I also found the digital crits (by e-mail to Greg Lynn and Brennan Buck) very helpful, because this way we were able to get additional feedback on some important aspects that for some reasons remained uncovered in personal conversation."
