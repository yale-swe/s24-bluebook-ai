    "A very good introduction and survey of the ideas of geometric rep theory (GRT). I learned a lot about techniques that I had seen before in rep theory, but didn't appreciate. Goes through primarily chapter 3 of Chriss and Ginzburg's book \"Representation Theory and Complex Geometry\". Its a great way to see how algebraic geometry and algebraic topology meet with rep theory to produce some really interesting ideas.",
    "I learned a good deal about the connections between representation theory and algebraic geometry especially the roles that flag varieties and cohomology rings play. I also got better and learning how to read textbooks and prep lectures.",
    "I learned more in this class than any other class I've ever taken."

    "I just hope something like this is given again. There's certainly demand for it among the undergrads.",
    "The course did a very good job of presenting the material from Chriss and Ginzburg. Most of the lectures were good and easy enough to follow. Some people weren't as prepared to lecture as others but on a whole it was good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially to those interested in geometry and mathematical physics. It really helps to have a good background in algebraic topology, and some algebraic geometry ahead of time.",
    "I would recommend this course. The material was interesting though how well it's taught depends on who's giving the lecture. Algebraic geometry at the level of chapters 2 & 3 of Hartshorne is needed at points, but otherwise it's nothing too intense."
