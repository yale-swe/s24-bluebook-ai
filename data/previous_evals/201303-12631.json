    "Klemann is an energetic and wonderful teacher that makes herself available to her students. As a physics major, I could sometimes feel as if the course was too \"Humanitiesy\" (e.g. discussing whether childhood is an image or a concept), but most aspects of the course were intriguing. Every class has some form of assignment or reading, so there is a substantial yet evenly distributed workload. My writing has definitely improved due to this class. From what I've heard of other Engl 114 sections, Klemann's seems to be among the best.",
    "English 114 is a great course to take if you want to improve your writing skills for college and enjoy yourself while doing it. I have traditionally not loved English, but this course kept me engaged and interested throughout. As the class is about childhood, the readings are extremely relevant and engaging, and quite enjoyable to read. The workload was very manageable, with four papers split up throughout the semester, and several little assignments (but not worth much). Heather was a very thoughtful, passionate, and understanding professor that really made class enjoyable and interesting, and was also extremely helpful out of class. One of the best things we did in the class was taking a visit to the Beinecke to spend a class studying the collection of pop-up books. I would definitely recommend taking this class if you have an interest in childhood or improving your writing.",
    "English 114 12 is a course designed to establish a foundation for students in the ability toanalyze readings, create claims, and to support their claims with research and opinion. The specific title of the course focuses on the definition of childhood's role in society, which is very interesting seeing as students are just beginning to enter a stage in their lives where they can look back and recognize key points in their childhood. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very important to create that foundation for the rest of one's time at Yale.",
    "English 114 teaches how to structure an argument and form a claim. If the topic of topic of the course is something that interests you, writing essays is much easier than high school analysis. The course really helps learning how to write a research paper with proper formatting etc. If you already know how to do this, and explicitly want to focus on style and how your writing sounds\/feels, 120 may be a better choice. This class requires 4 essays(including 1 research paper), which are workshopped in class and critiqued by peers. I would recommend this course to those who need to organize their writing, learn how to write proper research papers, or want to become better writers and don't have time\/space\/etc. for 120.",
    "I would recommend the class to those who don't know how to write college academic papers.",
    "This class surprises you by taking what you understand about children and childhood and turning it upside down. The readings for each class were always very intriguing and the way Professor Klemann set up the discussion for these readings allowed each student to leave the room with enough knowledge to deconstruct and critique similar pieces of literature in a thorough way. Close reading is very important in this class so if you are not willing to really look into what you read and what you write, then do not consider taking this section of ENGL 114. It is truly enjoyable to be a student in the middle of childhood and adulthood when taking this class because there are times when you must identify with both sides and it brings about a social dilemma and idea in one's mind that truly helps when writing on such topics. I would recommend this class to any student that is willing to put his or her writing abilities and critical thinking abilities to the test."
