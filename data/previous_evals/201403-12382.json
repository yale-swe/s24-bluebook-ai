   "comments": [
    "This course covers introductory ideas in lots of different areas of philosophy: e.g. religion, free will and determinism, knowledge, morality, personal identity. A great first philosophy class if you haven't studied the subject before (this was my third philosophy class at Yale and I still enjoyed it tremendously). Daniel Greco is a great lecturer that makes the (sometimes complex) ideas covered in class really digestible, and gives lots of examples and analogies to help illustrate philosophical concepts in class, really helping the learning process. Workload and grading is very fair. Overall a solid classhighly recommended!",
    "It's a philosophy class, which at Yale is generally challenging for people who are not used to the type of work that it involves (this includes me). I think that the 3 essays + final workload was a bit excessive, but they challenged you to think logically, an extraordinarily important skill to have. The class is graded harshly by Yale standards (average is like a B) so this may be a good CDFail class. Other than that, yes it was a well organized and thought-provoking class. Those hoping to get any answers to life, here's a hint: there are none.",
    "Ended up being my favorite course of the semester. A fascinating and engaging class with a good deal of humor thrown in. I have rarely learned as much from a course as I did from this one, and I don't think I've ever looked forward to weekly lectures as much as I did here. That said, don't take it if you're serious about philosophy. We didn't spend much time on each subject, and jumped pretty quickly through. Also, take it Credit D if you're concerned about your grades, as the prof doesn't give A grades except to work he finds publishably perfect. Sheesh, man.",
    "PHIL112 is a good way to get an idea of the general style of philosophical writing and to be exposed to a range of contributions to major topics of philosophical debate. While the topics of debate were interesting, the lectures at times felt long and inconclusive.",
    "Great course for nonmajors and people interested in philosophy who have no prior background. The course is a survey on 6 different philosophical debates, and presents modern philosophical discussions on these problems. Greco is an amazing teacher who presents often dense philosophical arguments in a very clear and understandable manner, using frequent examples. The class isn't difficult; as long as you keep up with the readings and think about them you'll do fine (I Credit D'd it and maybe regret that decision). Note that the class doesn't really focus on chronology and presents a lot of 20th century academic philosophy, so if you're looking for an intro class to the \"greats,\" you might want to look elsewhere. Nevertheless, you'll learn a lot about what philosophy is and pick up the mindset, so it'll definitely prepare you for another higher level philosophy course in case you're interested.",
    "Problems of Philosophy is a pretty good intro class. For anyone who's never had experience in philosophy, it is definitely a good way to find out whether or not philosophy is actually interesting to you. However, if you're interested in more classical forms of philosophy, such as Plato and Aristotle, I wouldn't recommend this class because most of it focuses on fairly modern\/contemporary debates.",
    "Broad survey course of philosophical topics throughout the ages. It explores those nagging life questions that keep you up at night and encourages you to find your own answer. It's been an eye-opening and rewarding course. I think a philosophy class is valuable for anyone, even a STEM major like me. It was surprisingly concrete and much less wishy-washy than what I pictured a philosophy class would be. Encourages systematic, critical thinking about life and the world as we know it. Highly highly recommend! Not that much work either!",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class to someone interested in getting a taste of what philosophy is like. It exposes students to a diverse range of topics, so it's a great starting point for people who have never taken a philosophy class before. I definitely would not recommend it to people who have already taken several philosophy classes and already have a good sense of where their interests lie; it would probably be better for them to take a more focused class, which this most certainly is not.",
    "This is a course that will challenge you while simultaneously easing you into philosohical thinking and writing. It's a course that skims the surface, keeping the subject matter interesting but not in depth or intensive.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student looking for an intro course that provides skills in philosophical reasoning. If the student is looking for a discussion course of the subject matter of difficult philosophy questions, I would not recommend this class. If the student is looking to improve his or her reasoning, argument construction, and philosophy writing, I would recommend the course. I would caution fellow students that without any background in philosophy, the writing demands of this course are difficult. I found the assignments were the most difficult of my classes at Yale, but looking back, I value the learning experience."
