   "comments": [
    "It is an interesting class with readings assigned every week you will have one midterm, a final, and a short 5 page paper to turn in. Overall, not too much work and Professor Espinosa is incredibly nice!",
    "I would most definitely recommend it. The class isn't a huge load of work and it's very enjoyable. Professor Espinosa is amazing, and the material is extremely interesting.",
    "Yes! I liked this course a lot and felt like it did a great job of combining Latin American history and history of medicine\/public health.",
    "An engaging lecture course that gives you a good general understanding of Latin American history as well as the specifics of public health and medicine in the region. The readings are interesting (although you don't really have to do all of them). I found the class a really rewarding and informative experience. Professor Espinosa is great. Lecture does get a little scattered at times because it's dealing with such a huge topic.",
    "I came away from this class more with a sense of the history of colonial and modern Latin America in general than with an understanding of the role of medicine and\/or public health. Maybe that's an indication that they were not as directly important, in and of themselves, as they were tools of political mechanisms. Either way I was surprised at how relatively little medicine and public health was covered, given the title of the class and its department--the History of Science and Medicine.",
    "I would definitely recommended this and anything else Professor Espinosa teaches.",
    "The class was alright. I learned a bit about the relationship between medicine, public health, economics, and politics but there was not enough focus on health and medicine.",
    "I took this class thinking it would discuss the Public Health issues of Latin America since the 18th century. However, I was wrong since this class is more about looking at the history of Latin America from a health perspective. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it a lot and learned much. I had no historical background on Latin America but I didn't necessarily feel that I was at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the class. I wish the lectures had a more formalstructure and made more connections to the readings (which I particularly enjoyed).",
    "Yes! definitely! Great course. Great teacher. A bit disorganized at times, but ultimately, I learned a LOT. It was interesting. It was not demanding at ALL. Just take it, you'll definitely learn a ton.",
    "History 359 is presented as a class on public health and disease as a social agent, that at least by the 2nd halfof the course seems to be more about economics than anything else. It presents interesting themes, such as the myth of nationhood and the policing of the body politic but it never follows through and you are left grasping at straws by the course's end.The tests are a bit ridiculous, lecture is boring, and the some of the readings incredibly impertinent, but it does have the potential to be a good course.",
    "Its a good course. The readings are diverse and interesting and the professor is great.",
    "A series of case studies of epidemics and other public health crises in Latin American which illuminate some of the major trends in public health. A good introduction to modern Latin America or public health issues.",
    "This course was great! The lectures and readings were really interesting. There was never too much work, and in my opinion the exams and essays were graded fairly. I say if you are at all interested in medicine and public health in Latin America, you should definitely take this class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "This course is great for anyone wanting to get a course in both the medical as well as the political history of Latin America. The course's fast pace and diverse coursework makes it very exciting - I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting way to study Latin America.",
    "Yes- take it! I actually feel like I learned something applicable."
