    "I think it would be helpful to restructure the way the class was taught. The online notes for each section were very helpful, but I didn't get much from your going over them in class. I did learn lot when I actually had to use the notes and do examples and problem sets. This class might be a good opportunity for a flipped class; you could create videos of each topic where you go over the notes online, and show us the basics. Then, in class, we would do sample problems and get more hands-on, guided experience. I think the homework assignments and mid-terms were very useful, but there wasn't enough of it (at least in the beginning of the semester).",

    "The quizzes, because they made me sit down and actually use R",
    "Hands-on work and getting help to answer questions.",
    "Having time in class to work on exercises, homework assignments, etc. was very helpful because it gave students the opportunity to ask questions immediately when we were having trouble with a concept or problem.",
    "If you have indpedent research this is an amazing course. I go so much out of homework assigments and can say that my comprehension of the material really increased drastically throughout the course.",
    "Semi-weekly quizzes were really valuable in providing the hands-on experience necessary to learn the material.",
    "Simon's web-page is very well put together. I really liked being able to work through the pages before class so that we could answer questions or go into a little more depth in class. It was also very useful to refer back to the web-pages later during homework assignments, or when working with my won data. The homework was great at synthesizing the concepts and solidifying the code in my mind.",
    "R is really useful -- I already found myself using it in other courses. The class was helpful in forcing me to actually learn the program; while there are free resources online, this class actually gave me motivation to follow through on learning (rather than procrastinating forever, which is what would have likely happened otherwise). Also, Simon's notes on his website have been extremely helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were a bit weak",
    "Instructor presenting. It would be nice to focus a bit more on indexing when that topic is covered at the beginning of the course.",
    "I feel like the pace of the course could be improved...perhaps the beginning lectures could move faster, and more time could be dedicated to statistics, special topics in R programming, etc. I felt like we moved very slowly though the first portion of the class and too quickly through the last.",
    "It would be lovely if we actually received grades or feedback on the midterm. It's the end of the course and have not received.",
    "Assignments should be posted earlier, I felt like I was penalized for starting assignments too early because they would often change by the end of the week meaning more work just because I had started early.",
    "The pace of the course was a bit slow. Not a lot of ground was covered in a semester's worth of lectures. Too much class time was devoted to doing homework and quizzes, which could have been done on students' personal time, as the workload for the course was fairly light.",
    "I found it pretty easy to excel at this course. I think it is important to note here that prior to this I had no experience with programming, had been out of school for 8 years, and considered myself a bit of a Luddite. While it was very gratifying to do so well on my homework and mid-term assignments, I probably could have benefited from a slightly accelerated pace--or a few more concepts per week. That being said, I learned so much and I feel confident moving forward with continuing to learn R on my own.",
    "The semi-flipped structure of the class didn't work especially well for me personally; it was especially difficult to focus\/hear when Simon would be lecturing at the front of the room while Andrew helped students with questions in the back. Again, I really appreciated having Andrew available for such help, but having a second running discussion in such a tight space was very distracting.",
    "Try to get in more of the foundation material in class and with some warm-up exercises. If one misses material at the beginning, it is difficult to catch up."
