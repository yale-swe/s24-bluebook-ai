   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to develop my understanding of the U.S.-Mexico border as it has been constructed by empires, nations, media, the border patrol, and the migrant labor agricultural system in the U.S. I have grown to understand how this border operates not only where it is geographically located, but also where it is psychologically active in people who live in borderlands (which doesn't mean they live in areas near the physical border). I also gained a better understanding of how nation is imagined, built, and maintained and how borders reinforce ideas and realities of national belonging and exclusion.",
    "This course is relevant now more than ever to understand what to make of our current political perceptions of borderlands and immigrants and to understand how we've gotten here. Besides learning the borderlands' history, I've developed an ability to think critically about the more general process of nation-making and even interpret the United States as an empire, an argument corroborated by its relationship with Latinoamerican countries. The course gives an insight into a history often untouched but with rich information that explains how the United States perceives not only its Latinx neighbors but its Latinx citizens.",
    "I learned intellectual frameworks through which to understand processes of racialization, border making and nationhood.",
    "I learned how to zoom into a narrow time frame in history with the purpose of thoroughly comprehending it. It also provided me with very new and different perspective of how to view the struggles in the border area.",
    "I learned a lot about a history that is never spoken about in the U.S. I enjoyed every reading we had, the documentaries, and student presentations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course provides a much-needed overview of the history of the formation of the U.S.-Mexico border while integrating lessons from border theories and studies, which help inform students' learning about how the border functions and regulates in violent ways through physical and metaphysical forms. The main weakness of the course is that there is simply too much to cover when talking about the history\/theoretical functions of the border - I think it would've been helpful if instead of full books on parts of the border history, there were more selected chapters mixed with articles. I would've also enjoyed reading more primary sources and sources from Mexico - I could imagine these would be in Spanish, but I think even videos with English subtitles from Mexico to reveal more of the perspective from south of the border would enrich students' understanding of the border as between two spaces and not just imposed by one on the other.",
    "The course's material in principle was very interesting, and I admire the fact that Yale's ER&M department approved of a course that covered material that was so relevant to current political discussions on immigration. I think that this course's material is very important for providing more relevant historical context to U.S.-Mex Border politics today. BUT The largest weakness of this course was found in the professor's tendency to either get off topic from the lecture's material, or her tendency to get lost in the details of her lecture such that the students in the seminar would run out of time to discuss the material (or simply run out of time to discuss the lecture's material completely)... This is largely an organizational issue since the material, as I said above, was very fascinating. However, I did find that the lacking time management was occasionally detrimental to fully internalizing certain topics throughout the semester.",
    "The course does try to touch on a plethora of topics, and although I am grateful to have touched on so many subjects, I was often worried that we weren't investing as much time in a given topic as much as we would have. Since class time cannot be extended, perhaps cutting on readings (all the readings were pretty insightful, so maybe just selecting core sections) or on the topics covered would make the pacing of the class more manageable. The workload was also higher than previous seminars I have taken. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the timing of assignments (having a response due the same day as a paper) can make completing all the work to a satisfying degree challenging.",
    "It was intellectually fascinating. The lectures were dense and fast paced. It was hard to feel like I had a firm understanding of the lecture material. It would have been helpful either to have a handout or to have the lectures posted online as well.",
    "The strengths of this class includes having engaging conversations every class pertaining to highly stimulating content given as homework. The main flaw is that there is never enough time to cover everything, so I'd recommend cutting some of the readings (some weeks it was quite a bit).",
    "I really enjoyed the topics we went over in this class. Professor Quintana is extremely knowledgeable and really helpful, and has a way of explaining very complicated concepts. However, the class was disorganized , and definitely gave more work than should have been necessary. Additionally, a lot of times we did a lot of work (readings, presentations, reading responses) and we never got a chance to present on it or engage with that work. This was super discouraging. Professor Quintana tried to do a little too much in such a limited amount of time, and I would recommend in the future choosing one thing and sticking with it, and definitely sticking to what's on the syllabus! Students want a chance to discuss the work that they're doing, we want a chance to talk about the readings and reading responses that took us 10+ hours to do, so please let us!!! If she were to teach this course again, I would recommend sticking strictly to lecture OR seminar format. What we had was more of a lecture in a seminar time frame, which was very frustrating because a lot of students didn't sign up for this.",
    "I really wish we could have had more of a structure to the class and if we could have stayed on track more even though there is much to be said about the borderlands. We could have talked more about the readings. Everyone should have presented for the same amount of time to keep grading fair. Also, the weekly journals should have counted for a larger part of our grade since we did them every week."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because it engages history, theory, and practice of the U.S.-Mexico border - which makes it so enriched and dense in ways that allow students to really develop a nuanced understanding of the border in all its interwoven functions and meanings for different populations and powers.",
    "You might be thinking, \"How much can you learn about the history of the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands?\", to which you will be pleasantly surprised with the amount of knowledge and history that exists about this nation-defining region of the country. This class is definitely recommended to anyone wishing to understand not only often-excluded history but also how each of these events have helped formed identities of the populations living in these regions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! I think Professor Quintana is leaving and I have no clue if she's planning on coming back in the future. However, if it is, then I'd definitely recommend taking this class. This is very important content that everyone living in this political era would understand.",
    "Not in its current format and without working out a lot of the kinks. The readings were really interesting and a lot of the topics introduced by Prof Quintana were great. But it needs some serious improvements in terms of organization.",
    "Yes, a very good history class!"
