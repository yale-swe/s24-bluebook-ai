   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend English 289, but make sure you are willing to go and pay attention to lectures. A lot of kids missed out because they couldn't pay attention in lectures, and it isn't worth taking if you aren't going to benefit from the great points Professor Dimoch makes.",
    "We read 3 works from each of the 3 authors and look at themes\/stylistic innovations that reoccur. Two papers and a final exam, so the work load is not great, but the reading takes time. We read almost a book a week, and these are works that demand a lot of attention. But I would definitely recommend the class - I am not an American lit student, so it was a great intro to this one period. But I am an English major, and I think that the class suited me for that reason. Prof. Dimock is definitely an English professor; her lectures focus on close reading of texts rather than broader historical context (though that enters in). She is a wonderful close reader and caring professor.",
    "Only if you want to read the books because the lectures are not good.",
    "You're better off reading these books on your own. The course was not challenging or engaging; you'd get as much or more from reading critical commentary.",
    "The reading list is great, the lectures are pretty boring. It's really easy--I took it credit\/d and that was probably a mistake.",
    "This class has a lot of reading, but the book list is really great and it has a low workload otherwise.",
    "Excellent course if you want a fun and pretty easy way to have an excuse to read some of the greatest american classics.Work load is definitely not that much, and a totally awesome C\/D\/Fail course to take if you're looking for an extra class just because.",
    "Lots of reading and literary analysis-sometimes it seemed a bit obscure but if you like that sort of thing it's a great class! I would recommend it just for the readings. It's a good way to familiarise yourself with these authors if you never have read them before (or even if you have)",
    "Great books, below average professor\/lectures.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you want to get yourself to read books from the 3 writers. The discussions were interesting, as were the lectures, but things were often dry.",
    "Great class. Take it for the books. Wai Chee is actually really smart -- just boring. I didn't go to any of the lectures and did fine.",
    "The lectures aren't the easiest to follow, but they're not as bad as some say. Wai Chee is quite brilliant; her style just takes some getting used to. Great reading list, fun papers. Take it.",
    "The reading list is wonderful; the lectures less so. Ultimately worthwhile, particularly if you can snag a good section.",
    "This was the first English lecture class I've taken, and I don't think I care for the format. I'm not sure how it compares to other lectures, but it felt a little disjointed and it was odd to have a class where the focus was not at all affected by how different students thought or interpreted works. It was interesting to see how the professor linked the works we talked about, though. I also liked that there were a lot of sources of very interesting outside information that were not explicitly about the texts we were reading. Although they did contribute to the disjointed feeling of the lecture, they are worth looking at. It was nice that the professor related them to what we were reading, but did not necessarily give a complete interpretation of how the relation might change how the book is read. Oftentimes looking at the outside information would lead me to a new reading that was very different from my original thoughts or the interpretation presented in lecture. I do wish there had been a little more writing, and I would have liked to spend more time on discussion. However, the lectures were interesting, and if you come into a lecture having thought about your interpretation of the text it's very interesting to see how the professor's readings differ from or add to yours.",
    "Take it if you want to read great literature. The syllabus is awesome. Prof. Dimock's lectures help tip you off on what to look for while reading but usually don't present arguments about the texts.",
    "If you have any interest in reading Hemingway, Fitzgerald, or Faulkner, take this class. The reading list is great (three works from each author), and the work load is manageable. Lectures are pretty straightforward, and Professor Dimock usually ties all the readings to war.",
    "Not worth taken. Yes, the books are great. Read them on your own; the lectures are horrible. Dimock has no personality as a teacher and advances no interesting theories about the works. Her lectures often seem like slightly more academicized versions of middle school English: She identifies a shallow theme or symbol, points out instances of it in the book, and then says nothing about the greater implications of her observations. The paper prompts are uninspired and section was horrible (although that\u0092s luck of the draw I suppose). You only things you\u0092ll learn are those you figure out on your own.",
    "This is a really good way to get a handle on Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner, and to have some really interesting literary analysis thrown your way. You read some great books and analyze them in really interesting ways. But Professor Dimock's not the most engaging lecturer, and it is a lot to read - you probably won't get to doing as much of the reading as you think you will.",
    "The reading list is excellent. While it is true that the lectures can be dry, if you come to class with the reading done, you can get something out of each one. I would shop the class for more than one lecture to really get a sense of it.",
    "Absolutely. The books are fantastic--who doesn't want to spend a semester reading Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner? Professor Dimock is wonderful and her lectures are engaging and insightful. The workload is generally light--lots of reading, but it's fun, and two papers and a final, but they're not bad at all. Take it!",
    "English 289 is a survey course, considering Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner as American authors in the same (post WWI) historical context. I would give the course a lukewarm recommendation. I did not personally enjoy Professor Dimock's lectures because I often found her arguments difficult to follow. Section can help bring order to your own interpretation of the literature, but quality will depend upon the TA. I guess the bottom line is that you should take the course if you want to read the books but wouldn't otherwise -- the lecture and section ultimately do not add much.",
    "Great class, mostly for the reading list. Lectures can get a bit boring, especially toward the end of the semester when you're burnt out, but definitely worth it. A warning, though -- although the works you read are great, the reading load can get quite heavy at times.",
    "Great overview of some of the best American literature. Work load isn't too heavy, and section can be stimulating and insightful.",
    "I came away from this class with a true appreciation for only Faulkner. For Whom the Bell Tolls is very tedious, but Hemingway's other two works are decent. With the exception of The Great Gastby, I didn't enjoy Fitzgerald. Take the class if you genuinely like Faulkner and Hemingway as they make up the majority of the readings.",
    "A basic introduction to many of the major works of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in even one book on the syllabus. You really should be reading these books. They're pretty great.",
    "The readings are fantastic if you're into these authors; the lecture not so much. I kind of suspected that going into the course, and took it mostly to read the books. If you like Hemingway, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald and haven't read much by them it's probably worth taking. If not, or if you're looking for a terrific lecture, this course isn't for you.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in the authors! Also, don't be turned away by Wai Chee's first couple of lectures. She doesn't really hit her stride until Gatsby and the first Faulkner reading!",
    "WONDERFUL COURSE! GREAT, INSIGHTFUL LECTURES AND LECTURER! A must take at Yale!"
