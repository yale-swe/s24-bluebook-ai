    "Question 3: The problem sets were very simplistic and did not push the students. It is important to have a certainly level of depth to teach these concepts, and all of the students in the class were capable of much more.",
    "There is room for improvement in the class, but as a student on the Industrial Ecology track, this is a must-take",
    "The course was a comprehensive intro to industrial ecology and I enjoyed finding overlaps between the course material and other courses that I hadn't thought wee related before. I thought there was a slight disconnect between learning the theory of Ie in class and the practical application of it in our project but like how there is both in the course. Could provide more mentoring in initial phase of project.",

    "Both having an opportunity for practical work, and the broad issues addressed in the classroom.I also really enjoyed the idea of having students run the debates.",

    "The field work in Hawaii",
    "Great coverage of a wide variety of industrial ecology topics.",
    "Applying what we were learning in class through our project was the most rewarding part of the class, and really where I got the most out of it.",
    "Hawai'ian project: great opportunity to get touch with related industry and government departments",
    "Interesting material, very comprehensive, field trip and project was a great learning experience",
    "Field trip. Hawaii is a good place to be during Spring Break, the project is long but exciting. I feel that I took two class here, one is the theory of industrial ecology, the other is consulting practicum.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Paired with the strengths, all of these areas could really be strengthened. The practical work could use more supervision and connection with the course work. The board issues should be paired with concrete knowledge. Also, the debates would benefit a great deal from the professors giving some input into what makes a good debate, and more direct feedback at the end of the debate about what was strong and what was weaker. It felt like a missed opportunity to really push students to strengthen their arguments and express themselves.",
    "There should be more work on methodologies. It would have been useful to at least scratch the surface of how MFAs and LCAs are actually done.",
    "More time in class to discuss our projects while we're still working on them - to help ensure we're getting the most out of it as a group. Also, the midterm didn't seem to add any value to the class; would have been better to spend the time on the project or some other more practical exercise.",
    "I would have liked more detailed explanations about the methodologies of MFA\/LCA\/etc. IT would have been helpful to have problem sets where students do a \"mini\" MFA or LCA, just to get an idea about how these are actually done.",
    "I felt the class was too much of a theoretical survey. I really would have liked more practice in the mechanics of LCAs or MFAs, both through instruction and via problem sets. I felt like I got a good overview of IE, but I would have liked to have gone a little less broad and a little more deep into some more pragmatic skill-building.",
    "Maybe needs some more assignment review part. We just didn't know why we are right or wrong for the midterm paper and assignments.",
    "Finding a way to sacrifice some of the breadth for some depth on topics that show current applications of industrial ecology in areas like policy or otherwise would be interesting.",
    "More initial project mentoring, have all previous class reports available for review",
    "The class should include basic training for practical industrial ecology tools, like material flow analysis, or life cycle analysis. It would be nice to have a few problem set on these topics.",
    "Increased emphasis on performing calculations and real world application of industrial ecology concepts."

    "It is great to have opportunities to work in a team, to pull from each other's strengths. The challenge is that with no guidance, it is hard to develop a pace that is right for everyone and to keep everyone on track.",
    "Got to know fellow students very well and got to work with a client, which was great exposure to post-school life.",
    "The advantages were everyone's talents could be contributed to the group. Without much outside guidance or leadership, however, there was an added pressure on some members to carry much more of the load. The disadvantage to that is actually that some people may not have learned how to approach these kinds of projects and problems on a macro-level, which should be a goal of the class and this school, in my opinion.",
    "I learned a great deal from my classmates, who brought different backgrounds and skills to the table. In truth, I would not have been able to complete our project on my own without their strong contributions. At the same time, as always, group work can be slow and frustrating... but that's just the way it is!",
    "In our case a better sense of what the project was from the outset might have saved us quite a bit of time.",
    "Group work was a great learning experience, though the project took more time than I initially thought it would",
    "working in diversity and understanding team dynamics",
    "The best learning experience I had yet at F&ES. Working as a consulting team in Hawaii to solve complex problems is definitely the highlight of my class experience."

    "Take full advantage of the study tour and think hard of how can you add value to the project. Try to incorporate things you learned in the class to the project if you can."
