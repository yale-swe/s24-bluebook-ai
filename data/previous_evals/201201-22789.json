   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading. The class included a few film screenings as well, all of which were great films. Overall, a pretty good class.",
    "CHNS 250 with Professor Hashimoto was a good class. The material was very interesting and I felt I learned a lot, not only about Chinese literature, but also Chinese history, society, and culture. That said, the course simply tried to cover too much material in too short a time. Each week we would only discuss maybe 1\/2 of the assigned readings, an even then, these discussions were quite shallow.I would tentatively recommend this course; hopefully in future semesters, professors will be slightly less ambitious in the amount of literature that can be covered.",
    "Yes. This was one of my favorite classes this semester. The syllabus is incredibly well-crafted and structured. Prof. Hashimoto is approachable and genuinely interested in his students' learning.",
    "Yes! But Hashimoto won't be around next year.",
    "For anyone who is interested in Chinese culture\/literature\/history or who wants to read great novels and have thought-provoking discussions, this class will be a great choice. Also, professor hashimoto is a very well-organized and caring instructor (with a good sense of humor, too). It would be a rare chance to take this course at Yale since he is based in Harvard--so if you have the chance, don't miss it!",
    "I would highly recommend the class. Although the materials are not always extremely interesting, but must be appreciated as relevant historically."
