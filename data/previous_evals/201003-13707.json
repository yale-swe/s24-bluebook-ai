    "I would recommend this class to someone who is good at research and good at papers and also in need of a science credit. If you're not good at papers, though, don't do it. This class puts all your eggs in one basket.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yeah, pretty easy science credit.",
    "If you need a science but you hate science take this because it really let's you kinda use your own approach.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a relatively unstressful science credit.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are the type of person who likes researching on your own. Basically for the entire class you are on your own. However, Professor Summers is not intimidating so you could approach him easily to ask for help.",
    "Yes, a great class for learning many things in many aspects of life and doing deep research.",
    "It is admittedly a good opportunity to do some interesting science research on your own, but class sessions can easily get monotonous. Prof. Summers knows his stuff, though."
