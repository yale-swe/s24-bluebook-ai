    "Provides an introduction to how WGSS can be applied to literature studies.",
    "This workshop involves attending and participating in a series of lectures, workshops, and discussions with fellow graduate students and professors in various fields who interests are broadly related to Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies. The workshop allows you to engage with work that you otherwise might not. It includes students in the humanities and the social sciences, though I would say it is more humanities-oriented. I would recommend it (and indeed, have) to students whose work explores gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and\/or power.",
    "The common sessions with guest speakers can be really wonderful. It probably depends less on your interest in the material, though, than the dynamics of the group.",
    "Yes I would!"

    "I know far more about literature studies now than before.",
    "This course challenged me to think about my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective. My work focuses on perceptions of people who are transgender, and the last week of class in particular challenged me to think about the ways in which trans studies can inform my work as a psychologist.",
    "It was inspiring!"
