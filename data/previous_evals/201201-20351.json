    "Definitely. Take this course, especially if you are interested in America's injustices and unfair law practices.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in learning about realness without any fluff.",
    "This class engages in supreme court cases and legal decisions pertaining to American citizenship from the early 19th century to the mid 20th century. Discussions of American citizenship include a range of topics from: the Dred Scot case, to Reconstruction , to American Indian conditional citizenship, to Latino citizenship with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, to Chinese exclusion in the late 19th century, to cases of peonage and internment, to the Civil Rights Movement in the mid 20th century.This is an incredible class and I highly recommend it to everyone!!! It is quite possibly one of the most important classes I have ever taken since it greatly enhanced my knowledge of the American legal system with regard to citizenship rights. Additionally, many of the weekly topics were never addressed in my high school and undergrad classes. I feel that it is really important to learn American legal history and it is also important to have a better understanding of the Civil Rights Movement. I can now write a legal memo which I could never do before taking this class!"

    "Enriching and exposing knowledge of injustices imposed upon communities in America and highlighting the hypocrisy of it all. This definitely helps enrich my view on social policies, laws, history, socio-political histories, and just America as a whole.",
    "As a History PhD student, I believe this class greatly enhanced my educational experience at Yale. Since my focusis indigenous U.S. history I was able to enhance my understanding of American Indian legal history. I appreciate that Professor Cleaver helped to foster my interest in American Indian citizenship, and were it not for her class I would not have an understanding in this field. After taking this class, I would like to study court cases of Alaska Native marriages and civil disputes in the 1890s. I believe that this research on Alaska Native court cases will be incorporated into my dissertation. This class helped me understand how to research court cases and I acquired some skills in writing legal memos and legal history. I believe I will work with Professor Cleaver in the future and I would love her help on researching Alaska Native court cases."
