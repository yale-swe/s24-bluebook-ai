    "I developed a pretty good beginner's knowledge of modern Greek! I feel like my Greek has really improved, and I can talk to my family a whole lot better now.",
    "Basic conversational skills, numbers, counting, basic phrases\/vocabulary, knowledge of Greek culture",
    "This L1 language course is highly communicative - you learn not only the basic grammar structures typical to a first year class, you also learn communicative strategies and, as a result, retain a great deal of new vocabulary without recourse to drills, etc.",
    "I learned the modern Greek alphabet as well as basic grammar, words, and sentence structures.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the greatest strength of the course is the speed and care with which each topic is learned- I don't think it goes too fast or too slow, and I feel like I always have a good grip on the vocab\/grammar before I move on",
    "Very well organized. The professor is very knowledgeable, kind, and helpful. She pushes us in the right direction. Pace was not especially quick. Perhaps more practice speaking on exams would be helpful",
    "I believe this course was overall perfect. Marias engagement with her students, passion for teaching, and love of Greek comes along in every lesson and allows for not just better learning but for an enjoyable class as well.",
    "I think Maria is a fantastic teacher, whose class is geared towards teaching students how to speak, as well as gain literacy. She emphasizes Greece as a cultural locale in a manageable way for the L1 level and accommodates inquiries unrelated or adjacent to the textbook. The communicative method mentioned above is truly a fantastic strength and the students' proficiency really benefits from such a methodology.",
    "I think this course functions very well as an introductory language course. Perhaps it could be improved by having students do dictations\/more reading out loud in class.",
    "strengths: Maria is a wonderful instructor, is very helpful in answering any questions and is reasonable about workload and flexible in dates when other classes are really challenging, but you still learn a ton weaknesses: the book is designed in a more modern style, which is frustrating for those who enjoy formalism in language acquisition"

    "Yes! Maria is a fabulous teacher and a bright light in my Yale experience--she makes learning Greek fun and engaging! I'm so lucky to have had her as a teacher!",
    "Absolutely. Maria's class is an incredibly inclusive, fun, and open environment. It is a pleasure to attend the classes and you will find yourself advancing through the material with surprising ease due to Maria's teaching strategies.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to students looking for an introductory language course regardless of whether or not they have a Greek background.",
