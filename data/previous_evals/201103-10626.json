   "comments": [
    "labor is clearly a very diverse and interesting field, but the course heavily focuses on complicated econometric issues, so students that get the most out of the course are those most interested in and prepared for these issues",
    "Labor economics class heavier on the structural methods, pretty time consuming - if you are interested in labor economics, then it is probably satisfying, if you aren't very interested, then it might be too much work for your interest level.",
    "This is a very comprehensive course that covers a lot of material and gives a very interesting overview of labor economics. In particular, recent literature and interesting directions for future research are discussed. I would definitely recommend it for students interested in questions related to labor economics. I was not considering labor as my major field when I started the course, but I gained a lot of new insights from this course that will be helpful for my research."

   "comments": [
    "labor is a crucial part of my current and future research agenda, so the material was certainly relevant. However, my more applied sub-field is perhaps not as focused on the difficult econometric questions that much of the class centered on",
    "Again, the course provided a great overview of the field of labor economics which was very helpful.",
    "Great coverage of labor economics. Furthermore, the course provided me with a deeper understanding of the relationship between theory and observed data and microeconometric methods."
