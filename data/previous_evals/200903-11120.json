    "I would summarize the course as being a crash course in the history of theory from Pythagoras to Zarlino with an enormous reading list and stimulating class discussion. I would certainly recommend this course to another student, especially if it were going to be taught by David Cohen again, who kept the level of discussion high at every class meeting.",

I could not be more glad about having had the opportunity to learn the things I did in a seminar environment as stimulating as Music 721 was."
