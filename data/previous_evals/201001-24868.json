    "Only take this if you are interested enough in the subject matter to figure a lot out on your own. And if you can deal with occasional bouts of extremely time-consuming, often tedious, work.",
    "I liked this course more by the end of it than I did in the beginning, mostly because the topics we talked about towards the end were much more interesting than the basic acoustics we learned at the beginning. Matt Wolf seems a little unsure of himself, but if you can get past that, he is a good teacher who knows a lot about his subject. Basically, you should take this course if you're interested in phonetics.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn about the science behind phonetics. The material is interesting and the work is not difficult.",
    "Intense. A serious look into modern phonetics. Includes a lot of theory. Only take it if you have a significant interest in phonetics as a field."
