    "Polymer characterization technique, Models to characterize the polymer properties.",
    "I have learned a great deal about the behavior of polymers in various solvents, polymer behavior under certain adsorption or force-based constraints, and useful polymer characterization techniques.",
    "I get to know much better on how to think about polymer in terms of micro-scale and macro-scale perspectives.",
    "Good physical insight into polymer physics. Nice basic background for polymer chemistry. Welcome side-bars into characterization techniques such as light scattering and GPC.",
    "I think this class gave a good foundation for my research. It also covered some practical topics, such as characterization methods, which will be useful.",
    "I learned how to apply the measurement tools for characterizing polymers to my research. I learned the importance of both solvent and polymer choice in research. I learned the basics of polymer science and how characterization is closer to physics than chemistry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: A lot of math is included to help us understand Weakness: If the course content could be more related to the real experiment, it would be better.",
    "The course was very thorough and I know that I have learned a significant amount of useful information on polymer physics and dynamics. I wish there was more clarity at the start of the semester about which textbook would be most useful. I purchased Hiemenz and Lodge and was frustrated when all of our homework was out of Rubenstein.",
    "Various related topics are covered in the course, which is a great way to know not only the theoretical part of polymer physics but also how it is used experimentally.",
    "The class gave a good overview of the topic. The derivations were a bit hard to follow in the beginning, so maybe go slower through each step. It would also be helpful to get feedback on our homework assignments or to have solutions made available after the assignments are due so that we can learn from the assignments, even if we did not get the correct answers.",
    "I like the method of grading. I was just as engaged in the course as I would be with testing. I liked the focus on how this new knowledge could be applied to research, rather than just a general conveyance of facts. I think we should go over homework in class after its been graded. Other than that, I really liked the course."

   "comments": [
    "Very good course, will learn a lot from it.",
    "Yes, this is a great course and it provides great insights to the study of polymers.",
    "Yes, I'll definitely recommend this course to other students who want to know more about polymer. The course load is not that high but it's very clearly explained and throughout the course it makes you think more about what you have learned and what you just learned.",
    "Definitely. Very well-taught. Instructor cared about students' learning.",
    "Yes, especially if the student's research has any connection to polymers.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who does not have prior background in polymers, or has experience but wants a refresher on theoretical fundamentals. The course is very comprehensive (broad but not deep), and the instructor makes sure to introduce concepts, terms and methods which frequently appear in polymer scientific literature and are commonly used by the community.",
    "I would recommend the course, especially to those working with polymers. It was extremely useful and interesting."
