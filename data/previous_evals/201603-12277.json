   "comments": [
    "Common concepts in statistical mechanics (covered on syllabus). In particular, simple models like the Curie-Weiss and Ising Chain models, renormalization group, and BKT transitions.",
    "The renormalization group, Ising model, Curie-Weiss model, landau-ginzburg theory, the role of critical exponents in relating different quantities, Kosterlitz Thouless transitions, the role that fluctuations have in determining the properties of a system",
    "Phase transitions, order parameters, universal aspects, Kosterlitz-Thouless, 1D ising, renormalization group, etc. etc.",
    "I developed an understanding of the use of field theory in statistical physics and condensed matter. I have a much better understanding of phase transitions and was exposed to mind-blowing ideas such as critical universality. This course certainly made me a better physicist.",
    "Phase transitions are insane",
    "Insight into deifferent methods of solving stat mech problems",
    "I learned about the basics of statistical field theory and our modern understanding of phase transitions. I feel equipped to discuss matters of symmetry breaking, critical behavior, and RG theory as they apply to theoretical models of macroscopic materials.",
    "I developed a much more in depth understanding of statistical mechanics, specifically phase transitions. I have a much deeper appreciation of phenomenological theories that describe properties of very different systems based on simple assumptions about the dimensionality of space and the dimensionality and symmetry of the order parameter. I feel that I got exposed to very interesting physics and complex concepts without needed a ton of background in the mathematical tools needed to perfectly describe these phenomena (e.g. topology, group theory).",
    "I developed a knowledge of phase transitions and the renormalization group."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was very well taught. At first it seemed like a bunch of random models, but quickly I realized how they were all related. The problem sets did a good job in expanding my understanding of the material. I also really enjoyed going into modern things like the KT transition which was just awarded the Nobel",
    "very good teaching, interesting material, very accessible exposition.",
    "I really think the course was excellent. I suppose typed lecture notes from a TA would be a nice thing to still have after the course ended, or maybe laying out the direction of the course before-hand so students could have a bigger picture view early on. But all in all excellent course.",
    "Lectures could benefit from more organizational clarity",
    "Strengths - Learned a lot from homework and office hours ,in addition to lectures.",
    "The course was well-organized and very clear. As discussed below, Professor Glazman is an excellent teacher, and I feel that I learned the material from him very well. The problem sets were challenging but interesting--they often required a lot of thought, but relatively little tedious work to actually write up. At the beginning of the course, it was advertised that we might discuss quantum phase transitions to some extent. Unfortunately, we ran out of time, but I think students in future years would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this material.",
    "The strengths of this course were in the way the professor would both rigorously address problems but also step back and give a summary or big picture\/intuitive discussion of the concepts. The focus on building an intuition for these concepts was something I appreciated in this course that many courses tend to gloss over.",
    "This course is very well designed.",
    "There weren't tests, which took a lot of pressure off during finals week. The homework problems were mathematically challenging, but always interesting. The workload was great."

   "comments": [
    "If the topics covered on the syllabus are relevant to your research, you'll find it useful. Glazman's enthusiasm for physics is contagious. The course load isn't bad. The course should really have final exams though - said no one, ever.",
    "Yes. As a biophysicist, this course will be extremely fundamental in my understanding of phase transitions in all types of matter",
    "very interesting material and very relevant for condensed matter research. you would benefit from a deeper understanding of mathematical methods (i.e. after taking PHYS 460\/506) but such a background is not necessary.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have the requisite background (a decent background in statistical mechanics). You learn really cool things like BKT transition and critical unversality.",
    "Yes but be prepared to do a lot of supplemental reading",
    "Yes, I think this is a good course for studying stat mech beyone stat mech I. The instructor is also very helpful.",
    "This class was well taught and covered very interesting material. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Definitely. I found it much more interesting than Stat Mech 1 and enjoyed worked with the models and types of physics addressed. I believe students should be familiar with phase transitions and critical phenomena, especially if the student is interested in condensed matter.",
    "Any student interested in phase transitions should take this course.",
    "Yes. I looked forward to going to class."
