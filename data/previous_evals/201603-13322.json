    "Shimi was fantastic. He gives so much of his time to students, totally understands their concerns (from a personal and a technical level), and is incredibly supportive!",
    "Shimi was the best part about this course (but the material was cool, too).",
    "Shimi is really interested in making sure that all of his students have a positive learning experience, and being in his class is a complete delight.",
    "To be honest, I was completely dreading this class. I have very little formal training in science and was unsure of how I would fare even in an introductory course. It was a complete surprise to me that by the end of this semester, this course ended up as my favorite. To say I learned a lot in this class would be an understatement - I am a completely different student now than I was when I first walked through the door. It was by no means an easy course (in fact, I struggled quite a bit) but it was incredibly rewarding.",
    "Incredible course. Shimi is a dedicated and passionate instructor that everyone at FES should work with at some point in their education here!",
    "Shimi was really diligent about going through concepts that we seemed to have trouble with and that was much appreciated. He was also so incredibly generous with his time and energy - so accessible. He does a wonderful job of being careful but efficient with the massive amount of learning material. Shimi is the best!",
    "Questions 13: Shimi always made a strong effort to explain difficult concepts to students and was readily available after class and outside of class. Overall, I was very pleased with the split course format and Shimi altered individual class sessions to explain material in online lectures depending on students' score on out-of-class quizzes.",
    "Shimi is hands down the best science teacher that I have ever had. He is excellent. His concern for the students is evident from the first day. He carefully reviews the material and is able to explain these complex concepts in a number of different methods. He is thoughtful, integrating student questions into the homework sets so that we can learn more about the issues that interest us. I cannot recommend him enough."

    "Shimi is a really good teacher and it seems like he sincerely wants everyone to do well. I liked the flipped course format.",
    "Shimi and the TAs. The water section was most interesting to me.",
    "Shimi was very approachable and made himself easily accessible for questions or extra help. He hosted so many review sessions before the exam and helped his students genuinely understand the material. The class is taught flipped which is a great arrangement because it lets people learn at their own pace. The quizzes every week were also helpful for him to gauge how people were doing with the material which he then went over in class later.",
    "Having Shimi as the professor! Also the fact that it was flipped, and getting to learn about climate science. You'd think FES would have more courses on climate change but I think this is about it.",
    "The course is well structured, the content is very useful for professional purposes. Inspire you to look up for more information about earth sciences.",
    "Shimi's great!",
    "While this course was alot of work, I think it afforded students every opportunity to succeed and seek out extra help if needed. It also covered a great deal of material in one semester.",
    "A VERY good foundation of physical sciences. It's information that we should all know as we work in the environmental field!",
    "This was a very good introductory course. Covers a lot of material and it is made as simple as possible and it is easy to understand.",
    "Shimi is an amazing teacher. He presents complicated material in clear and concise ways. He kept the course simultaneously very challenging and very manageable at the same time. The flipped classroom provided plenty of opportunity for clarification both from Shimi, from the TAs and from fellow students.",
    "Shimi is the best professor I had all semester, hands down. I know my skill set and learning style is so different from his, but he always made me feel at ease and comfortable in asking questions - regardless of how elementary they might be. In addition to the instruction, the clear structure of the course - with video lectures and class notes available - made the large amount of material covered manageable.",
    "The problem sets and quizzes were demanding but really important to my learning. Shimi's office hours and reviews sessions were critical for clarification of concepts.",
    "Shimi's ability to cover a vast amount of information in a coherent way in such a short amount of time made this course worth taking. The intermittent environmental examples that tied the concepts together really helped bring the more conceptual material into a 'real world' focus.",
    "The flipped course material, online quizzes, and problem sets made it convenient for students to review material, improve their understanding of the material, and prepare for exams. Shimi is very thorough in explaining the material and strives for all students to understand difficult concepts.",
    "This course provides vital information for anyone hoping to pursue a career in the environmental sector",
    "Professor Anisfield. He is a remarkable professor.",
    "-Shimi was very responsive to student questions and clearly cares about his students. The teaching assistants were excellent.",
    "1. Video lectures. Able to pause and look up unfamiliar concepts and interesting points. 2. Applicable assignment activities teach us how the science is actually done in real world. For example, I really enjoyed using USGS and NOAA databases to evaluate the state of drought in Connecticut, and the variability of sea level rise across North America. These activities deepen our understanding of course materials.",
    "Shimi is a phenomenal instructor. He is so knowledgeable and very skilled at convey complex information to an audience that may not have much experience in this field. It is obvious that he as spent a great deal of time refining the course, and his commitment to being a good teacher is noted and admirable. The flipped structure works very well in this course."

   "comments": [
    "I wish that things had moved a little slower. We covered so much that it had to be pretty fast, but sometimes spending more time would have really helped me understand the material better.",
    "Quizzes sometimes seemed to be quite harder than the material learned in the video lectures.",
    "On weeks where we have an exam, we would also have quizzes for new material which was overwhelming and not conducive to learning. The review sessions could have been a part of class as well which would have been easier for students.",
    "The course covers a LOT of material. I personally would have liked more of a refresher on chemistry, but there just didn't seem to be time. I also never felt like I fully understood everything we had to know about rocks.",
    "Perhaps some experiments or lab work would help to understand in a practical way some concepts covered.",
    "there's a steep learning curve in this class with the flipped-class style, but otherwise everything is great",
    "We had to prepare for unit exams (and the final) while we were still learning new material fo the next unit. It was ALOT of work outside of class and I think there was a certain level of knowledge assumed for students coming in.",
    "I didn't get much out of the problem sets where we were just plugging numbers into formulas. Maybe instead of a short problem set per class it will be better to have a longer one per week that helps us delve deeper into the topic. At times it was also unclear why we were learning certain facts. It will be great to have more examples in class or readings of short articles in problem sets to help us better understand the significance of the concepts. I'd also like to see more connections between the three modules that we studied (Water, Air, Climate). For example at the end of the course one classmate explained to us the Nitrogen cycle and it was so great to connect the dots between all the pieces we have learned regarding the N cycle.",
    "Sometimes the pace of the in-class lectures and clicker questions were too fast to follow.",
    "The two-test final was...tough.",
    "My only complaint is that sometimes questions of the exams were not indicative of what was stressed in class. Like it would be a very specific memorization question versus a more systems-thinking question. But those were few and far between.",
    "The course covers a wide amount of material. I am not sure that there is a solution to this challenge as all of the material is important.",
    "-The powerpoints for this course need a lot of improvement. I suggest that a teaching assistant be hired to revise the format\/content of the powerpoints. -It was assumed that students already understood many concepts that were covered, which resulted in a fast-paced course that left some students behind. I know that some of the international students in class struggled a lot with this. -This is a flipped course, so I expected most of class time to be spent on problem sets. However, at least half of each class was a lecture during which we reviewed material from the recorded lectures and in which new information was introduced. Thus, students had limited time to work on their problem sets in class and ended up having to finish their problem sets outside of class (which often required taking time to go to office hours and get help from the TAs) and watch all recorded lectures for the next class. If the powerpoints and recorded lectures were clearer, I don't think it would be necessary to spend so much time in class going over the materials, and the course would function more efficiently.",
    "Linkage among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere could be strengthened. For example, biogeochemical cycling of C and N span across the 3 systems. By the time we studied global N budget and fluxes in section 4.5, anthropocentric perturbations to the N cycle (e.g. aquatic eutrophication) that were covered earlier in the semester in the water quality lectures seemed a little disconnected.",
    "The last section, atmosphere, was a bit rushed, but otherwise this class was exceptional. Hands down my favorite class."

    "The flipped classroom was a bit of an adjustment, but I think it worked well to have remedial lectures and time to work on problem sets be the 'class' time, with the video lectures available to view whenever",
    "The case studies at the end of each section could be improved. Often times only the presenters were able to grasp the reading materials, while the rest simply sat back and passively listen.

    "It was informal group work (working on problem sets with other students). It was a very helpful part of the class, and I appreciated having the flipped course structure so we could do that.",
    "We worked on problem sets in groups, but you could do so individually. It was a great way to get to know classmates.",
    "Advantages of learning from one another doing problem sets.",
    "Very advantageous to work together on problem sets in class instead of struggling alone at home. Major benefit to the flipped class structure!",
    "The course is set up to encourage students to work together in small groups to complete homework sets. These homework groups were very helpful as we could take out the questions together and learn from each other.",
    "See my response to Question 19.",
    "It was great to talk through complex topics with classmates. Very helpful."

    "Stay on top of work. Take notes while you are watching the videos; be an active learner. Take advantage of TA and evening help sessions.",
    "Shimi is just wonderful. He really cares about his students and goes out of his way to be available if you ever need help on anything. There is a lot of material to cover in this course, but Shimi makes it fun. I LOVED that the course was flipped--that really helped my understanding and allowed for more time to ask questions of Shimi while working on the problem sets in class. Personally, I think this course should be required for anyone who is interested in climate change in any way. The information you learn is very important no matter where you go on to in the environmental field.",
    "Be ready to invest a lot of time in the course, but totally worth. NASA videos are also useful for those visual learners.",
    "be patient with yourself with the flipped classroom. if you're not familiar with this type of learning, there's a steep learning curve, but you'll get the hang of it eventually.",
    "Although you may not be going into the hard sciences you should still have an idea of whats going on in the world. This course gives that overview and Shimi is the most hard-working and responsive professor I've had here.",
    "Be prepared for alot of time spent outside of class in order to grasp the materials. Go to office hours often!",
    "Take it if you feel you need to improve your science foundation! The workload is heavier than a normal course but it is broken down into small chunks so it is manageable. When you study for a module exam, take good review notes\/ make flash cards so that when the final exam comes around you can review everything quickly. This is the best class I took this semester and I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "If you do not have a background in physical science, you should take this course. It covers topics that any personal with an environmental management degree should be well-versed in, no matter what your specialization is. Be prepared for a lot of work. If you don't put in the time, you won't get anything out of the course. If you do, you will benefit greatly. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Take it. You will be better off because of it.",
    "Do it! Before taking it I was unsure of how the specifics of the material covered would fit in to my overall course of study, but it ended up being very relevant, plus Shimi is an excellent educator.",
    "I would recommend that any students who did not take scientific courses throughout their undergraduate studies take the course. I believe that understanding the science behind climate change is essential to crafting solutions to the wicked problems we face in the field. Shimi works really hard to ensure that all students learn the material and understand the concepts covered in the course. I highly recommend this course to incoming students, especially those without a strong scientific background.",
    "Take it. It is a great course and Shimi is an excellent professor.",
    "-Be prepared for a fast-paced course that is very quantitative. -Print out every powerpoint and take detailed lecture notes.",
    "This course covers a broad range of topics. Focus on the field you are most interested in and go beyond the books.",
    "Just take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Be aware of the flipped nature of the course. The majority of learning is in video lecture and quizzes taken out of class time. If this isn't for you, this course might not be right for you."
