    "Agroforestry is very relevant to understanding evolving and profitable land-use regimes in especially developing countries. I had the opportunity to reflect on some traditional approaches to agriculture and landuse in view of data presented in this course. It was a useful exercise.Great case studies!",
    "lectures presented a lot of information. might be worthwhile to cover fewer topics but with more depth.",
    "Overall, this was a good course. Provided a very thorough look at a particular conservation\/development strategy, one that I think has a lot of potential.",
    "Q 9c: Field trips did not seem very relevant to the course but did contribute to a better overall understanding of local agriculture. Virtual field trips were more appropriate and informative.",
    "3. Grading was not harsh in this course, but the instructor offered prolific comments on my final paper. They will help me a lot as I move forward.",
    "This is a hugely important class for FES students wanting to work in practical forest management. This is one of only a handful of classes that lets us learn about the actual application of land management systems. It serves temperate interests as well as tropical, and caters to the students interested in agriculture, biodiversity conservation, forestry, community development and other sectors."

    "The case studies",

    "Florencia's vast store of knowledge. She has done a lot of work in the field, which is really helpful when she is giving her lectures.",
    "The organization worked well (dividing agroforestry up thematically\/by type of system or factor involved in agroforestry systems). Emphasis on specific tree species and tree-crop combinations was useful.",
    "This course gave me practical knowledge. I feel like I now have enough background knowledge to be able form an informed opinion about, and draw lessons from a wide range of agricultural systems.",
    "I learned a ton without too much academic stress.",
    "The concept of Agroforestry was new to me, and so the first half of the course was very enlightening and useful for my paper and my coming summer research.",
    "The instructor is very knowledgeable about the subject matter - she has spent many years working in different locations and is good at including guest speakers, and different perspectives into he lectures. The readings are spot-on."

   "comments": [
    "Should be more discussion-based rather than lecture based. If people all had to read some papers then come to class to discuss them after only a short lecture, then we could get a lot more out of the course. Lecture powerpoints are also way too long (60 + slides!).",
    "lectures could have more depth and less breadth.",
    "The readings were, for the most part, not really that helpful--a lot of them reiterated what was said in lecture, and there were a lot of them. I also wish that reading requirements had been clearer--as far as what had to be done, and by when. Also, the readings were not online at the beginning of the semester, which made it really hard to get them done, since they were only on closed reserve at Kline.",
    "Integration of themes and greater depth of information presented are needed. Good examples and case studies were presented but the straight lecture style prevented much engagement. I would especially have liked to have seen more classes dedicated to design of agroforestry systems and more discussion on the social elements of agroforestry. Spending more time on design would have been a good way to integrate themes and components.",
    "The instructor was occasionally dismissive of certain students' questions.",
    "Individual classes should not be taught with the power point as the template, but rather a discussion with the class. The class size is rather small and allows for discussion. If this would be given at least once a week, I believe that the students would be more negaged in the readings and the presentations. Havng the classes given via powerpoint, almost mechanically, is not engaging and often frustrating as questions were not answered",
    "The instructor often goes over time - and students sometimes have to leave to get to classes in other parts of campus."

    "My TA was very helpful and always willing to respond. When directing a class he was clear and engaging, allowing more class conversation than usual. The teacher was available during the first weeks of the semester, answering to emails only as the semester went by and having less available time for office hours. When in office hours, she was extremely helpful and very insightful.",

I was surprised to learn how many of the principles of the course hold relevance to the management of urban landscapes (which is more or less my area of academic focus).",
    "It was exciting to learn about the practice of agroforestry, because I believe it has a great deal of potential for the agricultural area I study.",
    "My master\u0092s program has a focus on ecosystem services and rural development. This course was central to understanding different agricultural systems used across the tropical forests, which is my region of interest.",
    "This is a key class for my academic interests. I have a working vocabulary and understanding of the main agroforestry systems and would be prepared to work in evaluation, research or implementation of most of them. The only thing that would have been great is to include a field trip to a tropical country over spring break."

    "The course did not live up to my expectations. I did learn much about agroforestry, being a new topic to me. I wished we had gone deeper into the different systems, and were able to discuss more in class. This last aspect, the lack of in class conversation, was perhaps the most frustrating part of the course.",

    "Yes.",
    "Since I had never encountered this topic before I was not expercting much more than what I learnt in the lessons. The class helped me discover my interest in agroforestry and its potential for cabon sequestration and rural development in developing countries. The class gave me an opportunity to do my own research in coffee agroforestry systems and carbon sequestration for my final paper. Once again, I wished we had gone deeper into the different agroforestry systems, this would have further my paper.",

    "Reading the assigned articles and book chapters will add greatly to what you get out of this class.",
    "Be mindful that the class will not be very interactive. The lessons are read from the powerpoint. In class questions are welcomed but not encouraged, that was my feeling of it.That being said, the topic is very interesting and important for anyone who wants to work in rural development in the tropics.To get the best out of the class the readings MUST be followed and one to two questions prepared for the lesson prior to going in the classroom. Florencia is very insightful and experienced, she enjoys responding to well thought out questions. Most of the criticism you will hear has to do with her teaching method. Sit for a couple of classes, do the readings, see if you like her sense of humor, and make your decision.",
    "Decide on a topic early on and make the topic fill any gaps you see in the curriculum. the instructor is very welcoming of additional topics or content to be covered."
