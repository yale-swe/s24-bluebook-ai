   "comments": [
    "The slides are useful, and the content of the course is not that difficult, but the actual lecture is very poor. The textbook is not very good, and several assigned homework questions are unclear.",
    "Good!",
    "It's an okay course, but like almost every biostats course at YSPH, you don't learn much from it unless you teach yourself. The homework assignments aren't bad, but there needs to be an explanation of how to put tables into SAS accurately. That is a big piece of the homework assignments and if you don't get that correct, everything else will be wrong.",
    "The final class where everything was pulled together was good. However throughout the course it sometimes was difficult to put concepts into perspective.",
    "if the professor can teach more systemically and clearly, it would be better",
    "Very good as a categorical analysis class. Learnt a lot! Love it!",
    "Strengths:-Very clear and thorough course material-Nicely organized course structure, applying theoretical material and building on previous lectures-Homework problems related directly to material taught in class-I actually liked the final project. I think it was a nice way to get closure on the course and apply everything I had learned.Weaknesses\/Suggestions:-I rented the required text \"Categorical Data using SAS\" but did not need to open it once. Would not recommend this text to others and definitely not needed for the course.-I found the labs redundant with the lectures and stopped attending after the first week. I would rather have had the professor provide the SAS code related to the lectures and just have the labs be tutorial sessions.",
    "The lectures were well-planned and coherent, but went into much more detail than was necessary to complete the homework assignments. More examples in the lectures would have been helpful.",
    "Helpful course with adequate workload.",
    "good",
    "I learned everything by doing the homework. I could have taught myself the material. In some ways, the course was a waste of time, due to the instruction and structure. The material is important.",
    "Very informative.",
    "honestly, this is a relatively easy class. the explanation for the theory is clear but I think the instructor can teach more in the semester.",
    "Hope there will be more theories. Don't be just simple application.",
    "I think the information was presented in fairly confusing manner, and the language barrier with the professors and the TAs made it a little difficult to really ask questions that required further clarification.",
    "well structured, made sense, very fair amount of homework with helpful class notes and TA notes to work through the problems. Also really liked that the book had answers for odd number homework problems.",
    "This is a good introductory course to categorical data analysis. The course was very well structured and followed the text book. There were no surprises. Clear material and well covered.",
    "Quite useful and need more application to real data during lectures",
    "This was a great course. The homework assignments were very useful for understanding what was being taught in class. The final project was a little long and it would have been good to get a bit more direction. We could have practiced writing the kind of paper that was expected for the final project in homework assignments.",
    "It was useful and practical. It would be better if it was more informative or more in depth. The contents of the course was somehow overlapping with Biostatistics 2 and Applied Analytic Methods in Epidemiology.",
    "helpful, but would be even better if there are more practice on theories",
    "I thought the slides and homework were all helpful in learning the material. The final project however could be improved. It seemed like we were being tested on data cleaning more than what was actually taught in class, by spending hours recoding and figuring out variables, as well as researching an unfamiliar topic. Although this is what real data analysis is like, it was frustrating to have a final project that was so time intensive simply setting up the data set then actually analyzing it as we had learned in class.",
    "COURSE SHOULD BE A MUST-TAKE COURSE. I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS COURSE.",
    "I don't think this class covers as much as other \"6\" level classes.",
    "This class is very useful. But I hope the instructor can be more engaging.",
    "The primary textbook did not go into detail for many concepts. Supplemental readings would be helpful.",
    "Strenght: excellent power point slides",
    "The course was on interesting material except the instructor was very hard to understand",
    "The course provided the opportunity to learn Categorical Data Analysis with no help from the instructor. Dr. Wang was unable to explain simple concepts in a way that students could understand or appreciate anything. The book was far superior to her methods and eventually served as the only resource for learning the material.",
    "This is a good course whose strengths are its specific contents and evaluation methodology. One weakness is the instructor's lecture delivery style."

Also very difficult to understand the teacher at times. YSPH needs to hire professors on their ability to teach as well as to research.",

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Weaknesses- Read off the slides- was not considerate of students with non biostatics background and concentration- assigned final project with writing component that was not covered in class",

    "Instructor: Jiehuan Sun \u00a0I did not have the opportunity to interact with the TAs much throughout the semester because I stopped attending the lab sessions, finding them redundant with the lectures. I was disappointed that they did not comment on why specific homework answers were wrong (instead of just writing \"-1\" or \"not right\") When I asked them directly about this, they deferred me to the professor, who then sent me back to the TAs. A homework answer key for each assignment would have been really helpful in figuring out what I could have done differently.",
