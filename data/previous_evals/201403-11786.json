   "comments": [
    "If you love theory (like I do) this will be the most wonderful class you ever take. If you do not love theory or haven't studied it in depth before, be prepared to work your butt off.",
    "In this class, you will not talk directly about feminist issues per se, but rather about how we talk about them. There's a very wide variety of dense material, and it's impossible to fully understand\/unpack all of the readings assigned in a given week. Nonetheless, it can be a valuable experience if you want it to be and if you think of it as sort of an introduction to feminist\/queer theory. Ultimately, you get exposure to a wide variety of theories and thinkers, and that has a great deal of value in and of itself.",
    "It is an incredibly important course. Take it.",
    "This class covers a ton of movements and readings, starting from the middle ages and going all the way to modern day queer theory and 3rd wave feminism. It's a lot of reading, but Moira realizes that we couldn't get to it all. It's a crazy mix of people from different departments, so there are a lot of different backgrounds (it's not just WGSS people!) and perspectives, which made it an excellent seminara and discussion. Definitely take it, but it's a fair bit of work!",
    "This course covers many topics in feminist and queer thought, including Marxism, anarchism, psychoanalysis, \"third world\" feminism, black feminism, motherhood, and queer and transgender theory. I would definitely recommend it; there is so much to cover!! You read all sorts of amazing works. Not all of them are contemporary, either. This class builds a real sense of the history of feminist thought, which was my favorite part.",
    "The syllabus was great and the other students were motivated to dive deep into the material. however, this class in particular was very disorganized and I often left the seminar feeling frustrated. I would recommend it for sure, but honestly, not with Moira.",
    "I can't overstate the importance of what you'll learn in this class. Moira Fradinger is devoted, brilliant, extremely knowledgeable. Take this--I beg you!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is a really exciting and necessary introduction to feminist and queer theory that will give you a good historical understanding of various methodologies and ways of thought. Importantly, there is a huge focus on intersectionality; this is not just a class about affluent white women in the 1970s. Marxism, psychoanalysis, subaltern studies, and postcolonial theory all come into play here. Obviously, this is a huge amount of material to cover in one semester, so it's best to treat it as a sampling of things to be returned to later in more depth. If you have had little experience reading large amounts of theory you might want to do some background reading before the class starts.",
    "I think that *every* college student should take a course like this. The ideas are so critical and so underrepresented in the academy as a whole. Even if you think yourself a very socially engaged persona sociologist, anthropologist, queer theorist, critical race scholar, etc.reviewing these texts or reading them for the first time with Moira will blow open your mind in the best way possible. Especially speaking from a man's perspective, this course demonstrated with biting clarity how feminist is not merely a discipline of study, but rather a way of adjusting for and throwing into crisis the systemic patriarchal biases that pervade all spheres of lifesocial theory, history, politics, economics, *the hard sciences*, professional life, love, friendship, family life, charity, social justice, etc. etc. Some say that not understanding a feminist perspective is missing half of human historyI'd push this even further. Failing to look through a feminist lens distorts and obscures the complexities of *all* history, regardless of your academic background, political persuasion, or intended life path.",
    "There are two ways to evaluate Feminist & Queer Theory (FQT): the actual course content and the professor. The course itself is reading dense feminist and queer theory texts, from older ones like A Room of Ones Own and Freud to modern writers like Judith Butler. As a WGSS major, some of the texts were difficult but manageable. I imagine this course would be very difficult or overwhelming, however, for someone not familiar with these texts or types of writing. As for the professor, FQT in 2014 was taught by Prof. Moira Fradinger, who likely won't be teaching it again. If you're reading this review because you're shopping another one of Moira's class; be warned, you will either love her or hate her. She is highly opinionated, expects students to attend a dozen hours of out-of-class dinners, events, or film screenings with her, and is often not clear about deadlines or assignments. Some of the literature majors in the class really enjoyed her method of close reading and high intensity, but others of us found it frustrating. Overall, the class highly depends on the professor, so shop it, read the syllabus and see what you think on the first day of class."
