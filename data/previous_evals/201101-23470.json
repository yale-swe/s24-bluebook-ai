    "I think this is a great addition to the EMD curriculum and I learned a lot! I only have two criticisms: 1) I would be interested to learn more about the PH (not necessarily immunological) issues with vaccine distribution - what are some reasons why uptake rates are low, logistical issues in other countries, etc? 2) I think it would be good to have one vaccines intro class (these are the types of vaccines, this is the vaccine schedule in the US, etc). I felt like I should have known these things before people came to talk about the various vaccines, not after.",
    "The class largely relied on guest speakers to present vaccine information related to their topic of expertise. Each speaker presented on a different topic, allowing students to be exposed to many topics. However, the class may be better organized if there was one lecture which provided general background information (i.e. parasites, bacterial, viral, etc.) before having speakers present their topic related to that area. The presentations were very scattered and did not have any common ground.",
    "I thought the course was one of the best I have had so far at the Yale School of Public Health. It is an interesting course with much opportunity for discussion between students. The professor used current and relevant areas of vaccine research to teach the course.",
    "Great class.",
    "I don't know that the assignments were the best. I like the journal reviews but the format inclined students to slack on each one. Perhaps more of a backbone on vaccines would be helpful. delivery systems etc should be assessed earlier in the class. Same with modelling.",
    "It would be nice to include more practical applications rather than just immunological functions.",
    "Excellent introduction to diverse and novel vaccine development approaches.",
    "Overall the course was good- I learned about various diseases and the difficulty with making vaccines for the diseases.",
    "Enjoyed the guest lecturers and the breadth of topics covered.",
    "The greatest strength is the relevance of most of the topics. I felt I had a very good understanding of where the vaccine field was at immediately at that time. For example some presentations\/seminars I attended later (Peter Kim from Merck) presented the same data from a paper we had critiqued in class.The only major weakness was that some weeks, the amount of reading was a bit too heavy (8 papers for a week). A clear detailed review or comments on the most helpful articles would have been nice (some lecturers did this, but some did not)."

    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0She was great and extremely helpful!",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Professor McMahon-Pratt provided very good lectures when she presented. However, as previously mentioned, guest lecturers many presented throughout the course with students presenting discussion articles as well.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Professor McMahon-Pratt is one of the kindest professors I have ever had as a student. She is considerate and respectful toward all students. She may be one of the smartest professors I have ever met, but she remains so humble and approachable. I wish she taught more courses at the school.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Diane is great, she will read everything you turn in and give you lots of valuable feedback.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0DIane was very understanding and kind. I wish she taught more lectures",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Diane was a wonderful instructor and did a fantastic job responding to student interests, needs and questions.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Diane was a good instructor- she broke down material well and engaged us in discussion whenever she lectured.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Very good instructor, gave lots of constructive feedback on our papers and assignments",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Wonderful teacher. Always helped in stimulating questions at the end of a long lecture. Also I was very impressed with the organization of the course and the logical trajectory of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it - if you are interested in vaccines, you will definitely learn a lot, especially about some of the cutting edge scientific research that is going on!",
    "The vaccines course introduces students to the many vaccines that are currently in the market as well as those in the process of development and refinement. If the course was better organized according to students' current level of understanding related to vaccines (which may be minimal for many), I would recommend it to other students.",
    "The course is relevant for those pursuing a career in immunology or vaccinology. The instructor brings in many important guest speakers to discuss their current vaccine approaches and methods. It is an excellent, excellent course in the public health school. I would highly recommend it for another student, regardless of their background, because it a well-taught course with much opportunity for discussion with peers and the instructor, Professor McMahon-Pratt.",
    "Awesome class. The class is focused on basic vaccine research, but for anyone interested in that I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it though suggest a very strong biology background",
    "Vaccines is a course that provides one with basic information of various infectious diseases and the challenges associated with creating those vaccines.",
    "Relatively in depth look into various vaccines for a broad range of diseases and conditions",
    "A very current overview of vaccine biology and approaches to new vaccine innovation. The majority of the readings and publications will be from within the last 2-3 years. Additionally, the rotation of lecturers are very well planned out and organized. Best class I have taken as a PhD student yet."
