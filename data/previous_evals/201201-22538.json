    "I mean, you have to do it. It's worth it for the BS. But, it's kind of dumb that we have to do a paper, a poster, and a presentation. You'll be doing research anyways, so, whatever.",
    "Same as 485. Start early on your final paper, as you'll likely go through several drafts. Same with the poster. Enjoy!",
    "Senior research for credit, it fulfills the 2nd half of the senior research requirement for the BS in biology. Requirements: poster session and presentation in April about your senior research, and a 12-15pg paper about what you've done in lab all year. You have to take it if you're a bio major, so...yeah. If you're going to be in lab a lot, I'd recommend doing the intensive BS (MCDB495) and not this one, because it's not that much more work.",
    "You'll take this if you need to conduct research for the major. The value of the course is all determined by your PI and mentor.",
    "It is the one credit each semester research that will get you a BS in biology. Just find a good PI--start looking in the spring of junior year if you don't already have one. Otherwise it is just a paper each semester, a presentation one semester (random), and a poster. There is no communication with the professors in charge.",
    "I would totally recommend it. Since it is year long, you get to make more progress in research.",
    "This is a research course. Your experience really depends on your PI, so chose wisely. Don't just look for a subject you find interesting, but a specific project that peaks your interest and a lab that's going to be welcoming and actually teach you. An accessible PI is also important. Be aware that you will likely work much more than 10 hours in the lab a week (I averaged 12-16), that is just the nature of science. Though time-consuming, time spent in lab doesn't need to be very stressful, so learn to enjoy it. The requirements for the course beyond lab time are minimal - make a presentation, poster, and paper at the end of the each semester. Plan a little ahead, but it's nothing to worry about.",
    "Not much to say. If you're taking it, you probably need it. Take this over MCDB 475 but consider carefully if you're thinking about 495.",
    "If you are a bio major who wants a BS you're gonna take it. If you are just doing research anyway, I think you could take it. There are binges of work, with the second half of second semester bearing the grunt of it, especially if you are doing your presentation then. If you work on your research paper bit by bit throughout the year, such as adding experiments you do and results you get when do get the data, it would save time. Not too bad of a course at all. I recommend it.",
    "We had to jump through quite a lot of hoops for two credits... But I loved my research so it was nice to get to do it.",
    "Definitely if you need to complete your senior requirements and the thesis",
    "You likely already know if you're taking this or not. It's 10-12 hours per week of research for one year. Presentations are required but not too bad.",
    "Research is a great thing. Getting a BS is way better anyways.",
    "Choose your PI well - ask around."
