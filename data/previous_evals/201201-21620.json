    "Solid way to get credit for research or to graduate from the physics major (important). The most vital part of the course is finding an adviser you feel comfortable talking with and working with and a project that you are genuinely interested in.The class is what you make of it as it's fairly independent. If you can, I would recommend taking a light courseload and focusing a lot of effort on your research as it can be time-consuming and will be way more rewarding if you put more time into it.",
    "If you can find a good adviser and a project that interests you, go for it. You will learn a lot in a format that's refreshingly different from your usual classes. You may also get the opportunity to continue your research over the summer.",
    "It's research for credit: what's not to like? I took it as a sophomore this year, and it was well worth it. If you're considering graduate school, try some research as soon as you can. It won't take long to figure out if being a research scientist is the career for you.",
    "You do independent research.",
    "I took Physics 472 as a second-semester junior, and I'm very glad I did. While it technically fulfilled my senior project requirement for the major, it also gave my valuable research experience - something you simply can't get in a lecture course. I may even take it again as a senior, just to be able to conduct more research. The post-research workload is not heavy. After your research, you write a short paper on the research and give a short presentation to accompany it. A pretty cool course.",
    "Even filling out an evaluation for this is kind of silly. Barrett's pretty chill if rather disorganized. Don't expect updates or feedback from him - but word on the street is if you show up for your presentation and turn in a report, you basically get an A.",
    "It is what you make of it.",
    "Pretty fun and interesting. Make sure you get a good advisor and a good project, though. And pick something practical - too many students try to do the coolest project they can find, instead of the one they'll get the most out of.",
    "Doing research for credit is a whole lot of fun!",
    "You get out of it what you put into it. Very free-form, Very self-directed. Be sure to get a good adviser that will stay involved with you throughout the semester as you do your research. It's very easy to get stalled and delay work (especially when the rest of your schedule gets very busy), which will then produce great anxiety at the end of the semester when you realize you barely have anything to show.",
    "A great way to get exposure to research if you're not a senior; if you're a senior, it's required, and that's that. Do your work throughout the semester, it'll make it all much better.",
    "It's the Physics Senior Project. The experience is largely lab dependent, so make sure you work with someone good on a project you'll enjoy!",
    "Great course---everyone in the physics major should start research as soon as possible.",
    "If you've got an independent research project in mind, this class is a great framework in which to conduct that project. Extra gold stars if that project happens to be with Steve Keith Lamoreaux, since he's such a BAMF - the boss BAMF, as he is known colloquially.",
    "This class will depend on the lab you join. The assignments for the class itself are relatively unobtrusive.",
    "phys 472 is great if you find a good advisor. the class is what you make of it, but i would recommend putting in a consisten effort all semester long and START EARLY! if prof barrett is supervising it take it- he's really nice, helpful, and laid back. just have to submit a proposal, midterm report, and final report, along with giving a 10-15 min presentation. easy to do if you're actually trying in lab.",
    "Absolutely!! Hands-down, best course."
