    "This course carried a bellow average workload, and had two of the best professors I've encountered at Yale. Its an interesting change of pace from the usual Econ fare, and I enjoyed it.",
    "ECON 276 is a difficult course, full of theory and calculus, but it is taught by two of the best professors that Yale has to offer, and, if you stick with it, can lead to some amazing intuition. I recommend this enthusiastically to any student with a background in Game Theory and Economics, who is willing to put in the extra effort to make sure he understands what is going on in class, and who is interested in meeting some really interesting classmates from YLS and the other graduate schools.So, if you have the time and the work ethic, I emphatically advise you to take this class. Plus, Professor Brooks is one of the nicest and most interesting professors I have ever met. Shame you won't get to study with Professor Stemitzer as well, but he will be back in Austria.",
    "It is a good class if you are interested in learning about contract theory. Gives you a basic background on various contract designs and models how they might work."
