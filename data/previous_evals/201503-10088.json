    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max himself is a good guy, and meeting with him outside of class was helpful. However, he did not run the discussion sections very well, and I did not particularly find his feedback on papers helpful. I think to a great extent he was hampered by the poor quality of the readings and topics for this course.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is very effective. He does his job very well.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was always critical but without being unreasonable. He sought to challenge people in section to articulate their views more clearly, or to be aware of the implications\/presuppositions behind their claims. He respected the views of every student. Max will make a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0I appreciated strongly Max's insistence that assertions made in section must be backed up by the text, which helped to prevent much of the rampant emotivism that sometimes characterizes survey courses.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was an excellent TF. I admired his command of section and hope he gets an excellent teaching job when he graduates. My only concern was the Jesuit week. I was deeply grieved by class discussion that day. It was extremely one-sided. I offered a counterpoint in class, was promptly shut down, and felt as though I couldn't speak again because of the class's strong counter-opinion. This affected me personally in very deep ways.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0He was well informed and passionate about his work. However I thought he was not receptive to non-traditional criticisms of historical events (i.e. post-colonialism critiques and critiques of racial and cultural hostility).",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0- Max did a good job in collecting all students' opinions in his section. - Max inspired and facilitated students well in holding weekly discussions. - Max gave concrete comments in grading papers, highly helpful for further improvement.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was quite artful in running class discussions during section. His feedback on papers was helpful. He's gifted with an affable yet highly scholarly personality. And I think he will be an amazing professor! He already is.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max encouraged the students to participant in the discussion at session. Max's strength is that he was good at catching the main point out of one's opinion and led consistent flows at sessions.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was clearly engaged in discussion. He pushed students in their responses in a way that was kind and accommodating, but which also made it clear that he expected a certain degree of rigorous thought uncharacteristic of many sections at YDS. His comments on assignments were clear and thoughtful. Given the realities of a survey course such as this one, discussion was pretty good. Extra preparation on days discussing longer texts, as well as a greater effort to include quieter voices in the class, would perhaps have improved the already high-quality discussion. I found the expectations for the assignments--particularly the three response papers--to be more opaque than any other YDS class I have taken, though that may have to do more with the nature of the course than anything else.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is awesome. His superb breakdown of the material during our weekly section was invaluable to the learning experience. His enthusiasm for the subject matter really feeds energy into the students. Max is extremely attentive to the primary sources and taught us to always draw from it in support of our historical statements. I found his feedback of my written work to be incredibly thoughtful and constructive.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is very enthusiastic and engaging in section. It feels like he is genuinely listening to everyone and truly interested in what we have to say. He creates a very welcoming and positive environment. It seems that he really allows the conversation to flow where it wants to, rather than having a specific direction in which he would like it to go.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max demonstrates a huge amount of enthusiasm for the material and for teaching. He was always willing to consider new ideas and try out new approaches during sections. He provided thorough and helpful comments on my written work, was always available to answer questions, and provided articulate explanations about the assignments. He is a great teacher!",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0I so appreciated Max's academic and intellectual integrity in a course that was otherwise so frustrating. The questions and topics of discussion that Max prepared each week were the the highlights of the class. I loved that he held our discussions to such (reasonably!) high standards, requiring people to stay on point and present textual evidence, pointing out faults in logic, etc. (I wish that our discussions in lecture had been so precise.) I think some people may have found his bluntness a little bit startling, but I appreciated his honesty and straightforwardness. Perhaps if he continues teaching MDiv students he might consider employing just a touch more tact in how he addresses faults and weaknesses, if only because people will listen more readily and respond more easily. My one criticism is merely that Max's passionate commitment to the Chicago Manual of Style seemed, at times, a touch excessive.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin kept the sections moving, but it seemed the whole purpose of section was not to teach us but for her to hear each student say something. I did not learn anything in section, and found sections frankly to be a waste of time. The section leader did not add anything to the discussion and the knowledge level in my section was low. Why not raise the bar for first-year students so they are better prepared for seminar courses and that way engage 2nd and 3rd year students a bit more?",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin was very helpful and knowledgable. She made sure that assignment instructions were clear and understandable and was flexible in ways that helped us feel supported. Her method of \"cold-calling\" students, however, proved, ultimately I think, to be less than ideally effective at generating genuine, deep, and reflective conversation. I believe that if she more regularly reflected or mirrored what students say in a way that integrated the groups' ideas, rather than simply call on one student after the other, her effectiveness as a facilitator of discussion would grow to be even richer!",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Her feedback was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0She was wonderful in discussion sections. The way she facilitated discussion allowed for us to really look at the material in a deeper way. She allowed for us to talk but also made sure to include important information. I appreciate her willingness to meet outside of class and section and how easy it was to ask her about confusing material. She was very understanding and patient. It was also very great that we were not forced to talk in section if we were not comfortable and that we could send in questions.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0I think Nazanin is very approachable and gives great feedback on papers. While her sections were a bit chaotic (lots of people talking in a row before she brings the conversation back on topic), she always did ask helpful questions that made us engage with the assigned readings.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Great knowledge of the material, effective at encouraging discussion (especially by breaking students up into smaller groups to generate ideas), encouraging students to think historically.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin makes connections easily with students. Discussions are carried well during section. Small groups in the large size of the section helped to engage all students in section. Feedback on course work is encouraging and demonstrates an interest in and appreciation for the students' work.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0-Masterfully kept everyone in (a large) section talking and involved and focused -Graciously worked with a number of difficult people in section -Led a high level of discussion throughout section In general, led a great discussion--as strong of a section leader as I have had.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin was a great Teaching Fellow. She not only helped reinforce the material that we were covering in class, but she additionally expanded the perspectives that we brought to each chunk of material that we were studying. She led discussions well, helping all students engage. Furthermore, she offered valuable, critical, and helpful feedback on our written submissions. One of the best TFs I have had.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0She facilitated discussion very well. She gave extremely helpful comments on returned papers, and she set clear expectations. She helped us to engage the texts and course materials seriously.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin was a very strong TF, and I really appreciated my experience in her section. She was always encouraging us to speak up and provide our opinion, and I never felt that my thoughts would be discounted. Her comments on my papers were very, very helpful. She made herself available for discussion\/questions outside of class and section hours, and she was always very well prepared for section. I hope to have more TF's like her in the future!",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Very knowledgeable. Respectful of everyone's opinions. Enthusiastic. Really enjoyed her section.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0I appreciated Nazanin's written feedback on graded assignments, her cheerful attitude, and her availability. On the other hand, she did not have a strong grasp of all the material we covered. I assume that's an inevitability in a survey course covering 1700 years. It meant, however, that our sections were a waste of time. I got to know some other students as friends, but all of the discussion was simply first year students sharing what we had learned if we had done the reading. I would have liked more insight from the TA in sections - but maybe that's just not doable with such wide-reading material. And I did appreciate her grading and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Weaknesses: nothing really noteworthy Strengths: abiilty to pull out of students discussions around her questions and ability to feed off of students answers in order to keep the discussion flowing and to get to a thorough discussion of the topics. Feedback on papers: outstanding feedback on student papers. She took the time to provide detailed feedback that allowed each student to improve on how they were able to forward an argument and back it up with the assigned text\/material. Her detailed feedback was not only valuable for this class, but helped to approach writing in other classes in support of an argument. She is absolutely outstanding - my best by far TF of all that I had this semester.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin did a good job of managing some strong personalities in the room. As a general matter, I don't find sections very helpful to my learning, but as sections go, these were well-organized and well-run.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0I also speak for others on this, as my colleagues shared our section experiences. Nazanins sections were a delight, she has an engaging manner, insures that that each of us participate in discussion. Keeps it light and amusing, but stays on point. Her expertise in Medieval Spain was impressive, added a lot to discussions, this not to imply she was not in full command of all of the material discussed this term. You had better be prepared and ready to contribute in Nazanins section! I will miss her next term. Her commentary on my (3) response papers and long paper on Arianism was very detailed and added value to my understanding of how to construct an academic paper. Her comments reflected her deep knowledge of the subject matter, she offered ways to expand and improve my content. I do, however, reserve the right to personal style when it comes to commas! Thank you, N.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0I really liked Nazanin and her enthusiasm for the material was obvious. She was also very knowledgeable. She had a great way with students. I also thought her feedback on papers was useful and very thoughtful. Overall, very positive. In terms of suggestions, my only thought was that breaking up into small groups in section got a little old by the end. So maybe mix that up a bit more. But have to give a high rating.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin was very organized, facilitated group discussion very well, and was extremely thorough in her comments on my written work. I looked forward to section meetings with her.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0I like how attentive she was, it helped me personally to focus in class knowing that she did listen when i do speak. She was always there when needed and was the best TF for this class.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Ms. Sullivan had very structured questions for discussion each week and truly encouraged all students to speak. It may have been helpful at times to move away from the pointed questions into more open discussion. Ms. Sullivan offered extensive feedback on students' writing, clearly reading assignments with care and wanting to push students further in their performance in the course. She was passionate about the subject and offered one of the most interesting lectures of the term.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Excellent in making the material come to life.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Best teaching fellow this semester for me! Her enthusiasm, knowledge, and hard work ethic is infectious. I love the way she gets everyone involved in the discussion and her detailed feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin is extremely well organized and enthusiastic about the material. She is an asset to the class.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0Nazanin was an excellent TF. She was engaged, extremely well-prepared, and able to think quickly on her feet. Her comments on my papers were extensive and extremely helpful. She was able to easily manage a discussion section of 20 students, all of whom had very strong opinions about everything. She also, more than any professor or TF I've had, showed a clear love of the material and a passion for helping others' learning processes.",
    "Instructor: Nazanin Yvonne Sullivan \u00a0- We had a very large discussion section, but Nazanin did a good job of making sure that everyone got to participate and of asking good guiding questions to steer the discussion. - Nazanin provided thorough and helpful critical feedback on written assignments."
