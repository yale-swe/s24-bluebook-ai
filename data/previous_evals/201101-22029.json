    "A great way to get you mind smashed weekly in the morning. Fun games that help you conceptualize and track music as you listen to it, develops good listening skills.",
    "Early in the morning, but pretty fun class, basically no work.",
    "Take it. Class was consistently fun. The keyboard labs especially are very challenging and will take some practice to prepare, but the whole class will make you a better musician. Chris is a great instructor.",
    "This class is significantly harder than MUSI 218. The class will probably be small - probably five students or less. The instructor makes all the difference. Everyone who has taken MUSI 218 or 219 with Sarita has said they liked her and she is so nice and approachable. I beg to differ. I took both 218 and 219 with graduate instructors, who were less intimidating and more approachable in my opinion. I do feel like my musicianship skills (my ability to hear and analyze music) improved tremendously from these two courses. However, my mistake was not to have taken or be taking concurrently a music theory class - 205 or 210 - so I suffered a little bit due to my limited background. However, this class is very very fun. It's great to listen to music and doing singing exercises in the morning. It's so different from any other kind of class offered at Yale. This class is challenging, but fun and engaging. Some students will probably have perfect pitch (I do not), but most instructors are accommodating for non-perfect-pitch people (like me) and will grade you more for your effort and improvement. Keyboard lab is very fun, too, especially if your teacher brings in musical scores and such for you to read (instead of just playing purple book Continuo exercises all day). I'd definitely recommend this class, though it's good to have more of a theory foundation before taking it. Also, there's rarely homework, except to practice for the keyboard labs and the occasional weekend assignment."
