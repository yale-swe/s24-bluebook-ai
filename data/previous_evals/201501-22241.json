    "A lesson on the theory and practice on Islamic law and its influence on societies. Also a lesson on discussion and historical writing.",
    "HIST 031 is the course you have been looking for to understand the basic issues underlying political Islam today. It will challenge your assumptions, broaden your historical context, and generate some great discussions.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I learned more about writing than I have in years and I've decided to be a history major! But it's great for people with a wide variety of interests.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to many issues that are of vital importance to our world today. It is a good balance between relaxed discussions and presentation of new information. We learned about the theoretical underpinnings of Sharia law, different political Islam movements of the twentieth century, and attempts at Islamic states--information that is crucial to understand, whether you are interested in political Islam for your career plans, or just out of curiosity.",
    "This is a class that definitely takes into account the history behind Islam. It is primary source heavy but in many cases that gives insight to how the Muslim religion can be interpreted. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",

    "Take the class! Prof. Stephens is great and cares about her students and the subject, which is really clear in class and discussion. Gives a great background into a side of Islam that many might not know about and is a great way to contextualize current events in the Middle East while getting an idea of what college history requires."
