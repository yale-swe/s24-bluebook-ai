   "comments": [
    "EEB 680 gives a comprehensive overview of life history, life history evolution, and the history of how we think about life history. The class teaches about a topic that reaches nearly every aspect of the biological sciences in addition to teaching practical skills like group work, synthesis, and original research. I would certainly recommend this class to other students, if for no other reason than it gave me an entirely new perspective on my critical and scientific thinking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, it is extremely valuable for anyone in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology as well as many others.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a great course if someone is interested in life history or relevant topics. Some basic knowledge about evolution will be really helpful. The course is based on reading and discussion so it is really important to be prepared before class. I will recommend this course to other students in EEB major or interested in evolution.",
    "I would recommend E&EB 680 to any grad student in ecology and evolutionary biology as well as advanced undergrads who are interested in pursuing further academic studies. The subject matter is useful across many disciplines of EEB."

   "comments": [
    "This class provided me with an important aspect of my discipline which is often nearly impossible to piece together without the expertise of a scientist like Prof Stearns. The history of life history evolutionary studies is important to know because assumptions build on previous assumptions and knowing limitations of our knowledge is important and challenging. In that regard, this class gave me a priceless understanding of the literature that would have taken me years to grasp on my own. This class is directly related to many aspects of my dissertation research.",
    "I feel that I have taken a crash course in many fields relevant to my department and found it to apply to my research as well as my other classes directly.",
    "After taking the course I gained a better understanding on a lot of basic but essential questions in evolution. Because part of my research is related to life history so taking the course will give me more perspectives to look at my own research.",
    "Taking this course led to greater understanding of the important role that life history evolution plays in the evolution and ecology of any biological entity. I have become more comfortable with theory, and will be able to better translate theoretical and empirical data from other disciplines and fields into my specialty."
