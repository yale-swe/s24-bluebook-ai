    "You learn how institutional investing works especially for an endowment- concepts include asset allocation (Swensen's most valued choice in investing), asset types, and manager selection. 5 different managers also guest speak at the class and you write papers on them. Most people in the class had a background in finance. It is useful but not definitely needed. If you know who Dean and David are you will probably want to take this class (if you are interested in finance), but besides that poingit is very interesting (though the long class does get long). As long as you can make it through the boring stretches, take it because you learn a lot about something you probably won't hear about much unless you work for an institutional investor before\/after. Dean\/David are really awesome and obviously really smart.",
    "Would really recommend taking this course if you can get in.",
    "Yes, recommended in the highest possible terms.",
    "If you get in, you have to take this class. While it didn't necessarily feel like it at the time, looking back on the semester, I realized how much I learned about the industry. Guest speakers are FANTASTIC and class is worth taking for the speakers alone",
    "I would definitely take this class if you have any interest in finance.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have the opportunity. The guest speakers are the most accomplished and brilliant investors. You will learn so much about investing.",
    "More work than one would think but the most rewarding economics class offered here.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Decent, but not ridiculous, amount of work. Takahashi is awesome. Swensen is a genius although definitely more intense. You will have an opportunity to meet guest speakers who you might not meet in an entire CAREER of institutional investing - literally rock stars in the field.That said, don't be fooled: this is not a class on how to make good investments. This is a class on how to allocate institutional funds and find people to make good investments for you. You're not coming out of here learning how to pick stocks, though you might have a slightly better idea about it in the end. The class should really be called \"Endowment Investing\" or \"Asset Allocation.\"",
    "Yeah - its useful, the dean and david are good, but if you don't get in I wouldnt stress. You can learn a lot of the same lessons by just buying Swensen's book and reading it. There are other good econ seminars out there too.",
    "One of the top classes at Yale (and toughest to get into). All the other students in the class were really impressive. The people that the professors bring in are incredible and famous in the finance world. A true example of learning from the best of the best.",
    "Definitely a good economics class to take if you are interested in asset management. Gives students a great perspective on investing and the pros and cons of the different asset classes. The speakers brought in are also masters in their own fields and able to share meaningful insights on their market.",
    "This class is good, but it is certainly not as great as past reviews made it out to be. Some of the guest lectures were fascinating and gave great insights into the type of work you would be doing if you worked at a hedge fund or private equity firm. After taking this course, I definitely realized that I do not want to work for a hedge fund, which is a valuable discovery. But don't expect to be blown away by this course. A lot of the material and the assignments are extremely repetitive. However, I did learn some valuable information.I certainly wouldn't give a rave review of this class, but I would give it a positive review.",
    "Probably the best course I have taken at Yale because it teaches in a way that a textbook cannot. The guest speakers alone provide students with an incredible learning opportunity. Both professors were really great too and made coming to class an enjoyable experience. I would definitly recommend this course to anyone able to get in.",
    "Best class at Yale. Take it if you can - put some thought into your application.",
    "Take it! That is if you get in of course, but it was a great econ seminar. Dean and Dave are fantastic, and the guest lecturers are amazing. Definitely recommended."
