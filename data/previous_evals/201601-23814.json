    "This course teaches you about the mechanics and thermodynamics of structures from the molecular scale all the way to the cellular scale. Much of the emphasis is placed on the cytoskeleton, and you learn a variety of concepts that can be extrapolated to related research. I would recommend this course to any and all BMEs.",
    "This is a very chill class where you can learn a lot of interesting and new things. I would recommend the class. The work is challenging but not stressful at all, it just requires deeper thinking about the content, not just copying from notes."
