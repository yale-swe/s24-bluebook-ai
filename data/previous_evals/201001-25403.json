    "The class experience was enjoyable, but don't take it if you want to learn about memory theory. The readings were often dense, and we didn't discuss them much in class. Most people used the class to work on \"pet projects\" that they already knew a lot about.",
    "A survey of how photography and culture are integrated from its initial uses to today. How the practice ties into identity, gender, documentation and cultural cohesiveness. This class is awesome if you are interested in photography and its power from more than just a snapshot perspective. Dense reading, but well worth it.",
    "This class is a good way to think about photography. It is a wonderful class with good discussion, if not quite coherent.",
    "AMST 449 is a great opportunity to think about photographs and read some important works on memory and photography. I would certainly recommend it to another student."
