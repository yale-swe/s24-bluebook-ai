    "Advanced Graphic Design with Henk and Julian is a delight. You get to spend a half semester working on each project, which is a nice amount of time to really dig into the design. Four hour critiques could sometimes feel quite long, but the opportunity to learn from the professors and other students was worth it.",
    "It's a fantastic course! They offer two Advanced Design classes--one in the fall and one in the spring. You spent the semester doing two projects with two different professors--in this case, Julian and Henk. Both Advanced Design classes are great, and you can't go wrong taking both, like I did.",
    "I learned a lot mostly because ART468 pushed me harder and further beyond my comfort zone than any of the other graphic design classes I've taken so far. Just be prepared to sit through hours and hours of talking."
