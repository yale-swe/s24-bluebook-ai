    "Math 120 is an intro math class, thus you can't really expect it to be perfect. Dan is a really solid instructor. Do the p-sets before the day they're due. Take good notes, as the examples we do in class are really helpful. Take advantage of the review sessions offered.",
    "MATH 120 is a straightforward college calculus class, I would say. If you placed into this course, you're probably either a math HL or calc BC kid - I would say it's relatively easier than HL (I don't know about BC), because the conceptual and problem solving requirements are definitely much less, even if you do cover a lot in the semester. As far as instructors go, you essentially just have to hope you pick a good one. Everyone usually tries to get Miki (the course head) because she always teaches and is always good. I lucked out and got an awesome, chill instructor, you may not. Solid class, not too rigorous, straightforward psests. Exams were fairly simple.",
    "I would only recommend the course to another student who has to take the course for their major, because even if you enjoy math, this class really isn't interesting and it's hard to understand where any of this will be applicable in real life. The course is just an in depth overview of multivariable calculus.",
    "It's an OK course - it's definitely hard, so I would recommend it to anyone willing to put in the work for it. If you're not willing to do the work, you won't do well. But, I did learn a lot and it did help me adapt to a college workload much more than some other classes may have.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty faced paced and rigorous multi class. You are probably taking it because you are a STEM person. I'd recommend leaving yourself plenty of time to do the psets especially towards the end of the semester. Watch out! Grading is harsh! Also really do try to get an intuitive understanding of where all the theorems come from. It will serve you better than memorizing formulas in the long run. Also try to connect it to physics if you are at all that way inclined. Thinking of things in terms of work and flux is helpful even if its not taught that way. I asume the ENAS class is more like that. If you take 120 and Dan is teaching a section he's great!",
    "The class is definitely more theoretical than anything I ever took in high school. It's a good intro to math at Yale, but if you're uncomfortable with the AP calc BC curriculum and still placed into math 120, take the lower level class that reviews the calc BC material.",
    "average multivariable class. very fast paced",
    "I would recommend the course because while it is challenging, if you put in the work you can do well. I would summarize it as a difficult but fairly rewarding intro class.",
    "Take this course only if you are super into mindless calculations where if you get a small mistake towards the end your grade is halved. Dan is a good instructor, if I were to rate instructors from what I have observed, take Miki, Jose, Dan&Lake in that order. I needed it as a requirement for my major and I did not enjoy it. It is bland, lacking any of the math intrigue or trivia associated with yale fun classes. If you do end up taking the class, a little tip- start studying way in advance for the final, grades are not curved and only a 93% will get you an A. Exam 1 is always easy, exam 2 not so much, while the final feels like getting your eyeballs burnt in acid over and over again every time you look at that goddamn problem. But yeah, only take this if you absolutely must, and try to study in advance- lots of topics will not be studied thouroughly because you lose a month on freaking line equations.",
    "Very challenging but rewarding. Only take it if you think you can handle it. Daniel Corey is a good professor if you're going to take it.",
    "A great course for learning multivariable calculus. Difficult for those without a firm grasp of math. I would recommend for those who have a moderately strong mathematical background.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is very interesting, and not too challenging to comprehend. However, the tests are extremely comprehensive and tricky, which is what makes the course challenging.",
    "Great class. Take it even if you dont need it for your major!",
    "Great course! Definitely worth taking!",
    "Very fast, and difficult to take in Fall semester being a first time multi-variable student.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 120 to my peers. Even though it can be a bit intensive at times in terms of time commitment, it is especially rewarding in terms of the subject matter you cover in just one semester.",
    "It is a class that is necessary for many majors and provides a wide understanding of many concepts that are also applied to other subjects outside of math.",
    "I would recommend it. It was hard but I thought it was a good introductory math course and the concepts are interesting as you get into more complex calculus. I would say that its a pretty typical math course. The psets get a lot harder near the end of the year, but overall its manageable.",
    "It's a good course, but I have heard there are worse teachers than the one I had...I'd be weary of which section you go into. That can make or break the class."
