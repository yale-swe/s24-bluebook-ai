    "There are many strengths of this course. One of the first that comes to mind is the upbeat and productive class environment. Also, Seye and Doyin are very helpful with answering questions. They do a great job of teaching us material. If anything, I think one of the few weaknesses would be that sometimes the material moves a little fast, with some students falling behind."

    "This is a great class that is challenging but not impossible in the way some language classes are at Yale. Professor Oluseye is a kind man who takes his work seriously but also has a great sense of humor that I appreciated every morning. While participation is required, it is well paced and the classroom environment is wonderful; I was not scared to ask questions or answer the ones I knew."
