   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this course. Dr. Kanter reinvigorated my passion of art history through his lectures and his eagerness to hear our thoughts. The small class environment was wonderful because I felt that I got to participate frequently and engage very directly with Dr. Kanter. His emphasis on looking at the object and thinking critically about every theory posited by art historians encouraged me to continue to pursue art history with confidence.",
    "This has been probably the best course that I have taken throughout my studies at Yale. Dr. Kanter is a true mentor. The approach that he is taking in his teaching philosophy resonates with me as a student at an enormous rate!",
    "I learned about various artists and sculptural traditions in 15th century Italy. I learned about how to look closely at a sculpture or relief and how to recognize high-quality work. I also learned how to critically assess things within art historical scholarship.",
    "This course was fantastic!",
    "I believe this might be the best class I have ever taken or will ever take - unless Professor Kanter teaches another one. I learned an entirely new, and far more practical approach to art history, and one that agrees far more with my own perspective on the subject. I am very grateful to have learned not only precious information from an expert but a way to evaluate the validity of new information.",
    "We learned about the great Renaissance artists. But beyond that, we learned close looking, and how to analyze and break down an art history argument. Dr. Kanter always challenged us to question the literature that we read and to observe works of art from different perspectives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are the Professor and the ability to work intensely on one project. The weaknesses are the lack of a structured syllabus and the limited access to Renaissance sculpture.",
    "amazing class! loved learning from dr. kanter - he taught us all a completely new way to analyze art.",
    "It is a very free-flowing and flexible course, both in terms of the assignments and the time in-class. As an upperclassman, I really liked that and thought it was a strength. I also thought we received useful feedback.",
    "I only wish we had more classes - overall, I truly enjoyed every one.",
    "One of the strengths lies in Dr. Kanter's knowledge. He is extremely excited and knowledgable about Renaissance sculpture which really made the class special. Watching and giving the 30 minute presentations was also a nice aspect of the class because we got to learn from each other and practice public speaking."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in art history, or learning from a world renowned curator, this is a wonderful course.",
    "yes loved it! almost no work at all and very enjoyable. definitely take as an art history major credit.",
    "Absolutely! This would be a true miss if any person interested in the art history would not take this course during their studies!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! Because it is relatively unstructured, I think it would be most valuable to upperclassmen who already have some background in art history. The final project (paper + presentation) was fun and I learned a lot from my classmates' presentations.",
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "I would tell anyone who is seriously committed to the subject to take the class (and I'm only saying this because I found what I learned invaluable and, since it's a capped seminar, it would be unfair to take the spot of someone who will value the opportunity more).",
    "I'd recommend this class because it is a low workload, and you get to hear from an expert in his field. It is really enjoyable to be able to meet once a week in the morning and listen to Dr. Kanter tell stories of the great Renaissance sculptors."
