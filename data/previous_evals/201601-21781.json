   "comments": [
    "This is a good class if you want to improve your French reading\/writing\/speaking ability. It has decent but reasonable workload. Mme. Schneider is a good professor, just don't be intimidated by her.",
    "French 150 is a great class and a great way to improve your written and spoken French. You will learn a lot and enjoy reading the literature and watching the films. The teachers are really good and although there is a fair amount of work, it is not unmanageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wishes to perfect their speaking or essay writing skills in French.",
    "A high-level, discussion-based class devoted to refining a students spoken and written french. I would recommend the class to another student for the reasons listed above.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. There was an unnecessary amount of work required. Some days there was a writing assignment, a movie to take notes on, and grammar readings and exercises. Way too much work, and the professor or was strict and harsh on the students.",
    "I made the mistake of taking this as a fifth class, just to keep my French sharp. It is way too much work to be thought of that way and even if you take it credit D, you kind of have to do all that work. There is a lot of grammar, much of which is review from previous classes, but this time with all the nitpicky details. The texts are great, and your French will definitely improve, and if you enjoy French there is plenty to love here just don't come in expecting a walk in the park."
