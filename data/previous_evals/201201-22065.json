    "Typography II allows students the opportunity to apply some of the more nitty-gritty aspects of typography to design projects of a larger scale than attempted in Typography I (we made a type specimen poster, a book, and a minute-long video). The details remain important, but Henk gets you to think about broader issues that a designer must consider--the pacing and structure of a book, or the way music and typography interact in videos, for example. The focus is certainly on typography, but there is plenty of room to incorporate pictures and graphics into your work, and Henk considers all aspects of the design when critiquing the work. Especially in this class, the projects are as ambitious and creative as you make them to be!",
