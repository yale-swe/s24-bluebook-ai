   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to any grad student interested in empirical work, and in fact have.I would describe the course as a great culmination of the methods sequence, in that it forces you to reflect on the basic premises of causal inference as well as to apply advanced programming skills. Through the discussion with different outside speakers during class and dinner it also offers a very helpful initiation into academic life - from arriving at good research projects to the inner workings of other departments.I also thought that it was a great opportunity to get to know each other as a group.",
    "Without any reservation, yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in using or at least keeping up to date with some of the major developing research approaches in political science and to those who would like the opportunity to interact in a more in-depth manner with visiting professors compared to the usual workshop setting. This course was also quite helpful in putting together the various techniques presented in the preceding three methods courses.",
    "I would highly recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course to every graduate student who is about to start working on his or her prospectus.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly recommend."

   "comments": [
    "The course offered an opportunity to look behind the scenes of- the development of interesting research projects,- data collection, and- data analysis.In particular replicating papers and working with the code of the speakers was very helpful. Many of us have applied the programming tricks to our own work; and I imagine will keep thinking back to the lectures when designing our studies.Technical insights aside, the course was a great 'professionalization' exercise.",
    "This course helped clarify some of the major ongoing debates in political science methodology and appreciate the ways qualitative and quantitative research may be usefully integrated. Beyond this, having the chance to interact with some of the visiting professors in a more informal setting allowed me to get a fuller grasp on some of the important nuts and bolts of the research process, as well as trends and norms within the discipline.",
    "This course is very helpful for the dissertation process.",
    "Essential for anyone interested in conducting empirical research with a causal inference leaning."
