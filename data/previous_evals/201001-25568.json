    "A lot of work, but definitely puts you on the fast track for learning French",

    "Every element of french thrown at you in one semester...",
    "A very comprehensive introduction to the French language. I would recommend it to another student because you learn so much in such a short amount of time without even realizing it.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory course in French.",
    "It's really great and I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "If you took L1, you have to take 120 to get credit for your year of French; this course is essentially a continuation of the first semester, with a nearly identical format. If you're deciding between a few sections, know that Madame Skorupa is wonderful.",
    "if you want to learn french, this is the class to take",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it but only if it is with Mme Skorupa. It is a great way to begin learning French and set yourself up for learning French in the future. By the end of the class you will develop a small confidence for speaking French aloud, reading and writing."
