    "This course was great at providing a solid foundation for measure theoretic probability and giving a great survey at all the ways the measure-theoretic perspective helped provide solutions to aspects of probability that were hand-waved or skipped over in an intro probability class. We also saw very clever and interesting applications of probability to develop other fields and subfields."

    "This course was great at giving students a survey of measure theoretic probability. Although the course was fast paced, it was very enjoyable and helped provide students a solid foundation in probability.",

    "I would very much recommend this course to anybody who is remotely interested in probability. Although it is a challenging course, probability is a fascinating subject and Professor Pollard does a great job at explaining the concepts and showing us why he loves the subject so much. I not only solidified my probability knowledge, but also grew mathematically after taking this course.",
    "Yes, if only Prof. Pollard weren't retiring. I don't really know how to sing the praises of this class to people who will never take it, but: he has a book version of the course. If you are at all interested in measure theoretic probability (or, like, skeptical of probability as on unsound mathematical\/philosophical\/etc. footing) please read it. You won't regret it.",
    "Professor Pollard was an amazing teacher and gave so much effort to his students through humorous lectures, and amazing feedback on homework assignments. His presentation on this rigorous view of probability was truly inspiring!"
