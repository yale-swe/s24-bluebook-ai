   "comments": [
    "This second semester of organic chemistry is more fun because you've already learned most of the techniques. It is also less stressful, in that post labs and lab reports are not due for all labs. I recommend taking this lab because it is fun, interesting, and not as stressful as the first semester.",
    "I enjoyed this semester of lab much more than the first. You get to make some very pretty\/odorful compounds.",
    "I found this lab to not be as bad as people said it was. As long as you are careful and meticulous on lab reports it is not difficult to get a good grade.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. For a lab, though the labs are long and some of the work is tedious, the lab reports are well dispersed and it was a valuable experience.",
    "Take it if you have to. This course is tedious and long with assignments following every lab that take up a significant amount of time. The EPs that are to be done before lab are also very tedious. The experiments themselves are sometimes interesting and applicable but have really tedious procedures.",
    "127L is MUCH better than 126L - the reactions are more interesting, the products are more exciting, and the workload is smaller (by a little bit). My review for 126L suggested that 126L is a good reason not totake freshman orgo; I think I ought to retract that now. 127L beautifully complements second-semester freshman orgo (125), which you should absolutely take if you took the first-semester class. The last lab of the semester involves synthesizing aspirin. That's pretty darned cool.",
    "Chem lab as usual. Some labs are quick and short; others are rather long. You may be frustrated with low yields, impurities, and tedious EPs and Lab Reports, but you will at least get a sense of what organic chem is like.",
    "Chemistry 127L is a course intended to give a student an introduction to the methodologies of organic synthesis, and is absolutely essential to the study of organic chemistry. I would recommend having this course, especially to those with little previous training in lab techniques.",
    "It's what you'd expect for Orgo lab. Sometimes a lot work, most of the time not.",
    "Fun lab. Probably the most easy-going lab I'll take on Science Hill. It's still a ton of work though (honestly, watch out for those reports).",
    "Yes, you have to if you're taking Orgo. It's well organized and interesting, but prepare for lots of work.",
    "Orgo Lab part 2. This semester its a little more fun just because you've learned all the techniques and so you ultimately use the same sort of techniques for each lab to synthesize various things (you make aspirin as the last lab!). Having a good TA definitely makes the lab more enjoyable, though not necessary. My lab TA this semester was much more knowledgeable, and it made the labs have a greater importance outside of lab and link easily to the lectures.",
    "It is a good course that can be a lot of work at times. I would recommend this course for people who are taking and are comfortable with organic chemistry because I think that if you can handle the class, you can handle the lab.",
    "CHEM 127L is a wonderful lab course to take. While you'll probably have to take it anyway, it will never feel like a chore - assignments are brief but to the point, and experiments are interesting and something you'll want to talk about afterwards. Banana oil, anyone?",
    "A good introductory lab course that eases you into learning standard lab techniques and reporting protocols.",
    "Second semester is a bunch of synthetic procedures plus NMR. I think lab is a great class and it's interesting stuff once you learn the reaction mechanisms (which you will have in Freshman Orgo by second semester). DiMeglio is a very friendly professor, though not very involved since labs are run by TAs, who are great instructors themselves.",
    "This lab was rough but apparently not as bad as the gen chem lab. I learned lots of very useful techniques. The flip side is that I devoted every Saturday of second semester to working on lab reports, post-labs, pre-labs, and experimental plans. And my TA still destroyed me on all of them. You can get very lucky or very unlucky with your TA. Unfortunately the grading rubrics are nit-picky to the extreme, and you will lose a lot of really stupid points for things that don't really reflect on your skill as an organic chemist. Whatever. You have to take the class along with freshman orgo anyway. And you'll probably make friends out of your lab-mates.",
    "CHEM 127 is a good class. The workload can be heavy sometimes, especially when there are full lab reports due. The way lab reports should be written depends rather heavily on the TA. The labs don't match CHEM 125 closely at all, and some of the material cannot be understood without doing quite a bit of outside research.",
    "You have to take it if you take Freshman Orgo. But really, it's a good, straightforward class. Be anal when you prepare you EPs and reports. And get a good TA. Really the TA makes all the difference. Second semester is a lot easier to understand because you actually learn the reasons behind the reactions in class. First semester was hard because the labs would be about SN1 and we hadn't even covered mechanisms yet. This semester is a lot easier to understand.Professor DiMeglio is awesome!",
    "Yes. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Interesting. And not too work-intensive. Proofread your lab reports.",
    "Well, it's required for Freshman Orgo. But either way, it is very useful to have practical experience to ground and put in perspective the more theoretical work of the lecture.",
    "You have to take this class if you are a premed, chem, or mb and b major. You learn how to do fundamental chemistry lab techniques and you learn about some different types of synthesis. By the end of the second semester you can do fairly complicated syntheses.",
    "I'd recommend it for people who want to try better lab than Gen Chem.",
    "If you're going to take Freshman Orgo, then this lab is mandatory. The lab requires a lot of work outside of the lab, but I enjoyed the time spent in the lab.",
    "More in-depth than first semester lab, but also more rewarding. Good application of some of the reactions you learn in lecture. Labs take longer and reports are more detailed but not unmanageable. Well-taught class. Dr. D is awesome.",
    "The labs this semester are GREAT! The reports are very manageable as well. But a word to the wise: I was very unhappy with my TA right from the start, but I didn't do anything to change it because my lab day was most convenient for me. I really really wish I had tried something, because having a good TA is crucial. If you're in that situation, don't be afraid to talk to Professor DiMeglio, she's the bomb.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Orgo lab was unlike anything I've done before, but it really helped me understand orgo (the class) better.",
    "Although this course is a fairly tough class for 0.5 credit, this is a heavy workload.",
    "Yes! If you took first semester lab with Professor DiMeglio, you'll be plenty prepared for the second. The amount of work is just right for a half-credit class and the organization and assessment of the course remains fair.",
    "This lab course is required if you're taking freshman orgo, which I believe they're removing from the course roster, so you will have to take it anyway. But it's a pretty fun course, sans the possible overload of work for one night a week. Make sure to not procrastinate on the assignments, 'cause printers always seem to magically malfunction at the last minute. Professor DiMeglio is great, you'll love her.",
    "Thelab takes a little more time than its half credit value would make you think. Just stay on schedule with what's due, and keeping up on the theory concepts even when you don't have to is a good idea."
