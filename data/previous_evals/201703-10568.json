   "comments": [
    "Of all my classes this semester, I learned the most from this one. Partly because I came in with only a minimal understanding of the topic, but also because the course was taught well. I originally was expecting to learn applications for NMR spectroscopy, but ended up learning the theory behind NMR - including the physical events happening at each stage of an NMR pulsing sequence.",
    "product operator formalism, basic NMR methods: INEPT, phase cycling, gradient selection, NMR methods for protein dynamics",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the theoretical underpinning of solution NMR experiments.",
    "By taking this course I learned that NMR can have many more applications than I have previously thought to be the case. I learned the underlying theory behind NMR. One example is that I learned that NMR can be thought of in a quantum and a vector model. The quantum model is a lot more accurate while the vector model makes it easier to understand. I was able to learn how to read pulse sequences and understand what is occurring in the nuclei magnetization in the form of rotation operators and density matrices. Overall I learned how to understand the underlying theory of NMR especially in the case of larger moleceules, such as proteins.",
    "I gained valuable insight into NMR on a very detailed level"

   "comments": [
    "Understanding the course is difficult if you do not have a deep understanding of linear algebra.",
    "might need to slow the pace and make sure everyone is following",
    "The course is well organized and the lectures are good, however I wish there had been more ways to test my own understanding, e.g., practice problems or similar like suggested early on in the course. Especially considering the recommended textbook doesn't have anything like that, I found it hard throughout the course to know if the level of understanding of the material that I had was on par with what was expected.",
    "The course description could mention that it is a very math heavy interpretation of NMR which came as a surprise to me.",
    "Professor Loria was great, though I think being assigned practice problems through the semester would have been helpful."

    "Yes. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in protein NMR.",
    "this is a fairly specific course, I would suggest people assess their interest before they decide to take it",
    "I would recommend this course to others. Coming into the course with mostly a structural biology background, I did expect the course to be more practically\/experimentally focused and to be less based on theoretically understanding NMR experiments, pulse sequences, etc. however in hindsight I think the course was a good introduction to protein NMR experiments and gives me a good foundation to understand such experiments.",
    "I would recommend this course for anybody who is serious in pursuing NMR as a research tool.",
    "Yes"
