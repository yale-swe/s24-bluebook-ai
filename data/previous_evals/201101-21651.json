    "I would not recommend BRST 178 to another student, though I believe this was a course intended specifically for the spring 2011 Yale-in-London program anyway. There was little cohesion between the works that we studied, and Professor Campbell only occasionally brought deeper insight into what we ourselves had observed. There was a lot of reading aloud...which took up time that could have been used for discussion. Also, what was supposed to be three short papers and a few informal journal entries turned into one short paper, one long (10-12 page) paper, and maybe two informal journal entries due to organizational problems, which significantly changed the balance of the course in terms of grading.",
    "Yes. I loved it because it was a great interdisciplinary class that mixed literature with art.",
    "Yes, Jill's classes are the only ones in Yale in London where you're actually asked your opinion."
