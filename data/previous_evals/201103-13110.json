    "Only if you really are interested in learning the program, and already having some idea of a project would be interested in pursuing...",
    "Take this class if you'd like to be able to do geographic analysis in your field--neat projects this year included projecting best sites for wind power availability in Kenya, affordable housing according to census data, and the ideal route for high-speed rail. Learning the program is a little tedious at times, but Professor Tomlin is extremely helpful.",
    "YES! GIS was unlike any class I\u0092ve taken at Yale \u0096 and it was awesome. I was worried about taking the class because course evaluations in previous years mentioned that the software was overwhelmingly time consuming. This is just not true. As soon as you get stuck for more than a minute, shoot Professor Tomlin an email and he\u0092ll get back to you within an hour, if not right away. The trick is to not start your assignments the night before they\u0092re due, but if you can do that, the work is totally manageable. The time I spent working in the program was relaxing, creative and ultimately produced results that I\u0092m proud of. Ultimately, if you like maps, you\u0092ll love this class.",
    "A must take!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are willing to take on an independent project geared toward learning ArcGIS, a very helpful program.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who may be interested in learning the software. I thought Professor Tomlin was great, and I'm really pleased with my final project."
