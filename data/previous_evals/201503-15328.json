    "I was technically registered as an independent study, but this review is for Eric Toensmeier's course Multifunctional Carbon Sequestering Agroforestry, which is what I was taking. This course was in incredibly high demand this semester, as it is the only course on agricultural management at FES, which is a growing interest among students. The course was capped at 12 because of funding for the field trip component. However, because this is such a popular course that fills such a unique niche at FES, there should be more funding for more students to take this course and the associated field trip. This is a chance for FES to respond to student demand in a really straightforward way. There aren't very many practitioners teaching at FES, and the chance to learn from someone who is so active in his field outside of academia was really special. This is one of the most unique, applicable, and exciting courses at FES.",
