   "comments": [
    "A great and in-depth summary of history and literature in China.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend it to fellow history students, even people who don't exclusively study Chinese history.It is a course that truly deepens and broadens one's knowledge and understanding of modern China.",
    "It's a profound study of the Chinese modern history.I would definitely recommend this course to another student who has already learned the basic outlines of the Republic of China's history.Because it's not a class for beginners. If you know nothing about Chinese modern history and come to the class, you will feel confused and cannot catch up with the discussion.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. It is a great class to anyone who is interested in Chinese history or Chinese literature.",
    "As a non-historian, I found the course quite challenging, but it cued me in to essential perspectives and sources I hadn't been familiar with previously. Class discussion wasn't always as productive as I'd hoped - but overall a very helpful course."

    "As a student majoring in literature before, I lack the training in history discipline. Taking this course help me develop a sense of history and look into problems from different perspectives.",
    "This class gave me a lot of inspirations. It taught me how closely history and literature are related, and how to use them together.",
    "This course allowed me to become more familiar with historical perspectives that form an essential background for my contemporary research."
