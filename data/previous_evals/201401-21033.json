    "I didn't like it and the grading was terrible",
    "Overall, the lab was interesting and better than other labs I've taken at Yale. It was at times extremely tedious, but luckily students aren't graded on completion or results. There were no lab reports, which was great -- I could just come into lab and learn the procedures without any pressure. There is a lot of memorization, which is fair. But the midterm practical, at least for me, was very difficult. The final written exam was much better. I would recommend this course because it is much better than other labs at Yale, but be prepared to spend a good amount of time studying the material for the two exams. Email Dr. Klein early to get a spot.",
    "The midterm and final are very hard and you will have to study a lot for them. If you take it, be prepared to be frustrated by spending hours on lab procedures that you know you won't be able to successfully carry out. The upside is no lab reports.",
    "Best lab at Yale! But beware of grading. 50% midterm and 50% final, but if you study enough you should be fine for both.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in knowing how life begins. Which should be just about everybody.",
    "The course is great for introducing you to laboratory techniques and experiments involving the reproductive system of various animals. While the experience is invaluable, the grading for the class is terrible. Not only were there only two items (being a midterm and a final) that were used to evaluate us, but we weren't given much guidance as to what to study for the exams which made it difficult to properly prepare. The midterm is almost impossible because of this while the final is a little more bearable. I would suggest taking this class if you are interested in lab techniques for dealing with reproductive experiments, but only if you take it CDFail or if you don't mind the hit to your GPA.",
    "2 tests, each 50% of grade. Study for these tests!!",
    "Completely recommend.",
    "This class has less work than most labs due to the lack of lab handouts, however with only 2 exams worth 50% it could be more stressful. The averages for both were approximately 70% so the exams weren't trivial. The lab is interesting though and allows for a hands on approach to some practical procedures such as IVF and creating chimeras. On the flip side, you'll find yourself memorizing frog and fly embryonic development for the midterm which isn't the most interesting.",
    "A fabulous class, one that would be nothing with Mary Klein. She's so knowledgable and helpful. The lack of lab reports makes this a very relaxed class outside of the class period but do expect to show up and work hard. Since there are no lab reports, your entire grade is dependent on two midterms (a practical and a written). I love practicals so I did well on the first midterm and probably not too hot on the second (which was mostly memorizing the protocols). Each midterm requires a fair amount of studying so be prepared. Don't sweat being able to master the techniques since you're not being graded on them. This was hands down my favorite lab and now I know how to skin a rat in less than five seconds.",
    "Yes take it! Only grades is a midterm practical and written final - both were very fair. Take the notes, read the packets and make use of lab time and you will be fine. Only take if you are comfortable with dissections.",
    "This lab is a great accompaniment to MCDB 240. While the lecture covers human reproductive bio almost exclusively, this lab uses frogs and mice to look at reproductive systems. I found that my understanding of material from the lecture was greatly supplemented by this class, which - since there are no lab reports (yay!) - was a great opportunity to actually learn during the lab periods without being stressed out. That said, take it at your own risk - 50% midterm, 50% final.",
    "Very interesting lab and you learn a lot of new and useful techniques but the tests are very difficult.",
    "It is definitely worth a half credit, not like the other labs at Yale, but the two exams can be challenging, and scary if you mess up on one.",
    "By far the best lab I've taken at Yale - as long as you don't mind doing lots of dissections, definitely take it! Be sure to email Dr. Klein well in advance - try for several months before the spring semester, although I got away with only a month and a half before. Not only are the labs fascinating and fun, it's actually a half-credit of work, unlike most labs. The techniques you'll learn are really advanced and exciting. There's one lab session a week, for which you'll need to read a short lab handout to prepare. Then there's one midterm and one final, and that's it!",
    "MCDB241L is a fantastic lab course. You'll learn a lot, and the lack of lab reports means that you can simply enjoy the course. Study hard for the midterm and final, but I absolutely recommend this class to fulfill a lab requirement.",
    "This is a great class and you learn a lot. Unfortunately your grade is only based on 2 exams which are 50% each so it may not reflect the amount you have learned over the semester.",
    "A fantastic course. Take it as one of your labs for pre-med or bio major. Warning that if you do not want to dissect euthanized mice\/frogs, you will be unhappy in this lab. It's very rewarding, but the midterm is hard to study for. Both the midterm and final were reasonable, but on the hard side since you can't just \"practice\" looking at slides again right before the exam.",
    "Make sure that you study a lot for the midterm. It is a quick moving exam where you really have to understand details out of context.",
    "MCDB 241L is a lab course that takes you through the reproductive tract of common model organisms. It teaches you techniques like in vitro fertilization and embryo implantation. Ultimately, it is a must take course at Yale. You'll be hard pressed to do anything cooler in a class.",
    "Absolutely. Great lab, manageable workload, fascinating material.",
    "The lab is fun but the lecture is pretty poor so it is probably not worth it to take the lecture in order to take the lab. Interesting but gets pretty repetitive by the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend repro lab to another student. It is a great way to fill a bio lab requirement. It's not a ton of work, the procedures in lab are really cool, and the material is interesting.",
    "Great lab course- the labs are all very interesting and there are no lab reports. The practical is really hard but the final is OK",
    "Definitely take the course. You learn a lot about reproduction, obviously, but the takeaway is also a lot of patience and really good lab skills.",
    "Yes! Every week you will love to tell your friends and family all the cool things that you did!",
    "Lab supplement to Repro Bio... Good class with sometimes long, difficult procedures",
    "As far as biology labs go, you're not going to find one better than repro bio. No lab reports, no quizzes, and they don't focus too much on how accurately you're able to do the experiment (but rather, do you understand WHY we did each step). That being said, having the grade only depend on a practical midterm and a final was nerve-wracking. Study hard and don't wait to start studying until too late!",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in! Email Mary Klein now or in advance to see if you can get a spot!"
