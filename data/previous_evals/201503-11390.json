    "Everything about this class is pretty good except for the fact that students teach all the material. Only 5 ungraded problem sets (he looks at your work to see how you're doing; it probably factors into your grade somehow) and 2 well-curved exams. Projects: (1) presentation (teach a class or half a class for undergrads) and (2) final project (grad students: write grant proposal; undergrads: grant proposal OR write\/improve a wikipedia page)",
    "note that this year's class was different from previous years' instead of lecturing Newhouse had everyone in the class take turns to give presentations on particular topics in synthetic chemistry. so classes were very variable and rather disjoint, and you probably could\/would learn better and more in a conventional lecture. lots of reading every week but you can probably get by without doing most of it. overall you learn a lot about synthetic chemistry, but I think I'd have preferred a more traditional course. not sure what form it'll take next year though.",
    "This class is OK--take it if you are interested in synthetic chemistry. Its mostly a grad class and as an undergrad you will get a sense of grad school. Workload is easy and grading is very generous. Tim is great, except he doesn't teach the class--its just students presenting on different topics which can be tremendously boring and you won't learn anything. Hence it can feel like a waste of time but in the end you will definitely get a better sense of organic chemistry fundamentals (ORBITAL THEORY) and you will probably get a good grade, so not the worst thing in the world."
