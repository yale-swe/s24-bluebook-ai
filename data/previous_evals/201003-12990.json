    "This is a great class with the best French professor. This is for people who know a little French, but just kind of generally. However, Professor Skorupa helps everyone find their level and feel comfortable. I felt really good about speaking and writing in French after taking this class. You are forced to speak in French, but the atmosphere of the class is so relaxed and fun you want to speak! If you mispronounce something, Professor Skorupa is really nice and helpful about correcting you. Take this class with this professor if you are studying French!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking L2 French for someone who has been exposed to French in high school but is still not confident with speaking. Although I did not come out of the class fluent, the professors helped me learn the nuances of the language and prepared me for learning more complex French in the future.",
    "At first it might seem hard or difficult but after you familiarize yourself with the different ways of using the book, workbook, and videos, you become comfortable.",
    "Yes, definitely take French 121. This was a relaxed, yet informative course. You go through a lot of verb tenses, lots of grammar, and tons of useful phrases and vocab. Having said that, watching the French In Action videos was key. They are very good at teaching whatever you are going to be tested in every two weeks. The workbook that came with the videos was kind of a pain. I started skipping some exercises because it would've taken me more than 3 hours per night to do everything. It was fine though. Mme. Skorupa is a fantastic professor. She's very energetic and explains things very clearly, even if she's only speaking French.",
    "By watching the French in Action videos, completing workbook exercises, reading Francophone texts, writing weekly compositions, and participating daily in class discussions, students are immersed in the French language. These activities are sometimes time-intensive, but they definitely help to improve written and spoken French as well as comprehension of French. My command of the French language has increased immensely over the course of a semester, and I highly recommend it to any student interested in learning French.",
    "yes, this is a basic intermediate level french class, complete with video series, vocab lists, and chapter tests. it will improve your grasp of french.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I felt I made a lot of progress.",
    "An amazing way to learn French. Very fast pace course.",
    "This is a great advanced beginner class, that prepares well for the L3 classes."
