   "comments": [
    "I was not well prepared for this class as a Freshman without having taken AP Lit, but my writing greatly improved over the course of the semester. I am a premed, science major and this class was definitely worth it. I will probably end up getting an A- in the course.It's a must take!",
    "The readings in this course are really interesting if you like plays. Prof. Weber is very nice in person, but a pretty hard grader, and I didn't always feel like our class discussions were as productive as they could have been. The reading workload is very manageable, just make sure you keep up with the readings as you go along so you're not stuck with a bunch of plays to read right before the final. Prof. Weber also lets you make corrections on any of the three essays you turn in (not for the final essay, though), which is really helpful if you're a freshman like me adjusting to college writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they though they would really enjoy the readings and if they are prepared to read ALOT. It's fast-paced and you really have to be prepared for this class.",
    "I would fully recommend any student interested in learning about the origins and modern state of drama and tragedy to take this class. Although the workload may seem slightly foreboding in the due dates for papers, it is all quite manageable.",
    "English 129 is not an easy class. There is a lot of reading, four papers, and a final. If the works on the syllabus interest you, definitely take the class. During shopping period, shop different professors to find one whose style you work well with.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to improve their writing and aren't afraid of participating in class discussion. At first the grading may seem harsh, but we had the option to rewrite our first three essays before the end of the semester. Overall, this was a cool, useful course that I really enjoyed.",
    "English 129 is a survey course of the greatest hits of tragedy, from the ancient Greek to the modern eras. The pace of this course is quick-after getting through the Iliad in about a week or so, we covered a play every night-but it's definitely manageable. Be prepared to write a good, analytical essay every two weeks, and to participate fully in discussions. I would recommend this course if you are interested in literature and also do not mind writing a fair amount. Do not take it as an easy English course."
