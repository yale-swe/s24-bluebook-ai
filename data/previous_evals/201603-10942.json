    "I learned how to put texts from different cultures and even eras in conversation with one another.",
    "This course was an incredible experience. It was nothing like any of the other courses I've taken at Yale. Throughout the course, Dr. Sussman took us along a beautiful and twisting path speckled with fairy tales, history, psychology, philosophy and even a little computer science, making it a very well-rounded journey.",
    "I gained insight into the magical world of fairy tales and realized that we too currently live in a magical world.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the field of German fairy tales and the abstract thought needed to process and apply them to contemporary discourse, reflection, and philosophy",
    "This class taught me so much about the world of fairy tales, psychological backgrounds and much more."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - engaging class discussions, fun and creative assignments Weaknesses - very difficult readings that are a little too easy to not do (and still participate well \/ get good grades in the class)",
    "Strengths: topics, discussions, content, instructors, attitude toward the course Weaknesses: sometimes disorganized in manner of learning, sometimes unclear on what students were responsible for having read\/prepared for the class.",
    "Fascinating subject material, very involved teaching staff.",
    "This course needs to be better structured in order to cover all the topics in the syllabus. The material is very interesting. Also, it could be more engaging.",
    "The interdisciplinary nature of the course was both one of its greatest strengths and simultaneously one of its weaknesses. We covered so many different themes, ideas, and approaches to analyzing the selected stories, that it occasionally became a bit much. All in all, the readings and writing assignments were well-selected and deviating from the syllabus is not inherently problematic, but the course structure needs to be slightly reigned in.",
    "I don't think anything could be improved. It was such an enjoyable class, a rare gem at Yale, because we got to learn and approach different literatures from various angles.",
    "A delightful romp through the wonders and terrors of childhood and what this means about human thought, based on multiple sources and philosophies but mostly Grimm fairy tales and Freudian psychoanalysis. Suffers from an overambitious syllabus, with wildly eclectic passions. All the unexpected turns in the material were difficult to follow. But the class was always fun, partly because it was so unpredictable and hungry for everything. Everyone could explore their own passions in it. I was always learning something new about things I'd once taken for granted."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in the subject matter - I can imagine this would be a pretty boring class if one isn't interested in children's literal\/folklore\/child psychology.",
    "100% YES. Take this course - it will challenge you in ways you WANT to be challenged, and if you can follow the often tangled thoughts of Dr. Sussman, you will find nuggets of solid gold.",
    "Absolutely",
    "The course was extremely self-directed; you get out of it what you put into it. You could get by by not showing up to class once, but Sussman is fantastic and lectures are always entertaining. It was a very chill fifth class. The final project is a great opportunity to make time to do something you always wanted to do anyway.",
    "Without a doubt. You get out what you put in, and Prof Sussman is a gem.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in reading fairytales from Germany and from all around the world. The class has some interesting reading material, and if you stick around, you will find some interesting points of view.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's rare to have this much creative freedom in a class, and even though most of the class was not what I expected, I feel like I learned things I never expected to and never would have sought out on my own. It's also not an overwhelming workload at all, and you as the student decide how much you'll put into the class. The camaraderie among the students is great, and you'll have a really enjoyable time. Take it!",
    "Take this course! It's an interdisciplinary approach to studying not just German fairy tales, but stories and writings from all around the world. It blends literary analysis, psychology, art, technology, and aesthetics into one course. Professor Sussman is an unbelievably brilliant and passionate professor who genuinely cares about the students in his class.",
    "Definitely take this class, if you are interested in fairy tales and love to be creative.",
    "Contrary to the seemingly simple subject, the class involves a lot of heavily technical readings and is not for everyone. The professor kind of sprung whole schools of thought onto us and expected us to follow along immediately. But I still recommend this class to people interested in child development, the fairy tale\/speculative fiction genre, or the unconscious mind--or just someone who's curious about pretty much everything. It's definitely one of the most memorable and important classes I've taken, full of delightful surprises. I mean, when else will you use the words \"Rousseau\" and \"Legend of Zelda\" in the same sentence?"
