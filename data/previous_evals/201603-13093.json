    "I learned more about the quantitative dimensions of many fields.",
    "General statistical proficiency, particularly in the context of political science and regression analysis",
    "Comprehensive knowledge of basic statistics.",
    "Having taken a statistics course before, the first half of the course was work that I have done in the past. However, it was a comprehensive review of the work ahead. The second half of the course that dealt with political science gave me a better idea of how to look at multivariate regressions to see how different demographics play into polling.",
    "I learned the basics of statistics that will form the foundation of further classes.",
    "I had never taken statistics before in my life and I learned a lot in just one semester which is highly relevant to real life! I loved the course.",
    "General knowledge about statistics and how it applies to real life situations",
    "I learned how to analyze data.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was very expansive and well done. The teaching fellows need to be better at having available office hours and grading more fairly. The lecturer, Jonathan, was really good but spoke too fast at times. He had the video lecture which one could look at if we didn't understand something. He was fun and spontaneous to keep people listening to lecture.",
    "There was a fair amount of repetition in the transition from the first professor to the second, so eliminating that would be great. However, the class was overall very engaging and interesting.",
    "The material was taught very clearly, but there should be a standard textbook for the class as opposed to recommendations.",
    "I thought the first half of the course with Professor Reuning-Scherer was incredible, but the breakout session into the Political Science with Professor Yaver section was less than satisfactory. This course could certainly be improved by ensuring that the professors of the second half of the course are of the same caliber as Professor Reuning-Scherer. This class is managed well however by doing a comprehensive review in the beginning and specialization for the second half. Professor Reuning-Scherer did an incredible job of keeping his schedule open for office hours and ensuring that the TFs were available several times throughout the week.",
    "The online streaming for the lectures allowed me to learn at my own pace and review topics.",
    "The strength is that the first half of the course provides students the basic knowledge which is necessary for statistical analysis and the second half is fun and more relevant to the real world! The only weakness to the course was the probabilities section. It was hard and somewhat irrelevant. I would have either liked one more class period to focus on the subject to truly understand it or to have the subject taken off the syllabus completely. I just felt like we went over it so quickly that it just confused me instead of adding to my understanding of the study. The second half of the course which focused on political science was engaging and should not be changed in any way.",
    "The professor was quite fast and didn't bother to stop and take a break to help the students understand, however he was very engaging",
    "The weaknesses of this course were in the second half, once we broke off into sections. Not all lecturers are the same. My section felt more like a presentation than a lecture and it was very difficult to follow along and learn all of the material that I would later be tested on.",
    "In the first half of the course and the second half of the course, some of the material was repeated, which I thought was not necessary.",
    "Very good at teaching you what you need to know in a painless way. No excessive and wasted work.",
    "Strength is JRS because he makes stats approachable and fun. The way the first part of the class (JRS) is structured is excellent and puts students in the best position to succeed. The second part of the class is frustrating because the profs are so different and the class lectures were disorganized."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend as a good introduction to statistics.",
    "Yes, particularly if they're interested in political science and want to gain a general understanding of statistics",
    "Very organized, well-run basic stats class. If you don't fall behind on the material, clear up any confusion over the psets during office hours, and study a decent amount for the midterms, this is a more than doable class that will leave you with important knowledge of statistics that can be applied in almost any field. JDRS is probably the best lecturer I've had at Yale, as he makes otherwise boring material (he acknowledges and makes light of the fact that it is boring material) engaging with a great sense of humor and overflowing energy.",
    "I recommend this course to any humanities student looking for a QR. Professor Reuning-Scherer is an incredible lecturer, and he understands that many of his students are more interested in learning about analysis than crunching equations. As somebody who had a background in statistics but no calculus, I did not find the beginning part of the class too overwhelming. Just make sure you go to lecture because Professor Reuning-Scherer is hilarious and super helpful! I took the political science section of the course (since the course starts as a giant lecture of basic statistics that breaks into subsections). Unless you are doing it for your major, I would recommend taking the Social Science section instead because you get to keep Reuning-Scherer as your professor! The professor for the political science section is not nearly as good...",
    "Good intro to statistical analysis.",
    "It is a great introduction to statistics, even for a student averse to mathematics.",
    "I would recommend the political science track to anyone. It was fun.",
    "It is a common misconception that Intro Statistics is a course for people who find quantitative reasoning to be challenging. For anyone who finds math courses difficult, this class might be particularly challenging. The problem sets during the first half of the course, usually required the assistance of a TA. The problem sets in the second half of the course were even harder and often times required collaboration with other classmates.",
    "Take it because it's a pre-req if you want to learn statistics, look somewhere other than the 150-person intro lecture. It's very easy to feel lost in this class, and even though its format (breaking into more specific classes eight weeks in) ultimately helps, this is a fairly self-directed class that prioritizes theory over application of concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning statistics and a real world application of statistics.",
    "Yes it gives a good foundation for statistical analysis.",
    "Yes if you are interested in stats or like QRs because JRS is the bomb. If you stay on top of the material you'll be fine. Just don't get behind and ask questions if you're lost."
