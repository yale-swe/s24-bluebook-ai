   "comments": [
    "Developed an understanding and an appreciation for ancient Roman Art and developed an eye for how to interpret it and understand it.",
    "Nothing",
    "Knowledge of the art of the Romans under the reigns of several emperors. Insights into how portraiture of the imperial family was created and what messages were intended to be communicated based on the current state of the empire.",
    "I learned a lot about what influenced Roman art",
    "I developed a deep understanding of the world of Roman Art from the Republic to Constantine. In addition, the course also provided me with knowledge on monument appreciation and particular architectural insight, which will be useful in the future.",
    "I learned how to properly write a paper in Art History, to have in-depth discussions about art history with my peers, and about what sites I might visit if and when I go to Rome. I also learned a great deal about Roman history, a perspective that was greatly informed by looking at art. Thank you to the professor and my TA for a great course!",
    "I learned a lot about Roman art and the various historical periods in Rome.",
    "I gained an understanding of Roman art and its influence and how it reflects upon Romans society.",
    "Evaluating historical art effectively, describing and reading pieces of art.",
    "I gained the ability to read a Roman portrait, effectively place a sculpture into a respective time period, and analyze its context and meaning.",
    "I got a thorough survey of Roman art. We went chronologically from Rome's mythological origins through the Republic all the way to the reign of Constantine.",
    "I learned about the significance of sculpture over the course of the Roman Empire. I learned more about the characteristics of each emperor and how that influenced their artistic style and choices."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Loved the online discussion posts. They were interesting and engaging and a really good way to learn more about what was being discussed in class, as well as a way of interacting with the material in a way that does not make shy students nervous.",
    "The level of engagement and knowledge you gain during lecture is repetitive and non-informative in regards to the greater look at an art work and how it relates to the larger picture. Professor Kleiner says the test is based off of whats in the lecture and not the textbook, but you should read the book anyways to actually understand anything.",
    "I thought the memorization was hard but it helped to go over it in class",
    "The course is engaging and interesting throughout. All monuments are covered in their historical context, which certainly a strength of the course. The use of a multitude of Canvas features is also a strength, however it does feel that a physical discussion section would be more beneficial.",
    "Strengths include the openness with which the professor gave out exam and paper instructions, the extremely well-organized nature of the course materials online, and the excellent lectures. There really were no downsides to this course.",
    "I thought we covered a large amount of material, but I didnt like how structured and similar each lecture was.",
    "I thought the class was great, I was not a fan of the online discussion forum as a replacement for section.",
    "I wish there was more engagement with the textbook readings.",
    "It would have been nice to have the slides posted somewhere, but other than that I thought that professor Kleiners page was very informative and well organized on Canvas. Her lectures were always organized, and you could tell she cares about the material.",
    "The strength of this course is the professor. Professor Kleiner really looks out for students. The weakness is the limited time frame. I think technical difficulties prevent us from learning the full scope of the class because the projector didn't work. I don't think this weakness was a fault of the class but I think moving forward it would be really helpful to make sure we were able to get through all the material because it's so cool!",
    "One strength of the course is the teaching fellows. They are easy to reach and flexible with helping you or meeting in person. The online discussion forum is also a strength because it is easier and less time consuming than an in-person discussion section. Weaknesses include the exam format, which places a lot of emphasis on memorization, and the lectures themselves. The lectures are not the most engaging and present a lot of content that doesn't make it into the exam.",
    "weaknesses- incredibly boring lectures over topics that should be made more engaging"

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend the course to other students because the material is still relevant today in that the ancient art tradition has such a huge impact on modernity.",
    "No, its worth trying another Art History course if you want to be interested. Unless youre concentrated in Roman Art, this course is not really anything special.",
    "Yes because I thought it was interesting",
    "Yes, it is a great Humanities course which is engaging and would offer something new to many students.",
    "I would. This course is excellent for anyone interested in art.",
    "If they are very interested in Roman art then yes, otherwise probably not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is very interesting and Professor Kleiner is great.",
    "Yes, I love Roman Art and the content was fascinating.",
    "Yes, but only if they are interested in history and art.",
    "Anyone who wants exposure to art history or is interested in Roman history should take this class. I really do feel like it's very manageable and, simultaneously, very interesting!!!",
    "Only if you are really interested in Roman sculpture or have some history of art background. If you know you are interested in sculpture or considering majoring in history of art, this course would be a good fit, but not for anyone just looking to try something new without an existing appreciation for art or Roman history."
