    "Firstly, if you've played an instrument in the past or have any experience reading music, you're probably ready for the course (which I was worried about). I've heard mixed reviews about MUSI 205, and I think this is largely based on instructor. Take this with Becky. It actually made a difference in my decision of what course schedule to take, cause I felt like I actually got to learn a lot in this course, plus she threw in a lot of fun things and random ear training which is always cool. I would 100% recommend this course with Becky; I'm uncertain if it's this good with all instructors (based on the input of peers who took the course at other times) but I really liked it.",
    "This class is set up like high school calculus, except with music. I love theory. It helps you hear more and better, which makes music even more fun! My only regret is that I waited too long to be able to take 210-211.",
    "MUSI 205 is an interesting and low commitment course. As a non-music major, I picked the material up relatively quickly. About 30 minutes of homework for every class and two reasonable exams. Highly recommended, especially for a HU credit.",
    "I would recommend Music 205 to any student who can read music but is interested in a deeper understanding of the principles behind music writing. Especially if you're not a music major or an expert vocalist\/instrumentalist, it's a great introduction that will give you a much better knowledge of musical principles. The class is well-taught and engaging without being stressful."
