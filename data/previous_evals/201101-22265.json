    "Yes I would. The year long is the way to go -- you'll think it's a great idea at first, then panic from October-February that you're not doing it right, then it's a great idea again. Just follow the deadlines that are set for you!",
    "It was great to work on an independent project. Take this course if you feel passionately about a subject you want to explore more in-depth.",
    "This class is required for yearlong essays. If you enjoy intensive research and writing, do the yearlong.",
    "AMAZING - full year independent senior essay. We met twice monthly in a colloquium to talk about our work, research, frustrations, findings, and progress. An excellent way to make sure you're staying on top of your thesis work.",
    "Yearlong senior essay! You probably know what this is about already. Pages pages pages! Or editing editing editing!",
    "try for an independent study unless you'd really benefit from the writing workshops, etc"
