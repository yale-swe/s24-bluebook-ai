    "This is pretty self-selective\u0097if you're considering it, go for it. Just budget your time carefully.",
    "Crowley is fantastic. Not many deadlines though unless you're self motivated enough.",
    "English 489 is one of the most phenomenal opportunities Yale offers. Take this course.",
    "If you're on the fence, do it! You got into the writing concentration for a reason, and this is a great exercise in trusting yourself.",
    "A senior thesis in creative writing. You work one on one with an advisor on a work of fiction, nonfiction, or poetry for the whole semester. Highly recommended!",
    "The Writing Concentration is an amazing and unique opportunity to work with one of Yale's outstanding creative writing faculty on a major project. Some people half-ass the Concentration and regret it. Write about something important and do it properly, and this can be your best and most formative experience as a young writer."
