    "This is the senior essay for the economics major.",

    "Yes - a good opportunity to do independent research on something you care about.",
    "I am glad I chose to write a senior thesis. I have received much guidance and it has been very helpful.",
    "Useful and a good way to construct a more thorough, meaningful senior essay than would be possible in one semester.",
    "Biggest challenge is finding data. Choice of research mentor is very important, consider if they will have time to meet with you especially when it gets to crunch time in April. Definitely do the 2-semester thesis.",
    "A great idea if you're interested in research",
    "Try to get Nordhaus if you can, he is the best advisor you can ask for."
