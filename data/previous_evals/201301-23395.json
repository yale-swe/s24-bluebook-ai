    "Highly recommended!",
    "If you are looking for a course that teaches you a lot about a seemingly obscure topic, take this class. The Himalayas are absolutely gorgeous, and there is no reason why you should not know more about them.",
    "A truly eye opening and enlightening experience. Professor Turin is a wealth of knowledge, experience, and poise. If you want to get anything out if the class, you have to put in quite a bit of time but it is completely worth it.",
    "A wide array of readings involving the socio-linguistic situation in the Himalayas. Very engaging readings with a weeky reading response and discussions that were so interesting that 2 hours would go by very quickly. Also, Mark is the best. Take this course!",
    "If you are interested in the Himalayas or in classical anthropology this class will be rewarding, though a lot of work!",
    "Forgive me for being abrupt but you are quite stupid and shallow if you are not taking this class. You will be missing out on the Yale experience if you don't take this class.",
    "YES YES YES Take this class. Mark is the coolest professor I've ever had, and you learn tons about anthropology and the Himalayas. I would take it again in a heartbeat. There is a fair amount of reading, but Mark also understands that you have other commitments. Discussion is productive and intellectually stimulating and leaves you asking questions both about the region and about yourself.",
    "TAKE IT! Wonderful class! This class focuses on the Himalayan region, however, the issues that we discuss have much broader implications. Professor Turin is the BEST. He is so helpful, understanding, encouraging, engaging, and enthusiastic! The class is not very hard and the weekly reading responses help guide the discussion. I found the class to be absolutely wonderful and very interesting."
