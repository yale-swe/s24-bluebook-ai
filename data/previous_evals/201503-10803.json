    "I think ASTR 510 is a necessary class for any astronomy student, although a lot of the material is also covered in classes like Stellar Astro, and Galaxies.",
    "definitely an important class for anyone who wants to study galaxies.",
    "Yes will recommend.",
    "You learn about each locus of the HR diagram: the properties of stars as a function of their mass and age. How stars evolve. How we know what we know. How stars are distributed in the galaxy, and how that informs galaxy formation theory. I would recommend this course since it is unique in its thorough study of the most important astronomical plot: the HR diagram.",
    "I would recommend the class, very useful if you have an interest in the field"

   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot more about galactic astronomy, as well as stellar spectra, and specifically a lot of new knowledge on variable stars and globular clusters.",
    "Now I know what delta scuti stars are if that's mentioned in colloquium. Stellar classifications are a foundational skill which I lacked before this course. As someone studying exoplanets, it is essential to understand their host stars.",
    "Very informative course"
