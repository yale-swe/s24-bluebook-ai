   "comments": [
    "Take it!",
    "Definitely! Take it with a teacher that's a native speaker.",
    "Not much to be said here...if you want to become more solidly proficient, take the course.",
    "The Italian department is wonderful, and Italian 130 will solidify your grammar skills, improve your speaking abilities, and more importantly, introduce you to an incredible culture. The professors are completely devoted and lovely.",
    "This class has your typical amount of work every weekend, with a composition per week of 400 words on average. The weekly writing assignments greatly improve your writing skills, and the fact that the class is conducted in Italian really helps with speaking and comprehension. We watch great movies and class is always generally fun. Giulia Cardillo is GREAT. She always offers help whenever you need it, and she's extremely nice. If you get the chance, do not hesitate to take the course with her. Waking up for 9:25 class is bearable.",
    "I definitely would. You get to learn a beautiful new language in a relaxed, happy atmosphere.",
    "Great class, great professor. A review of L1\/L2 to sharpen your Italian skills.",
    "Good revision of L1\/L2 - really gives a firm foundation of italian overall, talking as someone who started italian with the L1\/L2 summer program in Siena. Nice segue into L4.",
    "I'd recommend it, just because Giulia is a good teacher. She's very good at explaining trickier concepts, a testament to her patience with her students. If you're in L3, you most likely have to be there to fulfill a requirement, so in my opinion this is a good way to get that done.",
    "I would recommend Italian 130 02 to anyone. Italian is a beautiful language, and the Italian department at Yale is extremely competent.",
    "Review of level 2 italian verb conjugation wise with a little new grammar thrown in. The teachers are nice, and you probably have to take it for your language credit anyway.",
    "The class meets everyday, and you get homework everyday which is annoying, but it's not too hard and the class can be fun if you have a good group. Giulia is the best professor."
