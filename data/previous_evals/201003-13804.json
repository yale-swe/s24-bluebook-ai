   "question_id": "AC350",
   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Excellent",
    "It would have been much more helpful to have the photos and background material regularly available early for each week. During the weeks that we had to gather that ourselves was an unnecessary burden on an already heavy workload. The time doing that would have been better spent on the drawings themselves.",
    "The school and the TAs need to play a large role in helping the students print on Mylar more efficiently. A great deal of money was wasted on Mylar and failed prints.",
    "The library's hours are a disgrace. It closes too early at night, which is the prime time to do research since we are in class all day. And the weekend hours, are a sad case as well - opening at 2pm on Sunday! I would think that an Ivy League school could do much better than that. Please keep the library open later, and open earlier, at least at 12 on Sunday.",
    "I find the library's one day, with possibility of extending only three, difficult and not conducive to actually reading the books that are available to us.",
    "Sure.",
    "Thelibrary was too small and had very limited hours and deadlines for checking out books.",
    "Yea, the resources were adequate.",
    "Fine",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "resources folder was great for most weeks. Some weeks was difficult to find images.",
    "yes.",
    "Resources were adequately available.",
    "Sometimes adequate plans and sections of the assignment buildings were not readily available. The TAs next year could find better source drawings for Serlio, and a few others.",
    "Most of the drawings were done on the school\u0092s computers and printed on the inkjet printers. I had no issues with this setup.",
    "The only resource we needed for this class was inkjet printers. The inkjet printers week after week were a disaster. All of them. I used an average of three sheets of mylar every time I needed to print, because the printers would damage the paper, or print incorrectly. Often, the printers would not print at all. On a typical Wednesday night, only one or two inkjet printers in the whole building would be printing properly. One night it took me three hours to print one sheet. On the printers that were working, the image would be very poor quality. Lineweights would print inaccurately, and any color other than black would bleed, and spread across the mylar sheet over the course of a couple hours.",
    "Yes they were available.",
    "Good on all counts. The TA's helped us by providing weekly resources and the library was chock full of monographs on the more noteworthy architects we reviewed in this course. It was difficult to find work on the more obscure architects form the Renaissance, as well as the obscure buildings by well known architects, but I don't think that's the library's fault.",
    "All the resources were above adequate, save for the speed of the computers at our studio desks. If more ram could be added to these computers there would be less crashes and our productivity and efficiency would be much higher.",
    "Resources were available.",
    "Sometimes there were issues with the inkjet plotters which were very frustrating. Sometimes the machines did not feed our paper and at other times files would bog down a printer for hours, if not until the following day."
