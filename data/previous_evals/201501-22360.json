   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course, because the assigned texts are good and the instructor keeps in mind both the physicality of the city itself and the literature Rome has produced and inspired, a different approach from, say, Comparative Literature classes. On the other hand, not enough close reading of the literature--the study of repeated motifs in the readings like \"the corruption of the Catholic Church\" was much commoner than the study of the language and aesthetics. A good course for Humanities majors, particularly if they plan to go to Rome over the summer for the succeeding HUMS S250 course.",
    "You may be expecting this class to be something like a seminar-lecture hybrid. Not a bad guess, as the class is quite small (mine was ~9 students). I would say, however, that City of Rome for the most part stays true to a lecture-style format. If you take this class, expect to spend most of it listening to Professor Jewiss' lectures (which are amazing, often supplemented by her personal anecdotes about living in Rome and images that she's taken around the city). She is receptive to questions and the occasional discussion between students, but for the most part I think she prioritizes staying on track with the lectures on the syllabus over being able to have lots of inter-student discussions (honestly I even wish that there was less student participation because student questions were often off-topic and contributed to the fact that we didn't get to finish everything on the syllabus - we were about a week behind for the whole semester). You may feel like City of Rome won't be worth taking if you can't do the summer component. I was certainly worried that I would feel left out. I would say, however, that HUMS 444 stands on its own quite well - the materials you'll read in just the one semester are a mostly thrilling though sometimes dry grand tour of Rome from its founding through modernity. I especially appreciated the interdisciplinary approach we took to learning about Rome - we studied historians like Tacitus and Livy, playwrights like Shakespeare, poets like Petrarch and Dante, political theorists like Polybius, in addition to looking at lots of nice images and even writing a paper about Rome-inspired pieces in the YUAG (my favorite assignment Ive done at Yale to date). My biggest complaint about HUMS 444 is that the reading list often felt divorced from the actual classes, such that I felt like I was enrolled in two different classes that happened to be about the same subject. Because Professor Jewiss had planned such a fast-paced schedule of lectures, we often didnt have time to discuss the readings, which was a disappointment, because I often had lots of questions scribbled in the margins. Over the course of the semester, this also led students (including me) to be less invested in actually doing the readings, because we knew that we wouldnt be discussing them in class anyway.",
    "Yes definitely! The best class I have ever taken!",
    "City of Rome is a tough class, but it's worth the work. Professor Jewiss teaches an incredible seminar that sometimes turns into a lecture due to her vast knowledge on the field. Yet, that makes the class all the more special because Professor Jewiss is a true expert in this field given her background.",
    "Overall the course is a great immersion in the history, culture, and narrative of the city of Rome, ranging from legends of the city's founding all the way up to Rome during Mussolini's rule and World War II. We start out the course reading the work of ancient Roman and Greek historians including Livy, Tacitus, Polybius, as well as Roman literature such as the Aeneid to get a foundation of Rome's narrative which future thinkers continued to interact with and reinvent. You then move on to various other authors who were very much engaged with Rome including Dante, Petrarch, and Gibbon. I would recommend this course who is looking to get a broad understanding not only of Rome, but of how Roman culture has shaped the western world and continues to do so in some very surprising and interesting ways."
