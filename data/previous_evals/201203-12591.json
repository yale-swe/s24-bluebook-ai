    "You feel like you're caught in the system because so many people have taken an equivalent class in high school or something, and mess up the curve on the exams. It doesn't feel like participation in class matters, because ultimately it's not your professor who grades you. I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you want to use it as a prereq.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student. Professor Do is quite competent (a lot of people left the section at the beginning based on first impressions and missed out in my opinion). The concepts aren't too bad, and the first two midterms are easily prepared for. Toward the end synthesizing every concept on the final is a little challenging, but overall rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was taught well and not too overwhelming.",
    "Straightforward, albeit with poor teaching.",
    "Many people have taken multi before so if you're going into this just coming out of BC (like me) please make sure you're prepared to study a lot to catch up. Go to office hours if you're even remotely confused about a topic and don't take this course if you're not going to commit a lot of time to it."
