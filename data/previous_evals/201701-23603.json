    "I learned how to approach objects in new ways especially through the seminar's sessions in which conservators and other YUAG personnel were guest lecturers. Before the class, I had never thought so much about engravings, etchings, and prints, and how they were made. I also thought about debates in conservation in new ways -- such as with Constructivist sculptures and how best to display them if they are falling apart. The class gave me insights into these conversations and debates.",
    "The ethical problems of restoration were entirely opaque to me before taking this course. Our initial engagement with the theories of Cesare Brandi and our later consideration of his legacy in the digital age really grounded ideas about \"reversibility,\" the differences between conserving the artistic thought and conserving art's support. I think that our engagement with conservation professionals like Ian McClure, Ruth Barnes, Cindy Schwartz and Anne Gunnison will very credibly inform how I engage with objects on display in the Yale University Art Gallery while teaching undergraduates next year. I now have a whole slew of narratives and connoisseurial data to share with students. I can imagine a new range of conservation-informed close-looking prompts for objects like Velazquez's \"Education of the Virgin,\" or the Ugolino di Nerio \"Virgin and Child Enthroned.\" I think I can help my students see where paint has been flattened by ironing and lining; where trattegio has been applied and how to read it; how celluloid has decayed, and whether or not such decay is expressive in its own right! I think Caro's tight scope on the campus collections produced experiences and encounters with the Yale holdings that will be highly translatable as we become or continue on as Teaching Fellows."

   "comments": [
    "The class had many interested students who brought a lot of insights and expertise to the class. We learned a lot and got to interact with many objects and YUAG personnel, which was great. As far as what I perceived as weaknesses, the class's workload was to me way too much, to the point of being counterproductive to the class's goals. When you're confronted with nine readings per week amid other courses with equal demands upon your time, it's really difficult to slog through all of those readings in a meaningful way before the class meets that week. If the course readings had been reduced to a more reasonable number, between 2-4 readings for instance, I would have been more comfortable with that. Even when some of the nine readings were quite short, it's still intimidating to see such a long list each week. Especially when the semester is close to ending and final papers become the priority, knowing which of many readings to focus upon is difficult when there are so many. I would also say that the weekly 500-word blog posts became really burdensome over the course of the class. During the week to get to YUAG and then document your experience of the art in a meaningful way while thinking about the readings was too much to do so consistently amid other classes. In the future maybe decreasing the number of posts, say to 5 per semester, might be helpful for students.",
    "Our repeated visits with staff from the Yale University Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art count as a chief strength of Caro's course. I think that the time we spent looking at objects under their supervision helped build a visual memory for the signs and effects of conservation, as well as the characteristics of textiles, plastics, print media, oil paintings. I don't think these encounters necessarily trained our eyes to look like a conservator's eyes, but it certainly primed us for that kind of looking and prepared us to consider returning to this particular gaze in the future. I remain ambivalent about the short writing activities. On the one hand, I appreciated writing briefly and succinctly, on a variety of themes, experimenting with topics and consolidating the readings we had completed before each session. (Given the fact that on days when we were in the galleries, we rarely consulted the readings, this kind of pre-writing was pedagogically effective: forcing us to rehearse what we had read in some way, at all). On the other hand, I struggled to really build a short research paper out of or around one these weekly composition. My writing project mostly just emerged out of a vague, heady enthusiasm for one particular reading, and didn't really find purchase in a thesis or a set of concerns I mapped out in my responses."

    "I would recommend the class with qualifications. If the student were deeply interested in issues of conservation and had the time to accommodate the workload, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. The course met its objective, insofar as it made us aware of and receptive to the material and technical aspects of art and its conservation. It was an excellent field-recognition, or object-familiarization exercise. It built up my ability to look for the effects of conservation, ensuring that I can more responsibly attribute a specific element of an artwork to an artist or to his successors-- discriminating between a pictorial expression and a later-day treatment."
