   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to the intersection of art and postcolonial activism. I really enjoyed the model of the course with a weekly screenings and reading. I really appreciated being able to connect scholarship from a variety of backgrounds to an equally diverse set of films. I gained an understanding of how the film and contemporary art fields have engaged in postcolonial critique. I feel Ive gotten a good foundation to continue studying postcolonial cinema.",
    "Having looked for classes that could raise my political awareness through the study of film and art, this was the perfect course. I gained exposure to artists creating highly pertinent work across the globe, and I appreciate that many of these were contemporary figures still at work in the present. I completed this course far more comfortable in my ability to draw connections across a variety of academic disciplines, and also came to better understand my own strengths and weakness in critical analysis. The tools discussed in this class could not be any more relevant today, and it was so important to me to have been able to be in this course during recent events with likeminded individuals; I now have a much strongger sense of my goals in life, or at least have gained the conviction to move forward and act as I see fit.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of knowledge on how to think about the postcolonial world. I hadn't been aware of postcolonial studies prior to this course, but I have been able to develop a framework of analysis that uses a postcolonial perspective to analyze issues in the Arab levant. It's a bit difficult to share the insight that I gained from this course because each of the texts that we read and films we watched were incredibly unique and powerful. I do think that the one major insight I have taken away is that we do live in a postcolonial world, and that more needs to be done to question its fabric.",
    "I learned a whole new lens with which to look at the world. The perspectives I learned in this class are so necessary to understand the complexities in this world, political and otherwise. Additionally, I came away from the class with a much better idea of how art can be integrated into the political consciousness and its role in affecting change."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A great strength of the course is the diversity of material covered in one semester. And I think a related weakness is that not every text and film we covered was maybe given enough in-class discussion time.",
    "The pacing of the course was great - a daytime screening each week (and the resources available online) along with complementary readings. The texts we read were often difficult to keep up with in some weeks simply because they were so challenging, but the work was always rewarding as I looked forward to this class more than any other this semester.",
    "I think a major strength of the course was the syllabus. Each of the texts and each of the films we had the opportunity to watch are things that I will definitely be returning to in the future. I think this course has been one of the only courses I've taken at Yale that has exposed me to such radically different points of view that have pushed my thinking beyond anything any other course has pushed me to. I honestly don't see any weaknesses; all aspects of this course were such a joy to engage with intellectually.",
    "Strengths: brilliant professor who knows so much and cares so much, wonderful and kind classmates who are engaged in the material, and such interesting films and readings Weaknesses: the professor dominated discussions, spent most of the seminar time talking. While I learned a lot, I wish the students had more opportunity to develop our ideas through a more engaging discussion"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's the type of class that you get out of it what you put into it. The more willing you are to engage with the material, the more satisfying this seminar is. With that said, there was a lot of room to explore topics of interest to each student. I was specifically interested in the role of gender in the postcolonial struggle and I was able to devote my final project to studying that.",
    "Absolutely. All of the films and readings were absolutely phenomenal, and could offer enormous opportunities for growth to students from varied backgrounds, i.e. anyone interested in more closely dissecting\/understand\/creating media that resists colonialism. The course was, in many ways, the confluence of varied sources that allowed me to finally draw big-picture connections between my classes. I plan to revisit these materials for many years to come in my own academic studies and artistic practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course has honestly been one of the most incredible classes I've been able to take at Yale. Everything I've had the opportunity to engage with through the course--the readings, the films, our in class discussions--has been instrumental in transforming my thinking on the postcolonial world. I would strongly urge all students to take at least one course on postcolonial studies before graduating. Even if this course is never offered again, I would recommend just downloading the syllabus and choosing any given week to read.",
    "The syllabus is amazing-- read a cannon of works often overshadowed by the Western classics. Prof. Davidson knows so much and has spent years in Palestine- you will get a perspective that is rare outside of the ER&M major and even then, this class's specific emphasis on art is so amazing and there needs to be more interdisciplinary courses like this one at Yale."
