    "Critical thinking",
    "A depth of knowledge regarding theories of knowledge, their shortcomings, skepticism and its responses."

    "strengths: KDR is accessible, I preferred weekly reading responses to section. weakness: if you aren't interested in epistemology, you are not going to have a good time",
    "Strengths: handouts, loved the conversation-feel of the small lecture (basically a seminar), giving questions made testing much more manageable Weaknesses: lots of reading, unclear answers to questions, sometimes monotonous Improvements: if you haven't covered all the material at the end of the semester please either cut it from the syllabus or plan better earlier on. At least don't decide to make these dense, rushed papers the core of the final exam.",
    "Reasonable workload, pretty good progression of material, DeRose explains things ewll.",
    "I found the classes - which were all lectures despite the small size - somewhat boring. There was very little class participation.",
    "Strength: Professor was a great speaker Weakness: Not meant for STEM oriented students",
    "It was an extremely productive dive into the subject material. The class was organized well so different systems of thought played of each other when we studied them."

    "I recommend this course if the student has a clear motivation for taking it. If not, the discussions will seem pedantic",
    "It's useful training and Prof. DeRose has fun with it, which makes it fun for us. Be sure you know what you're getting yourself into, though.",
    "Sure",
    "I wouldn't. I did not find the material interesting nor the teaching captivating.",
    "I would recommend this course for nonSTEM majors or students who like to think critically.",
    "Yes it not only requires you to learn the author's positions but the regular writing requires you to engage and wrestle with the ideas on your own."
