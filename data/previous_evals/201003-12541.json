   "comments": [
    "Unless you're a heritage speaker, you would find this class really challenging. The class assumes oral proficiency and the ability to read complex texts in Chinese. It mostly focuses on improving your ability to write and analyze texts in Chinese. The course workload was huge, and although homework wasn't exactly difficult there were still just SO MUCH to do. However at the end of it your Chinese will improve significantly. Take the course if you're serious about improving and want to challenge yourself.",
    "This course is a very time consuming course, however, you can learn a lot from it. There are large differences in the abilities of the students, and this can make the class hard at times (especially for the weaker students). Kang laoshi will grade fairly, and will treat you based on your level.",
    "If you once knew Chinese and forgot a lot of it, it's a great refresher. It's also an easy way to get the language requirement out of the way.Just make sure you're on top of your game from the start; all the dictations and exercise marks count: even the very first one, when you might still be recovering from senioritis.",
    "Rigorous, good course that will improve your writing skills by a ton through quite a bit of work. I would recommend this, but only if you know you're already fairly proficient in speaking and listening. A summer or semester in China certainly would prepare you well for this.",
    "If you can speak Chinese decently and willing to put in the work, your Chinese will improve a lot. If you are already fluent, this class should be an easy A (you need to learn some fanti zi though)",
    "If you are a native Chinese speaker, or has taken Chinese for many years and have become fluent in the language, I suggest that you take the Chinese writing course instead. You would probably gain more out of the writing course as compared to Chinese 152.",
    "It's a good class to take. It broadened my vocabulary and helped with my writing skills. The thing is, the professor likes to hate on mainland China a lot, which can get annoying at times.",
    "This is a pretty difficult class and was a lot more work than I anticipated, even though I didn't take it for a grade. You learn a lot of vocabulary each week, though not all the vocab is necessarily new, but a good percentage of the words are pretty complex. Kang Laoshi is nice and a pretty good teacher, but I don't think I got a lot of speaking practice in class. We did weekly verbal presentations of compositions, but I think that the course lacked more discussions\/daily speaking exercises, though that's difficult given the limited time of the class. Take it if you're ready for it and want to improve your vocab, but don't expect to improve your speaking abilities beyond what you came in with (though of course, if you're a native speaker, this probably isn't your primary area of weakness).Also, having to learn traditional characters was very annoying for me personally, since I doubt it will come into use for me in mainland China -- there should be a choice to opt out of having to learn traditional chars."
