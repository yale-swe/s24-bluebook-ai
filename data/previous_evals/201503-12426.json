    "A great class for non-STEM majors. If you'd like to learn more about science, but not have to worry so much about all the chemical compounds and whatnot, this is perfect. We talked about anything from reproduction to HIV to the environment to multiple sclerosis. Professor Summers is super knowledgeable and was able to engagingly explain each of these concepts, which is a huge plus! A little something to be careful of is the fact that there's absolutely no mid-term feedback about how you are performing in class though. There's not too much work and everything is very manageable.",
    "All work is participation, 1 presentation, and 1 final paper. Enough said.",
    "Absolutely wonderful science course if you're looking for a Science credit. I spent years on the prowl looking for one and took a gamble with this one and am very very happy about it. Discuss current events in science every class and what's in the news. There's one semester long project and you also give the class updates about where you are in that process every class. At the end, you do a ten minute powerpoint and present the project, and then the project (which is just a 12-18 page essay), is due at the end of reading week. But to take a science class where you can do one 12-18 page essay for the entire semester and not have any exams is really a gem. He knows that people taking this aren't exactly science whizzes either, so he doesn't expect your scientific research to be really in-depth, a lot of the people in the class ended up doing faux-science topics for their projects. Someone changed his topic at the end to an essay on the fermentation of grapes in ice wine, because he had ice wine over the Thanksgiving break and loved it. And Bill Summers was cool with it. Speaking of him, he's a wonderful professor, seems to have extensive knowledge about every science question you can throw at him, and when he does he leaves you with more profound questions about the topic. He's happy to meet about your essay and he's really a great resource to have at Yale. For those people who are warning you about taking this class by saying that because there's only this one essay that's determining their grade, they don't know how they'll do so it could all go up in smoke at the end, the grading policy is actually 50% participation, 50% essay, so you're halfway there if you show up and talk in class. It's also a class for non-science majors so again, your paper doesn't need to be the next big deal.",
    "Take. it. s c i e n c e c r e d i t s g a l o r e",
    "This class is perfect for those who want a super, super, super easy science credit. Take it if you need that credit to graduate or simply don't want a stressful science class.",
    "This is a fantastic class if you need a science class and really want an opportunity to engage with science. I have always considered myself a \"non-science\" person, but this class really changed my mind on all that.",
    "If you aren't science-y this is the science for you. I promise. I haven't taken a hard science class since sophomore year high school and this wasn't hard for me. Basically each week you just talk about your progress on your paper and god knows if anyone was actually making progress or not. Basically just have a presentation and a 12 page paper done by the due dates at the end of the semester and you're golden. Basically I did my project on something I was interested in so it wasn't super painful. So a) take the course b) don't pick a boring topic c) try not to save the whole paper for like two days before it's due even though I'm sure you're going to.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's not a great deal of work, but you actually get to learn a lot about diverse aspects of the sciences and broadening talking points for grown up conversations in the future. If you also choose something you're interested in, you'll find yourself intrigued and excited to write your paper.",
    "If theres one thing at Yale worth spending your 70 grand on, its this class. Bill is an absolute legend. You will come out of this class as Albert Einstein. This class is the true definition of what education should be - hands on independent projects, peer-to-peer learning, and spontaneous conversations, all orchestrated by a professor of extraordinary capabilities and knowledge. 10\/10 would take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The format of this course allowed us to pursue whatever we found to be particularly interesting in the sciences. There was a lot of freedom to this class. Professor Summers is an excellent professor and is very knowledgeable in virtually everything. I also learned a lot about a variety of topics that I otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others."
