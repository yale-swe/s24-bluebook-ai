    "Yes--broad range of ideas discussed.",
    "You will learn a lot. It may not be the most go-by-the-syllabus class but in the end, you will learn how to think outside the box and not be content with narrow perspectives.",
    "Very useful for a range of disciplines, not just film studies. Enriched by having students from other disciplines in the classroom.",
    "The course does not analyze filmic texts, but rather explores theoretical issues of medium specificity. The course is recommended for anyone interested in new media theory and is seeking more to engage with theoretical concepts than actual films.",
    "A very interesting overview of film and media theory. It challenges and makes you aware of your behaviors and practices as an individual living in a media-saturated and media-conscious society. I think it would be interesting to everyone (our case studies included YouTube, and blogs, and other things we deal with all the time without necessarily considering theoretically)."

   "comments": [
    "The course was useful to my research because it introduced to me several theoretical models that I had not previously encountered but are relevant to my personal interests. Much of what I learned in the course could be applied in the future.",
    "I learned a lot about parts of my discipline that I'm not actively interested in. I will go on to use many of the insights gained here in my future research."
