   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in majoring in ME you should take the course.",
    "This was a decent class. I thought the topics were interesting though I wish they had been covered at greater depth. Much of the work was qualitative rather than quantitative.",
    "I would if you've taken chemistry",
    "It's a really good course to take, primarily if you're interested in the \"how and why\" materials behave the way they do and when is the best use of certain materials. Everything is incredibly logical and you can reason your way through the material, so the exams are mostly conceptual. Not incredibly difficult or work heavy (psets are about what you will expect from the mechanical engineering department), especially if you keep up with reading (DO THIS! It'll save you a lot of study time before the exam--nail the concepts as you learn them, get the details later) Definitely don't dread this course.",
    "would be a great elective towards an engineering major",
    "This is very different from the other physics and engineering classes I've taken. It is mostly memorization of a lot of concepts. It covers a little bit of a lot of different subjects, so it doesn't get very quantitative. As long as you keep up with the lectures, the heap of material covered is actually pretty manageable.",
    "The course is supposed to teach you materials science. However, due to the large amount of information you will need to cram a lot, solve few quantitative problems, and answer unclear questionsinstead. Too much stress on physics and chemistry, too little on engineering. I would not recommend it.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It was great when Ramirez taught it, but not really any more.",
    "Covers basics of metal, ceramic and polymer structures. Also their mechanical properties and how they are affected by their atomic structure. We also talk processing and applications of these materials.",
    "MENG 285 provides students with much information on materials and is quite useful for Engineers. I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in obtaining a good background in this topic, or any student who is interested in Engineering or the physical sciences. The course has an average workload and it remains enjoyable throughout the semester",
    "If you have to take an engineering class this is def one of the better choices.",
    "MENG 285 01 is alot of material to cover and a very small class. You can easily fall behind. Class and slides a pretty similar however the test will be hard and probably must read the book. I would not recommend the class. If you like history classes I highly recommend it because it seems like reading the book and memorizing little lines may be best rather than being able to figure it out.",
    "I learned a lot in this class. The problem sets are tricky and you often lose partial credit for small things. The lectures range from very interesting to very boring. A good class for people interested in mechanical engineering."
