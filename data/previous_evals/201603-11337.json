    "I thought that this was a well rounded course with great content, but at the very end when we got to the minuet form and quartet style, it got kind of repetitive. So I would maybe recommend adding one more topic to the course.",
    "Very effective in teaching the aforementioned theory concepts, with subsequent application in class and in the following homework assignments.",
    "The overall course was well-organized, though lesson-by-lesson, it felt somewhat less well-organized.",
    "The course covers a good amount of material and is appropriately challenging; there could be more review in the beginning for students who place into the class but might not have a comprehensive knowledge of all things covered in 110"

    "I would totally recommend this course to anyone who is interested in music theory and the applications of those guidelines to classical music. We analysed works from Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven and got to even write our own music!",
    "Absolutely recommended to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of music or ever pursuing music, even informally, in the future. This course will better you as any kind of musician.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anybody who has a firm footing in the basics of music theory and would like to expand their knowledge. My background in music theory before this course was AP Music Theory in high school, and this course was a rather significant jump in complexity for me.",
    "I'd recommend it if you have an interest in learning more musical theory\/strengthening your music writing skills. The class is pretty chill without a huge workload, and teaches you a lot."
