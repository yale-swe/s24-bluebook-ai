   "comments": [
    "Italian 120 is a logical progression from Italian 110, picking up where the previous course left off grammar-wise and then introducing more elements of Italian culture thoughexposure to film and literature. The work load of the two courses are approximately the same. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "It is a decent amount of work, but it goes a lot slower than L1. One of the best language departments at Yale.",
    "Good review of grammar from ITAL 110. Satisfying to complete the textbook, but even more enjoyable to practice applying listening and reading comprehension to Italian literature, film, and music (short poems\/excerpts from the Decameron, the film version of La Traviata, art exhibits at the YUAG). An enjoyable, engaging course.",
    "Italian 120 concludes much of the Italian grammar and prepares you for higher levelItalian classes. After taking this class, I feel much more comfortable speaking and understanding Italian and also have a greater desire to continue studying the language.All of the professors are super nice and helpful, but I had an amazing time in Anna Iacovella's time and would absolutely recommend it to anyone considering the class. Anna is an extremely enthusiastic, nice teacher who truly cares about what she is teaching. She is also a native speaker, which helps a lot for learning a language!Overall it was a really good class!"
