   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze and evaluate historical sources, think critically, write succinctly, and formulate analytical arguments based on primary sources.",
    "I learned how to write an essay with a roadmap and structure essays and presentations well. I gained debate, presentation, and public speaking skills as well as confidence in doing so. I learned about many historians and themes in world history, and what defines scope in history and what counts as world history. I learned what the definition of historical fact was. I learned to write more concisely and still get my point across.",
    "Writing more clearly and succinctly. A broader understanding for the purpose of history and how it has changed over time.",
    "I developed strategic reading skills for a seminar-based course. I also improved my oral presentation skills through debates and took advice on how I can make my writing more appealing to the readers.",
    "I learned what studying history actually entails besides the memorization of facts. This class taught me how to improve my writing significantly.",
    "This course gave me a new and interesting perspective to view and judge history. I learned about what makes a good historian by examining the arguments, evidence, and sources that historian use. This course, also, helped me enhance my writing skills.",
    "I most gained how to write an effective and concise paper -- although there wasn't too much writing, emphasis was placed on how to convey intent to the reader and write succinctly, as well as develop different writing styles.",
    "My thinking and writing skills have improved tremendously from this course.",
    "I learned about historical causations and was introduced to historians from various cultures and backgrounds. Above all, I improved my writing and how to structure effective arguments. I also got to experience what it is like to be a seminar leader.",
    "I learned a lot about how there is now definitive definition of \"history,\" just interpretations of the word. The course really enlightened me on subjects such as objectivity, viewer bias, and selective bias. I also improved my reading strategies and learned how to write better.",
    "This course is an ideal freshman seminar. Its focus on developing academic writing is incredibly useful. Additionally, the attention to adapting to Yale and becoming aware of how one can best make use of its resources is very helpful.",
    "How history courses work at Yale and how to succeed in them, improved skills in writing clearly and concisely, and (as should be obvious from the course title), a history of how the study of history has evolved over time.",
    "In this class I learned to better evaluate works of world history and understand what a history should do.",
    "Writing skills, debate skills, public speaking, making a defensible argument, what history is"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great class size, a diversity of historical material (not just ancient western European work-- also ancient Chinese, and ancient Islamic World material as well as modern philosophical thought), a reasonable number of assignments. Weakness: Some of the essays were placed at bad times, so if those were shifted to better account for schedules that would have upped the effectiveness (I know this is hard)",
    "The course was really great because of all the ways that Prof Hansen tried to make it fun, from going to Shake Shack and then watching a movie, to taking a trip to the Met! I did not think very good\/useful feedback was given on papers, however. Sometimes it seemed like if she didn't agree with your point, basically every single piece of feedback would be something like -- your point is wrong.",
    "The strong criticism forced me to hold myself to a higher standard. The lack of multiple drafts for most of the assignments prevented acting on that criticism.",
    "I can only think of one weakness for this class, which is the lack of conversation at some points during discussions. That weakness is certainly class specific and does not warrant any change of course structure.",
    "I would say that the strengths of this course are the class discussions and that professor Hansen makes sure that your writing and arguments improve. In terms of the weaknesses, although I enjoyed most of the readings, some were very dry.",
    "Strengths: Course switches up enough that it never gets monotonous, teacher cares about engaging every student. Each student gets the opportunity to lead the discussion. Discussion depends much on the students, so quality may vary year by year.",
    "The student-led seminars were great but at the start, it was hard for the students to adjust to the role of the seminar leader. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the classroom conversations. Sometimes the topics fail to develop into a greater depth but we do cover a large breadth.",
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Hansen forces class participation, the books are fairly interesting, and Professor Hansen critiques essays fairly harshly in order to improve our writing. The weaknesses of the course are that it is often boring if one is not extremely interested in history.",
    "I think the course is very well put together as a freshman seminar. Of all my courses taken freshman year, this was most helpful for adapting to Yale and learning about the academic landscape.",
    "Strengths: very knowledgeable instructor who cares about her students and takes the concept of a freshman seminar seriously, meaning she explores interesting topics in class but also helps us as freshmen navigate history at Yale. For example, she taught us techniques to manage an unmanageable reading load in other words, what to read when you cant read it all, and exposed us to a wide variety of tasks and assignments frequently found in higher history courses. Very direct and honest feedback (some people dont like this, but its useful if you dont take it personally). Exposes us to actual world history, as opposed to just Greece and Rome. Weaknesses: sometimes the evaluation of passages and writing of prior historians made this feel more like an English class than a history class, but perhaps I should have expected this going in, given the title and description of the course. Like in any class asking you to read for homework, some readings were more interesting than others, and oftentimes class discussion that followed longer, less interesting readings really dragged when it became apparent that nobody did them. Although feedback on papers was very useful, I wish we had the opportunity to hear comments on our full papers before turning them in (we did get this opportunity on the final paper, but only for introductory paragraphs on other papers).",
    "The strengths of this class include the spontaneity of classes and the diversity of primary texts. One weakness of this class is that it would work better as a writing seminar with less students.",
    "Strengths: seminar discussion is well led by Prof Hansen, seminar has varied structure (debates, presentations, leading discussions), interesting readings Weaknesses: greater and clearer direction could be given (more time on Evans' book or at least its ideas)"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you are genuinely interested in reading primary historical sources or learning about historiography. Otherwise, you'll be bored!",
    "Absolutely. This was a great freshman seminar and a great springboard into other humanities classes at Yale. I particularly enjoyed all the ways she tries to help you succeed, not only in writing papers and giving presentations, but also by organizing things like trips to Mory's and having students from past years come to give advice on majors at Yale.",
    "Yes! This class was an excellent way to improve my standard of writing.",
    "Regardless of if you had liked history in high school or not, this course will be a challenge for everyone. Thinking about history in this course is very different from how people often learn history in terms of memorizing events, concepts, and names of people. Professor Hansen will prompt everyone to come up with original ideas and challenge students to lucidly defend them during seminar discussions and in writing assignments. I would recommend this course to those who are brave enough to learn from criticisms and mistakes. Don't take it if you cannot withstand the pressure.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's an excellent opportunity to understand the idea of history in its entirety, rather than through a list of facts collected in a survey course.",
    "Take this course! Professor Hansen is great. She really helps you improve your writing. You will also learn a lot about examining the credibility of historians",
    "Yes. Student-led discussion and relatively minimal writing enables strong course participation and engagement.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in history and wants to improve writing.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class. As a history freshman seminar, it looks beyond the western world and introduces me to new cultures that I otherwise would not have been adequately acquainted with. It is a great class for anyone that is interested in world history.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student if he\/she was very interested in history or looking for a freshman seminar that fulfills a weiting credit.",
    "Absolutely! This course is a fantastic introduction to academic life at Yale and to the major principles of historiography.",
    "Yes, but only if the course is for you. The course is for you if: - Youre okay with highly direct but well-intended and very constructive criticism. For example, the professor might read a paragraph you wrote and say This doesnt make any sense to me. This sentence doesnt match with this one, this sentence is written incorrectly, and the whole idea doesnt work. Heres how you can fix it. This is great for improving your writing, but some people arent used to that and take it the wrong way. Shes only saying this to help, so Id recommend trying to get over your fear of hearing feedback and take the class, but if it will really bother you, then take a class from a different professor. - Youre interested in history (obviously), and youre also interested in analyzing writers intent, etc. as you analyze historians methods. - You feel comfortable writing long(ish) essays, speaking\/debating on a regular basis in front of a group of about 18 people, and doing somewhat challenging readings, or you dont feel comfortable with these things but are ready to learn",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who needs a writing credit and is interested in history as a major, as this class will teach the student how to evaluate historical works.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course to improve your writing skills, a clear understanding of history, a crash course on Yale academics and seminars. This is an excellent introduction to Yale life (especially with Prof Hansen's no nonsense attitude and blunt truths on how to survive at Yale). Excellent freshman seminar, though a Fall offering would make more sense given these reasons"
