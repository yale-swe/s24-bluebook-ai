   "comments": [
    "On the whole, this is a solid class. We didn't go as in-depth into law as I would have expected, but the class certainly was very interesting, considering how timely developments regarding gay rights and the law is. There was a slant towardviewing court support of gay rights as proper, and I feel like the class could have engaged more with the material. Still, it provided a good overview of important issues in gay rights and law.The readings are definitely integral to the class, as many times, we analyze cases for the class period. Reading was particularly heavy toward the beginning part of the semester; as the class progressed, Professor Chen was excellent about picking the most important parts of cases to have us read. Overall, the workload is manageable and the class is informative.",
    "If you enjoy reading case law and law review articles and\/or you're interested in gay rights from a policy standpoint, this is for you. The material is timely: new developments occur literally as you discuss it. Prof. Chen is helpful and brought in 2 notable speakers (former CT Supreme Court Justice Joette Katz and Prof. Robin Wilson), both of whom were great.",
    "Recommend if you like the law",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone considering law school - it is taught much like a law seminar and you will learn pretty quickly whether or not law school will be good or bad for you.",
    "Gay Rights and the Courts was an interesting class. Professor Chen cares deeply about her students' work, but was sometimes a bit frazzled. The cold-calling also made the class a little stressful, and made it harder to simply learn. That said, the topic was relevant and we had a really cool guest speaker.",
    "If this course is offered again, take it! Professor Chen is lovely and a good discussion leader. Coursework is engaging and very manageable, and the two big papers were on topics of each student's choosing. Professor Chen teaches with th Socratic method, so every student should be prepared to be called on. While I wish we'd read a little more legal theory and maybe argued a case or two, I really enjoyed this class."
