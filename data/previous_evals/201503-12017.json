    "Maybe. You watch good movies with a knowledgeable professor. The class is split roughly 60\/40 between lecture and discussion, and the discussions were often much stronger than the lectures. Since I hadn't seen any older French movies before (either New Wave or earlier) this class was great because it exposed me to French cinema. I also felt that I got a good grasp on these movies through the lectures\/discussion. Still, this class could get boring, especially during the detail-dense lectures.",
    "Yeah I'd recommend the course to another student if they were already interested in film and wanted to learn more.",
    "A summary of the history of French cinema, from the 1930's to the New Wave. A collection of films and texts are used for reference."
