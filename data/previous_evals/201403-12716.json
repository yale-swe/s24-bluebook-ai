    "This class is only relevant to ER&M seniors working on their thesis. The class works best for people working on year-long senior theses.",
    "It's required for ER&M majors, but it is a great course. I enjoyed class every week, and it's nice to be surrounded by other ER&M majors. Master Pitti is fantastic.",
    "Yes! A great course! The course is very self-directed, so do not wait till the last week to start on your thesis. Prof Pitti is the best! He is accessible, easy to talk to, and sets a collaborative tone for the whole course. The guest speaker list this year was amazing and include Dean Holloway and Prof Brooks. All of the guest speakers were all helpful, inspirational, and engaging. Do take!",
    "Great support and guidance to writing a senior thesis and definitely kept me on track! Also amazing guest speakers"
