    "I increased familiarity with key social theorists in the western tradition, Aristotle downwards (although Paul might prefer to say 'upwards'): Hobbes and Marx to the linguists and the semioticians to the European Sociologists... I was able to see interconnections between these and other thinkers, the shadows or reflections of concepts of one thinker in another."

   "comments": [
    "I can think of no weaknesses for this course apart from the incorrigible fact that the semester is too short, and that I am left hungry for more classes with Paul. The course was extremely well-designed, with a very carefully curated list of readings and sequence. Paul's lectures were riveting, if one can use such a word for a classroom performance, and deeply informed. Paul did not resort to fuzzy language when dealing with complicated texts, and even the most abstruse concepts (no semiotic pun intended) became clear in Paul's expert hands. All I want to say is: thank you, Paul.",
    "I think the general weakness of this course is in the lack of student engagement in discussions of the readings. Its challenging to know if weve understood the material correctly because there isnt space to really speak."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course, even though - I realise - this course is reserved for first year Anthropology PhD students. But the power of the course, and of Paul's execution of it, is such that it would be valuable across disciplines. From the readings and the treatment of the readings, to the lectures and Paul's deeply engaged feedback, and to genuine interest in the classroom, this course (or probably any other by Paul) is worth taking."
