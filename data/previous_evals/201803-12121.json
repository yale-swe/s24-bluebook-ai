    "In this class, I learned from not knowing the name of the tools to building a small steam engine by the end of the class. This was my favorite class by far. The instructor was always happy to help and his efforts for me to learn how to use the machining tools was very high. And the class was always fun and interesting as we learn new ways to make parts in each class. I would like to thank you the professor for his knowledge and effort to help me succeed in this class.",

    "I wouldnt mess with how it is now",
    "Strong --Well structured, that's the goal of the class was to teach us the fundamental skills in the machining by making us build a final steam engine with a lot of parts that required most of its parts to be as precise to function. Therefore, that helps to experience different ways of making tools and as the course progress I was able to speed up because I was able to learn how to use the tools efficiently. --The professors input for us to learn the course was very high --The opportunity to come in a different day and make up if I missed a class in a different day --The class was really fun which makes it to learn the tools always interesting Weak I don't think, I found any weakness in this class, but I would say to have more classes like this how to use and build things such as a laser printer or 3D printer or advancing machine shop, that will enable us to learn a lot of skill based knowledge. In short, I like to have more classes like this.",
    "This was course was excellent but I already evaluated it in the 562L feedback form.",
    "Learning by doing was great, I think I learnt the most working by myself during the last classes, working in couples is a little slow, less challenging",
    "Great class and well taught!",
    "Really wouldn't change anything. Fun and intersting"

    "To anyone who has an inclination to building, working with their hands, or chopping through metal... take this class. David is a prepared and relaxed instructor and a great person to learn machine shop skills under. In this class students build a one-piston steam engine, but the real treasure is the friends made and skilled learned along the way.",
    "Chill and rewarding class that will leave you comfortable in a machine shop setting. You can come in with no machining background, or with a fair amount like I did and still learn a lot.",
    "I highly recommend the course for other students, specially for students who like to develop a skill based knowledge while at Yale. The class can be taken by any student (ie from different backgrounds from even humanities or art classes..not just science) because the professor is really helpful and always there to help teach the class.",
    "Definitely, even if they won't enter a machine shop again, it's still very fun and useful",
    "YES take this class if you have time! It's really fun and a super low workload! and you make a mini steam engine.",
    "Great intro to machining. Dave was great and you will be able to use the machines comfortably"
