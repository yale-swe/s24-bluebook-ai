    "This class is really good. I recommend it to another student because it does help you a lot for your future research using matlab.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in numerical method. Because you really learn a lot of things although the homework load is a little heavy.",
    "A very good course for one looking for knowledges on programming and numerical method.",
    "Yes. It is very useful and learning in this class is satisfying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students majoring in engineering or natural science. Because they can learn a lot of methods to solve different problems, such as ODEs, PDEs, matrixs and non-linear equations. The training in coding is also appreciated and helpful for future career.",
    "Highly recommend this course if you are interested in applied math and want to hone your programming skills.The work load is above average, but the problem sets help you really understand the methods being taught.Great teacher, no text book to buy.",
    "I would say it requires a lot of work. Be prepared, and it will definitely worth the time.",
    "I would only recommend it if they needed to solve ode's or pde's numerically for their research"
