   "comments": [
    "Developing a well thought out and persuasive argument in a short paper. Re-outlining.",
    "I feel like I learned so much from this class. I've always loved English class, but DS lit really pushed me to take both my writing and thinking to another level. Like a lot of people, I came into lit with some degree of familiarity with what the class was about (unlike with the other disciplines) but I think this class still pushed me the furthest beyond my starting point.",
    "This course was my first experience with the classical Western Canon. I was introduced to learning how to close read a text and write an analytical paper.",
    "I have seen how works and writers in the early Western Canon influence one another. I also am familiar with many of the recurring themes in this body of work. My close reading skills have improved, and I am confident that I can write a much better essay now than when I started the course.",
    "I have learned to do close reading in this class. Close reading enables me to appreciate the delicacy of language and to argue responsibly with evidence.",
    "I learned new methods of analysis and close reading, and especially improved my skills in transferring these abilities to the writing of a paper.",
    "Great discussion! I know the quality of classroom conversation depends a lot on the people you have it with, but Professor Bauer really goes out of his way to encourage everyone to engage. Writing papers with him is such a great journey. I struggled a lot, and not until the every last few weeks that I realised I have grown a lot as a writer as well.",
    "Close reading, essay writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I know there's a constant debate in DS about what to include and what not to, so feedback on works is difficult. I really loved the half week of Sappho, though, and would definitely advocate that her poetry remain on the curriculum. This was perhaps due to the timing of reaching midterm, but talking about a love and appreciation for Sappho was one of the first conversations about lit other than lit class that I had with my classmates and one that we continued to have later in the semester. The lit track of DS had some really interesting lectures throughout the semester and overall presented a variety of interesting and important texts.",
    "One of the greatest weaknesses with this course is how quickly we moved through the material. I never felt that I received a sufficient understanding of each text -- and was simply preoccupied of managing the intense pressure of the enormous reading assignments for each week. Reading became rushed -- and lost all elements of enjoyment for me. I often had a difficult time remembering what I have read. One of the strengths of this course is that it was well organized.",
    "Because we read works in chronological order, we were able to see how early authors influenced later ones and how many of the stories and characters were connected. This allowed for amazing insights that would not have been possible if we had read significantly fewer works. But when we were reading Antigone and the Bacchae in one week, I felt we were jumping around a bit too much. The major weakness of this course - the fact that we read and discuss so much in so little time - goes hand in hand with the strength listed above, so it's hard to know how to fix it. I could do with taking out Antigone and just reading the Bacchae that week, or even reading Medea in place of Antigone because it could be discussed more in conjunction with the Bacchae.",
    "The high pac of reading is sometimes overwhelming. Perhaps a more focused analyses of certain chapters\/content rather than entire book surveys could lend itself to deeper analysis.",
    "I enjoyed most of the works on the reading list and appreciated discussing them in section. However, the weekly lectures were not always the most engaging.",
    "The great strength of this course was Professor Bauer's unceasing enthusiasm for each text and his ability to use that to create a wonderful environment for class discussion. Even if I wasn't particularly excited about a book coming into class, by the time I left, I had come to appreciate it.",
    "Weaknesses: sometimes I did not feel like we were getting very deep into the text in class. Strengths: This course helped a lot with my writing. The sample essays and sharing essay ideas in class were all incredibly useful and helpful. The extensive comments on essays also helped me write better each time.",
    "The reading list is, of course, unfailingly excellent."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recomend the course to another student. It can be frustrating to move quickly among so many books that each merit more than a 1 hour discussion, but the pace of the class is a small frustration compared to what I got out of it.",
    "Professor Bauer is a phenomenal section leader. Just the right balance of student and teacher contributions to class. You will receive great feedback on your papers and learn new techniques for writing. You will not be disappointed with this section.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend DS and also this particular section. Professor Bauer's emails can be pretty intimidating, at least at first, but discussion was always fantastic and he really pushes you to get to a deeper reading or a more interesting idea. As a person who was originally on the fence about doing DS, I can say with absolute certainty now that I'm glad I stuck with it. Paper writing gets pretty stressful, but by the third paper of lit especially, I was writing about ideas that I genuinely found really interesting, and it was definitely worth the struggle.",
    "I would recommend DS Lit only if you are passionate about the Western Canon and classical texts. It is a really intense program and course, and if you are not passionate about the material it is not enjoyable. I would recommend however if the student wishes to take DS Lit to switch and take the class with a different professor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! The professor was very organized and invested in the class. I looked forward to every section because discussions were enlightening and engaging. We read a huge volume of work in one semester, but I felt like I had a better handle on the literature we read in this class than any other DS class because of how efficient and organized every section was.",
    "If they were interested in a survey of Western Literature, definitely. However, you have to love and have a passion for reading and analysis, or you may find yourself in a tough spot.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This course is great! Professor Bauer is a great teacher he made me fall in love with literature and he is so good at facilitating fruitful discussion. He is also very available and his love and passion are contagious.",
    "If the reading list interests you and you're willing to put the work, DS Literature can be a really rewarding class. I found the course valuable. However, the discussion in this particular section felt a bit forced and less flexible than my other sections at times. Professor Bauer is extremely passionate about the course content and the success of his students, but expect to put in more time and effort preparing for this class than some other DS sections.",
    "This was the best course I have taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it to any student, regardless of whether they are interested in literature. Professor Bauer improved my writing and deepened my appreciation for great books.",
    "Yes! I strongly recommend DS and especially with professor Bauer.",
    "Yes, of course! This was my most challenging DS section this semester, but it was also the section that I looked forward to the most since I loved the books we read and we had a wonderful class!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class-with Professor Bauer's guidance, our seminars achieved a really high level of discussion and I always came away from class seeing the text in a new light."
