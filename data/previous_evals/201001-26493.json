   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Weil is a genuinely nice and accommodating teacher who provides a clear overview of the basics of the energy industry. While the course doesn't delve too far into the specifics of any one topic, Weil clearly has a deep base of knowledge from which to draw information, and can answer almost any pertinent question with aplomb. The workload is relatively light, and Weil is a generous grader if you put in the effort.",
    "Sure, but only if they feel comfortable sitting through sometimes very technical lectures.",
    "Highly recommend. Great class, not too much work (25 pages of writing, all told, with no exams). Interesting reading& discussion each week.",
    "It is sweet you should take it.",
    "I would recommend this course for a good, broad overview of the coal and oil industries to get a grasp of the institutions involved in suppling America's (and the worlds) energy. It doesn't go too in-depth, but the research project allows you to do that independently.",
    "A thorough analysis of different types of energy without the politicized debate concerning global warming. Focus on the primary methods of energy production and not the new renewable types. Yes.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend for a thorough analysis of energy in context of our daily lives.",
    "It was a really great introduction to all sorts of different energy sources. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, especially non-science majors",
    "This seminar was a very good class, probably my favorite of the semester. This was the first time I took a class that was so applicable to the real world, and that never once felt too academic or stunted. It offered a very good and bird's-eye view of Energy Sources, Uses and Issues, and I am very happy with the pool of knowledge with which I have left the class. The class also functioned as a discussion, so as students we were able to participate when we wanted. This also means that the class was always interesting, because we were never forced to completely learn one topic: we lingered on topics of interest and sped by the less interesting ones.Thomas Weil is certainly a part of why this class was so enjoyable. He was refreshingly down to earth (not one of the pompous academic lecturers that we must deal with so often) and made an obvious effort to make the class enjoyable for his pupils. He is a humorous, nice and \"normal\" guy, which made him very approachable to a student completely new to the field of energy. I am not sure I would have enjoyed the class the same way with a different professor.One of the downfalls of the class is that it only met once a week, for a time of 2 hours. That meant that every week, I would forget some of the small and interesting details from the week prior. This is certainly due to some fault of my own, but perhaps one hour twice a week would be more conducive to deeper remembering and in-class focus.One more (and maybe related) complaint is that it was hard to keep track of everything that we had learned in the class. As an introductory \/ overview class, we covered a lot of material, and I would never expect to be able to master every subject we had learned. That said, there was never any true incentive to take good and detailed notes. Also, since the topic of discussion jumped around so often (which is a good thing), any note taking would likely be confusing. I wish I had had more incentive to take notes so that I would remember everything more clearly. Or, I wish there had been some powerpoints \/ outline handouts that I could fill-in during class and look at afterwards to really remember everything we had learned.There are two long papers to write (one ~8 and one ~14) and several little paragraphs. So, in that sense, the workload is definitely manageable, but the readings were sometimes difficult to get through. There was a lot to read, and much of it was dense and somewhat dry if energy isn't REALLY your thing.",
    "This course details aspects of the power industry that Yale students particularly would rarely think about - especially when class makeup usually consists of a mix of environmentalists, policy wonks, engineers, and business types. While the professor tends toward the business side of things, the information is useful for all of the parties above.Seminar is very open, with time split between presentations by the professor and discussion of topics and\/or reading. Readings are longer, but all easy\/fun reads with the possible exception of the first book (Smil), which one appreciates more later on as a font of information.Like most courses at Yale, it extends your breadth of knowledge, and convinces you that there is more to the picture than you originally thought - no matter your background.Finally, the power-plant tour is Awesome."
