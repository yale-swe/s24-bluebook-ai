   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure if it will be taught by Professor Hilt again, but if it is, take it. I'm sure the class is very dependent on the professor but Hilt presents history of the American economy (from colonial to mid-1900s) in a clear and exciting way. Lectures were always very structured. Lots of reading but largely optional since Hilt goes over them in great detail in class. Great writing credit (3 papers, 1 5-7 pg, 2 7-9 pg), though there are probably WR classes with a little bit less writing required. I personally learned a lot through my papers though.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's a more humanities approach to economics, so economics majors shouldn't expect to see the theory that they're used to discussing. It's a super relevant way to get your writing requirement out of the way as an econ major.",
    "A very interesting class. I highly recommend it.",
    "Good course on economic history. Essays were long but reasonable. Readings relatively short and interesting. Lectures were the best - Prof. Hilt had a tendency to make really quirky remarks that were quite funny.",
    "Good way to kill two birds with one stone: Econ credit + Wr credit.",
    "Hard to say, since this class is always taught by a visiting professor. But I think the way Professor Hilt taught it is reminiscent of an AP US History class. The lectures each focused on a specific historical event or economic development, and the readings were closely related to the lectures. I would recommend it, but it is NOT an easy class. You have to really keep up with the readings and work hard on the papers.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to work hard for your grade in this class.",
    "pretty good econ class and not too hard of a writing credit. just some boring material sometimes but overall fine class.",
    "If you're interested in economic history or in major American economic policy issues over time, this is a good class to take. If you want a writing credit where you can write about economics, this is it. This class delivers exactly what it promises: it uses a series of papers in the scholarly literature to address key points of American economic history. The class isn't hard to follow. The slides are excellent review tools and the workload is reasonable.",
    "Solid class. Prof. Hilt was very engaging, but I think that econometrics should be a prerequisite course for this since many of the readings contain regression and statistical techniques (For some of the assigned readings, statistics is the primary factor.) Not having taken econometics or statistics, I was frustrated when reading papers.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Without a doubt one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Having empirical data to back up historical thought is very interesting and the class makes you reevaluate your thoughts on many historical topics. There is a decent amount of work, because its a writing credit, and doing the readings can be difficult if you haven't taken econometrics. As either a history or econ major definitely take this.",
    "Solid survey of U.S. economic history. Course is pretty broad but covers a lot of thematic developments in American economic development. Lectures are interesting, papers aren't too bad, and the final is fair. Take it if you're looking for a WR and have some degree of interest in economic development.",
    "Hard to recommend for next year unless Professor Hilt is teaching it again (he was visiting for this semester). However, the subject matter was SUPER interesting. A really unique blend of history and economics. Also, American history in general is just cool. Good for a writing credit. Also, if Annie TA's again, take her section. She makes you work a little harder than other TA's on your writing, but well worth it as she is an exceptionally competent TA",
    "This class is different every year because each spring it's taught by a different visiting professor that puts his\/her own spin on things, but Hilt really set a high bar this year with an engaging lecture style, remarkably clear, concise, and well-organized lecture slides, and incredible bursts of hilarity. Some past reviews have dubbed this class basically APUSH again, but this year it most certainly was a novel view of American history in its own right, a brilliant case study of how economic incentives can help us understand and evaluate American exceptionalism. 9\/10 great writing credit",
    "ECON 182 is a way to really understand your country's economic past and even its present. I would recommend this course because the material is interesting and not too difficult to understand. Put in the time and you will do well.",
    "With Professor Hilt (a visiting professor), this class was the best I've taken at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed going to lecture and learned a lot about the historical foundations of modern American politics and economics. Probably worth taking with another professor too though, but obviously hard to predict.",
    "Yes, take this as an intro. to U.S. economic history.",
    "Absolutely, take this class if you can!",
    "The course was much more difficult than it has been in years prior. It is pretty interesting, but the papers can be challenging.",
    "Really interesting class",
    "Good course, take if you're interested in American economic history.",
    "Fair work, interesting writing credit. Hilt is a great lecturer, fairly interesting topic",
    "Great class. Good amount of material, useful if you're interested in understanding US history.",
    "This was a strong class. Professor Hilt gives good, interesting lectures on the whole. The one weakness I would highlight is that TAs have total control over your grade -- for the three papers and the final alike. So try to figure out what your TA likes when writing your papers\/what style of analysis might suit them best. Other than that, interesting material and a good professor, so all in all a pretty enjoyable experience. Not at all the gut it used to be reputable as.",
    "It's a wonderful introduction to the country's economic history. From pre-colonial times to the Great Recession, students get an incisive and interesting look at the way the U.S. economy grew and developed. I loved this course.",
    "Great class. Not a gut!",
    "Good solid course if you need a writing credit. It is rough how you have a final paper and final test to take though.",
    "Interesting if you're into this type of stuff. Not going to captivate anyone who isn't inclined towards this subject independently. Good as a writing credit.",
    "This class is a really interesting overview of topics in American Economic History from colonial times to the mid 20th century. The topics jump around a bit (probably because there's too much to cover), but most are really interesting. Lectures are engaging and the readings are as well (with a few exceptions). I would have appreciated one fewer paper and one more midterm, but overall this is a good course for Econ majors and non-majors alike.",
    "An interesting writing class that takes the history of the U.S. on through an economically-focused lens. It is generally quite comprehensible after 1 or 2 intro Econ classes although Econometrics can be useful to better understand some of the regressions done in the assigned readings. Three papers and a final this semester (although I think a different professor might teach the class each semester so keep that in mind), which was a reasonable workload, with a weekly discussion section as well. I liked Professor Hilt - he wasn't amazing but generally had well-planned and interesting lectures, and was receptive to student feedback as well. Overall I enjoyed the class and it's great if you want a WR credit and are interested in Econ, or if you're an Econ major looking for a cool change-up from all the more math-based classes that make up a lot of the requirements.",
    "Great class, but really because of the lecturer and TAs. Interesting and through provoking material if taught well.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great overview of American history which I think is good for everyone to know. As an engineer, I found it interesting to read the more technical analyses of American history which I have not encountered in any of the history classes I took. The essays are fun to write (well, as fun as writing an essay can be) and the final was fair. This was a great class.",
    "All around solid Econ credit (and writing too!). Economic history is actually pretty essential to being a well rounded Econ major - Good to know about panics, depressions, slavery etc. Readings are amazing and interesting and lecture is worth going to.",
    "Great WR credit for Econ majors. Imagine American History taught from an economic lens. Sheds light on what events (such as the Banking Panics of 1907) led to the creation\/start of certain institutions (such as the Fed Reserve).",
    "Absolutely, take this class! Your writing skills will improve and your knowledge of American history will be significantly enhanced.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It's a fantastic overview of American Economic History (like, actually though) and is really well taught. Expect to read a lot of seminal papers in the field of economic history and have your perspective on things taught in micro\/macro widened!",
    "I highly recommend ECON 182 to any student who is interested in American Economic History, even if this class is not related to their major or distributional requirements. It is very well taught, entertaining, comprehensive, and its work load isn't too bad: three papers and a very small final. I do not recommend this class if the student does not like writing papers, because they constitute a majority of the class' grade.",
    "A great economic history class for those who wonder how the American economy got to be what it is today.",
    "I recommend this class for sure. Especially if you are interested in either econ or history. For me, this was a writing credit and I definitely got better at writing historical papers. Really makes you engage with the material on the final. Not an easy class at all, however.",
    "Econ 182 was a good course that gave a broad overview of American economic history. I hit all the major points and the professor was an engaging lecturer with a good sense of humor.",
    "I had no interest in American economic history (or any form of American history) before taking this class but absolutely loved it. Professor Hilt made it relevant to the powerhouses among developing nations like China and India and many modern economic issues including the latest financial crisis. The history majors in the class also seemed to really like it so it wasn't just me. That being said, this course depends entirely on the instructor. I've shopped the class before when it was a gut and the teaching was nowhere near Professor Hilt's level. The content has the potential to be really interesting if taught well, so I'd definitely recommend shopping it.",
    "Good class, but really depends on which visiting professor is teaching it and what your interests are. I recommend taking a look at the syllabus before enrolling. In any case, this semester it was a solid and worthwhile writing credit. Very well taught, moderate workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's an ECON major or looking for a WR credit. It was a solid amount of work (about 22 pages total of writing), but the material is really interesting.",
    "Hilt made the class extremely enjoyable and his descriptive lecture slides really made it easy to follow along and allowed me to sit back and just LISTEN to lecture during class without being distracted having to take notes.",
    "This is a really cool course. Even though I'm not a huge history fan, the course was very interesting, and I learned a lot about America's economy through history. We had three papers, a final exam, and section each week, which was definitely manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants a relatively easy but very informative intro to economic history. I learned a lot from the class and gave me a new way at looking at American history.",
    "If you're internaitonal, beware. Americans might not know much about the rest of the world, but they sure know a lot about their own country.",
    "'twas the greatest course I have ever takenand I wasn't even remotely interested in history previously. Unfortunately, I heard that Eric Hilt will not be teaching the class again, but if he is, this is a must-take!",
    "History 135 will introduce you to a hybrid field where history can be analyzed to come to new and surprising conclusions. I learned more about the underlying structures of American history in this class than any other class before. 10\/10 would recommend this course due to the combination of writing help and fascinating material."
