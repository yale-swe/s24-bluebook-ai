    "Experience engaging with clients, learning to work efficiently and effectively within a team",
    "It was invaluable working with a client on a REAL issue! I learned a ton, not only on the subject matter of my project, but also about my client, and the coalition members that they worked with.",
    "The best aspect is that we had the chance to work on a project that will be very useful to our client. My project involved a large amount of research so I was happy to broaden the breadth of my knowledge in the subject area my project focused on. It was also very helpful to have a great partner on my project. They were very knowledgeable about the subject matter and helped fill in information in areas which I had less experience."

   "comments": [
    "Lectures are not that helpful. I think it would be better to reserve more group work time.",
    "I would suggest that the advisors check in with groups members individually more often. In several cases, some group members didn't necessarily pull their weight when it mattered, which made it difficult for the rest of the group. Also, some of the class lectures weren't really applicable to the clinic.",
    "It would be great to have more interaction with other student projects as we're working on our project deliverables. I would also find it valuable to find out what projects were most useful to clients in the past, and to figure out how they have been used or modified since the clinic project.",
    "I think client projects - specifically those relating to China and countries that have restrictions on speech - need to be more thoroughly vetted and carefully considered.",
    "Some of the lectures seemed to try to cover too much, so they stayed surface level and brisk - but I also understand that with the diversity of projects requires that we do quick snapshots of the environmental law field. As an environmental law student, many of the lectures also dragged on, given that I have taken many many courses on topics that are covered in mere hours."

    "Wonderful experience collaborating with students from another school with very divergent expertise.",
    "Managing group dynamics and expectations was often difficult, especially when facing deadlines. Also figuring out how to work most efficiently was complicated by people's different work ethics. I did, however, appreciate bouncing ideas off of my group members and feeling like I wasn't in the project alone.",
    "Some of the members of this group were not particularly strong writers and one had never worked on a group paper before and so she was not used to having her work edited by others - this made writing the paper difficult.",

    "It's a ton of work, your work actually means something, and you will have no idea what you're doing or if you're doing a good job. It's perhaps the most useful class at FES. Take it. And log your hours early and often!",
    "Be open-minded regarding what project you decide to undertake. While some use the EPC as an opportunity to further pursue a specific interest, others find value in exploring a completely new topic.",
    "Devote time to project evenly across semester, make sure team members are all contributing their fair share of work",
    "Do not take projects on that involve working with non-profits\/organizations based in China. Try to work with individuals that have strong writing backgrounds.",
    "Make sure you choose a project that interests you. It is a lot of work and can sometimes be a bit frustrating coordinating with clients, so it is important that you choose a subject matter that you are curious about."
