   "comments": [
    "Overall this course is a good, useful follow-on to Biostat II. Dr. Zelterman makes statistics accessible and provides useful insight into methods for analyzing categorical data. The course is fairly easy and has a low workload compared to other classes. There are no exams (midterm or final), which feels like a strength when you are taking the class, but ultimately the course does lack the synthesis of concepts that exams force. Similarly, using the professor's own textbook can be a strength for referring to examples and material during class but also a weakness when you need a concept explained in a different way. He tries not to overburden students with the math behind the statistics and is successful in this (more math would have been ok with me). A few of the more theoretical lectures were quite challenging to follow, but the concepts all came together in the end.",
    "It is ok. Dr. Z tends to \"dumb down\" the information too much. When you try to apply his explanations to real data - you often have no idea what to do.",
    "Excellent. One of those courses that revolutionizes your way of thinking about data.",
    "Professor is adaptable and can change style as necessary for students. Having prepared slides or notes beforehand might be useful",
    "The statistical analysis is difficult to do, even though the instructor claims that it is easy. Perhaps, designate one of the two sessions per week to lab. Just go through SAS and how to do that particular analysis. We are so new to this a bit of hand holding like that would be much appreciated.I would also appreciate if some time was devoted to \"how to write up the results for a journal\". Often that is the most crucial component that is neglected. We learn all these fanciful analysis, the background behind it but usually not how to write it up.",
    "The material can be challenging. The course's real strength is the teaching of Dr. Zelterman who is able to make difficult concepts understandable. It is also a major plus that he teaches out of his own textbook. Homework assignments give you have a chance to apply your analytical skills.",
    "I thought the instructor was very enthusiastic and engaging. Although the text book followed along the course nicely, I think other readings\/texts would be helpful for those of us who need more background.",
    "This is a great class if you if want to understand working with categorical data. The workload is not very heavy (no final!) but the assignments ensure you learn the material. However, the class focuses on the theory behind categorical analysis so if you are only interested in using SAS practically, the class probably isn't necessary for you.",
    "Overall good course. Overview of techinques to use for categorical regression.",
    "I felt the class is important as categorical data is an important component of public health data but felt that I didn't get much out of the class. I felt too much was expected in SAS and more instruction should have been geared to that. I also felt the class lectures focused too much on theory and less on application as if it was being taught for math or stats phd students rather than mph students."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a pleasure to learn from. He was not originally listed as the professor for the course this year, and when I walked in and saw him on the first day I was thrilled. Dr. Z is easy to follow in his lectures, easy to interrupt with questions, and very approachable. He is far more interested in a discussion of the concepts and material at hand than he is in grading and assessments, which can be refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Z is a great guy but the course is disorganized and difficult to interpret. A professor should not use their own book to teach because if you struggle with understanding the Professor, then the book should be a support mechanism for learning. When the Professor, who you don't understand, wrote the book then the book is no help at all in clarifying explanations.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Unusual in a good way. Loved his approach to the subject. Got us thinking about the data\/meaning of the analyses. His book packs quite a bit into a few pages.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very good. Useful instructor",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He's a passionate teacher.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0An excellent teacher - Dr. Zelterman is a real asset for YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths: enthusiastic, reasonable, good at simplifying conceptsWeaknesses: We probably could have covered more material",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman clearly enjoys teaching the class and is very willing to provide students with extra help if necessary. The pace of the course can be a little slow at times but it does help in making sure you know the material really well.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Great guy. Entertaining. Surprisingly successful at making Categorical regression fun!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I felt the instructor was very kind and meant well and was certainly generous on grading but that he taught at a level above the students and most students had to figure out much of what they needed to do in the homework on their own. I felt little was gained in coming to class for when you understood what was being said in class it didn't help in translating to homework.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was very knowledgeable, but he made the class too theoretical."

    "Greg Ryslik was a great TA. He came to class, answered homework questions over email, and graded problem sets. It would have been nice if he had held office hours for help with the problem sets, but he was always good about returning emails in a reasonable timeframe. Greg also taught two of the classes while Dr. Z was away and handled them very well. He also has a wonderful sense of humor.",
    "Greg was a fine TA. He really didn't do anything but grade the homeworks. He should have offered to hold consistent office hours and \"problem solving\" sessions.",
    "Greg was very helpful. Taught an excellent class.",
    "Greg Ryslik was helpful and speedy in responding to questions",
    "GREG.I think he's brilliant but sometimes sometimes his brilliance brims over to the point of being brash. I recall during a class where he constantly interrupted the professor and correcting his mistakes. While I appreciate his honesty, I thought that could be done with a lot more tact and diplomacy, without putting the professor down in front of the whole class. We were all wondering why he acted like that?",
    "Greg was helpful with questions and did a nice job.",
    "Greg was a great TA! He was very knowledgeable and was always willing to help.",
    "Greg was a great TA. He responded to questions very quickly and was very fair in grading the homework. He also attended every class and was clearly on top of the material.",
    "Kind. Undeerstanding. Great TA!",
    "I felt Greg, our TA, wasvery helpful and generous on grading. He was willing to help at any time and wanted us all to do well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes but you do need to be prepared to do a fair share of SAS and homework. Since this class doesn't have a final, it also gives you more time to concentrate in studying for other classes.",
    "This course is useful but relatively low maintenance. I spent a fair amount of time on the problem sets, especially as the course progressed, but there were only 7 problem sets throughout the semester and no additional assignments or exams. However, sometimes the hardest part of the problem sets was figuring out the SAS code as Dr. Z does not spend much time on SAS in lecture. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone using categorical data for their thesis or just looking to learn more biostat. You will learn something and not sweat too much.",
    "It's a requirement to take.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interested in categorical data analysis.",
    "Course was a great overview of discrete data.",
    "A very good course for those interested in taking an upper level biostatistics class. I would particularly recommend it if Dr. Zelterman is teaching the course.",
    "I would recommend the course. I feel like I have a good understanding of what subjects we covered, but am not confident I could go out into the world and be an expert on these concepts.",
    "If you are interested in the theory behind categorical data analysis, you will love this class. If not, it's still an enjoyable class but the material isn't necessarily useful.",
    "Overall good course. Overview of techinques to use for categorical regression.",
    "This class could be good but only if you have a decent working knowledge of SAS beforehand and are willing to reach out to the TA for extra help frequently."
