    "I gained a better understanding of the styles and history of buildings and during what era they were constructed as well as the different themes of each era.",
    "I learned an overview of American Architecture and development of American cities including collegiate, suburban, industrial, and corporate architecture.",
    "I learned so much about American architecture. I did not realize buildings could be so complex and human!",
    "General background of American architectural history and development",
    "I developed knowledge on the architectural feats of this country and how\/what they represent in history and to us now.",
    "I learned so much about the themes of American Architecture and how they connect to American history, the history of New Haven, and to issues of design in the present day.",
    "I learned a bit about how to look at architecture and now look a bit more carefully at the built environment around me. I was disappointed to not learn a stronger framework for understanding architecture.",
    "General Survey Course of American History - overarching themes, styles, and architects.",
    "I learned a lot about different styles and architects and am now more interested in architecture.",
    "I learned a lot about urbanism and the history of american building.",
    "This was an awesome class!! I learned so much about different architectural strategies and the history of urban planning and the historical impact this has had on the American landscape and social dynamics.",
    "Learned a lot about the relationship between urbanism and architecture. I look at things differently.",
    "I learned about buildings.",
    "I learned to be able to look at buildings around me and be able to identify the general time period, style, etc. which is pretty cool. I also know some stuff some more famous buildings which I have seen in New York or around New Haven. It is cool to have more perspective on the social history of the landscape around me",
    "This class was a subject that I never thought I would take, but it was truly interesting. It helped me gain an appreciation for architecture and the buildings around me, which I never thought I would learn to do.",
    "This class made me more aware of the buildings and urban fabrics around me. It is actually super fun to look around and recognize building styles we talked about in class!",
    "Deep understanding of american architecture and urbanism",
    "I've developed the ability to critically analyze buildings and their influence on it's environment's cityscape, culture, and vitality. I gained an understanding of many different global and national movements as they relate to cities and infrastructure. Since taking this class, not only has my knowledge of New Haven improved (the class often looks at buildings in New Haven), I've grown a strong appreciation for the natural and built environment around me. I walk around looking up at buildings and admiring the craft behind it.",
    "This course is a comprehensive overview of the history of the American built environment. It seems to lean more heavily on urban forms than on particular buildings, although I do feel like I have a sense of the \"greats.\" This is a good class for people with no experience or with a lot. I have a thorough architectural background, but I've found that other courses are mostly ancient or totally modern, and European, not so much American and not so much 18th\/19th century. I enjoyed it.",
    "I was expecting to learn about architecture fundamentals from this class but it ended up being more about urbanism and architecture history. I got to learn about how much power buildings have in terms of defining a place and how places can end up taking a life of their own. I also learned how architecture is a fairly subjective field and could very much rely on personal interpretation. I think this class has truly changed the way that I look at a place when I see a building, I'm more aware of my immediate reaction (pretty, ugly, etc.) and then I start thinking about the history of a place. I also started thinking about the people and the place, what went into building a place, and what it could be.",
    "I developed a decent working knowledge of American architecture.",
    "As a history major, I was familiar with most of the themes surrounding colonialism, U.S. history, and development as they related to this course. What was new to me, though, was the ability to get to some of those deeper themes by visually inspecting a building or a landscape.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge and appreciation for American Architecture. We studied trends and landmark structures in America starting from colonial times. I gained insights into analyzing physical artworks and how to place them into larger trends. You begin to see the same trends in the buildings around Yale and it feels very fulfilling.",
    "learned so much about not only important buildings in America but about different movements and how the past has affected the world around us today from a very unique lens.",
    "Greater understanding of architectural trends and patterns of urban development in the US. Basic architectural knowledge",
    "The course was a general overview of the foundations of American urban architecture, covering a variety of style, architects, and cities.",
    "A familiarity with key American buildings, architects and themes!",
    "great overall survey of American architecture. very accessible to non-architecture majors",
    "I learned about the major architectural and urban trends in the United States from the mid 15th century to today. This course made me look at built structures in an entirely new way: I can now recognize the style and era of any building on the street, and it is cool to be able to connect what we learned in lecture to the real world. The course teaches the specific critical thinking skills needed to analyze structures from a comprehensive point of view, like examining external factors and relationships to the existing landscape and sociopolitical climates.",

    "Analyzing a building\/ a landscape",
    "To look past initial aesthetic",

    "I learned the periods of American architectural history.",
    "This class gave me a greater appreciation for urbanism in the US in every sense. Elihu does a fantastic job connecting architectural themes to broader narratives in American culture and history",
    "Identifying architectural styles.",
    "I gained a much deeper appreciation of the urban built environment and a set of vocabulary to properly express my ideas.",
    "I learned about the history that impacted urban development and architectural movements. This course taught me how to integrate different fields and how architecture is linked to nearly every aspect of our lives.",
    "Lots of insight into how to view American cities and buildings!",
    "history of arch, how to id buildings etc",
    "This course teaches some major themes in American history through the lens of urban planning and architectural styles, and I've learned to look up and understand why the environment around me is built that way.",
    "I had never taken an architecture course so this was really new and cool. Now I notice the buildings and structures around me more.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of urbanism and how cities were settled, organized, or planned the way they were. This was the main focus of the course and it really focused on the narrative of streetscapes and how cities and buildings and styles have changed over time as a response to different factors like health and technology. I thought it was more of a history and urbanism class than architecture, although we did need to understand some of the characteristics of each movement in order to understand the buildings.",
    "I learned so much about not only patterns of American architecture and urban planning, but also an entirely different paradigm of evaluating and interpreting built space in general. A must take at Yale.",
    "I gained a broad knowledge of architectural and city planning movements and how they related to the issues in the U.S. of a given era.",
    "As my first course in architecture, this class taught me to look at design and urbanism through a new lens. I am now much more aware of my surroundings and have the ability to contextualize the development of urban spaces.",
    "Appreciation and general knowledge of architecture",
    "I learned how to evaluate different architectural styles and better understand their role in urbanism.",
    "I learned a broad history of architecture in America, and the ways in which the styles have evolved and have inspired other styles over time. Apart from the simple identification of what buildings evoke certain styles, the course goes further to talk about the social importance of the buildings and cities we are analyzing. All of the analysis is tied together very well, and gives a good starting point to learning more about art and architecture.",
    "I gained the ability to see and notice the architectural fabrics of the cities around me. Its amazing what you notice once you have started to train to look for it.",
    "Learned some stuff about buildings. Jo my TF was awesome super engaging.",
    "I learned about the narrative arc of the history of American architecture and urbanism. I learned how to walk through a city\/town and understand what I'm looking at architecturally. Honestly the most important thing I took from this class is to be more mindful of buildings in my life in general.",
    "I have a new way of seeing and understanding the world around me in American cities and beyond.",
    "I started to look up around new haven and learned about so much history of the city.",
    "This is my first architecture\/architectural history course, and I definitely benefitted from being a newcomer. Technically I've learned to: (1) identify architectural styles in America, (2) formally analyse buildings in America, (3) have a greater appreciation and a critical eye for the American built-environment, and (4) understand that architecture and urbanism are intricately linked, and one cannot be analysed without the other.",
    "A broad knowledge of American architectural history.",
    "I developed many insights about the history of the development of the American city and the architectural styles of different eras",
    "I developed both an understanding of urban architecture in the United States and a broad understanding of how architecture is taught more generally.",
    "Overview of American architecture throughout history, important architects, important movements and important buildings.",
    "I loved this course! It broadened my knowledge of American Architecture, and it helped to supplement my previous exposure in studying the built environment.",
    "This class taught me the path of architecture in the United States from the nineteenth century forward, mainly. It examined different cities in the US and different time periods and emphasized the context that helped shape these architectures. I learned to look more critically at the city around me and to appreciate and notice more about other cities, like building styles and what that says about the place's age, what its purpose was, how that has changed since its creation, and how it has influenced or taken influence from its environment.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the trends in American Architecture and Urbanism and I felt very strongly by the end of the course that I had a grapple on the content. More importantly, I felt like by the end course I was able to view the environment around me in a deeper way.",
    "I learned a new vocabulary with which to speak about the built environment around me; also learned a lot about the different eras in American architecture and in what ways they were inseparable from their political moment.",
    "I learned about the history of style and organization in American urbanism.",
    "I gained a fantastic overview knowledge of architectural trends in american cities, beginning in 1600s and ending with today.",
    "I learned a survey of American urban history through the lens or architectural design and tenets of urbanism. Elihu spends his time describing buildings but contextualizing their construction in social histories and ideals of the school of architecture to develop a broad but intricate curriculum",
    "I learned to look at architecture and urban settings in a way that I never had before.",
    "This class gave me a broad understanding of how the architecture in the United States has come to be what it is through the lenses of economic, social, and cultural history. We learned a lot about the actors that played into the manifestation of building types and trends in the US which has aided me in understanding the modern formation of cities.",
    "Survey of American architecture over a long period of time. Exposure to a new language of architecture was valuable, cursory exploration of social processes relating to the architecture was interesting too!",
    "I learned a lot about the history of American architecture. I learned how to analyze and write about buildings and landscapes. I learned some basic architectural vocabulary. I learned to think differently about the cities and buildings I engage with on a daily basis.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of architecture and the people and movements who shaped it.",
    "I gained a wide range of knowledge from this course, including familiarity with building types and styles throughout American history, knowledge of important individuals, buildings, and trends in American architecture and urbanism, a greater ability to analyze streetscapes, and an improved understanding of the discipline of architecture. The course provided insight into the forces that have shaped cities and buildings, helping to explain the urban forms and structures we see today. The course also helped to give a basic vocabulary for the discussion of architecture. Finally, the course has given me a greater awareness of and curiosity surrounding the built environment.",
    "After taking this course I learned to view buildings in a different manner. Before taking this course I did not think to view buildings as a part of history, but after taking the course I now see the importance of a building in the context of urbanism and history.",
    "I actually look around New Haven and even my own hometown differently now, because of the knowledge I have gained from this class. I have a much better sense for understanding the influences and cultural shifts that left visible impact on the American built environment.",
    "By taking this course, I learned a little bit of the fundamentals of architecture and art history, as well as the social and urban history surrounding some of America's most iconic buildings, and the skill to observe more carefully my surroundings, and connect how buildings create and define the spaces we inhabit.",
    "I learned a lot about different architectural styles and the cultures\/eras they are associated with as well as how the usage of these styles reflects on America specifically during different periods of time.",
    "Very insightful look into the history of urbanism starting with precolonial plans and settlements and progressing all the way to modern day.",
    "Good survey course of American architecture with a focus on social situation and circumstance that led to the implementation of new styles.",
    "I learned how to better look at and understand buildings, the process of urbanization, and the social history of buildings.",
    "Learned about architecture",
    "A crash course in the moral and aesthetic themes of American architecture in the broadest sense of America. A notebook full of all the beautiful phrases that fell from Professor Rubin's mouth during lecture. An urge to take more architecture classes even though that's not my area of study.",
    "Learning to take a new perspective on building meanings.",
    "a good introduction to different architectural styles and patterns of urbanism",
    "knowledge of history of American urbanism",
    "I learned how to critically evaluate historic U.S. trends in housing and how to situate specific architectural structures within urban patterns. I am particularly skilled in looking at buildings and understanding the history behind them, their placement in specific cities, and how their relationship with the urban fabric is changing.",
    "Taking this course has helped me look at buildings and larger infrastructural networks from a different perspective. I have learned to appreciate more details, recognize certain patterns, and understand the functioning of a city in a deeper way.",
    "I learned the importance of and how to identify the connection between Individual buildings and their role in the cultural landscape",
    "I learned a great deal about the progression of Urbanism in North America from the precolonial period to the present. I also became familiar with a large number of buildings in American cities, the reasons they were built and the impact they had on the spaces around them.",
    "We learned so much about the planning and construction of many American cities.",
    "I gained a fantastic grasp of identifying buildings from different eras and their relationship to American urbanism. Rubin's course offers a new way to view the built environment, allowing me to connect it to the various course readings and captivating lectures offered in the course.",
    "None.",
    "I learned a lot about American history through the lens of urbanism and the development of cities.",
    "I learned about the development of various architectural styles and how they interacted with \/ reacted to American cultural history.",
    "This course taught me how to analyze architecture with a historical lens. I especially enjoyed learning about the ways in which trends in urbanism (City Beautiful, urban renewal, etc.) altered the way our contemporary cities are designed.",
    "This course was a great survey of American Architectural history and urban change and development.",
    "A new perspective on the progression of US urbanism. I look at buildings, roads, cities, etc. with a new interest and understanding of their place in history. This course was so fun and has really influenced the way I inhabit the world.",
    "I think I received some general framework for discussing architecture and a better understanding of the timeline of American architecture.",
    "I learned to trace the development of architectural theories across American history, critically evaluate buildings, and conduct archival research about New Haven's architecture.",
    "It broadend my awareness of the socioeconomic ongoings that influence why and where buildings are built.",
    "This course was an overview of the development of American architecture. It really is a broad course. I learned a lot about American architecture in general and some of the themes that Prof. Rubin was particularly passionate about. I learned how to use New Haven resources such as the New Haven museum and Prof. Rubin really prompted us to explore New Haven's buildings and treasures.",
    "Great dinner party class. I can speak with confidence (and feigning intelligence) on a huge variety of buildings.",
    "I learned so much about American architecture and urbanism! It has really changed how I see New Haven, my hometown, and any architecture I pass by or enter. This class was fascinating, and everything I learned was so relevant to my every day life, and interesting from the perspective of my political science major.",
    "I enjoyed this course as someone who is more interested in the urbanism part of the course than the architecture component. It was interesting to learn about architecture as I don't know much about it, but the urbanism part was what really interested me, so it was interesting to follow the historical trends of urbanism in America. I wish there had been a stronger racial lens and focus on urbanism and architecture, as this was a topic that was discussed in the course, but as race and racism are the primary factors that drove American urbanism, I would have appreciated looking at the questions of the course through an explicitly racial lens. It is a big lecture course that also covers architecture, so I am not surprised it had less of a focus on these topics, but I do think it would be valuable for a wide range of students to learn about the realities of American urbanism. Overall, I enjoyed the course and did not find it particularly challenging."

   "comments": [
    "The courses strengths are its subject matter and Prof. Rubin's passion. There are lots of weaknesses, however. Lectures were disorganized, readings weren't connected to course material, and the sections lacked a coherent connection to course topics. Prof. Rubin is often vague and rambles through unnecessary distractions rather than focusing on a given idea or point.",
    "use more coloquial terms and engage the students more",
    "It's all SOOOO GOOD!!!",
    "bwasjsax",
    "Engaging lecture, great professor and TFs. Applicable, relateable content",
    "I think a potential way the class could be improved is to outline more broader topics in the beginning of class and then dive into them. This was addressed a little bit about halfway through the semester, but in the beginning I definitely felt lost and asking myself \"so what?\" about many of the slides, not really understanding how the examples fit in with the broader topic of the day.",
    "the lectures were disorganized. not enough focus on the architecture of individual buildings. more focus on social movements but it was often unclear how the architecture reflected these social movements. the readings did not really relate with lecture. section and lecture seemed disjointed.",
    "strength: Elihu is a great lecturer and makes the lectures actually interesting and enjoyable to attend weakness: too much reading",
    "The lecture was pretty good",
    "Professor Rubin was very engaging and really a great lecturer, definitely interesting to listen to and he was so passionate about the topic. Though the slides didn't have many words on them (which definitely would've helped my learning- or being provided with handouts\/notes to accompany the lectures), the lectures were pretty interesting and from taking the lecture I feel like I learned a lot about the city of New Haven and beyond.",
    "The strengths are the lectures. The weaknesses are the readings.",
    "A weakness of the class was it was a extreme amount of buildings and specific information like the architect, time period, etc. that we had to memorize for hundreds of buildings which I don't believe is a good way to test what we learned in this class because the class focused more on themes from each time period and their changes over time over specific buildings.",
    "Lovely lectures. Meaningful assignments. Too much memorization and too much spread over too many decades of architecture and urbanism.",
    "Great course, the lectures are a lot to consume, but so well taught, at the end of the year I can still recall themes from the first lectures",
    "It was good in telling you about architecture but it was not good in teaching you about architecture, it seemed like they would give new architectural terms and meanings without telling us what they mean, seems like a more advanced architectural class then for students with no architectural experience.",
    "Professor Rubin is amazing-- passionate, a funny and interested lecturer, and always ready to engage with all student interest (sometimes he's slow to respond to emails, but aren't we all). I deeply wish the class had been capped, because some of its magic was certainly lost in its size. Sections often had a lot of apathetic non-participants which made the experience a low point of the week.",
    "Course could be improved with more structure and clearer lecture outlines. At times, I was confused about the definitions of certain terms so it would be great to have a slide or two at the beginning of each lecture that not only outlined what we would talk about, but also clarified key words (i.e. Beaux Arts) and provided dates\/definitions.",
    "The strengths of this course were Professor Rubin's passion for the subject, the interesting assignments, and the breadth of material covered. The weaknesses were that we never learned really how to analyze architecture, a lot of the themes were repetitive, and the material was never really addressed properly. Section discussion was weak and student engagement was embarrassingly low. It's definitely a gut course with the downsides that come with that, to the detriment of how interesting the material was.",
    "weakness - lots of material to review for final strengthens - well organized course, interesting assignments",
    "Overall good class",
    "I really enjoyed most of the lectures in this course though I felt like I would get more out of a course with slightly longer lectures in place of section. Though I liked my TF, I found section to be very repetitive and not all that helpful. I also think the NHBA project ios very flawed and should be removed from the syllabus. The website crashed regularly, deleting hours of formatting that I had worked hard to establish.",
    "Elihu is a wonderful professor who is great at capturing his class. Course was well organized and there was plenty of opportunity to learn additional outside of class knowledge.",
    "strengths are elihu's poetic lectures weaknesses are the lack of organization and section",
    "This course had a lot of things that needed further explanation, such as vocabulary words and key themes in the course.",
    "Super fun class! I love Elihu's lectures and the material is super interesting. However, it was a little unorganized feeling because we didn't find out what our assignments were until right as they were assigned and my TF also seemed to not know what was going on in the class to help us prepare for the exam.",
    "more engaging lectures",
    "This course seems like it's all over the place while it's happening. A lot of the information is just random facts about buildings. Reviewing the course at the end of the year though, there is a clear structure and specific lesson units. I guess I would improve this class by making this structure more clear at the start so that students process the information into categories throughout the semester, instead of going through it all at the end in preparation for the final exam. Otherwise, this class was great. Section was, honestly, not too useful until the last few sections where we did review and synthesis of material. However, they were still enjoyable and did not detract from the overall course experience.",
    "The course was a broad overview which was great so it included a lot of materialparticular vernacular architecture that is often left out. I felt like it was lacking in detail in terms of how to look at a building and use architectural vocabulary. Several of the lectures also felt rushed and disorganized due to catching up. Also, there were over 700 final review slides. The intention was that this would exhibit broad trends and that we could discern the important icons from the group. However, the overwhelming number made it hard to actually focus. It's difficult to remember the important buildings visually when so many similar ones are passing your eyes.",
    "Professor Rubin was a bit disorganized in the beginning, so that was a bit difficult. The course had great examples of important buildings. The course was also taught chronologically, so it felt like we were analyzing American history through an architectural lens, which was interesting. I think I would have appreciated a lecture (even just one) in the beginning where we just go over architecture fundamentals. Sometimes, I found it difficult to talk about things that I was seeing in the buildings we were studying because I didn't feel like I had the language.",
    "This course was truly great! Professor Rubin loves this material and his passion shines through in his lecturing style! Every lecture was super interesting and this class taught me to look at my surrounding environment in a totally different way than before!",
    "Prof Rubin is an able public speaker and clearly passionate about the material. But the course would have been greatly improved by adding in much more structure. Lectures were unengaging and felt as though they just rambled on. It never felt clear what we were expected to know and what we weren't. I felt like I left class having taken away nothing. Rubin should work to make the material more clear for students; I would recommend especially adding words to his slides.",
    "The course had a broad subject matter: American architecture and urbanism. Obviously, then, not everything in U.S. history fit within the syllabus. I do think we sort of disproportionately emphasized the late nineteenth century and the late 1940s and '50s (considering how we were evaluated and the broader swath of U.S. history that surely had an impact on architecture and urbanism). It also would have benefited from a more balanced view of development and redevelopment, especially as a survey, where many probably were not familiar with these themes to begin with. Overall, this was a fairly strong and compelling course.",
    "Strengths: Elihu Rubin. He definitely elevates the course to where it is right now. He is a great lecturer and speaker. He clearly loves what he teaches and is very approachable. The content, especially once skyscrapers begin, gets super interesting as well. Weaknesses: The sheer volume of content can be a bit overwhelming. One lecture can cover a very intimidating breadth of information. It is easy to get worried about studying and remembering these buildings come exam time. It was hard to tell what was relevant to memorize verses just appreciate during lecture. Of course, the two are often not mutually exclusive. But some more clarity over what information was tangential and which is a key structure a student should memorize would have helped come exam time. Although, they gave us a study guide with all the buildings, so that helped.",
    "Elihu's lectures are very engaging, but sometimes could have a more easy-to-follow structure. I felt that section did not always add much to his lectures, but they became more useful over time. A basic intro to architectural terms and themes at the beginning of the course would have been useful because lots of people in the class were not architecture majors.",
    "Lecture could be more organized! Wish we had a bit more structure.",
    "slides and lecture could be more structured. but it got much better through the semester",
    "The course is very well designed in chronological order to travel through the urban history of the U.S. I like that the course is grounded in New Haven architectural history as a case study of the larger themes of the class; it makes the course more approachable and relatable. Section is helpful in that we get to discuss specific examples related to topics covered in lecture. The New Haven project was great, I loved researching my building.",
    "Very disorganized, too many slides for final",
    "Nightmare of disorganization.",
    "Lectures are interesting but not well organized",
    "I think it was an incredibly well-planned out course and I will recommend it to all my classmates!",
    "Amazing course, interesting subject content.",
    "The lectures could have had more structured content. Each lecture was more musings on 50 buildings rather than cohesive points about the history of architecture.",
    "The course is so interesting and is taught very passionately I think it could probably be a little better organised. I sometimes wish the lectures were a little clearer \/ more focused. At times I was lost and a lot felt shoved together.",
    "This course was an awesome way to explore individual interests in architecture",
    "Not well organized, unclear about what information was important",
    "The lectures were a bit scattered. It would be a lot easier to follow along if the slides had more written content instead of just pictures.",
    "The class has a lot of potential but does not live up to it because there are too many examples and not enough explanation of styles. We saw many different styles, but none were actually explained in depth. I understand that styles are not static entities and are difficult to define, but it would have been helpful to give something of a definition. Also, there are too many examples thrown out in class and not explained. It would be better to focus on fewer buildings and analyze them in depth. The whole class felt like skimming the surface, which is somewhat inevitable in a survey, but can be helped by in depth explanation of certain examples.",
    "The project was definitely the high point for me, while the paper seemed like more of an afterthought. The lectures were very engaging and fascinating. Section was even good!",
    "A bit inaccessible if you don't know that much about architecture.",
    "It was a normal lecture with reasonable assignments and a reasonable final. Wouldnt change anything actually.",
    "great",
    "The lectures and readings dump a lot of information on the students with no clear way to synthesize this, especially as the papers do not relate much to the course material, so this could be improved. However Elihu is a great lecturer with an engaging style and brings out social issues beautifully through his analysis of the urban environment.",
    "Great lectures, fair assignments and exam, could spend more time building up evaluative skills for the exam",
    "The final was super hard to study for -800 images and you were supposed to know the name and architect and year. Good thing I took it credit\/d. Professor Rubin is very passionate but sometimes its hard to make sense of what were supposed to get out of lecture. Anyway, very low work commitment throughout the semester - 1 assignment, 1 paper, section, and a final.",
    "I think the class lecture is very engaging. Elihu really knows how to talk about architecture and create a narrative. However, I felt that the readings did not always align with it.",
    "The one thing I would ask for is a little more structure in lectures -- there are so many interesting tangents to go on with the subject matter, but they can sometimes be distracting.",
    "Rubin is a fantastic lecturer. I think since it was his first time teaching the class it was a bit disorganized in its structure and some of the lectures repreated material from the ones that can directly before it. Overall an amazing class.",
    "Strengths: This course manages to cover a vast amount of material in a single semester; it is a very ambitious survey course that largely accomplishes what it intends to do. Weaknesses: For non-architecture-majors, which is most people, the readings for this course can be frustratingly dense and esoteric, and that discourages many students from doing the readings at all. This class would be improved if the readings were either shorter or supplemented by more straightforward ones that don't assume a background in architecture terminology. It would also be helpful if a glossary of architectural terms, styles, and key figures was included in the syllabus, because definitions are never explicitly stated in the lectures or readings, which can make them harder to follow. Also, section meetings were not nearly as helpful or productive as lecture. Perhaps this was because each one was led by a different pair of students, but because there were completely new topics every week, the material was as unfamiliar to them as it was to the rest of the students; I would've preferred for my TF to just lead section and involve students some other way. Finally, the final exam was much too long-- 2 5-paragraph essays and 6 slide comparisons forced us to go for quantity over quality.",
    "Professor was very passionate and insightful",
    "I thought it was a great course.",
    "There is way too much information for the course. The TFs were unprepared. The strength is that the topics are relevant and important and lasting, but the course was poorly taught.",
    "This course does a very good job of going through a broad amount of material, especially as it's expected to cover from the pre-colonial era to present day. Additionally, the sections do a very good job in reviewing the information and the readings so that it sticks. Nevertheless, there is a lot of information to cover, and the review materials are comprised of several hundred slides. Therefore, if there was any improvement on the course, it might involve trimming the time period slightly, although the material from the beginning of the course is still very interesting and important.",
    "Professor Rubin was an engaging and entertaining lecturer whose passion for the subject material was contagious. The outlines at the beginning of each slide deck that started halfway through the semester were very helpful",
    "Strengths: Elihu is incredibly, wonderfully passionate about the subject, which makes lecture extremely entertaining and fulfilling to attend. The amount of work was good for the class and let us enjoy the material. We covered a lot of topics decently, even for a lecture. The building research project was actually a lot of fun. Weaknesses: The structure of the class wasn't great. Elihu started doing topic guides at the beginning of lectures about halfway through the semester, but he should have done that from the beginning because it was sometimes hard to follow the narrative arc he was trying to convey. Sections were hit or miss--I have a couple friends who had really useless ones. Sometimes there was just too much material, and the slides for the final were absolutely ridiculous (there should have been 50-100 slides that we learned in depth).",
    "The lectures in this course were great engaging, cohesive, and interesting.",
    "Elihu is great!",
    "The course does what it offers: it introduces the American Architecture and Urbanism, so with that it's already a full marks for the course. The only issue I have is that I feel the course flows very similarly to Vincent Scully's stream of consciousness, and it's hard to follow the topics logically. I don't mean it's hard to understand the topics, but just hard to understand the flow of the themes. I think Professor Rubin did realise this after a few students pointed out to him mid-semester that lectures do not quite follow a logic as well (yes, it follows a theme) and tries to show the logic of the lecture, but frankly after taking all 20+ lectures sometimes the logical structure still eludes me.",
    "Assignments were tedious and unhelpful. The paper assignment exemplified the fact that this class was, in general, too large in scope. Lots of really interesting materials and although I wish there were some way it could all be taught, there needs to be more organization\/focus.",
    "I wish there were more clear explanations of what characteristics make up each type of architecture because I found myself looking up a bunch of this information on my own.",
    "I feel that, although Elihu likely didn't do this as an incentive to make students come to class, if the lectures slides were posted such that the students could download them beforehand and take notes on them during class, it would be beneficial. The slides are mainly pictures with some subtitles, so just looking at them without attending the class would lack any annotation required to understand the significance of the image or the content of the course.",
    "The course contained a lot of fascinating material and was taught in a really engaging way. At the same time, the structure of the course could feel somewhat jumbled at times since it contained so much information.",
    "The instructor (and my teaching fellow) were absolutely wonderful and were definitely the greatest strengths of the course. I also enjoyed the field assignments greatly. Perhaps a final paper would be more fitting than a final exam, but I was totally fine taking the test.",
    "The strengths of this course are its simultaneous breadth and depth, as we explored cities across the US, but also analyzed singular buildings in great detail. I liked that we looked at buildings that seemed prosaic, but actually had a rich history and important place in the community. The weakness of the course was that there was so much content that it was difficult to know what we were expected to take from the lectures. I think that if unifying ideas could be outlined more clearly that would help students feel more confident for the final and study in a more productive manner. It felt like we were given a lot of information to memorize, but understanding underlying trends and tensions and similarities between similar ideologies was what was really important.",
    "The lectures were fantastic!!! Professor Rubin is incredibly engaging! There could be a little bit more attention paid to the sections, as there was a big disparity in the quality and difficulty of the sections. I also found the rubric and grading of the assignments to be vague and confusing.",
    "I'd say the strength is the assignments; besides weekly comments on the readings, we only had to do a profile on a building in New Haven and a research paper that could relate to literally any theme we had covered in the class. The first assignment got me to visit the Department of Records to obtain information on the building I was assigned, and it kind of blew my mind how much information the city has documented on the most innocuous of buildings. I also loved the freedom of the second assignment. I think the class is great at making the world of architecture accessible to people like me who have never had any exposure to it at all. This might be part of the weakness of the course though, which is that we cover such a wide swathe of history (basically colonial era until today) that we aren't really able to go too in depth into any era.",
    "The course is very interesting from a materials perspective, and Professor Rubin is clearly a very nice man (and was great when he lead my section!) However, I found Professor Rubin very difficult to follow and his lecture style somewhat distracting. He spoke in a way that sometimes confused me and other students in the class and made it difficult for us to understand his point. This was not true in section setting, but in lecture I found it very difficult to pay attention. The same was true of many of the readings assigned. Scully, in particular, was very inaccessible to me and many peers I spoke with.",
    "Elihu is a fantastic Professor and the structure of the course was very good. Some lectures felt scattered because Elihu fell behind and tried to cram too many themes into one 50-minute lecture but otherwise, a fantastic course.",
    "I thought this course was strong in that it presented interesting information that one can apply to their everyday life. I thought that it was weak in that the lectures were a little confusing to follow at times.",
    "The course is a nice overview of a topic that most people don't learn about, and so I have no regrets about taking it in that regard. This class has a very low workload, and I think that the 2 projects that we did have could have bee organized to facilitate learning more related to the class a bit better. I don't feel that I got much out of either, but I did get a lot out of the class when I had to study for the exam and the ideas started stitching themselves together in a way that made sense. Lectures were scattered and not necessarily on track with the syllabus.",
    "The strength of the class lies in Professor Rubin's knowledge of the subject and passion for architecture. I enjoyed the visual focus: the way Rubin used images to illustrate every point. However, it would be more helpful for there to be a bit more text in the lecture slides, primarily for greater ease of note-taking. Sometimes it was challenging to put into one's own words what the building or map represented, and it would have been nice to have Rubin's description below. The \"researching a building\" assignment was also a major strength, as it was a completely unique experience that ended up being rewarding. Something that could be improved is the structure early on in the course, as it could seem choppy at times and hard to follow the narrative.",
    "Great material, needs more focus. Could benefit from having intensive and non-intensive sections.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is Professor Rubin. His vast knowledge, passion for the material, and dedication to the course really benefitted students and allowed students to both enjoy and learn from lectures. Beyond simply imparting knowledge, Professor Rubin ensures that the course encourages students to think critically about the landscapes and structures they encounter. Another strength of the course is its ability to cover such a wide range of time periods, giving a broad perspective on American architecture and urbanism. One way to improve the course would be to take time during discussion sections for teaching fellows to review what we have learned in lecture, emphasize some of the most salient themes, architects, and buildings, and connect the lecture material into a broader narrative. This would allow students to further benefit from the expertise of the teaching fellows, even if it means taking time away from discussing the readings. Another potential suggestion would be to take time during lectures to provide a succinct definition or list of defining features each time a new architectural style is introduced, as having these definitions would be especially helpful for students coming from varied backgrounds, although it is very helpful that Professor Rubin does make a concerted effort to make the material accessible to all.",
    "This course was a great survey course into American architecture and urban history, and Professor Rubin is definitely a very passionate professor who cares deeply about the subject at hand. However, it seemed scattered at many points of the semester--there was too much material covered in such a brief amount of time, and it was hard to pinpoint the key themes of the course as the course jumped around chronologically. I would suggest less buildings covered and identified, in exchange for more depth surrounding each building, and its social history.",
    "The course is very well organized. Each lecture is clearly outlined through Professor Rubin's presentations and reflective of our weekly readings, which makes it much easier to connect concepts across lectures and allows students to take away much more from the course.",
    "The examples and constant flow of case studies were so incredibly helpful to understand all the themes. I think I would've taken one class or part of a class both before the midway point and the final to break down trends by decades just so the time table was super clear when discussing each movement \/ idea",
    "The lecture was interesting and section was nice. The final and papers were really fair. The readings were too long and many didn't do them.",
    "Strength: connections w urbanism Weakness: order of lectures",
    "STRENGTHS: Professor Rubin's exquisite lectures; meticulously arranged slideshows; mood lighting courtesy of the YUAG auditorium; a really thoughtful assignment to catalog a building on the NHBA. WEAKNESSES: the sections are hit-or-miss.",
    "Strengths are section, weaknesses are readings not lining up with lectures",
    "pretty interesting content, but lectures could be pretty repetitive and boring at times. Prof Rubin used very flowery and long-winded language that made him sometimes hard to follow. also readings weren't always super relevant. would be great if Prof Rubin gave out more info on the final exam ahead of time, I think that stressed a lot of people out even though it didn't end up being that hard.",
    "This course was strong because the professor understand that, because this is a survey course, there would be a lot of material to cover and that he would need to be flexible with how much information he expected us to retain\/understand completely. This course could be improved by being a little more rigorous in expectations. I appreciate how much flexibility there was with grading and assignments, but I really wish there was more structure to ensure that I completed this course learning what the professor believed I had to learn to really understand U.S. architecture and urbanism.",
    "Great material and excellent 5th class.",
    "This course was very strong and enjoyable with very few weaknesses. Preparation for the final examination was a little more stressful since there were so many elements to memorize.",
    "The slides had only images which made it harder to figure out the main point or theme",
    "This course presents a tremendous amount of information about architecture and urbanism in the United States. I would have preferred learning about fewer buildings and talking a little more about the stylistic choices of certain architects. For students outside of the architecture major, I think parsing the stylistic elements was a little tricky and it would have been helpful to go over those a little more. I really enjoyed the building archive assignment and the opportunity to right about something I was interested in the second paper.",
    "Strengths would be professor rubins vast knowledge and a weakness would be the class being too large in size.",
    "Rubin's lectures are the best part of the course. He is a fantastic speaker and really enthusiastic about the subject material. At the same time, he's a very approachable person. He actually listens to student feedback during the course, even altering his lecture-style to improve legibility (a request put in by a friend of mine). The assignments can be a lot of fun as well. The class was very large, and that was unexpected, but other than that it was great.",
    "This class was completely disorganized and nobody had any idea what he was supposed to be learning all semester.",
    "Talk slower please elihu!!!!",
    "I loved the lectures that Professor Rubin gave. Sometimes the slides were a little hard to follow, but overall I love his lecture style. I think the assignments in the course were also really engaging and fair at the same time.",
    "The lectures were engaging; however, in the first part of the course, they lacked structure and seemed repetitive.",
    "This course is very strong. The themes are very important (especially as they relate to inequality and class), and the lectures were very engaging. I think the course could benefit from a bit more structure - perhaps a class goal for every lecture. The assignments were definitely a strength in the course, as they provided students the opportunity to explore things they were truly interested in.",
    "Lectures were quite engaging, especially given their very broad scope. It would be helpful to have lecture powerpoints posted after class for those of us who want to study as we go along through the semester. The assignments were unique and interesting to complete--the building history project was my favorite. The class did what it set out to do I believe--make me look at the urban fabric of our country with new appreciation.",
    "I felt that the class was fairly disorganized and there wasn't a clear sense of what exactly we were supposed to be learning. This wasn't a problem for most of the semester, but it made studying for the final incredibly difficult.",
    "I found it very difficult to understand the point of readings and various tangents in lecture. Maybe it's a common feature of Architecture, but I found the very flowery, symbolic language used to describe everything made it very difficult to understand the actual history that was happening. I didn't feel like there was clear consequence to anything that was discussed in this class, it just seemed like things were arbitrarily connected without a real analysis of how history played out.",
    "I think the New Haven Building Archive project is a really valuable learning tool, and it feels rewarding to contribute to the NHBA database, which is an outstanding public resource for researching New Haven. Elihu's lecture style helped me think and see as an architect. However, for students unfamiliar with architecture, it would have been helpful if Elihu pared down the individual buildings discussed during some of the lessons and took more time to describe the significant components of architectural theories and movements.",
    "I enjoyed viewing all of the slides. I wish we were able to compile terms into a clearer form somehow.",
    "I think the lectures were really interesting. It was easy to distinguish the broad themes, and I really enjoyed learning about it generally. I don't think Slide ID was the proper format for the final. It probably would have been better as a final essay exam because Prof. Rubin gave vague, countless slides to study from which I don't think was particularly effective. This is not a very specific class and I think it needs to be decided if Prof. Rubin wants to run it as an art history type course or not. Once that decision has been made I believe the format will be way more streamlined. I also think because Prof. Rubin expected the class to be a lot smaller it wasn't organized as efficiently. The TA's and sections came together kind of hastily and I don't think the teaching team was as prepared as they could have been.",
    "Lectures could be longer! It often felt as if each lecture was steadily going by until the last 5 minutes when it was a whirlwind of information. Some more time to digest would be helpful.",
    "The lectures were incredible. However a bit difficult to follow along for note taking purposes, but really still great.",
    "I think this course could be improved by employing an explicit racial lens, that examines other questions such as ethnicity, class and gender as well, in looking at the development of American architecture and urbanism. As race and racism drove the way urban spaces in the America were created, grew and were subsequently governed I would love to see this course embrace these realities. I appreciated and it was a strength of the course that it touched on these issues, but I think it would be valuable for such a big lecture course to focus on these realities very explicitly so as to engage a wide range of students in understanding the racialized realities of American urbanism, as it can explain so much of the United States current situation in general.",
    "Very interesting, but the readings could be a bit mundane."

    "I would take this course again, but I would go in with some clear expectations. It isn't difficult, it isn't well organized, and it isn't going to dramatically change your understanding of architecture or the urban environment. It does provide some interesting context and the course assignments are better than other lecture course essays, etc. On the whole, it's a good fifth class.",
    "Yes Elihu is an awesome lecturer and very engaging and loves teaching",
    "Absolutely-- Rubin is a must see!!!",
    "adscxljjeadnz",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would recommend this course because it gets you thinking about ideas and visual history in ways that I never thought of before.",
    "nope.",
    "definitely recommend. it is a very different type of class that makes you learn and think in a different way. you really view the world around you in a different way and this was the best class I took all year.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course as a great Credit\/D option for students looking to try a class in Architecture\/Art History! I think that since there was so much material for the final it would have been stressful to take the class for a grade because I would've felt pressured to memorize a TON of material in a short period of time.",
    "Absolutely! The context of urbanization and architecture was a very an interesting way to learn about American history.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless the person they are thinking about majoring in architecture.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in architecture this course is a good way to get an overview of the history of architectural development in the United States. it also promotes a more conscious thinking of the built environment.",
    "Yes! Professor Rubin is a gem and you'll never look at a streetscape the same way again.",
    "Take this course! Professor Rubin is a gem.",
    "Yes but only if they have a architectural background because Elihu was a great teacher for those that knew what he was talking about but for those who didn't understand from day one what he was exactly trying to teach us, it more or less stayed the same",
    "I believe so! It's a really great way of getting a solid and comprehensive understanding of American Architecture, the big names of architects, and a working understanding of the context for modern day designers.",
    "Good fifth class. Lectures were a bit repetitive but overall I gained an appreciation for the \"built environment\" and learned a bit about architectural history.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course, especially if you actually hope to learn about architecture. Though we looked at a lot of interesting material, the lack of student engagement and the lack of a structured way to learn about architecture made it really, really difficult to get anything from the course, especially if you've taken any American Studies\/history courses. Professor Rubin is, however, an engaging lecturer, and I appreciate all the effort he put into the course I just wish we'd learned more structured things.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. You don't have to be that interested in architecture because Elihu will reel you in and make you love it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Rubin is fantastic and delivers amazing lectures.",
    "Yes!! Most definitely would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I think its great for anyone looking to greater understand urban development.",
    "yes! learn about buildings! so much fun. such fun.",
    "yes! Not stressful at all, learned some cool things. Lectures were very interesting when I payed attention",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. This class was engaging and interesting enough to sit through lecture each day.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. It is pretty easy and fun throughout the semester, but the exam is a little intimidating because we had like 800 slides to study.",
    "yes",
    "Highly recommend. The information addresses how American cities form and change overtime. It covers a variety of subjects within this topic, and it is super interesting to see the progression from Teotihuacan to modern day starchitecture. Even if you're not interested in architecture, this class doesn't so much focus on architectural details, but on the influence of them and the greater social, political, and economical impact they have, both locally and nationally. Plus, overall good vibes from the students who end up taking this class.",
    "I would recommend it. This course is a comprehensive overview of the history of the American built environment. It seems to lean more heavily on urban forms than on particular buildings, although I do feel like I have a sense of the \"greats.\" This is a good class for people with no experience or with a lot. I have a thorough architectural background, but I've found that other courses are mostly ancient or totally modern, and European, not so much American and not so much 18th\/19th century. I enjoyed it. One of the projects was to research a New Haven building, which I loved because it involved primary source research. The second paper is a typical research\/analytical paper, but it's short and easy. It gives a lot of opportunity to pursue something that piques your interest during the lectures.",
    "This class was a fun introduction to urbanism and a great exploration of American architectural history.",
    "I would not recommend it. If you have a deep interest in architecture, it might be for you. I came in unsure about the topic, and found myself completely unengaged with the material. Everything felt muddled.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the ways that U.S. culture and policy have intersected to produce our built environment. As a history major, this was a useful perspective to gain. Professor Rubin obviously cares a lot about his students, but note that it's he's sometimes hard to follow in lecture because of the convoluted way that he speaks (and because he inserts his opinions into much of the discussion). That being said, I'd take this course again and am looking forward to taking another lecture with Rubin before I graduate.",
    "Yes! This was my second class with Elihu, after New Haven and the American City. As a STEM student, Elihu and his lecture style have been a refreshing change from my pset classes.",
    "YESSSSSS definitely one of the most interesting courses I have taken here at Yale. The lecture is super engaging and the material is really cool stuff.",
    "I would recommend this if you want a survey of basic architecture types and urban planning trends. Gives an insight into US history through buildings and city planning. Not too much work, accessible even for non-architecture people, engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is looking for a humanities credit. Professor Rubin is a great instructor and the course is very interesting.",
    "Not really",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student interested in architecture and urban history. It is a very enjoyable class, lectures are engaging, the readings are interesting, and it is very easy to make connections between lecture and real-life experiences. I am glad I took this class over Biology.",
    "No.",
    "yes",
    "No. Elihu lectures in a disorganized manner through 26 lectures and then tests you on 12 of 700 slide identifications.",
    "Yes its awesome and you look at new haven in a better way after since you appreciate architecture",
    "Deez nutz",
    "Definitely!",
    "Must take at Yale, Professor Rubin is an incredibly poetic and good lecturer. Youll learn to appreciate the world in so many new ways.",
    "Yeah. You should learn about architecture, it's fun.",
    "Yes. This is an excellent course and I would highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in architecture. Rubin is an engaging lecturer -- going to lecture is like attending a TED talk. The requirements are quite manageable (although readings are long but do yalie's ever do their readings...)",
    "Yes totally. I think the course will get better with time also.",
    "Yes I would, I enjoyed it a lot",
    "Yes, amazing, super chill",
    "Enjoyable",
    "Yes! I thought this was a very informative and interesting historical survey of American architectural and urban patterns - the readings were mostly approachable no matter what your background in the subject is, and Elihu is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "This class gives an overview of the different architectural movements throughout American history. It does not go into great depth about anything, however, which can be frustrating, and make it feel like you are not actually learning anything.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class gives you a set of knowledge that I have found to be so applicable in my everyday life. It helps you gain the ability to understand your surroundings at a deeper level and gives you an appreciation for the urban fabric that makes up the United States. Elihu is one of Yale's best lecturers and truly projects his passion into his lectures. This class is so worthwhile and enjoyable throughout.",
    "Yes! Professor Ruben is a fantastic lecturer, and the project will open your eyes to the complex history of New Haven.",
    "Yes, it's a class that is useful and often times surprising in content. The class is taught enthusiastically by Professor Rubin and all the TAs are devoted to making sure you understand the material.",
    "Yes, but make sure it's right for you, because the teaching style is a little different.",
    "Yeah its a great CR\/D or even normal grade - youll learn a lot and the assignments are so minimal. Elihu is great. Take it with a friend.",
    "yes learned a lot, not trying to trick you on assignments.",
    "This is a fun course that does what it says on the tin, so sure, take it and you'll enjoy it!",
    "Yes, great lectures and interesting material. Good credit\/d class to take with a friend.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for a super hard final-800 images and you were supposed to know the name and architect and year. Otherwise, low work commitment throughout the year -1 assignment, 1 paper, section, and a final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. I thought it was a really interesting course that I will continue to use the knowledge from. You learned about architecture, history, social justice, and more, and all of it has affected the way I interact with cities and buildings.",
    "A good, relatively chill class with assignments that are legitimately enjoyable (as a non ARCH\/HSAR student). It involves you contributing to the New Haven Buildings Archive, so your assignments actually matter somewhat!",
    "Yes I thought it was fun to learn about the built environment around me.",
    "Yes yes yes. I love this class with all my heart. I was excited to attend lecture every day and my TA was the sweetest person imaginable. Take this class.",
    "Take this class if you are considering majoring in architecture or if you want a very thorough, detailed background in American architectural history. Lectures are engaging and interesting, but the readings are long and dense. This is a survey course, but you dive into detail at each juncture. The workload is fine: weekly reading responses, two short research papers, and a final exam- but there is a lot of material being thrown at you and it can be hard to absorb. Professor Rubin is fantastic, however, and he has so much knowledge to offer about New Haven, urban planning, Yale's campus, and patterns of development across the country.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an introduction to urbanism and design. Even though it is advertised as an architecture course, the material of this class is much more generalized than I had anticipated. It explores entire architectural movements from a historical perspective, rather than focusing intently on particular buildings, architects, and introductory vocabulary. I found the amount of material covered in the semester to be a little ambitious, but Professor Rubin is a very passionate lecturer and I am much more aware of the context of my own surroundings, especially in New Haven.",
    "Absolutely!!!",
    "Yes definitley",
    "Yes but only if interested in architecture.",
    "The topic is interesting, but the course is poorly taught. Professor Rubin takes himself way too seriously and ultimately it gets in the way of him teaching the course in an interesting and relatable way.",
    "If you want to take a fun course that is well-taught and is interesting, I would opt to take American Architecture & Urbanism. Prof. Rubin has a very interesting (and at times verbose) lecture style, but it's fun and makes the course more interesting than prepping for slide comparisons. In addition, he is able to integrate the buildings of New Haven into the curriculum, which makes it more personable and identifiable as the semester goes on. Overall, I really enjoyed the course, and was one of my favorite lectures that I have had here.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Rubin was engaging and accessible and the topics covered were fascinating.",
    "Take if youre at all interested in urban patterns or architecture in the US. You learn what it sounds like you learn.",
    "I would recommend this course under the assumption that it will continue to improve as Elihu continues to teach it. The material is fascinating and it's a fun fifth class to take.",
    "This course is a great way to begin understanding the buildings around us in America. This course is great for people who aren't even majoring in the areas it is listed in because the information is so interesting and important.",
    "Yes! Its so fun and you learn about relevant information",
    "Yes, for anyone who is interested in American Architecture and architectural history, this course delivers what it says it would deliver.",
    "Yes, the content is interesting but be wary of disorganized lectures and odd assignments.",
    "I loved this class!! Elihu is an incredibly talented and knowledgeable professor and I actually looked forward to listening to his lectures twice a week. I also really enjoyed the two (relatively short) papers because it gave me an opportunity to engage more in the architecture of both New Haven and my hometown. Sometimes the lectures can feel directionless or too abstract, but they way Elihu speaks is a treat in and of itself.",
    "Yes, I feel like, as a stem major, this course was a good option for me to emerge into the studies in the humanities. Also, it causes me to go about my daily life and observe the world with a more analytical eye.",
    "Yes! Super interesting, will chanfe the way you perceive the world around you",
    "Without a doubt. Great class and a convenient time and location. It was directly related to my major's concentration and academic interests, so it really could not be much better. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is very cross-disciplinary and teaches you to look at the built environment in a different way. The assignments are fun and very doable, the readings are interesting, and the lectures are engaging.",
    "YES! You will not regret it! Very engaging lectures and topics covered, useful for everyone of any major or discipline. The two assignments are not too difficult but can be really interesting depending on what you make of it.",
    "The best word I could use to describe this course is \"fun.\" It was perfect for me because I wanted a class that didn't have a heavy workload where I would still learn some interesting things about the world around me, but it probably wouldn't feel fulfilling for a student looking for something more in depth.",
    "It is interesting material, and not a bad choice if you're an ARCH or AMST major. Otherwise I think there are better courses to take.",
    "Absolutely. Enjoyable assignments, great lectures with a humorous and lovable professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. This is a great introduction to learning about real-life things (buildings, cities, etc.) that we come across on a daily basis.",
    "Yes, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. The lecture is just slides with buildings and Professor Rubin's commentary about their appearance. I thought that he would talk more about the readings which were typically more interesting than what was going on in class because they covered the investors that made buildings possible, the role politics played in architecture, etc. It was not necessary to go to lecture to do well\/understand the material in this class. Just do the readings and go to section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those who (like me) have little experience with architecture. The class seems like it would not be of particular use to those who have taken many other architecture classes, as it is a broad overview of American architectural history. However, for those without experience it is a fun and interesting class in that teaches you a lot. I truly walked away from the class looking at buildings in a different light.",
    "Yesit's a solid survey course that guides you through a large breadth of ideas\/movements\/examples in American architectural history. Not the greatest class you'll ever take, but a good course that I'm happy I took.",
    "Great class if you do all the readings and have a good section.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially a student in Architecture, Art History, or American Studies interested in learning about the built environment and cities throughout American history. The course provides a broad overview of building types, urban planning, and architecture, and it not only helps students interpret the built environment around them, but it also encourages them to think critically about their surroundings. Professor Rubin makes a conscious effort to make the material accessible to students from different backgrounds, and his passion about the material is contagious.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it was very interesting and fun. The topics discussed in the course are different and interesting in their own way.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student for its subject matter, and for Professor Rubin, who is a great and passionate professor, but would recommend it wholeheartedly if it were taught in a different way. There was just so much material covered that what we learned seemed very surface-level. At the end, we had about 600 buildings up for IDs, and none of them were covered in extreme detail. Furthermore, we never had a clear definition of fundamental architecture terms. For those approaching the course with no art history or architecture background whatsoever, this made the course very difficult to follow at times. I would like to see this course offered in the future with a more streamlined and clearly defined agenda per lecture, as well as a reduction in the number of buildings covered (with an increase in the quality and depth of information given surrounding these buildings).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I took the course with the intention of trying something new, and the course ended up being my favorite one of this semester. I learned a lot in the course, and I am now interested in looking into other American Studies or Architecture courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to those looking for an insightful survey. It spans so much time but Professor Rubin and the final ensure that you keep up with all the information in a not overburdensome way",
    "This was a very solid introductory architecture course. Lectures were engaging, the material was interesting, not too much work on a weekly basis. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "If they like architecture",
    "YES. The readings can be slightly dry at times, but they're 100% worth the opportunity to sit in on Professor Rubin's magnificent lectures. He entwines aesthetics and social histories with so much responsibility and sensitivity.",
    "I would recommend it because it was a more unique topic I did not have much prior knowledge about",
    "If you're interested in architecture and American history, then yes, but it's not an amazing intro to the subject for people who aren't.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course because not only do you learn a lot of really really interesting material, but you also experience a course that is not graded very roughly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches us to walk through a city and to observe the environment around us in a whole new and thrilling way.",
    "The lectures were incredibly interesting and the professor was very engaging. I would recommend it to nearly anyone.",
    "Yes Im personally not into architecture but it was fascinating to learn how important buildings can be to the streetscape and larger geography",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it gives you a broad look at the progression of architecture and urbanism in this country. You get a lot of exposure to different styles and ideas. The workload of this course is fairly light as well, even though you still learn a lot.",
    "yes if youre interested in this kind of thing.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It provides a whole new perspective on the built environment and is well worth taking, even just to be able to attend Rubin's lectures.",
    "Absolutely not. My least favorite course I've taken.",
    "No it's so confusing",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Rubin is a great lecturer and the topics are engaging and were all new to me.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking an enjoyable introduction to American architectural history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course really helped me to understand the urban and suburban landscapes that I interact with, and I walk through a city completely differently after this course.",
    "Yes! Professor Rubin is a wonderful lecturer and everyone will be interested in this material.",
    "Yes!! Lectures were great, and there was not much coursework. Readings were good but unnecessary. Grading was generous. Material was fascinating, and it made me appreciate the urban environments I inhabit in a new way.",
    "If you really like architecture and enjoy flowery, fluffy descriptions of buildings this is your class. But if you're looking for a history of architecture or anything concrete, I would dodge this course.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is an engaging survey of American architectural history that will help you view the built environment more knowledgeably and attentively. The two projects are self-driven and provide a chance to learn more about New Haven. If you don't get the chance to do the reading thoroughly, the threads presented in the lectures will be hard to follow at times.",
    "Yes, it is provides a good overview.",
    "I think this would be a great fifth class. It's interesting, but you don't necessarily have to pay complete attention during the lectures. The workload isn't bad, and it's really fun to be able to choose the architectural topics and buildings that you want to work with. The final wasn't too hard but it wasn't explained very well, which was difficult to work with so be sure to go to the review sessions.",
    "Yes. Professor Rubin is a great lecturer and passionate about what he teaches. I had little interest in architecture before enrolling but this class really made me interested in so many aspects of architecture.",
    "Yes! Professor Rubin is a wonderful lecturer and the material is incredibly engaging.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is super interesting, a great lecture, not very hard, fairly graded, and extremely relevant to every day life. Overall a wonderful experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in either American architecture or urbanism. I learned a lot in a big lecture course, and did not find the course to be particularly challenging. For someone looking for a less challenging lecture who has any interest in these topics, this course would be interesting to take, particularly if taken with a conscious and critical understanding of the way forces such as race and class have shaped American architecture and urbanism."
