   "comments": [
    "This class teaches a ridiculous amount of ways to evaluate integrals.",
    "I developed a much more solidified understanding of integral calculus. From the fundamental theorem of calculus to convergence and divergence to volumes of revolution I really improved my understanding of these subjects.",
    "Learned calculus 2",
    "i learned integrals, convergence of series, and some geometry with calculus. I'm not great at math and I really had to work hard in this class, but I think I got better and confronting challenging material and did learn new math skills. also I learned to solve new problems on tests even if they looked nothing like what i had practiced, which has helped me use what i know in new contexts to solve problems.",
    "calc",
    "I learned many fundamental calculus concepts.",
    "I developed a firm foundation in single-variate calculus, on topics such as integration, convergence\/divergence of series, and polar functions. I also learned a lot about mathematical thinking and problem-solving processes.",
    "Calculus and its applications",
    "How to deal with sequences and series.",
    "I learned calculus concepts",
    "I learned about riemann sums, definite and indefinite integrals, the fundamental theorem of calculus, techniques for evaluating and estimating integrals, determining sequence convergence, power and Taylor series with applications, how to calculate the volume of 3D shapes, and how to represent functions in parametric and polar coordinates. The biggest takeaway was understanding how integrals relate to derivatives and area, and how this in turn relates to representing any function as a polynomial through Taylor series.",
    "This course was a good continuation in Calculus. The concepts were connected to the real world in very concrete ways while still ensuring that students were learning different theories. This course was all about using different strategies and there was a great emphasis on understanding the different solutions in order to implement them correctly.",
    "The material was properly explained and the instruction was good",
    "I learned how to figure out whether integrals were convergent or divergent, as well as analyzing polar equations.",
    "Calculus II, but also I feel like I gained a much better intuition of the material than in high school.",
    "I learned how to integrate, find whether series were convergent or divergent, find McLaurin series, and find volumes of rotation.",
    "I did not have enough exposure to mathematics before and this course helped me a lot with my skills.",
    "Better understanding and foundation for calculus",
    "Integrations rules and shortcuts, how to determine whether a sequence\/series converges or diverges, Taylor approximations, power series, parametric equations, finding volume of some objects, and a little work with polar coordinates",
    "A better understanding of processes for integration and series convergence tests, as well as parametric equations and polar curves.",
    "This course developed my understanding of the foundations of calculus.",
    "I worked on my calculus skills in terms of different applications.",
    "I had already taken Calc BC in high school, but missed 6 weeks of the course due to a concussion, so I felt that taking Math 115 was the proper course of action. And I was right! I've generally been a fine math student, and have been able to get through by working hard at it. This class actually took me a step further, and helped me develop intuition for the tactics instead of just rote-learning how to do them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The placement test within the math department should be taken more seriously, so that the pace of the course adjusts for students who are actually trying to learn the material.",
    "Strengths: I like the online homework Weaknesses: More office hours would be greatly appreciated.",
    "One of the difficult things about this class is that many of the students come in already having a Calculus BC or higher math background, which means that those who have only taken Calculus AB have a much harder time in the course and its pace.",
    "its really hard to sit through a 75 minute math lecture twice a week, although clearly the course makers have tried to design ways to break up the class period and engage students by asking math poll questions etc, so this was good. I will say that the explorations were never helpful and just felt like a tedious task every time, so either having fewer of those or replacing them with something else (maybe a quick math video or intro a topic) would be better. the homework towards the end of the class felt very manageable, but earlier assignments were so long and had way too many problems that felt redundant. i like that there is a lot of help available for this class.",
    "Strengths are the structure",
    "My instructor was very thorough and clear with his teaching, and offered a lot of office hour times!",
    "Amazingly designed",
    "My instructor was the biggest strength of this course. However, much of the class had taken BC before, which was tough for everyone else.",
    "The course was great!",
    "This course was great. I have no complaints",
    "Strengths: class engagement, subjects build on eachother, explorations are very useful Weaknesses: not sufficiently in-depth on certain topics, lacking examples of real-world applications",
    "Guidance as to what resources you need to use specifically",
    "The teacher is eager to help people, and his office hours are extremely helpful. I would suggest that he talk a bit louder.",
    "Strengths: Definitely Brett Smith, my instructor. I already had some exposure to the material in high school, but Brett explained things in such a way that I truly grasped things. Also, online P-sets were nice. Weaknesses: Online notes weren't really helpful at all, so I really had to take good notes or class. Also, peer tutors seemed pretty pointless, weren't too helpful.",
    "I learned how to methodically approach an exam or problem set",
    "Weakness was timing of assignments and having to do lots of homework before we learned material and the online was not helpful. Strength was Brett was a great teacher",
    "Strengths: probably prepared me well for Math 120 aka multivariable Weaknesses: the problems in class were way too easy; once the problem sets and tests came around, the questions were much more difficult, and class work and discussions weren't helpful. It almost seemed like they taught you the basics of everything, and then threw in special cases as trick questions on exams without explaining them. Also, the explorations were easy, but annoying; it's easy to forget to do one once and a while, and sometimes they don't make much sense",
    "One weakness of this course was there was not a lot of resources to help struggling students.",
    "Strengths are that material was explained well by the instructor and I had a lot of practice. Additionally, the professor was very accessible for help and information.",
    "It was a very strong class overall. I really enjoyed it, the problem sets were manageable, I really liked my professor. My only negative comment is regarding the review sessions for the final exam. There was one session led by someone -- I'm not sure if he was a young professor or a TF -- but he gave us questions that were significantly more challenging than what could be expected of us, then did a poor job explaining them. We would ask questions that he couldn't quite explain well either, which overall did not leave a good feeling for anyone going into the final exam."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Unless it is required for your major, no. It starts off easy but gets harder. It's incredibly difficult to learn complex new material in a fast-paced setting in which the professor is writing on the board and not providing explanatory slides or presentations. The classes do not adequately prepare you for the p-sets or exams. Office hours are crowded. This course was easy for the first few months when it covered topics I was familiar with, but quickly became a great cognitive burden after that.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is needed for a major or you have a passion for integration. The course requires several hours each week to do okay and a true commitment (or prior knowledge) to succeed.",
    "Yes. Especially if you are a stem major, I would highly recommend taking this course. You develop a very firm grasp of the fundamentals you will use in higher-level stem classes if you take this course.",
    "I would caution a student that this class is quite difficult without prior calculus 2 experience",
    "i would highly recommend brett smith as a prof, and maybe to students who enjoy math i would recommend this class, but I would personally never take this particular class again if I had the option. Solving problems can feel really rewarding, but more often than not this class was boring and hard to me.",
    "Yes if they enjoy math",
    "Yes, I think, in particular, my instructor was good at explaining concepts and really cared for his students success in calculus!",
    "Yesss!!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes I would. It's a good class though my instructor was a big part of my enjoyment of the class.",
    "Yes, and would especially recommend taking it with Brett Smith. Although it might be boring to many (due to lack of real-world applications in the course itself), it serves as a foundation for a very fascinating area of mathematics.",
    "If you need to take a math class, this is a challenging and engaging one.",
    "Yes, this course was very educational and important for any student interested in continuing their path in mathematics.",
    "yes it is a good introductory math course",
    "I would recommend the course; it is a great bridge between high school calculus and higher-level calculus.",
    "Yes! However, also keep in mind my background and everyone elses--it will vary a lot from person to person. I have never been a math guy and struggled taking calculus in high school, yet also took BC, so this class was essentially review. For me, this was a perfect refresher and solidified the concepts that I failed to grasp in high school. I can't speak for everyone though, especially those who were learning everything for the first time of course. In any case, the class was well organized and exams were absolutely fair, plenty of study resources. Also try to get Brett Smith if you can as instructor.",
    "Yes.",
    "It is a very good opportunity to improve math skills",
    "Only if you need to take 115 in order to take another class. There is no reason to take 115 just to \"knock out a QR credit.\" It's a fine course, just annoying sometimes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students.",
    "Yes, I feel like I learned a lot and it was beneficial to my Yale experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. My professor, Brett, was really great, and this is a core course for anyone who wants to go into any STEM field."
