    "The course really forces you to think about writing in a way that many freshmen have not before. The process is hard, but you come out of it with a much more critical eye. Professor Klemann really works hard to make sure that all her students get the help that they need!",
    "I liked the small classroom setting the course gave. However, we could do some more excursions to the libraries present at Yale because I found those to be very useful."
