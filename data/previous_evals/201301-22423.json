   "comments": [
    "I think it's a great class for people who want to wrap up single variable calculus.",
    "Great math class that covers a lot of material. The success in the class really depends on your professor and how you utilize the resources available to you. I would recommend the class, but only if you have some type of interest in mathematics or need it for a requirement.",
    "don't take this class unless you need to its really painful to get through. i never took bc calc but a lot of people said it was kinda different because you could never use your calculator",
    "The course moves pretty quickly through basic calculus; personally I wouldn't take it unless you have to or are really interested in calculus.",
    "Yes, if you need it or if you have a lighter course-load and want a challenge.",
    "Mostly series and volumetric integrals, not very applicable to real life.",
    "It's a class that you're gonna have to take for several majors as a prerequisite, who you have as your section leader makes he difference.",
    "I would recommend Math 115, but I would warn the student to study hard and put effort into the problem sets.",
    "I heard Math 120 is better. I don't think Math 115 is that great a course. I took it after taking AP Calc BC as a junior and then not taking calc for a year as a senior thinking that it would be good review, but it just reminded me of how much I had forgotten. If you still remember your BC Calc, it'll probably be super easy. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it, since it mostly tests you on how well you know how to manipulate numbers (at least on the psets) but then suddenly asks you the concepts behind questions on the tests. I guess go to office hours a lot. I heard Professor Logan is great when it came to setting up office hours for her students. I had Professor Tryniecki, who was also an excellent professor.",
    "Would recommend",
    "It is a very conceptual type of math course now. I recommend it if you're looking for a challenge.",
    "It is a difficult course for someone taking it for the first time. You will be with students who have already seen the material and you have to be ready to devote lots of time to the course.",
    "Math 115 is a very difficult course, and I experienced many challenges. If you are going to take it, I highly recommend Michal Tryniecki or Miriam Logan. They are top notch and will help you if you need it, going above and beyond.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a good course for a solid foundation in calculus.",
    "I would only recommend it if you really enjoyed math or needed to take it. The tests were based on very conceptual themes but the actual work you do in class is more numerically based. Because of that, the tests were very hard and it was also difficult to prepare for them."
