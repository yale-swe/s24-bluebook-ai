    "Question 1 - - fantastic readings. Very well chosen.Question 3 - - I found the commentary assignments to be very helpful in synthesizing the concepts.",
    "I didn't think the structure of this course worked very well. The first half was spent with Professor Dove lecturing, and we broke into smaller discussion groups in the second half. Professor Dove's commentary was good (as were the readings that were selected), but the discussion groups were really not good. They were often poorly facilitated with some student voices dominating the space, the conversation straying very far from the readings (to personal anecdotes), and with it seeming as though many people did not do the reading. I found it hard to be motivated to engage deeply in this class because there was no \"reward\" for having done the reading.",
    "In re: Question 1, I believe this class had some of the most useful readings of any course I've ever taken. I will remember many of them for years, e.g. Himalayan Uncertainty, Anti-Politics Machine, Brosius and Kirsch.",
    "Excellent class. I really enjoyed class\/section dialogue. I really enjoyed writing the final paper.",
    "I believe this is an excellent class to introduce people to Anthropology and Social Ecology themes, however I would suggest adding more recent readings.",

    "Professor Dove's reading choices and his careful, thought-provoking lectures.",

    "I loved Professor's Doves lectures and found the readings very engaging. The discussion half of class was always well run and the student participation was robust and high in quality. The class felt like a wonderful immersive experience.",
    "I learned about the importance of critical thinking and having some social science background.",
    "The readings were good, and I was glad to have read from the canon of anthropology relating to environment and development. Thinking about methodology was also very helpful.",
    "Professor Dove truly changed the way I think about the causes of environmental degradation, indigenous peoples, sustainable development, etc. I am convinced that this class will someday make me a more effective, sensitive, humane, and enlightened conservation practitioner.",
    "The short answer assignments, unlike the final paper, were particularly helpful in forcing a synthesis of the information and were a good learning tool.",
    "The readings were great, as were the lectures. I appreciated that the lectures added new information and didn't just cover what was in the course readings.",
    "Class time interactions and writing reading responses.",
    "Listening to Prof. Dove's voice, James Ferguson's book, and the guest speakers.",
    "The design of the course itself. The readings, Dove's incisive lectures, and the opportunity for group discussion made for an exceptionally well-rounded, engaging, and educational experience.",
    "This class is extremely helpful for working out ideas for summer research project. Student and professor input on research topics are also helpful.",
    "The conceptual material. I explored conservation and development from entirely new perspectives.The disaster readings were my favorite.",
    "professor dove's lectures - his message is well-honed and the material taught is truly a process or a 'method' to problem solving. this seems rare, and incredibly valuable.",
    "The classes and how Prof. Dove leads you to an analytic point of view.",
    "the pasion of te professor and the dialog with other students during the sections.",
    "The lectures and guest lectures",
    "Incredibly challenging and diverse material covered by Prof Dove. Really forces us to question existing paradigms of conservation and development, role of anthropologists, and makes us more critical of everything. Profound and well-prepared analysis by Prof. Dove in his lectures, although too complex sometimes to take good notes on."

   "comments": [
    "The room! It was really hard to pack so many people in that room, and the way it was set up, only about 3 people were actually facing the right direction. The rest of us had trouble seeing and engaging. While a circle is helpful for discussion, the first half of the class was lecture style, and a lecture style set up would have been very helpful.",
    "The paper is too long.",
    "Somehow all the students seemed struggling at the end to complete the paper requirement and integrate it into the themes of the course. Workshops or discussion specifically on paper topics could help.",
    "I really feel the structure of the class (breaking into small groups) does not work. I think it would be interesting to try keeping the entire class together the whole time, and having a discussion that way. I think there should also be a system limiting how much each of the students can talk (if others also want to say something).",
    "Nothing in particular. This probably won't change, but I think it would work better if class met twice a week for 1.5 hours rather than one really long session, as it would aid concentration. Also, I wish there had been more discussion of anthropological methods.",
    "The discussion sections for the second half of the class were painfully too long half of the time.Also, there is absolutely no need for the final paper to be 25-30 pages in length. If this was not a foundations class and more of the students were at the point of writing theses and masters projects, then it might make sense, but the academic timing and level of the course just do not merit this length requirement. Nothing educational is gained from it.",
    "It was great to have guest speakers, but I think I got more out of the discussions that split into 3 sections because we discussed the reading more. The guest speaker discussions could feel like a Q and A section after a lecture, with the topic changing with each question someone asked instead of being fully discussed. I'm not sure how to change the format, but maybe giving commentators a little more guidance for the first guest lectures would help, so that they can ask questions in a way that promotes discussion among the whole class.",
    "More non-development-oriented readings.",
    "Reading discussions after class.",
    "I did not have an issue with the course. The classroom, however, was too small and students that could not fit around the central table had to sit in the windowsills. On the one occasion that I did not arrive early enough to get a chair, I found it difficult to concentrate on the lecture. A bigger space or smaller class size would be more appropriate.",
    "A more variety in readings would help. Too much of a focus on SE Asia and agriculture.",
    "i see no clear space for improvement other than the natural reshuffling of reading materials and guest lectures",
    "Recent readings and bigger classroom.",
    "Sometimes the professor was a little late, and we were starving for knowledge.",
    "The course syllabus needs to be refreshed and build on the material more cohesively. I felt every lecture (including the guest lectures) were sort of like vignettes suspended in their own context, but it was often hard to see how they connected to the rest of the course. Even now, I'm not sure what were the underlying theories or common threads of knowledge\/lessons that we should take with us, and it was difficult to see how everything was connected. It would be great if Prof Dove would emphasize some of the course's main theses (e.g. relations of power and politics underlie environmental problems, moral ecologies, structuring of discourses?) more constantly throughout the course, and make it more explicit how he believes the material fits in, so that we can either accept his interpretation or offer an alternative.Also, the guidelines on the paper need to be available much earlier, by October at the latest. We got them less than 2 weeks before deadline, and Prof. Dove has exacting specifications and requirements for the paper (e.g. position of page numbers, table of contents, formatting, bibliography).Prof. Dove and TA's should help push the discussions more; the commentators did a good job, but if we are missing something or covering tangents too much, they should feel free to push us back to the material."

    "Professor Dove's office hours are highly sought-after and hard to plan on, given the fact that you can't sign up before noon of that day. A sign up sheet earlier or some other system might work better.",
    "The quality of help I received from both Pr. Dove and the TAs was excellent, though getting a spot at the professor's office hour required substantial effort.",
    "Excellent. The TA's were particularly accessible and great teachers. Professor Dove was also wonderful and a joy to learn from, though his busy office hours made him less accessible.",
    "I met with the instructor during his lab hours.",
    "The availability of the professor was very low... this was disappointing. The quality was good, though the quality was limited by the time (15 minutes per week, even as an advisee).",
    "I sought both Professor Dove and the TAs for help, and both were very useful. Professor Dove can be hard to get ahold of - if you're not camped out by his office when the office hours sign-up sheet is posted, you can pretty much forget about gaining an audience. Still, when I was able to access him, he was helpful, as were the TAs.",
    "Holding office hours one day a week in the late evening is not sufficient. Also, only allowing people to sign up via a sheet posted at noon on Monday is also not an equitable way to advertise this availability, as some people's schedules will not allow for them to get there at noon to sign-up for an appointment.Further, the professor was chronically tardy for the start of class, usually arriving 5 to 10 minutes after it was supposed to start.",
    "Dana and Sarah were great. I talked with Dana about my paper during office hours and she was very helpful.",
    "They seemed very approachable and available.",
    "They were proactive in the discussion sections and attentive to student questions.",
    "The instructors office hours sign up usually filled fairly quickly. My failure to speak with the instructor outside of class, however, was primarily because of my own restricted schedule. Dove seemed to make himself readily available to students. The TAs also seemed to be available and responsive, and on the one occasion that I called on the TAs with questions, I received helpful feedback.",
    "Excellent. I felt like I was given full attention when I needed it.",

    "I found the course very helpful in applying social ecology literature and theory to my broader research topic.",
    "It was my first class in the field or in the related field of anthropology but it gave good theoretical context to my field experiences in development.",
    "It allowed me to work about the work of NGOs and INGOs in different countries.",
    "I hope to someday work in conservation and\/or development in a less-developed country, and I think this course should be mandatory for people with those aspirations. As I mentioned earlier, I'm certain that I am now a smarter, more nuanced thinker about development issues. AlthoughI had little background in anthropology prior to this course, I certainly plan to take more of it.",
    "I think it's a great intro course for those on the social science track. I didn't have much of a background in environmental anthropology, and this filled in the gaps of having a basic understanding of the field.",
    "Great overview of the literature and introduction to key concepts.",
    "The class provides a necessary reflective pause in the flurry of scientific and practical coursework. It is useful for someone who has had few social science classes because it informs of alternative approaches to framing social science fieldwork and interacting with different cultures.",
    "I am studying social ecology and water resource management. This course is suitable to my program. I initially thought that the material was a bit of a reiteration of theories that I studied in anthropology, history, and sociology courses as an undergraduate, but ended up feeling like I was introduced to new ideas, new bodies of work, and new ways of creating linkages between my work in the environmental manager and the larger frameworks of conservation and development.",
    "a perfect introduction to the study of anthropology, provides a very strong foundation",
    "Yes, because I am interested in Social Ecology. As a Biologist interested in social issues, this course gave me the basic tools to choose other courses that will complement my formation as a Social Biologist.",
    "This is the only anthropology course I will ever have, It gave me a glimpse of what this is al about.",
    "I see this class as helping me take more critical views of any issue; rather than just focusing on the explicitly defined aspects, the class now makes me ask tough questions. Who is defining the problem, who commands what, how has the discourse been created and how is it evolving? While this verges on making me too cynical with environmental problems, it does mean that I have to struggle now with whether I am asking the right questions. This could be an incredibly valuable skill in real life, but could be taken too far."

I appreciated having Conklin's lecture, but it was very slow, and I'm not sure how it fit with the rest of the class. Regular technical difficulties present throughout the semester in getting powerpoints to work, etc.Would be better to have a spreadsheet determined at the beginning of the semester to say in what discussion section each person will be sitting every week, rather than having to do a haphazard countoff every class period. This would ensure everybody rotates more equally among Prof. Dove and the TAs."

Although I started my paper nearly three weeks before thedue date (well ahead of most of my peers), I found myself wishing for more time. My paper evolved greatly during the course of writing, but I was unable to explore all its new directions due to time constraint. Therefore, I encourage other students to begin collecting sources and formulating arguments as soon as humanly possible.",

Read all of the readings and take notes, summarize the main points and think about how they relate to your topic. Sometimes it takes writing a full 25 pages before you realize what you really should be writing about and how. So, write a lot and don't expect your first draft to be your final paper.",
