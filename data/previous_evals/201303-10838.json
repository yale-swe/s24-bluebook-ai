    "Spanish 309 is a really good class. It can be a little dry at times, but the time period in spanish history is fascinating and most of the literature is really good. Definitely a harder spanish class. Be prepared to read long spanish novels from the 1800s and to write a lot and research in spanish. It's the same workload you would have in other literature classes but in a different language. Definitely worth taking though, especially if you are interested in the history of Spain or Spanish literature.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Lots of reading but interesting and a good professor.",
    "Spanish 309 is definitely a course with a heavy workload. If you are good at reading Spanish, then I highly recommend the class. It is reading-intensive but all the material chosen is very interesting. I would recommend to all students to take advantage of office hours. Office hours are a great way to get feedback on your writing assignments, come up with new ideas or just practice speaking. I wish I had gone there from the beginning of the semester.",
    "Small discussion class, easy reading that is interesting, cool teacher and only a few papers that were easy.",
    "Great class. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to continue their Spanish study and interested in the material."
