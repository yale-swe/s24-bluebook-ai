   "comments": [
    "I very much recommend taking this class, especially with Will Villalongo. It was fun and definitely developed my rudimentary drawing skills.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to other students - a good Cr\/D, and welcoming to all skill levels if you're interested in drawing and improving!",
    "Really great basic drawing course with a manageable amount of workload if you take it with Villalongo. Be prepared to have dirty hands for almost the entire semester. It's a great way to learn to see the world in a different light, and also fabulous to practice technique.",
    "This class will improve your drawing abilities if you're very inexperienced, otherwise it's a bit slow and frustrating.",
    "Take it before you graduate, regardless of your prior experience I had literally zero experience and ended up learning a lot from the class. Highly recommended.",
    "It's a good class for students both with or without experience in drawing",
    "Yes 100%",
    "This is an introduction to the basic techniques of drawing, including line drawings, perspective, and value drawings. I would recommend this to any student interested in brushing up on basics.",
    "If you have never taken an art class before, than this is a decent beginning class to teach you the basics and improve your drawing skills. If you have any previous drawing experience or ability, you will probably be bored out of your mind. The pace is really slow - we didn't start shading until after spring break. The homework is basically the exact same thing that we have been doing in class with no exploring or really room for creativity and is pretty boring while still being pretty time-consuming. I felt that the professor was pushing his ideas of 'good art' onto all of the students, and didn't seem to value technical ability at all. He seemed to pick up on the mistakes in the pieces and talk about them as if they were successes. The critiques were in no way productive or constructive, and they were mostly the students trying to say things that would appeal to the professor's ideas instead of saying what they really meant. I did not feel that my drawing ability improved at all or that I gained much (if anything) out of this class other than a prerequisite. If you plan on taking this class, prepare for it being the most frustrating class of your semester.",
    "This is a fun, basic art course. I took it as a senior as a final fun class at Yale, and I think that's a great way to do it.",
    "I would recommend Basic Drawing. As tacky as it may sound, it teaches you to see the world a little differently."
