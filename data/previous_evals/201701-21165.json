   "comments": [
    "There's just so much that is useful for careers\/life in this course.",
    "I feel like I learned a ton about the content of the textbook we were working with for stochastic processes. I think that was the point. I'm way better at the mathy side of statistics than I was previously.",
    "Marov Chains, Graphical Models, Martingales and a tad bit of Brownian motion.",
    "I received stronger intuition about probability, and a much better understanding of how probability is employed to solve real-world problems. Stochastic processes are very interesting, and this was a good follow-up to STAT 241.",
    "I guess I learned a lot applications for probability theory.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of markov chains, martingales, brownian motion, graphical models, and other topics, and gained a lot of experience working with the mathematics of probability generally.",
    "I learned a fair amount about markov chains and convergence, markov random fields, martingales, and some introductory brownian motion. This was my first course in statistics at Yale, so it was a good review of probabilistic reasoning, and showed me how statistical proofs are formulated (and how to reason rigorously about intuitive statements). There was some reference to applications, but it definitely favored theory more (which I prefer).",
    "This was a great introduction to stochastic processes, I definitely feel like I have a good basis to take more classes on the subject.",
    "Markov chains, Markov random fields, martingales, Brownian motion",
    "This course teaches you the theory and methodologies behind Markov chains, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Random Fields. Brownian motion was touched upon, but either it's more simple than I thought or we didn't go all that deep into it. Overall I learned so much about Stochastic processes and came out with a good theoretical understanding of the theory. We didn't go too far into applications, but I feel that the theory is sufficient to where we can google applications of markov models etc and feel comfortable understanding them.",
    "I learned a lot about stochastic processes, which was an interesting combination of theory and applications. Gave a lot of insight into the way Bayesian statistics work and furnished me with tons of new ways of thinking about statistics in general. Concretely, I learned about Markov Chains, Martingales, and continuous stochastic process in considerable detail, including proofs.",
    "Probably learned more than was appropriate for a Senior spring",
    "Proof-based class to some degree so i learned how to do proofs",
    "We used proof-based methodology to study stochastic processes, especially focusing on Markov processes, martingales, and Markov random fields. In general, we stuck to proofs, examples and theoretical calculations (e.g. \"show xyz\") rather than studying applications - and wrote next to no computer programs. We learned methodology and strategies for analyzing stochastic processes through time and their convergence and other behaviors.",
    "This class is divided into several components: 1. Markov chains and random fields (most of the course) 2. Martingales 3. Brownian motion 4. Diffusions and stochastic calculus (we didn't get to this) The subject is absolutely fascinating!!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was amazing. I just wish it went faster and covered more material.",
    "I liked this class a lot. The problem sets were challenging and rewarding and I could usually do them without assistance. When I needed assistance, the TA's were very helpful. The tests were very difficult but I think curved reasonably well to make that difficulty reasonable. Also, shout out to Joe Chang, his textbooks are the best books!",
    "This course was fascinating. The choice of material is great, of course, the issue is the difficulty. I thought that it was difficult to the point that I couldn't learn anything. Lectures were very interesting, but far more theoretical than the homework, which made the homework very difficult.",
    "The course had pretty good problem sets, in that they taught the subject well and were reasonable in length. The tests were not so good: they were too difficult and didn't really test what we were taught. I think they could be made much more manageable if they would allow students to show what they know, i.e., followed the book and problem set problems more closely. For instance, the final exam was not at all like Sahand said in an email, in that it was very far from the problem set and book problems. The lectures were also pointless to attend. Usually Sahand walked through a proof that hardly anyone followed. I think it's better to go over the big ideas of the theorems and some examples, and leave the proofs to the textbook.",
    "This course was SO HARD. Lectures were often difficult to follow. Psets took like 15 hours each and were impossible without help from the TAs. Sometimes the TAs didn't even know how to answer the questions, and we had to go to Sahand for help understanding what the questions wanted. The exams were terrible experiences, and I struggled to prepare for them, as it is unrealistic to prepare for any possible question related to the Chang text questions. This exam consumed my academics, and I definitely did worse in other classes because of the 20+ hours I put into this class some week.",
    "I thought the lecture notes were great - very readable and intuitive explanations of all of the concepts. The pace of the course was also great - we covered a fair amount of material, but Sahand made sure to spend enough time going through the concepts so that everyone had a chance to catch up during lecture. The exams asked interesting questions and tested our knowledge but I think that their difficulty and length (the first and last ones in particular) made it hard to show what I actually knew about the material, and made me lose confidence where I shouldn't have. I think it's generally better to have exams test knowledge without requiring a curve - i realize it's not easy to write them that way but that would have been an improvement.",
    "The course did a good job establishing comfort with the processes covered, but it did not use a rigorous treatment of probability.",
    "The topics covered in the course are very interesting and connected to each other nicely, and the pace was reasonable as well. Both TAs and the professor are also good at explaining concepts. For improvement, I think the course could have been more organized -- the homework schedule was inconsistent, and we only got one practice exam throughout the semester. I think class could have perhaps been improved by a few more examples (although in general, the pace was ok). Sometimes class notation was the reverse of what was used in the Chang textbook,. Homework problems (the hand-written ones) as well as exam problems were often also confusingly worded or contained typos; it might be beneficial to have a TA look them over and edit them before releasing them. Finally, I think there was possibly a disconnect between what sort of problems the professor thought students could do, and what we could actually do in the short time period of an exam -- one way to help with this could be comparing the potential exam question difficulty to that of problem sets (which usually took a while of mulling over before getting the answer). A short proof definitely does not imply it's easy to come up with; longer problems (that are broken up into parts a,b,...) may have been more feasible for exams.",
    "I wish we spent a bit more time on continuous processes (i.e. Brownian motion), but overall a great syllabus.",
    "The exams were way too hard and not reasonable for the time given, especially the first midterm.",
    "The course is very, very tough, and surprisingly proof-based. This is fine, but not what I was expecting. I'm a bit miffed that we didn't do much application, but as I said earlier, the amount is fine.",
    "Very interesting material but VERY hard problem sets and exams.",
    "This course is terrific, although a very high workload. Once you learn to manage it even that isn't such a problem.",
    "Hard course, wish there were more physical examples\/coding assignments to really solidify my understanding of the material.",
    "Strengths: at times it was very interesting. Weaknesses: homework and midterms were way too difficult and the professor did not help students learn the material well enough during class",
    "Some administrative gripes: having problem sets due the week of exams is unreasonable, and the pacing of the class felt very uneven at times. Further, we had a homework as \"review for the first midterm\" due (Friday) after the first midterm (Wednesday), which made for an unfeasible workschedule. Also, I don't think we saw enough example problems in class - definitions and properties are certainly helpful, but the real learning of the class came from the homeworks where we were forced to apply concepts in a strategic manner. I would have liked to see more of this in-class.",
    "Strengths: The subject is fascinating. The problem sets and tests were well designed. Weaknesses: Some lectures could have been more organized. Rather than presenting every detail of every proof, I would have preferred higher-level lectures. That way, we could have spent more time on Brownian motion and other topics such as diffusion and stochastic calculus."

   "comments": [
    "Ohhh yeah.",
    "I have recommended it to all my mathy friends that want some statistics in their lives. I have had a surprisingly high number of interested parties.",
    "Here's the thing-- this class is super interesting. But, it sort of takes over your life. The problem sets are sometimes impossible without having the TA spell out the problems for you, and I felt that having problem sets and tests that were that difficult made it impossible to learn. Psets took me up to 15 hours and tests made me cry. literally.",
    "Absolutely take this class. If you liked STAT241 you will love the material in this class. It had challenging tests, but I can safely say I learned the most in this class than in my other classes combined this semester.",
    "Stochastic processes was an interesting course, and was worth the time. The exams this year were too difficult, and they didn't offer us a chance to show what we knew. The lectures were also nearly pointless to attend. But the problem sets were good, and Chang's lecture notes are good, so I would overall recommend taking stochastic to another student.",
    "If you are a stats wizard or willing to put in 20+ hours a week, yes. Lectures were great for the first few weeks, and then they were probably still good but I (and most of the undergrads, at least) stopped understanding them, so less fun. Homework is mostly out of a Chang manuscript. The two midterms were really rough, averages of 52% and 76%, with the final around 72%. But it's curved. I recommend finding a bomb study group, going to office hours, and preparing for some all-nighters.",
    "Only if it is 100% mandatory for your major. I was miserable. I was credit\/d-ing the course, and I still had to put more effort and time into this class than any other just to make sure I even got credit. I honestly don't know if I even learned anything that I will use in the future or will remember after the course has ended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found the course well organized and the material very interesting. This was easily my favorite course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! The topics we cover are applicable in a ton of fields, but the course itself focuses on rigorously proving properties used in applications -- this is really fulfilling, and to me much more satisfying than courses I've taken that just used these models, without really proving anything about them. The problem sets are usually pretty fun (if sometimes ambiguously worded), although exams are hard. But, Professor Negahban is super responsive to feedback and willing to engage with students, so I think it will even continue to get better each year.",
    "Yes! I wish that sahand had covered more continuous martingales theory though",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless it is required. You could easily read Prof Chang's notes on stochastic processes and get about as much out of that as you would this course. The workload was heavy and the midterms were unreasonably difficult. Prof Negahban hardly ever finished an example in lecture and overall it was a difficult course to follow.",
    "If you really enjoy\/understand probability theory and want to challenge yourself, yes.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in statistics. It's challenging, especially if you take it with Sahand Negahban, but extremely compelling and rewarding as well. You will learn a ton if you stick with it - and if you're feeling discouraged at first, try to push through for a few weeks! It gets easier (and you'll be glad you did).",
    "Possible to do without background in probability or proof-based math, but get ready to learn a lot really fast.",
    "Stochastic Processes is a hard class for its number (STAT 251) - I heard a rumor that they are bumping the class number to STAT 351 next year, and rightfully so. Intellectually comprehending the behavior of theoretical stochastic processes is fairly difficult to begin with, and the examples in Chang's notes are not trivial either. Sahand's problems were often even more difficult, though generally elucidated some deeper understanding of the subject material. Be prepared to put a fair number of hours into office hours and homework attempts, but overall the class ends up being quite interesting.",
    "The subject matter presented in this course is absolutely fascinating -- one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. In class, you'll learn about Markov chains and random fields, martingales and Brownian motion. For that reason alone, I highly recommend taking this course. The problem sets and tests are certainly challenging, but for me, it was worth it. I'd recommend taking it Cr\/D\/F if you're concerned about your grade."
