    "A one-term senior essay is the most difficult academic project I have ever undertaken in my life, and I absolutely could not imagine doing a full-year project in English. Writing a 35- to 40-page paper in English Literature is quite unlike writing a senior essay in other disciplines. While it is certainly true that all academic endeavors require students and scholars to express themselves with a high level of clarity in their writing, I think English takes this a step further: when writing an English paper, students and scholars must write with a level of precision that I don't think is required in other disciplines. Writing with this degree of precision is extremely, extremely draining, and you don't quite realize how hard it is to sustain a clear and precise argument for dozens of pages until you try to do so. I found myself working on my essay all the time from about early October until the due date on Dec. 6.All of that being said, I highly recommend writing a senior essay. It is enriching and will test your scholarly ability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether or not you intend to go to grad school. The skills you strengthen and acquire in the process of writing a senior essay are valuable to all future projects, academic and otherwise.Another important note: think carefully about your adviser. Big-name professors will often not make the best advisers, because they will be too jaded and busy with their own work to care. I worked with a junior faculty member and the entire process was highly rewarding. Myadviser met with me weekly and required me to submit writing prior to our meetings each week so he could give me specific feedback and advice. Junior faculty are the way to go!",
    "If you work well on your own and have a passion for a specific topic not covered in a senior seminar, take it! It was the most rewarding thing that I have done at Yale. I am so proud of my work.",
    "While difficult, writing a senior essay on a critical topic of your choice can be incredibly rewarding. It's important to choose something that will continue to hold your interest over a sustained period of time, and to pace yourself.",
    "I found the senior English essay to be challenging and ultimately rewarding. I would only recommend electing to write an essay if the student is not a procrastinator--it would become so difficult to complete if so."
