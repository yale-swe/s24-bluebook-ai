   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot and learn to love poetry even more. Read aloud! Alexander Pope especially helps you get an ear for the natural music of English. Professor Brisman is the best English instructor I've ever had and extremely kind.",
    "TAKE BRISMAN'S SECTION. His grading is notoriously harsh, but regardless of how good of a student of literature you think you are in the beginning of the term, you'll conclude the course as a much better one. The way he conducts the class will open your eyes to different ways of reading literature, and his comments on your papers will improve you in multiple ways. The workload for this section is much greater than that of other sections (5 papers, 5-8 pages each), but this is supposed to be more or less the \"classical\" 126 experience, so it is really worth the time and the effort. Sometimes you'll love him, sometimes you'll dislike him, but by the end, you cannot help but feel grateful that Brisman taught you how to read properly some of the most amazing poetry in English. After this experience, you should be pretty comfortable with taking virtually any class in the English Department.",
    "This class is an in-depth look at classic poetry. The readings are all great, and analysis (primarily led by Prof. Brisman) is very insightful. I took this class as an exploration of English, not really considering it as a major, and although I really enjoyed the class, it was also pretty clear who was an English major and who was not. I do wish the grading structure had been more clear at the beginning, since we got an email during reading week about essay weights and other things that would have been nice to know a lot earlier. You really do as much of the reading as you want to, and it is you get what you put in--no reading quizzes, and the final exam is negligible. Prof. Brisman is a very sweet person who pushes you to do your best and really think about thinking, which is one of the most salient things I took away with me from this class.",
    "A solid introductory course, with some serious mishaps. You'll spend nearly a month reading Paradise Lost, and then the last 2-3 weeks covering Yeats, Eliot, and possibly a third more modern poet. This course is all POETRY. There is no prose covered, and there is very little work done to improve your writing; I think this makes it difficult as an introductory English class, since it doesn't seem representative or even preparatory for the following courses in the major. You should also be VERY careful which professor you select for this class. Some of them, like my own, seemed very old-fashioned and treated certain students and certain ideologies unfairly compared to some of the newer professors in the English department.",
    "Great for English and non-English majors alike",
    "I strongly advise women not to take this course. Professor Brisman is incredibly flippant and disrespectful toward feminist literary criticism and feminism in general. Throughout the semester, every time he referred to feminists he made sure to call them \"angry feminists.\" He also made odd, insensitive comments about rape on multiple occasions. He devoted an entire class to analyzing Wordsworth poems as an \"angry feminist\" would, asking the class, \"What would an angry feminist say about this poem, and what would she be missing?\" I spoke with multiple other women in the class, and we felt uncomfortable writing about gender in our papers because Brisman so blatantly disparaged feminism. This was a really really terrible course. I left class twice a week feeling miserable, and I almost dropped it on multiple occasions. This class convinced me to drop the English major because it exemplified everything that is wrong with how Yale approaches English literature. I know everyone loves Brisman - reading the reviews for his course, I expected a lot better. To say he was a disappointment is an understatement.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially with Professor Brisman. The poetry is beautiful, albeit representative of patriarchal literary tradition, but Brisman engaged with feminist readings and also included Louise Glck in the syllabus (my new all-time favorite poet). This class teaches you how to think critically in a new and refreshing way.",
    "Keep in mind that this class requires a lot of reading. The materials get interesting over time, so don't get scared away by Milton and Pope.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 126 with Brisman for a fellow student. The courseload is heavy, but you get a lot from it: I found a newfound appreciation for poetry because of this class."
