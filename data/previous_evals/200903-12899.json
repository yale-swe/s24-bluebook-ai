    "This occured in great sequence for me, during my third year. i think it would havebeen great anytime during second year as well. I think the intensity of this course was great later in the curicullum, but there is good reason for the subject matter to be pushed in first year too, maybe as a segment of a first year studio project.",

    "The material was excellent and timely. The expectations were aggressive but reasonable. And excellent course all around.",
    "the body of material presented in this course was great. the best part of it was the openess to which we discussed the material in this course and it was not just dictated. form is a critical topic that requires a back and forth not just a one way ideology.",
    "The material for the course was all valuable and well selected, but the there was too much material to cover in one semester.",
    "The content of the course was relatively difficult to comprehend and discuss at the speed the schedule required. This though is just the nature of the material and is not a fault of the course or the instructor.",

    "This course has raised many import questions that, as a student, I am trying to reckon with. It has pushed me to investigate a number of areas I woudl not have otherwise explored. Excellent.",
    "this course was very valuable",
    "Great class -I enjoyed our debates. Great material too.",
    "I found material covered in this course to be very relevant to current architectural discourse. The readings and discussions were useful for formulating evaluating ideas and formulating approaches to design.",
    "This course was very valuable to me. The material was new to me and I was greatful to be exposed to it. I think it takes longer than one semester though to fully comprehend the subject matter. This was infinitely more valuable and educational to me than the second semester of Theory as required by the school. A course more like this could replace that course.",

    "The instructor was organized and well prepared, however the pace at which the material was covered was too fast due to the extent of the material.",
    "Ed Mitchell is a very intelligent and passionate instructor. He was clearly eager for us all to learn and made a point to make himself available to us. I think he could benefit from putting things in writing more often - as in assignments and comments on papers\/drafts\/etc.",

    "I appreciate how you set incremental deadlines for the development of the final paper. What if you took a slightly different approach... What if each week, instead of a general reading response, we had to use the reading in a way that would support our paper topic? Take the reading, extract quotes relevant to the topic, pose questions of the text in relationship to a thesis, write about a page in relationship to the topic. Granted some weeks might be more or less relevant to specific topics, but the idea would be that each week you are both developing some aspect of your paper and using it as a springboard for conversation in the class discussion. Just a thought.",
    "I think the course could benefit from a reduction in the material to cover and a careful re-sequencing so that link contemporary discussions in theory with his the historical movements discussed in the course.",
    "Given the difficulty of the subject matter (for some of us), a class which might cover the general issues in a more meta-fashion would have been helpful. Each week covered its specific topic and while we refered back to earlier weeks, it seems as though there is an underlying meta-diagram\/outline which would be super helpful to see\/understand.The readings per week were intense but manageable with some dedication.",
    "shorter paper!"
