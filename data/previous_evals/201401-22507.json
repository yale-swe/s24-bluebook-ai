    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who will be using microscopy in their research. It not only taught me about the techniques I was interested in using, but it exposed me to techniques that I had never heard of and may consider in the future.",
    "Excellent overview of the various microscopy technologies out there. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in or thinking of using any of these technologies.",
    "yes. recommemd",
    "Recommend. A very helpful course if one is working on imaging, and a fun course if one is interested in microscopy."

    "I learned a great deal about microscopy, how it works, the different variables, and the different technologies, including super-resolution-microscopy, that are out there and available for use. This course has already contributed significantly to my research in that I am currently using a great deal of microscopy and will likely utilize some of the more advanced microscopy techniques the course goes into in the future.",
