We were given a problem set at the very end of the course, but it might have been helpful to get smaller ones more directly after covering the topics on the problem set.",
    "Bill English is a prestigious figure in the field and knew how to convey his industry experience in an academic setting, to students. The flow of the course was great, as was bringing in guest lecturers.",

    "Yes! Fun class, not too much work, great professor."
