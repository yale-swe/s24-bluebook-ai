   "comments": [
    "The class is a bit unstructured but it is really cool that you get to run your own experiment and get funding to do it. Professor Gerber is really approachable and has always been helpful during office hours to help me through the process of running my first experiment. It's a great class to be introduced to experimental design and decide whether or not you're interested in delving further into the subject.",
    "Professor Gerber is kind of the man when it comes to experimental political science. Any question you have -- he answers it and then some. I cannot overstate what an incredible wealth of knowledge he possesses. That said, this course is designed to pretty basic, so if you've already taken courses that have covered experiments before (e.g. seminars offered by other folks in ISPS), I think the marginal value of this seminar may be lower than you'd like. This seminar is ideal for a sophomore or junior. The workload is pretty light, but that might be due to weird scheduling circumstances this term (e.g. the blizzard). I have no sense of grading because it's almost entirely dependent on the final essay.",
    "I would recommend this class to any political science or economics majors interested in quant-y research. You will learn so much practical skills about how to conduct lab, survey and field experiments.",
    "For me this was a pre-requisite class and was necessary for my major, but there are very few options to fulfill the research design requirement and Yale and this is definitely the best available class out there.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in creating and running your own experiment. The various papers and experiments you will get to read and evaluate are also an excellent source of knowledge. That said, there is quite a bit of statistics involved in some aspects of the class.",
    "This class teaches you practical skills, such as how to perform regressions and design a survey, but is uninspiring. Professor Gerber was helpful, but not particularly engaging. I learned useful skills, but could have had a more enjoyable time learning them.",
    "If you are interested in experimental literature and running your own experiment, it could be ok. The class is a bit dry, so the subject matter really needs to interest you.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are really into political science methodologies and really want to conduct an experiment.",
    "Do the words \"Experimental Methods in Political Science\" excite you? If so, take this course. If not, don't. If you're already somewhat interested in the subject material, this class will give you a great background on experiments in political science (and bordering on fields like psychology and economics) as well as practical research skills. If you have no interest at all in political science experiments the class probably won't make you fall in love with them. Professor Gerber is really knowledgeable about the subject material and is easy to talk to to answer questions about your own project and readings. I am glad I had some experience with statistics and data analysis going into the class. Some students clearly did not, which slowed down the pace of the class and I'm guessing added an extra challenge for them in writing their final paper.",
    "Alan Gerber is a wonderful mentor and professor. He gives up his time readily for students, and is filled with useful advice and guidance for the research project. The class is great. You will read different papers and volunteer to critique them for a few weeks in the semester. The research paper will take a fair amount of time to run. Go to Professor Gerber's office hours early, from the time you think of a proposal to the very end when you are putting finishing touches to your paper. If you are not comfortable with statistics, seek help from Professor Gerber as soon as possible because statistics will be the core analysis for the paper. You don't have to make a complicated proposal either; stick with what you know and do something that excites you.",
    "I would recommend it to polisci majors, but ONLY to students that have taken stat or just ooze mathiness."
