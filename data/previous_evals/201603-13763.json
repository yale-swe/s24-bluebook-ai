    "Teaching the basics of scene painting. I started at 0, and now think I have progressed to a 3. Ru is understanding especially with students who do not have design backgrounds and I really appreciated his teaching style and ability to communicate with technically minded people. I took the class to better understand a department that one day I might supervise at a different institution as a technical director and now have a new appreciation for the estimating skills and approaches used everyday in the paint shop.",
    "A really enjoyable experience overall. The course is well planned with a clear purpose to understand the process of scene painting. The exercises overs many information within and beyond the art of scene painting. The final project is great that it facilitates teamwork and is a valuable experience.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. learning how to paint from research images and what a scenic artist needs to do their job well is very valuable. I like that it was mostly all hands on learning. Ru was always encouraging and made himself available to help outside of class time.",
    "Trial-and-error is a true art and it's amazing to experience that on your own, with classmates, with Ru, and with Nate and Lea. Solid range of material imitations and project types, good blend of individual work and group work, weekly project critique with Ru and classmates was constructive and genuinely delightful. Big love for DRAM152a. 3",
    "The hands on nature and ability to give to the project as much as you can\/if you can. If you can only give a certain amount of hours you'll learn, but if you can give more hours you'll learn more. That works well with our busy schedules.",
    "We tried new paint technics which I will use in my future."

    "The final project focused a little too much on build over painting. As someone with a technical background I wish that I could have been able to focus more on the painting process over preparing a surface to paint. I think it was super useful to paint on 3 dimensional objects so I understand the need for the mock scenic units, but perhaps in the future there are stock pieces to paint.",
    "I liked the idea of the final project but I wish it had been more about painting and less about construction.",
    "I would have preferred to have some more color mixing basics. Maybe taking a piece of MDF and making our own color board on the first day. Just splotching a color and writing the name, try mixing two and see what that makes and write down the combo.",
    "Nothing."
