   "comments": [
    "This course forced me to think critically about the visual aspects of the built environment in ways that I had not before. I would recommend this course to students who could benefit from this sort of analysis. For those whose interest lies more strongly in political or economic aspects of urban studies, this class might be less helpful, although all urbanists should be encouraged to engage with the visual.",
    "Other students interested in Built Environments should absolutely take this course, even if unfamiliar with specific architectural or historical modes of analysis. Professor Hayden helps each student to make you more comfortable with a wide variety of sources.",
    "it's a research similar that encourages you to explore some aspect of the built enviornment. provides a good introduction to ideas of thinking about space and place in a variety of context and scales.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a research topic already in mind, since the deadline for the final paper is quite early. It is a useful forum to test ideas and arguments among a range of other students and in particular to learn from interdisciplinary approaches. The more practical issues of academic research, like publication, revision, conference presentations, and grant writing are more underplayed."

   "comments": [
    "The course introduce me to some literature that is helping me de-ideologize my thinking about place which will be helpful for situating my own work within contemporary space\/place discussions. It also underwrote a heavy load of research that should prove to have been a good case study or orienting instance of a developing theory of place.",
    "The research I did for this course is directly relevant to my dissertation research.",
    "This course was invaluably helpful to me, as it made me feel more comfortable using sources that I previously did not feel I had a mastery over. Being aware of the wide variety of sources that are available for spatial analysis will help me to be more attuned to potentially helpful materials in my future research. This course also has helped me understand how I might craft truly interdisciplinary research projects going forward.",
    "course broadened my knowledge of the built environment, contributing to a more interdisciplinary approach to my own research.",
    "My research paper for this course will contribute to further research and likely my dissertation project. The emphasis on interdisciplinary thinking and incorporation of images into writing also enhanced my understanding of my discipline."
