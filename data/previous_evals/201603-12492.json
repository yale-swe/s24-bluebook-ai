    "I developed a strong appreciation for the process of economic research and scholarship. Though the material was at an extremely high level, both instructors were very clear and approachable on the subject matter. Some of the technical aspects of decision theory went above my head as an architecture student, but the professors were extremely helpful in recommending less technical reading to supplement their lectures."

   "comments": [
    "I think the most helpful thing would have been to have the models distilled down into more common parlance. This would naturally help the non-economics students understand the material as the course progresses, but as there are probably not very many who take this course outside of the economics department, that is possibly not the strongest case for doing it. As a former science teacher, I think this is a generally good practice for all levels of material taught even when dealing with experts in a field. I think it becomes a lot easier to follow any mathematical\/economical\/scientific model when you can paraphrase it into something a non-expert could understand easily. Some of the finer points in this class were never quite wrapped up in that way."
