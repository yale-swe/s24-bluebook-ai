   "comments": [
    "Pretty boring material - mostly a continuation of intro physics. Wouldn't take unless you have to. Try to get with Dufresne or O'Hern",
    "Not a very good class. Good deal of work and don't learn much.",
    "Interesting course, but essentially just an extension of physics 180 with slightly more difficult problems.",
    "I thought the tests were really difficult, but the homework was okay, and usually a little shorter than typical engineering classes. Udo puts notes online, though, which is really useful for when classes are hard to understand or move too fast for me.",
    "It is a tough course, but if Udo is giving it you should better take it with him; he is very friendly, understanding, and brings some nice stuff to show the class every now and then. Psets every week too, btw.",
    "Dynamics was an interesting class but I would not recommend any class taught by Professor Schwarz. This was my second class with him and by now I have learned that his classes should be avoided like the plague.",
    "Dynamics with Schwarz is like an extension of high school or intro physics. The course is a standard lecture format comprising derivations, conceptual points, and physical demonstrations. Schwarz provided lecture hand outs which were very helpful in reviewing the course. It is not necessary to purchase a textbook.",
    "The only reason I would recommend taking this class is if you don't have Udo as a professor OR because you have to take it for MECH E.",
    "If you are comfortable with the chain rule and manipulating equations, I highly recommend this course. The tests are very difficult, but curved quite favorably, and the problem sets are not terribly difficult. The course is well structured as well.",
    "The course itself is not too difficult and some of the concepts are review of old material. Prof. Schwarz is always excited to teach but his lectures can be dry."
