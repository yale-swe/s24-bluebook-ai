   "comments": [
    "Project-based class on big data. Almost every week interesting guest speakers covering aspects of and topics linked to big data. Unusual grading scheme (e.g. participation based on tweets during class). I would recommend this course to students with prior exposure to python or other programming languages.",
    "Know more about the hot topic \"big data\" and how it helps people nowadays. Yes, lots of ideas beyond statistics.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that this course is a great way to understand a trend that will be present in almost everyone's working and personal lives: big data. While the course is less skill-based and has more of a policy focus, the class will help students who will one day be managing a team of people, some of whom might be data scientists. The project is very useful for acquiring big data skills and learning more in depth about a specific big data topic.",
    "Definitely yes",
    "The course material is extremely interesting - I think more undergraduates should be taking classes like this. You can use this as an opportunity to learn programming\/tech skills, since Casey will provide the resources, or you can use this as an opportunity to learn more from a less-tech perspective. Either works and you can shape the experience however you'd like it to. Casey is a great professor - he is understanding and responsive. You'll learn a lot from him.",
    "The class explores the idea of 'big data', and how the ability to collect, process and analyze large volumes of data is changing how we think about things like biomedical science, currency and human trafficking. The class bounces all over the place depending on the guest speakers who come in. Professor King is really a fantastic guy who is funny, kind and cares a lot about his students. The classes are very discussion-led. There is a final project that is very flexible where you can explore the role of big data in some space or do a more technical project involving scraping, processing and visualizing data. I took this class as a senior undergraduate, in spite that it's normally a Jackson Global Affairs graduate course. It was well worth my time.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested in data analysis, cybersecurity, tech for development or finance. I would not recommend it to students who have little knowledge or interest in developing programming, data analysis, or other tech skills on their own.",
    "A challenge to do something. To learn code, to come up with an interesting idea to present to others, to engage with top policy experts after an engaging class. It is unlike most classes at Yale where you will be hand held in developing a single paper or presentation. It is more of an open challenge to show the instructor or your peers what you can do. Doing nothing is fine only if you think it is.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, because it introduces ideas and issues that are currently not receiving the attention they deserve.",
    "Open-ended nature of assignments can be liberating for more self-directed students--or deeply frustrating for those who like greater guidance and structure. For those who are interested in the policy implications of 'big data', but disinclined to learn the technical skills necessary to conduct big data analyses, auditing may be a better option.",
    "It is a course that helps you to understand how big data technology is changing the way government works, and how would it impact everyday lives of many.",
    "GLBL 849 provides a diverse range of opinions and applications pertaining to big data and its implications in global affairs. The main course component is a culminating project that can be on any issue regarding big data and policy. I would recommend GLBL 849 to another student, although I would add the caveat that students with a background in technical skills (or students with the time to learn such skills on their own) may get more out of the course as they will be able to do a project that is more skills-based.",
    "Excellent introduction to the potential role of big data American and international policy making."

   "comments": [
    "Believe in big data and know how much I can do to help people in need.",
    "Big data will be increasingly important in the world of policy. The federal government is moving toward having a data analytics office in every agency, and my guess is that state and city governments will eventually do the same (if they have not already). This course teaches students the language of big data and helps students understand the various ways that policy will need to adjust to the glut of data.",
    "Showed me why and how statistics and machine learning matter.",
    "Data is being fetishized most by those who least understand it (perhaps as it always has if Mark Twain is to be trusted). This course removes the veil of data magic just a bit, while also tempting us to practice its dark arts. In this way we can employ or avoid it to our benefit as policy professionals going forward.",
    "Big data is transformative and before I took the course, I had no clue about how many its applications are, and how important it is as a legal, economic and technological driver. As I continue a career in the age of data, I am now more aware of how it can be applied and I feel more confident I can use it creatively and responsibly.",
    "It inspires me to think from a macro, comprehensive point of view to the future of big data. I think my ability to think about the bigger picture has been improved",
    "This course has definitely deepened my knowledge of global affairs, and has provided me with an outlet to build certain skills that I'm sure will be essential or complementary to my profession."
