    "You can tell that Professor Tartari really cares about teaching, more so than a lot of econ professors at Yale. That said, I found the organization of the class to be a bit weird. Almost all of your grade comes from a nearly two hours long presentation. In the end, there were only about 2 class sessions taught by her and the rest were taken up by student presentations. I would've preferred a different format \u0096\u00a0maybe half of each session devoted to a lecture by her with the other half devoted to a presentation. Also, make sure you know your shit before you present, because she will call you out on it if you don't. If you're comfortable with empirical papers and don't mind giving long presentations, I'd recommend.",
    "Good class, but the emphasis is on student teaching and not on professor teaching. Your grade depends on one 2.25-hour presentation you will give. You really need to understand Microeconomics and understand the papers you are assigned to present in order to do well in this class, because you are not taught--since it is a student presentation-based class, you much teach yourself. That being said, Tartari was always available for office hours and did elucidate the concepts. The syllabus says that our the professor \"will interrupt your presentation and...will ask questions\"--this is an understatement. You will be eaten alive if you have not prepared enough, so prepare. I wish this had been explained at the beginning of the course."
