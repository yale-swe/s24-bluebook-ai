    "I audited the class. Kyzar is a sharp guy, but the class could have been a little more interactive, with less lecturing from him and more opinions from students.",
    "Good class but not sure I actually learned anything. Class discussions needed to be better managed to keep the super-eager kids from taking over the discussions.",
    "I love this professor. I learned a lot from his classes!",
    "I audited this course",
    "Question 4: The amount of reading was really heavy but there were no assignments which was nice. I also liked that we had options for the final assignment.",
    "YLS courses arereally great. Professor Kysar's course was excellent. His teaching style is wonderful and the course material was excellent.",
    "This course is a refresher to a lot of the climate policy work you can find in other FES classes. The difference is that Kysar is very good at inspiring class discussion and you learn some introductory thoughts on the law perspective on traditional climate issues.",
    "The readings for the course were out of date.",
    "There was a lot of hot air from fellow students which the professor kindly wanted to acknowledge but wasn't very useful to learning. I also feel like there is a lot of reading that must be done in order to really get a lot out of the class. Lastly, the professor is so passionate and interested in the topic - it really might do better as a seminar!",
    "I very much enjoyed the visiting speakers and would like to see them again in future editions of the course. However, it would be nice if speakers were some time outside of class so that they did not take away from the overall material.",
    "It was made quite interesting by initiating interactions.",
    "This course was designed more like a seminar course that relies on small group discussion. In a large class setting it did not seem to work as well. I really would have liked a bit more structure and introduction to the law material. I found that I did not learn enough about the legal tools as I would have liked."

    "Interesting readings, topics, class discussions.",
    "The excellent professor.",
    "The instructor's all-encompassing approach to the topic. Good structure and relevant readings.",
    "Professor Kysar is fabulous, great at explaining clearly and keeping the class interesting for people with a wide variety of knowledge levels. I would give this class an A+. Great, engaging lecture style, and the course is very up to date and covered the most recent climate change law developments. Guest lecturers were also great.",
    "The knowledgeable and articulate students who brought a range of backgrounds and perspectives to the course.",
    "The professor is a great lecturer and very engaging. It was great listening in on classroom discussions.",
    "The breadth of the material and the amount of material that we covered. Kysar's lectures were very informative and entertaining. I also really appreciate how passionate he is about the material.",
    "Learning about climate law from Professor Kysar. His lectures and readings covered the topic from so many different angles. Excellent work Professor Kysar!",
    "The readings were very timely and interesting regarding both domestic and international climate policies. Professor Kysar is very engaging with students and brings a certain optimism to the field of climate law (even if he thinks he is being pessimistic most of the time).",
    "Great professor",
    "Professor Kysar is amazing and very engagingcover good range of topicsa bit repetitive if you've taking EL&P or other policy classes",
    "Kysar is a sensational speaker and teacher. His lectures and lecture slides were excellent.",
    "Professor Kysar is an excellent and engaging lecturer! He is clearly very passionate about the topic, and he makes it personal, which I very much appreciated. It really makes the class rewarding.",
    "Professor Kyzar's lectures from PowerPoint were enjoyable, concise, and very informative.",
    "The interactions and also the in depth analysis or explanations of issues with cases",
    "great overview of what is going on with the discussion of climate change, global to local scales.",
    "I really enjoy Professor Kysar's lively and humorous lecturing style. He is clearly was well informed on this topic, encourages discussion, and wants students to learn.",

   "comments": [
    "Difficult to balance between people who know a lot about climate and law, and people who have never studied it.",
    "Keeping the class focused.",
    "It would be nice if we had smaller discussion sections so that everyone could feel comfortable talking.",
    "Better targeted readings - perhaps indications of required and recommended readings to make sure students are actually completing the important ones.",
    "Perhaps more encouragement of multiple-person dialogue, rather than soliciting just individuals' comments.",
    "I can't think of anything to improve.",
    "It's so broad! I don't know how it can be any different thought. As a non-law student the volume of reading surprised me.",
    "The lectures could be a little clearer. As a non-law student I feel that the cases were rushed through and I would have appreciated a little more explanation.",
    "Class size was way too big for discussion.",
    "Some restructuring would be nice to get into more depth on a few topics rather than giving a broad brush to everything. For instance, the day focusing on litigation strategies was helpful but could have gone into more depth. Perhaps have students analyze a climate related case in more depth as a class assignment.",
    "a little less reading...?",
    "The reading list is out of date, and a little boring.",
    "Again, too much participation from students, especially particular students. The professor could try to cut this off once in a while.",
    "The course was originally designed to be a seminar, and it would have been nice to have been nice if there were more opportunities to comment either in section or elsewhere. Class discussions were unfortunately dominated by several talkative students.",
    "Practicals or some exercises like real\/ moot court trials.",
    "More background materials for students with non-law background. It was very difficult to jump into the readings without them.",
    "If the class is this large, have more structure to it. I also found that completing the final in just 3 hours seems very challenging. We were given 24 hours, so it was not a problem to finish it but was told that the intention is that this is a 3 hour exam.",
    "The format of the class was ideal for a seminar, so it should be slightly adjusted if it ends up as a lecture again."
