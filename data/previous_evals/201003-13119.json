    "A necessary introduction to an inevitable period of English poetry and thought.",
    "Take this course! Prof. Fry is a literary genius and a passionate lecturer. He really entertained and inspired us. If you have a love for poetry, you could not be better served than to study the English Romantics under such an excellent teacher--these poets, along with Prof. Fry's reading of them, are pretty life-changing. Even if you are just generally interested in English (the language, the literature, the literary history), the Romantics are an essential movement and you will find no better way to experience them than here. This is an extremely underrated and under-enrolled course.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "If Paul Fry is teaching this course, take it. It's an absolute miracle.",
    "I love Romantic poetry, and the fact that I feel extremely well-read in the genre now makes me sooo happy. Professor Fry is a pretty good lecturer. One midterm, one 5-7 page paper, and one 2.5 hour final. My section was pretty fun as well.",
    "What a wonderful class. The romantics are a joy to read, and Fry makes them even better. I was shocked at how few people were in the class; this is important and delightful stuff. A good follow-up to DS, too. There got to be a significant amount of reading towards the end of the semester, but it was not at all unmanageable, and it was almost always fun reading. Also, I had the only good TA I've ever had in this class. Everyone should take this class. It's perhaps the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "You'd better love Wordsworth to take this class. In Fry's words, \"I'm a Wordsworth man.\" The Keats reading is fantastic, and Coleridge and Byron are goofy. You've got to have patience for longish poems and for off-the-cuff lectures that are hard to take notes from but that do crescendo in a very satisfying way. Only for a certain type of gal or guy, but if you are she or he, don't miss it.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in Romantic Poetry--the lectures are terrific, the readings are outstanding and it gives you a really excellent overview of the period. One caveat: if you are not an English major, this class will be very difficult for you to follow at times. Professor Fry's lectures heavily emphasize things like meter, verse styles and antecedents which are impossible to understand if you're not well versed in English poetry--this was definitely the case for me. Nonetheless one of the most interesting, challenging and thought provoking subjects I've studied at Yale.",
    "This is a great introduction to Romantic Poetry.",
    "An excellent class for anyone with an interest in Romantic poetry, and especially for anyone who has read the shorter works of the major Romantics, but has not yet tackled the longer works. Professor Fry is an extraordinarily dynamic and enlightening lecturer, particularly with regards to Shelley and Keats."
