    "if you have to take this lab, it will be fine but it is very stressful at times as the instructions are often unclear and it almost seemed like we were \"guinea pigs\" testing the experiments for the first time",
    "A manageable and general introductory physics lab. Not too bad, and if you come with positive energy it can even be fun!",
    "To be honest, I would not have taken this class if it wasn't a pre-med requirement, and I think there are better options within the physics department when it comes to meaningful lab courses. The class isn't very substantive in terms of teaching you in-depth new material, and you might feel underwhelmed by the weekly labs and reports. However, the workload is significantly more manageable that many other labs you might take at Yale (i.e. Gen Chem, and don't even get me started on P. Chem). If you get the chance to take this course with Sid Cahn, do it. And make sure to ask him as many questions as you can, because the man is a genius at getting you to reason through the concepts on your own when he's listening. It's not too important who you end up being in a lab section with, since lab partners rotate weekly. Having friends in other lab days can be helpful though, when it comes to troubleshooting your understanding of the lab since the procedures tend to get more refined as the week goes on. tl;dr - it's a class you shouldn't fear taking if you have to anyway.",
    "NO. Don't take it.",
    "Lots of circuits. Simple enough if you've taken any introductory physics.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS.",
    "This course is conducting experiments\/labs once a week and writing up a lab report. It's slightly lengthy day of, but during the week, there is not a lot of work you'll have to do. As long as you have a schedule and put some effort in, one should do fine.",
    "Not as terrible as Phys 165L. Get through it, you can do it!",
    "If you're taking this course, it's because you have to! Very reasonable, the lab reports are only one page and the practical isn't particularly tough.",
    "would recommend",
    "The material is only marginally interesting to me, and despite the instructors' best efforts, that did not change. However, I would say that as someone who has to take this class for premed requirements, this was a very well organized class that made it as painless as possible, while still being a rigorous course.",
    "If you're looking at this, you know you have to take the lab. All I'll say is that it's better than 165L, but still an intro physics lab, so...",
    "Better than 165L, not too bad as far as labs go",
    "A much better experienced than 165, most labs were quite short and never got to bogged down in details. Take it because you have to, but you won't have to dread it like other labs.",
    "good lab, reasonable work",
    "It's an intro physics lab. You probably have to take it for one reason or another. Don't worry, it's not painful at all. Lab reports are easy and the practical isn't bad. Don't worry about course load. Throw this in as a 4.5th or 5.5th credit and carry on with your semester.",
    "Much easier and friendlier than 205L. The topics are probably less interesting than 206L though and there is a practical at the end, in case you're deciding between the two. The workload is much less than 206L overall.",
    "Awful. Only take it if you have to.",
    "you probably have to take this course so on the bright side it does not take a lot of time like the other labs. you only need to write a page long summary every week.",
    "Crappy class but necessary for pre-med. Sucks though.",
    "Physics 166 is your basic introductory physics lab course. The experiments are reasonably straightforward. Find a helpful teaching assistant and the course will be not too bad.",
    "This is a standard physics lab course, and you'll probably learn something interesting from it even if you're just taking it to fulfill a requirement. If you do your work and stay on top of things, it won't be too much of a struggle.",
    "Same format as PHYS 165L - one lab each week, read the handout beforehand, take a quiz first thing, spend the rest of the time doing the experiment \/ following the procedure detailed in the handout, leaven when you're done. Difficulty tends to vary from TA to TA!! Also may include labs that focus on topics not really covered in PHYS 171. Take it if you want to \/ have to for pre-med requirements.. it's not that bad, just tedious at times.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you need to take it for your major or for pre-med requirements. But I doubt you're looking at this class unless you're one of those two things anyways. In that case, just take it and get it over with.",
    "One of the least painful labs at Yale, if you have to take it, fear not! Lab sessions go by quickly and the only work is a one page summary.",
    "Pretty scrappy course. Most people are obviously taking the course as a requirement. The lab handouts are not terrifically organized and are often written with a good amount of flair\/fluff. Make sure to ask your lab TA as often as you need to answer questions in the handouts and to help with your experimental setup -- it saves a great deal of time. The lab summaries are easy (1 page) and the course is overall not too time intensive.",
    "Better than 165, still not the most scintillating thing ever. You might learn more from lab than class though.",
    "Most people who take this course are those looking to fulfill a requirement. I would recommend this lab over other physics labs because it is engaging and the course instructors are helpful.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to! Much harder than first semester and you don't take away as much--maybe it's because the concepts are harder and we don't interact that much with them on a daily basis, like we did with mechanics.. Sid really puts a lot of effort into the course though.",
    "If you need to fulfill pre-med prereqs, just take it. If you are interested in circuits, this class will be very enjoyable! If you hate physics or circuits, this course will be the sad part of your week.",
    "If you are taking this lab, it is probably because you have to. Manage your time wisely, finish all your graphs and lab notes in class, learn how to use the oscilloscope, and you should be fine.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, it's probably because you have to. It's not as bad as PHYS 165L. You will survive.",
    "If you must, take it. Not very hard, just 3 hours of very boring experiments once a week.",
    "Obviously you are only taking this class if you have to. It sucks but isn't that terrible. The actually labs are tedious and uninteresting but not that hard and the postlab assignments are very manageable.",
    "This lab dealt with basic electronic circuits and E&M theory. As an engineer I did not feel the lab was difficult, but it was nice to brush up on my knowledge of electronics. I also learned some cool stuff along the way, and the class was not overly time-consuming.",
    "Hard",
    "PHYS166L is basically what you would expect from a general physics lab, and it follows the same format as PHYS165L. The lab practical was a bit harder in 166 than in 165, but the material was more interesting during the semester.",
    "Really fun lab class! You can learn a lot if your engage with the material and ask a lot of questions. Overall not very difficult, but definitely very rewarding for a biology major who doesn't normally get a lot of applied physics exposure.",
    "Take it because you have to. It's not fun but might be better if you take it in the same semester as the lecture course.",
    "PHYS 166L is a continuation of the work and experiments from PHYS 165L. The experiments are run in a very similar fashion and cover the material from PHYS 171\/181. Most labs experiments coincide with the lecture material and this is very helpful, but at times the experiments do not deal with topics discussed in the lecture.",
    "Not great, but could be a lot worse. You're taking it because you have to, but at least the professors are good.",
    "I would recommend this lab to anyone interested in electricity and magnetism and who is taking Phys171 (the lab material preceeded that which was taught in the class, so taking the lab helped me understand the material taught in class better).",
    "Physics lab course of E&M physics",
    "I would recommend taking it at the same time as PHYS 171 because it helps you learn the material.",
    "The majority of people take this class to fulfill a pre-req, so if you're reading this, you likely already have to take the course. The labs are arguably more interesting than its counterpart, PHYS 165L. Standard lab course with not too much work.",
    "A solid lab course. There are some interesting experiments that will keep you engaged all throughout the course. It's very well organized. One thing to be mindful of is that it covers electricity, magnetism, and optics. We didn't cover optics in 181 so those experiments were a bit challenging, and the lab moves more quickly than the lecture course for 181, so be prepared to learn things on your own as you go.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if I didn't have to, but you do, so try to not hate it entirely. It is quite boring and time consuming, but might not be that bad.",
    "A fine class to go along with 171. Not as intuitive as 165L for me, because of the circuit work, but doable nonetheless",
    "This lab was much more interesting to me than the first semester (PHYS 165L) lab. It was well organized and helped me understand many of the concepts we learned about in PHYS 171.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Not terrible as far as labs go, but definitely worse than orgo lab. A necessary evil for pre-meds.",
    "This course is necessary for knowing how to operate the essential equipment used in many science positions.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Though you're probably not taking it for fun, 166 was shorter and better than 165 in my opinion (no error calculations woo!). I took this a year after taking 181 and still found it manageable - it's probably even more helpful for the course if you're in it. Learn to use the oscilloscope! A lot of people thought the practical was pretty hard but as long as you make sure that you're paying attention to how to use the apparatuses and LoggerPro you should be fine.",
    "166L is the natural follow up of 165L. If you've taken 165L, you should expect pretty much the same environment for 166L. Different things are stressed in the second semester, but these are all explained well in the lab manual they still have us read.",
    "If it is not required for you, DO NOT TAKE IT. If you're not good at physics and have little background, like me, you will spend the semester in a state of confusion and anxiety about your confusions. If you are good at physics, you should probably take a more advanced lab. This class was highly mediocre ranging on unpleasant and frustrating. New material that hasn't been covered in the lecture courses is skimmed over, but you actually have to understand it decently to do well in the course. If you do have to take it, it's not terrible. You'll get through it. But I wouldn't recommend.",
    "This is a pretty good lab that teaches all the basic physics concepts and you'd think electricity is hard to learn hands-on because you can't actually see anything, but this lab lets you get hands-on as much as possible and you actually learn a lot. The instructors are all really helpful and willing to answer questions. I'd recommend this.",
    "Good stuff!",
    "It's a good class to expose students to physics experiments. The lab practical at the end of the semester is very hard, however.",
    "You're probably required to take the class for your major\/pre-med work.",
    "If necessary take it, but if not you won't be missing much.",
    "Entry-level intro physics lab.",
    "Don't take physics lab unless you're required to for your major.",
    "You'll be fine!",
    "I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS LAB COURSE! I WAS VERY SURPRISED",
    "This course definitely aligns with PHYS 181 and it is helpful to have taken PHYS 165L beforehand just to be familiar with the lab report format and the equipment overall.",
    "It was very stressful. Hopefully they make changes to make it better. I dreadded going to class each week.",
    "A good hands on class, but not particularly relevant.",
    "Well, it won't be the most fascinating lab you've ever taken, but it is better than 1st semester Phys 165L. It's a straightforward intro physics lab course, and with a workload that amounts to weekly one-page lab write-ups, reading quizzes about the labs, and a lab practical final, it's not too stressful a lab, except until maybe the lab practical. It's a much more relaxed environment than labs like organic chemistry or pchem, and the instructors and TA's are always ready to answer questions and explain concepts during labs.",
    "Great as far as intro physics labs go!",
    "This is the second semester of Physics lab and it goes more hand in hand with the second semester of class.",
    "Take it if you have to. Much better and more interesting than the first physics lab course. Can actually be a lot of fun at times. Make sure you get a TA who is clear about their expectations for the lab reports!",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "Much more tolerable than 165L, I thought. Dr. Cahn is an excellent lab director and designs effective experiments, and they are actually pretty interesting, too. It's also predictable in terms of workload, with pretty much no surprises along the way, which I know is a helpful characteristic in the midst of a busy semester that will usually fluctuate in terms of stress levels.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Would definitely recommend, even if you're not in the lecture course. I wasn't in the lecture course, and I still feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "It is an interesting class and easy to apply the concepts learned in lab to the physics course you are taking. But, your grade and how you need to complete your lab write-up will highly depend upon your TA.",
    "Definitely one of the better introductory premed labs!!",
    "Do not take this class. It is terrible and a constant pain. The instructions were constantly unclear and different versions (with information necessary for quizzes) would be uploaded sometimes even the day of the lab. Monday lab students were at a great disadvantage, and we were constantly \"guinea pigs\". LABS SHOULD BE A FULL CREDIT. LABS SHOULD BE A FULL CREDIT. LABS SHOULD BE A FULL CREDIT. LABS SHOULD BE A FULL CREDIT.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying physics or engineering, however, it might get a little too tedious and seem pointless if the course material isn't very directly related their career goals.",
    "PHYS 166L is a required course for many majors and for premed students. The experiments are sometimes fun and engaging but most of the time are just frustrating. The course does not line up well with PHYS 171.",
    "Harder than 165L, but a must for physics lab requirement.",
    "Only if required. The physics concepts are fairly easy.",
    "Weekly lab modules, about 3 hours long, sometimes a little longer. The lab modules deal with applications of various equations or physical phenomena covered in introductory courses.",
    "A disorganized lab that is very confusing and not at all helpful. I would not recommend this class to anyone, but alas, pre-med requirements....",
    "no, u have to take it though",
    "Continuation of the general physics lab sequence - if you're reading this, you probably need it. It can more fun than semester one since you're comfortable with the basic system and the packets have some exciting puns. The lab reports are short and simple and the experiments are straightforward. Read the packets before lab and you'll be fine."
