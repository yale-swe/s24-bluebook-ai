    "I would say that this class is a lot of fun and is a real stress reducer and would definitely recommend it.",

    "Take it take it take it. Best class at Yale. Learn something useful.",
    "build a steam engine, amazing class for practically minded people",
    "Take this course. Being forced to build a particular part to within 5\/1000ths of an inch of specifications is a terrific complement to the abstraction of most other Yale parts. Dave is a wonderful (and wonderfully patient) instructor, and best of all, you'll have something concrete to take home from this course for the rest of your life - a steam engine!",
    "Fun.",
    "Perhaps the most fun part of our second semester.",
    "If you want to get better at using mills, lathes, or the CNC machine, this is your class. Plus, you get to keep the mini steam engine that you build throughout the year when you finish.",
    "Take this course. It's so incredibly awesome. Where else will you learn how to make a steam engine with machine tools?"
