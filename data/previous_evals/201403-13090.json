   "comments": [
    "If a student has any interest in the construction of childhood, I would absolutely recommend this course. It was one of my favorite and most rewarding classes this semester. The professor is such a joy and I felt as if I was always working toward something worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend English 114 to a lot of students because it is a great chance to get very good at writing and you need it in the long run. There are a lot of sections for 114 so I am sure any student will find a topic that they like.",
    "English 114 is an academic writing course which will give you the solid base in writing that being a Yale student requires. As a shaky writer coming into Yale, I am very glad that I became acclimated to the caliber of writing that Yale expects in my first semester here. Though it was challenging at times, I feel that I learned a lot and now I am a much more confident writer. I would definitely recommend this writing course to anyone who would like a preview into the Yale English Department as well as to anyone who would like to improve their academic writing skills.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would summarize this class as a key introduction writing class in college that is essential to help succeed as an overall student at Yale. I already have mentioned this class because I had such a good experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to all freshman because it really helped me transition from high school writing to college.",
    "An introductory English course with very intriguing content, a dedicated and resourceful teacher, and very likely to help in polishing out your writing and helping you identify your writing style. I would strongly recommend this course to another student as I have grown significantly as a writer due to this class.",
    "Yes, I would this class to another student because it allows one to develop basic writing skills for college level writing.",
    "It is an intense,interesting and particularly hard class but worth the struggle.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Whether or not you have an initial interest in childhood before the course, Professor Klemann gets you to engage with the concept of childhood in ways that are fun, exciting, and challenging. Through multimedia forms of information gathering like articles, essays, films, and modern-day music videos, you will be able to look at the idea of childhood through many different perspectives and form your own critical thinking lens to view those various opinions. My writing improved greatly not only in terms of being able to construct an effective and debatable argument, but also in terms of being able to think outside the box and come up with original, creative claims that contribute to the world instead of just regurgitating someone else's work. She's really a wonderful human being and professor and works very hard to make this class amazing. Take it!",
    "English 114 is a worthwhile class if you want to feel confident in your writing abilities moving forward. It provides a basic foundation for many types of papers that you may write in future classes. I would suggest picking a section with a topic that interests you, because you will be reading and writing about this topic a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It really helped me strengthen my writing and also completely changed my academic and career path for the better. Professor Klemann is great, the readings are interesting, and the paper topics are challenging but in a really good way. Even though I was older than most of the students, I learned a lot from everyone in the class."
