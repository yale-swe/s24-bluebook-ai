    "Take this class if you want to explore playwriting as an art form, and are willing to put in the work! In addition to weekly reading, you will be required to produce and share writing on a weekly basis, and you will only get out of the workshop what you put in. Really rewarding, though, if you can get in!",
    "Good class. Definitely would recommend if you're interesting in writing for theater\/TV\/film. My writing absolutely improved over the class of the semester, and the work was pretty manageable. You just had to write a scene every week, and once you decide on what your play is gonna be about, you get into it enough that it stops being work and you just want to write. Would definitely recommend."
