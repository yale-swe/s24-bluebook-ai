    "The class was my heaviest work load, but I felt each assignment was very valuable and that is where I felt I learned the most, so it quite manageable.",
    "The combination of small responses that required reading and thought, and one large project felt very appropriate.",
    "One big project, and then just enough to make sure we're thinking. As not a member of the theatre mgmt program, i might be uneducated - but the midnight deadline is a an absurd, unnecessary, ridiculous construction.",
    "I really enjoyed that the workload involved the sort of critical thinking that allowed you to prepare actively for the class. I also felt that it wasn't so large that there was ever an excuse not to be prepared, which meant everyone was always on the same page in the classroom discussion."

    "I felt the syllabus was very clear. Sometimes the scope of the projects felt more \"corporate oriented\" and was difficult to understand without a background in business.",
    "This was a nicely organized class with some really strong techniques used to prompt discussion in class and to put our knowledge and readings to use. Everything we did felt purposeful and useful.",
    "I think it was a very informative, well outlined class.",
    "I didn't understand the order - or maybe the guest speakers didn't fit at what felt like appropriate times.",
    "a. Syllabus was clear and communicated effectively b. I'm not sure what the logical sequence was supposed to be. I know we started more on the hiring end, and ended more on the firing end but the arc is a little lost on me I think. c. Everything we needed was always up on v2 d. I really enjoyed the mixture of lecture and discussion. We were really encourage to contribute and feedback, which led to a more thorough learning environemnt. e. I'm not sure what this means!",
    "Classes V2 felt a bit disorganized towards the end trying to search for the articles we were supposed to read. The e-mails out made it extremely helpful to just click the link and access it though.",
    "It would be helpful if the material on Classes V2 was organized. It is possible to create folders and sort materials on Classes V2. It was often difficult to find assignments and readings in the jumble. Folders or better titles on the files would help. I would also appreciate the Powerpoints in digital form on Classes V2. This could also save paper if students don't want a printed version."

    "She was very responsive to questions, and led classroom discussions that were in depth, but did not dwell and rarely got \"stuck\" in any one topic.",
    "Vicki clearly knows her stuff. Perhaps if i'd understood more of the trajectory of the class, I'd've been able to follow better.",
    "I can't say good enough things! I wish there were more courses and instructors like this. Very energetic and invigorating, active listening and responding to students comments and encouraging contribution and thinking. She was fantastic.",
    "Vicki always seemed prepared and asked the appropriate questions of the class to get us to engage in whatever topic we were discussing. I also liked the outlines and notes she made on the board to bullet point lists and points.",
    "Vicki has been one of my favorite instructors at YSD so far."

    "I loved having Laura in class for the diversity training.",
    "Laura Freebairn-Smith was very engaging. It was difficult to get through her lecture - more content than time, and I would have appreciated another opportunity (outside class? voluntary?) to finish the lecture. Esther from Kolby was also good at presenting. I thought that her content was very valuable. It's important to know one's own tendencies and strengths, and this class filled an important role.",
    "I loved our diversity training and I wish there was more. In fact, I think there should be a whole course or more workshops in it for all students.",
    "The Kolbe woman was fantastic. The other was fascinating, interesting, and pretty cool - but lacked detail, relevance to the course, and therefore meaning. We could have just watched her (hypothetical) ted talk instead.",
    "Esther - Kolbe: This was fantastic! It really helped quantify some thoughts I had had in the back of my mind about building a team. It really put language some choices I'd made in the past that I wasn't sure why I thought they might be good choices. Also the self analysis portion has already proved helpful in terms me approaching my work here at YSD. So that's pretty neat. Caroline - legal issues: She was also great. I wish we could have gotten more time (isn't that always the case?). It would be neat if a longer session could somehow be managed. Laura - cultural competency: This is one of the topics I felt quite well versed in, so frankly I could have taken or left it. However, if anyone at all was not familiar with this than it is vital to keep it in the curriculum. Absolutely.",
    "Diversity was awesome. I would take more of her."

    "I felt that I've gained alternative perspectives on something I've been doing informally for awhile. I feel I will use this information (especially the job description and how it relates to the mission) for the rest of my career.",
    "a. There were some parts of the course that I felt for me I already had a grasp on, and there were others that were new and a certainly learned a bunch on. b. I think I understood it all? Some of the CEO, money making examples we used as case studies kind of escaped me overall but I think the point of the exercise was clear and I learned from it. c. It was kind of more about learning a way of thinking then it was retaining specific information. I think the language about employment will really stick. d. I'll probably use most of it daily without thinking. Hopefully some aspects I won't have to deal with, but we shall see!",
    "I think we covered a broad range of topics that are all applicable to how we may approach management in any type of company. I think the case studies were extremely useful in applying theories and general attitudes to specific personalities and how we would all deal with them, or unique ways to address situations."

    "Outside of having a better understanding of handbooks, I am not sure how applicable the final project was. I really enjoyed having the opportunity to interview and research a professional theatre, but I felt the presentation strayed from what we had learned through the course of the class and it became a just a information session on a theatre.",
    "It was difficult to work with a randomly (or instructor) assigned classmate on the final presentation. Also, the time deadline on those presentations could have been enforced more strictly (or at least been more underscored on the assignment sheet), so groups were more conscientious of the duration.",
    "Again, I would suggest more time for diversity training. Also, it would have been nice to recap the expectations for the final project before it was time to present.",
    "I wish we received grades on assignments on a more regular basis.",
    "This was my favourite class this semester. The amount of discourse and encouragement for everyone to contribute and share each others experience was really great. I felt like I learned a new language in a way, and I think it will be very useful in the years to come.",
    "Overall great course!"
