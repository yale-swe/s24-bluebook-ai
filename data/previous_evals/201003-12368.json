   "comments": [
    "It's not like the best class ever, but if you have to take it, then do.",
    "The lab class is an extension of what you learn in intro physics. It went great with phys. 260. It isn't too bad if you get a good instructor and take the class with a friend-- Nikhil was a great lab instructor whom I'd highly recommend. The class can definitely be a bit tedious at times, but there are no lab reports to write afterward, so it's a trade off.",
    "I would only take this lab if you have to. Don't expect to really learn anything here. No one really seems to know what's going on. The handouts are really poorly written and the labs are not designed well.",
    "Nope.",
    "The experiments are interesting and actually improved my understanding of several subjects I had studied in class. I took this first term, and with what I learned in AP phys. C, none of it was completely foreign. I don't think waiting a semester would have made a difference.",
    "No. If you don't have to take a phys lab why would you? That being said, it's not a whole lot of work, almost none outside of class. Just 4 hours of pain every week.",
    "I came into the course with very miserable expectations and was happy to find that it was not as bad as I expected. This course is really only of interest to physics majors and your enjoyment of it probably depends on your aptitude.",
    "It's a challenging lab course which tests, more than understanding, your ability to write a lot quickly. I would recommend it only for those who are truly interested in learning it.",
    "If you liek physics, you do get to play around with stuff, but most of the time you are so stressed out that you are not understanding anything that you don't get much fun out of it. Therefore: I would not recommend this class until they change the structure of the course.",
    "This is an intense physics lab, only take it if you want a challenge",
    "It's not too difficult at all. Some of the labs are even interesting. The final exam is a little tricky but nothing impossible if you've prepared for it.",
    "Very hard course, but also quite rewarding.",
    "This lab is great for people who like to tinker around with a topic for a few hours and not have any homework afterward. I felt like I learnt a lot each day and learned just as much as I wanted to learn. Also it's a great class for people who need to learn concepts by doing. This is sort of the premise of the lab: although we may not be equipped to understand mathematically a lot of the topics, we can gain a conceptual understanding through experimental measurement. A word of caution is that this lab assumes a fair amount of knowledge about circuits and E&M is not covered in first semester physics courses, so either you should have a decent background with circuits, or you might consider taking this lab in the Spring.",
    "This lab course focuses on methods of data collection and analysis, with a strong theoretical component involved in much of the analysis. About half of the semester focuses on mechanics and gravity, and the other half focuses on circuits and various circuit elements such as resistors and capacitors. The use of the oscilloscope is emphasized. All work is done in-class; lab notebooks and handed in at the end of the session, so there can be significant time pressure to finish experiments. However, the experiments are planned so that you should have just enough time. I believe that this lab is more valuable, if more challenging, than the Physics 165 lab course, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore methods of measurement that they may not have seen before.",
    "Physics 205 is a lab that should be taken by students who already have a good understanding of physics. Each week a new lab is completed with a relatively short write-up.",
    "This is a great course that for little outside-lab work offers great rewards in familiarity with circuits and other lab devices and expanded knowledge of experimental calculation and some natural phenomena. It always provided work during the alotted time for experiments, yet provided little stress. It is a must-take for anyone interested in physics or engineering, and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "This lab is less work than others because there isn't much outside work. You complete an online quiz beforehand regarding the upcoming lab and then all the write-up stuff is done during lab. However, the lab notebook is VERY important than and the grading for that seems somewhat arbitrary. Plus there's a practical\/written final. The labs are OK, some are fairly interesting and others aren't but you probably don't have much of a choice about taking this lab anyways. You will learn a fair amount of useful techniques though.",
    "I would recommend Physics 205L to a fellow student, based on the fact that it has pretty interesting material once you get past the laborious labs. In particular, I really enjoyed learning about error analysis and connecting it to my stats class. There is no written work required outside of lab, but it is probably smart to spend some time reading the labs. You basically can never finish a lab on time, so lab time was quite stressful. Overall, however, I felt the material was pretty interesting."
