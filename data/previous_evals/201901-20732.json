    "This is a very chill coarse work wise, but you can learn a a lot from the topic which is great. There were only 2\/3 homework assignments over the semester and a final group project (presentation and paper) at the end of the semester. The only thing to take note of is that since it's a seminar that only meets once a week, sometimes it feels like class goes on forever.",
    "Professor Maggi is fantastic. Wish there had been more discussion.",
    "Lecture was long but informative",
    "It's a stress free class. The professor is pretty nice and that makes learning much more enjoyable",
    "Strengths: interesting final project and problem sets, though would be more interesting if there were more problem sets over the course of the semester (perhaps more shorter ones instead of two longer ones). Prof Maggi is very interesting Weaknesses: a lot of overlap with Econ 184 (international econ)"

    "Yes! It's an enjoyable course, not too much work and the professor is great.",
    "Yes, but it is not very challenging.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Professor knows what hes talking about and the class is relaxed in a way that makes it easy to learn",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yeah! I think trade policy is for every econ graduate. You can develop pretty good insights which will take you far",
    "Maggi is wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable. Class is generally a lecture format, which can be tough for the whole length of a seminar if trade policy does not particularly interest you. Workload is very manageable."
