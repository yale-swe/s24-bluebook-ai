   "comments": [
    "A great course for majors and a real gem for non-majors.",
    "I highly recommend this course, even if you are not an ENVE major but have strong quantitative abilities. It allows you to appreciate the complex processes that go into water treatment; processes that we are so far removed from in everyday life.",
    "Take it if you have to or have a particular interest in the subject.",
    "ENVE 377 was a great overview of water quality control in the developed and developing world. It was not too intense and the workload was very manageable while still being enough to facilitate learning and understanding. 6 problem sets (1 and 6 were long and difficult, 2-5 were short and easy) and 3 midterm exams (the first 2 were really easy, the last one was really hard.) Peccia is a very fair grader and makes the class interesting. If you're in ENVE, it's required, but if you're a different engineering major looking for an elective, this would be a good choice.",
    "The psets can be a little tricky, and the final was harder than expected. but generally, the course load is not that big and it's a very interesting subject.",
    "It's a pretty narrowly-focused class, going real in depth with waste water and drinking water treatment. Honestly I don't really see how I'll use the information in the future, but it is a pretty big part of environmental engineering. I suppose some concepts are useful to be exposed to as they might be reused in other sectors of environmental engineering. With Peccia, it's not a very hard class.",
    "Water Quality was a decent class. Nothing riveting, but if you are an ENVE major, then you have to take it but you definitely don't have to dread it. If Peccia is teaching, that is probably another added bonus. Inherently, the subject matter wasn't the most fascinating - we talked mostly about Waste and Drinking Water treatment - but given what we were learning, I thought that the class was decent.",
    "EnvE 377 is not the most challenging of courses. The exams are rather easy. The homework load isn't too demanding with psets assigned every couple of weeks, although the problem sets can be at a higher level of difficulty than what's covered in class and you definitely should avoid leaving them until the last night. The book isn't much help, though sometimes it does contain the information needed to figure out a problem or two on the homework. Between office hours, class, and email, Professor Peccia and the TF provide plenty of opportunities to ask questions related to the homework. Professor Peccia is very engaged with the material covered in the course, and his enthusiasm--and occasional stories--help to make class an enjoyable experience. The material discussed covers a wide range of topics related to water quality engineering, but the class proceeds at a good pace and you never feel like you're drowning in too much information to make sense of it all. The information covered is fairly standard (e.g. treatment trains for industrial water\/wastewater treatment), but Peccia is willing to take time to discuss more interesting topics such as water treatment in the developing world (unfortunately, scheduling issues left less time to devote to this topic than originally envisioned). Professor Peccia makes this class an enjoyable, informative, not too challenging experience that I would definitely recommend for those interested in the topic.",
    "A relaxed but informative class. I certainly learned a lot of things in this course, though a good amount of it is plug-and-chug. At the least, each aspect of the formulas is explained in enough detail to understand why the formula is the way it is. The workload is very manageable, and tests are very fair. A problem set every 1.5 weeks, two midterms, a final, and two pretty cool field trips to water treatment plants."
