    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I was interested in the period coming in, but I think that even had I not been, the subject matter was rich and broad enough and the teaching engrossing enough that I would have enjoyed the class regardless.",
    "Appropriately paced; reading list provides comprehensive survey of criticism to assist study of the poems; writingassignments consist of informal protocol presentations (based on 4-5 p. written responses to the poems) and a final research paper (with a brief progress report to the class). A 20-minute presentation on a topic of choice was also required. I have thoroughly enjoyed this class - it has deepened my appreciation (and comprehension) of Middle English and manuscript culture, introduced me to the working group\/presentation format, facilitated my use and understanding of criticism, and allowed me to study some of the most complex and enjoyable works (poems of Cotton Nero, St. Erkenwald) I have ever read."

    "I am an undergraduate with no prior exposure to medieval literature. This course has deepened my appreciation (and comprehension) of Middle English and manuscript culture, introduced me to the working group\/presentation format, facilitated my use and understanding of criticism, and allowed me to study some of the most complex and enjoyable works (poems of Cotton Nero, St. Erkenwald) I have ever read. I am very glad to have taken this class."
