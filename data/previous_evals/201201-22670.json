    "Loved this class, loved Maripaz, straight forward material, just do it.",
    "yes!",
    "Take it! It's a good class if you want to learn more grammar points and begin testing your reading\/listening\/comprehension skills in film and literature. It's not hard, not too much work.",
    "you start to learn higher level grammar stuff, still learning vocab, pretty much the same as L3",
    "L4 Spanish is a pretty basic, normal Spanish class with grammar, vocab, stories, videos, etc. I would recommend it to anybody who is fulfilling their language requirement or wants to get a good grasp on grammar.",
    "I would recommend it as a gateway to L5, where I think the most improvement can happen.",
    "I would only recommend this class if the student needs to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a good L4 spanish class compared to what heard from other L4 Spanish students with other professors.",
    "This class is very similar to L3 Spanish. The novel at the end is really not that bad: it's really short and the chapters are only a couple of pages long each. Lots of daily work, but the tests aren't that hard. Maripaz is a pretty good teacher and a very reasonable grader."
