   "comments": [
    "how to write! or at least baby steps towards that reading as writer",
    "This class definitely made me a better writer. This most important skill I learned in this course, was how to write to persuade people that don't already agree with me. This skill definitely needs more refining on my part, but this class created a really good foundation for it. I also learned how to give my writing a sense of urgency a little better.",
    "My writing in general received so much attention from this course, and it has genuinely influenced how I will think of reading in writing in the futures, in all of the essays I ever write from now on. I have a better understanding of analysisinp texts and understanding how my writing appears to and affects others.",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester! It was an incredible \"reading for craft\" approach to a huge mix of material (from David Foster Wallace to Joan Didion and beyond). We learned to examine the techniques authors employed to imply their meanings and nudge their readers toward realizing these implications. I also think that the process of reading for craft also helped me read for content more precisely, as well.",
    "I learned how to carefully craft a nonfiction essay and use specific techniques to enhance and clarify my writing.",
    "I learned the skills to write non-fiction in a creative manner. The insights from Professor Shirkhani and the other students were incredibly helpful; advice was always constructive and useful. I especially learned a lot from the one-on-one meetings with Professor Shirkhani.",
    "I have become a much better writer as a result of this course. I've also learned to, as Professor Shirkhani says, read like a writer. I am a lot more aware of how language is being used when I read now. It's really changed the way I read.",
    "1) how to read creative writing from the lens of a writer, to analyze the technique used in order to engage and influence the reader rather than for content 2) how to improve my creative writing through organization, word choice, tone and concision More specifically: how important the placement\/ordering of words within a sentence influences clarity",
    "One of the most important things that this course taught me was how to read and analyze texts carefully, a skill that I had not developed in high school. I learned that every word in a work serves a purpose, even if that purpose may not be apparent to the reader at first."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "really well designed weakness - maybe more essays that are not by American writers?",
    "The variety of genres kept this course interesting. The peer workshop that everyone had to take part in was also super helpful, because it really reinforced the skill of \"reading as writers.\" I also loved how all the readings in the course were clearly pertinent to the present day, because it gave the class a sense of urgency.",
    "English 120 is a standard Yale cut-throat class in which you're immediately informed from the onset that only one person in your 17 (give or take) -person class will receive an A at the end of the semester. Essays that receive A's are supposedly publishable material. There's a lot of pressure that accompanies this specific layout of the course, but it also pushes you to try your absolute best. There is a lot of helpful and patient support from your professor if you seek it out, and oftentimes this is the most effective way of improving your performance.",
    "I wish there was more workshopping\/one-on-one essay work than reading, but the readings were actually very interesting.",
    "The small class size definitely helped the learning process because it allowed for close relationship building with the other students and the professor.",
    "I love how the course was organized by genre. That made it easy to say what type of writing worked for what genre. I also loved how we workshopped each other's essays- getting feedback from peers really helps. I really enjoyed the readings and even writing the essays. It was very different from my other classes and served as a nice break from them. I also really liked how we had to turn in drafts and got feedback from the professor before turning in every paper. Turning in what I thought was my best and then having the professor push me to do even better really improved my writing.",
    "I loved this course. The only issue was the timing of the classes: 9am is not a time conducive to engaging class discussions. At the end, Professor Shirkhani addressed this, but it would have been nice to have more model essays closer to the length that we had to write. Strengths: -workshopping and critiquing one another's essays -meeting with Professor Shirkhani for essay feedback -super engaging and fun readings",
    "One of the things that I liked about this course was that we got to discuss each work we read in class so I could pinpoint the things I had missed in my initial reading of the text. This was really helpful because I got to hear different viewpoints on the techniques each author used."

   "comments": [
    "yes, really helpful for reading and writing",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. I will really help you improve your writing without having to write an insane amount, the readings are a little much some days but they are extremely interesting so they never feel like too much. This class will also help you learn about yourself as all of the writing assignments are reflections. You don't need to be an English major to succeed in or enjoy this course, since you only ever write about yourself. And even if you don't have an English-inclined mind, everyone will be able to find something to say about the readings because they are so relevant to the present day.",
    "I would recommend it because it genuinely improved my writing, and not just in scholarly forms of writing, but in a very significant and personal way.",
    "I definitely recommend English 120 to any student looking to improve their writing beyond just writing about other writing. 120 is a class that challenges you to reflect upon your own thoughts and stances on situations, and to craft an essay of implication that convinces your reader to think in the same way. At first I found \"reading for craft\" (the 120 slogan) to be extremely difficult because I had never done anything like that before. But as we analyzed more and more material and pulled out the techniques authors employed over and over again to strengthen their voices, I came to really appreciate the critical, carefully placed thought pattern behind every piece of writing.",
    "Definitely. I think it greatly improved my writing, and the workload was very reasonable.",
    "Yes, I think this course is definitely part of the Yale experience. This skill is useful in many contexts and I would take the course again if possible.",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student in any major! It's a lot of fun. I used the homework in this class as a study break from my other work and really looked forward to going. It gives students the opportunity to write about anything and get a lot of feedback on their writing. Everybody could use that, I think.",
    "I loved this class, especially because I love reading and writing creative non-fiction essays. Professor Shirkhani is a pretty dope professor who is incredibly understanding, helpful in her essay feedback, and just a chill professor to have teaching this class. The atmosphere of the class itself depends a lot on the people in the class, since it is very discussion-based. Mine happened to be a 9am, so everyone was always too sleepy to have very engaging conversation. Yet, Professor Shirkhani still managed to lead such wonderful analyses of the essays. This course will definitely teach you how to write with such wonderful clarity and better organization, if you allow yourself to really engage with the course (i.e. do the readings and put a lot of effort into your edits). There are also required drafts and edits, which is helpful for procrastinators. It is quite a bit of work, since you either have a draft or a final paper due every week, but it is worth it. The readings are also a joy to do because they're generally short stories or fun essays that I probably would read for fun anyways.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course. Although it can be challenging to read as an author rather than a reader, I think that doing so helps us gain perspective on our own work and allows us to try out new techniques in our writing."
