   "comments": [
    "Pretty standard math class.",
    "I would only recommend Math 120 to someone who has to take it for a major requirement. The material taught is not intellectually stimulating - the syllabus is really just designed to get a large volume of students through the material.",
    "Kat really did her best with a difficult topic. She provided bonus problems, was always free and willing to help, and even compiled review packets for the midterms and final. It was hard because she was so nice but the material was just horrible. Don't take this class unless you absolutely must, or unless you're willing to accept whatever grade you get. I took AP Calc BC in high school and got a 5, and I went to every class, did every homework and did relatively well, and studied an obscene amount for the final but I still felt like part of my soul died. I actually wrote \"sorry\" at the top of one of my pages because I felt my answer was that bad. The first midterm isn't too bad, but afterwards everything just gets crazy confusing because there are so many ways to evaluate line\/surface integrals that you don't know where to start. Good luck if you take it.",
    "This class on multivariable (pre-)calculus can be wonderful if you make an effort to understand the material on an intuitive level, rather than simply cramming the formulas. (Make sure you always do the former, especially in the last part of the course.) Kat Orekhova does a very good job of conceptualising the material and is able to explain it in an understandable manner, although sometimes the content of her class would simply be going through what the Stewart textbook says about whatever topic.",
    "This is a straight-forward multi-variable calculus course. Its workload is average and tests are predictable. Does not go particularly into theory and does not get excessive. Great for non-math majors.",
    "The course is laid out quite well, the homework assignments are predictable and manageable, and the assessments are fair. Many students who take the course have already taken a similar course before, though, so there is very little to no curve.",
    "Well it was a little tough for me but thats only because math isn't my strongest suit. I guess I would recommend it but I'd suggest to get help if you don't understand something because waiting to see if you eventually understand the material doesn't help at all.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is a requirement for your major, but not otherwise. The subject matter is as interesting as the professor makes it, and mine did not make it very interesting. That being said, if you enjoy calculus for its own sake, then you can probably get some enjoyment out of this class."
