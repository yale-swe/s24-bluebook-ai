   "comments": [
    "This class is exactly what you would expect. We read a few pages of Greek each class, wrote two papers, and had a midterm and a final exam. Prof Greenwood is very good.",
    "This is an excellent Greek prose class. We covered a significant but not overwhelming amount of text, reading almost all of book II plus selections from books I, VI and VII. We also discussed receptions of Thucydides and some secondary literature (mostly from the last 20 years - which I enjoyed and which represented a nice change from most other Greek classes here). Classes had a satisfying balance between translation and discussion of the work.The assessment was vocabulary quizzes 1 or 2 times a week, two medium length (2500 words) papers, a midterm exam and a final exam. We read a total of 79 chapters in Greek, which comes out to about 4 chapters per class.I have studied Greek for a long time, so I found this workload manageable. If you are new to Greek (ie you are coming from L4 or a similar level) I think it would be fairly challenging, because the reading is significant and Thucydides is an exceptionally hard writer.I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Greek history or historiography, or anyone who wants a good prose class under their belt. Also, if you plan on taking the departmental exam in Greek, you will read almost all of the Thucydides on the reading list in this class.",
    "Thucydides is tough, but Professor Greenwood is fantastic. This was easily the most enjoyable and rewarding language class that I have taken at Yale.",
    "Excellent. Challenging and profitable. Professor Greenwood is incredibly clear and receptive to different ways of interpretation."
