   "comments": [
    "A great class. Forces you to know your stuff. Professors are funny, and really smart. Interesting discussions. Moose is great with bad puns.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a seminar style class in which you read a seminal biology paper (or two) each week and discuss them for a couple of hours. You really have to read through the papers extremely carefully and know your stuff because your entire grade is based on participation. Just don't be afraid to speak up, and if you are nervous about speaking (like I am) just force yourself to do it.",
    "This class is incredible, definitely the coolest bio class I've taken. You probably won't get in unless you're a senior MCDB major and have taken biochem, genetics, and cell bio (or Wolenski's cell bio lab), but if you have the opportunity to take this seminar, don't let it go. Basically, you get together once a week with 15 or so students plus 2 incredible professors and talk in depth about 1-3 important journal articles. I learned a lot, not just in terms of material but in terms of how to think about scientific problems and read journal articles. Mooseker& Rosenbaum have great chemistry as a duo, and you'll hear a lot of hilarious stories about the wild lives of biology researchers (seriously). No written work: just show up prepared to think critically and present the reading once or twice. My only complaint was that it was no fun walking up to KBT at 7pm and then walking down after 9, sometimes as late as 9:30",
    "Yes, absolutely! Take it if you can. It's a great class to take (especially as a senior) because it takes all of the textbook knowledge you've been learning over the past few years and applies it to understanding real science. The structure forces you to come to class prepared. You won't do well unless you actively participate.Prof. Mooseker and Prof. Rosenbaum compliment each other very well as co-teachers and pay attention you can really benefit from their immense collective knowledge base.",
    "You read one or two land mark historical papers each week, and hash them out for two hours. You really have to read these things. You go over step by step methods, results, impact, and how you would do this differently with today's technology. If you don't like speaking in front of a group, don't take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, but would warn that it's not AS great as these evaluations might describe. It's way different from your typical biology course: no boring lectures, tons of pages of tedious reading, or stupid memorization. This course forces you to engage very deepling in several important cell biology papers. It enforces active learning, and it really improves your paper-reading skills. However, it's a very big advantage if you have a strong background in cell biology. If you don't, it might be much more difficult. Personally, I didn't find the papers interesting; it's not the professors' or the course's fault. I just happen to not enjoy cell biology very much. In all, solid course to take senior year for a req...no writing requirement, no final anything, but pretty intense, not too interesting reading. Oh and did I mention the Professors are great?",
    "Yes! It's a great opportunity to interface with faculty that you don't really have elsewhere.",
    "Landmark Papers is an excellent way to get students thinking critically about the journal articles that they read - what does it mean to do this procedure? Why did they use this system for their analysis? Why is this a breakthrough, and what do we know about the topic now? You really can't be shy and take this class, and you have to prepare a lot to be able to say intelligent things at each class meeting, but it ends up making you much smarter and better at reading research papers. The professors are hilarious and definitely try to make sure everyone participates, even pulling you aside to let you know if you aren't talking enough, and the class gets to be a close-knit group by the end of the semester. Really nice to have a bio seminar in the middle of all the huge lectures, so I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "The course was a good senior seminar. There aren't many opportunities to take seminars within the biology department, so I would take the opportunity if you get it. The course is different from others, and you will develope a different set of skills. There is no memorizing. Your grade is based solely on participating, thinking, and questioning.",
    "Great seminar-you learn a lot about techniques and the big picture of different research topics.",
    "This is a great seminar if you're interested in biology research. It's a little intimidating - your grade depends mostly on class participation - but the professors are great and class discussions are really good. A good class to balance out text-heavy lecture courses, or to take a break from them."
