    "This is a great class that guides you through pencil drawing, charcoal, and eventually drafting. THe assignments are interesting, if I dare say fun. It is quite expensive: between both classes, expect to spend $1000, probably $200-300 from this class. That being said, this class pushes you on whatever level you are as an artist, and helps you to gain your confidence as a drawer. Go to the TAs, who are awesome and unbelievably helpful, unlike the TAs in Analytic Model who are useless. They have a perfect sense of what needs to happen in your drawings.A few suggestions--include a lot of contrast in your line weights, get rid of excess lines--be a minimalist, and see astounding results.You can spend hours on the drawings, or only a few a week--it all depends on your approach, and how much work you do on what you want before you sit down to draw. Don't be intimated by the work--it's never that bad. It's sad but true--the less ambitious you are, the more you can focus on what you have, and the stronger your drawings will be.Really enjoy the little community that forms out of this class, analytic model, and your TAs. You'll be dancing on tables on the weekend, getting insomnia cookies delivered to you the night before the review--it's just a great way to form a tight-knit group, so relish in it.",
    "It is an intensive drawing course that really improves your drawing skills from repitiion. It is great to draw all different kinds of things from paper bags to the elevation of the Yale Center for British Art.",
    "If you're majoring in architecture, this isnt that big of a deal and you'll find good ways to do it, and you'll stay on the weekends to be on top of it and stuff like that because it matters a lot. You'll also hate some of the assignments and it will probably show in your work, but that's okay because everyone hates different ones, and the ones that you enjoyed working on will look good! I'm guessing everyone who tries hard get's good grades, but trying hard means trying REALLY F**KING HARD and going back to the same drawing like 6 times to make it perfect, so don't be too comfortable with that statement.",
    "If you're thinking of the arch major, this class will teach you all the basics you needTo know and experience about architectural drawing and successful visual communication.",
    "An enormous amount of work, particularly after spring break. I would recommend this class to anyone who has a love of drawing or art for that matter, just know that it will take at least 25 hours a week by the end of the semester.",
    "Yes! If you like getting your hands dirty, becoming close friends with a small group of people through your mutual suffering, and just like to draw and physically engage with your environment. Arch 154 will teach you to perceive your surroundings and think in a drastically different way. Disregard all warnings about how much your life will suck because if you love doing this, you'll be susbtantially happy even when you're sleepless, exhausted, etc. Plus you'll have each other (ie, everyone else in the studio who is in the same position)",
    "Anyone interested in the architecture major should take this class regardless of drawing background",
    "Fun, interesting class. Victor is really nice and will always have good, constructive advice. The TAs are amazing, and you will grow to love them as well. Bottom line is, if you liked drawing assignments in intro to arch you will love this class. Less work than Analytic Model for sure, but equally as rewarding if you really try to push yourself.",
    "It's a great drawing class, even for non architecture majors. Still, don't underestimate the workload. You feel pushed throughout the semester and think that it's tough, yet when you start drafting you realise you had no clue how much time you were going to invest into a single drawing. By the end of the semester, you look back and can't believe just how much everyone has improved. It truly is a fantastic course, and like Victor says, knowing how to express your ideas on the spot through drawing is a priceless skill to have. Get on it!",
    "You should obviously take this if you are planning on majoring in architecture. If not, I don't think it is worth the time commitement unless you are amazing at drawing. I spent at minimum 10 to 13 hours per week on the class. Don't worry too much if you haven't drawn that much before, there are people at all levels who take the class and are successful.",
    "Yes! Take it even if you're not an architecture major. If you want to learn how to draw in a super intensive setting, this is it. Expect to spend lots of time on your drawings, but then to look at your portfolio at the end of term and be amazed at what you've accomplished.",
    "Great course. This course teaches you not only to draw but to see in a completely different way. Very soon into the class, you may find yourself gazing down hallways trying to figure out just how quickly the perspective lines begin to fade.Certainly not for the faint of heart, or for non-architecture majors. The course claims you need no prior drawing experience--technically true, but impossible to produce good work if you haven't had quite a bit of exposure already.For all architecture majors, who have to take the course anyway, you will not regret it. Victor Agran, and all the professors for that matter, care tremendously about their teaching and it really shows. You will not find other professors as dedicated."
