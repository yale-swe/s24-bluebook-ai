   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload isn't really as bad as it was portended to be, the reading, although sometimes dense, was always interesting and this course really does help improve your writing skills.",
    "Take English 120. You don't get the chance in other English classes to write this way. You will also learn so much about how to write well yourself, not just how to analyze the work of other people. And Professor Chapman is a really smart, engaging, and understanding teacher--you can't go wrong!",
    "Close readings of modern essays, with topics ranging from serious to lighthearted. Several personal essays addressing different topics or styles.",
    "The class was overall fun and interesting. The readings were a lot and with the 5 essay you have to submit it took was one of the time consuming classes of mine. Still, I enjoyed the lectures and discussing the readings normally led to great discussions.",
    "I think it was overall a great opportunity to really get into the discipline of writing regularly, and to meet people, explore ideas that we've never considered to be topics that could potentially be wrought into a piece of non-fiction writing. But in terms of how great your experience is, it really depends on the section.",
    "In English 120 you read an assortment of different styles of essays, and write five different essays. The class also includes workshopping your peers essays. I would highly recommend this class. I have never particularly enjoyed English classes, but I loved this class and I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "If you have not taken an English class at Yale and need a writing credit, just want to take a writing class, or love the New Yorker, then take this class. The readings are extremely engaging and reasonable to complete. The essay writing process is pretty structured and the professors are great with providing you with advice as to how to make your essays better. I was recommended this class by a student who had already taken it. She said that it was her favorite class of the semester. After taking the class myself, I whole-heartedly agree.",
    "English 120 is a great course that will help you improve your writing ability. The readings were all very interesting and we wrote five essays in the term. While the class is labeled as the Modern Essay, the writing requires great amounts of creativity too. If you are considering taking Eng 120, Professor Chapman is one of the nicest and most knowledgeable professors, so definitely shop her section.",
    "I would totally recommend this class, especially as a refreshing break from writing academic papers. It's a great way to find and begin to develop a writing voice of your own, and you read phenomenal essays that make you appreciate the craft of essay writing.",
    "I would say this class is worth taking whether you need a writing credit or not. I do not particularly like to write but this class was still fun for me and I actually liked the essay topics. I thought this class was much better than English 115.",
    "Reading and Writing the Modern Essay is an excellent introduction to the craft of nonfiction writing. Reading several short essays for each class meeting means exploring a variety of authors, subjects, and writing styles. The readings alone made the class worth taking. Discussing the craft points of each piece makes you appreciate essays in a whole new light. The five units (personal experience, place, profile, cultural criticism, and satire) built well upon each other but also introduced a fresh set of challenges.",
    "This class was awesome. I needed a writing credit and heard awesome things about 120, but was always too afraid to take it because of my lack of confidence in my writing abilities. However, I decided to take it anyway, and I could not havebeen happier with that decision. This class has been an amazing experience and I feel more confident in my writing than I ever have before. If you are an award winning author or a math\/science person who just needs a writing credit, you too have something to learn from this class.",
    "No, if you need a WR it's not bad. Your writing will certainly improve and you will find some fun readings, but the class time was lacking in good discussion and insights.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, but I wish I took it later, as opposed to first semester freshman year."
