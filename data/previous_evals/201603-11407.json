   "comments": [
    "I pretty much learned an entire new grammar structure, alphabet, and beginnings of a language all in this one semester course! It was really cool to watch the build up of knowledge and be able to apply it all in the final projects.",
    "I fully learned how to read, write, and speak Hebrew in a seminar-style class setting centered around discussions and both in-class and out-of-class practice. We also came upon insights regarding the use of the language and its connection to different peoples.",
    "My knowledge of the Hebrew language really grew from this course. Both my written and my spoken Hebrew improved significantly over the course of the semester.",
    "Reading and writing the Hebrew script, lots of basic Hebrew grammar and conjugations, lots of useful vocabulary.",
    "I learned how to write, speak, read, and listen to Hebrew in a variety of settings.",
    "This semester I learned basic present tense Hebrew grammar and now can hold a conversation on a variation of topics. I feel very comfortable with the verb conjugations I have learned, and I developed the pretty important language learning skill of memorizing verbs and other vocab. I especially appreciate learning how to write and read, and I really have enjoyed cultivating the skill of Hebrew writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that it is a pretty small course, so you can really get face time with your professor that you just can't in most other classes, and that it tries to give you real life experience with the language! I think the class could do better by adding even more relevant readings to today.",
    "This is a very strong course. The fact that we were truly immersed in the language and culture both in and out of class - including attending dinner discussions and Israel-related events - made it a real learning experience.",
    "This course is a great introductory language course. It requires a lot of work, but the proper amount for learning a new language.",
    "Strengths: lots of individualized attention, constant practice and reenforcement of all four linguistic skills, and the availability of many different learning materials (online exercises, discussion sections, songs, etc.) Weaknesses: Some of the vocabulary was unnecessary, or at least could have been postponed until a higher level course (e.g. butterfly, agriculture). I thought learning that last three binyanim in successive weeks at the end of the semester was a bit rushed; maybe it would be better to spread them out more, or only learn three this semester. Would have liked a bit more reenforcement of vocab from earlier in the semester.",
    "This course is extremely geared towards teaching kids who do not necessarily have a strong background with Hebrew. This is very helpful because it allows for kids to slowly develop their skills, even if they are not as familiar with the language as their classmates.",
    "My weakness is definitely on the speaking side, it's hard to have a spontaneous conversation after only a couple months of Hebrew instruction. I also have difficulties with pronunciation. My strength is constructing well composed written essays for class."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend any one interested in learning Hebrew or just seeking a language credit to try out the class!",
    "I would recommend this course to others; in fact, I already have! This course is appropriate for anyone interested in learning how to speak modern Hebrew, whether because they have cultural ties to it or want to learn it from scratch and have no background.",
    "Yes! It is a great class if you're interested in learning Hebrew.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who was committed to learning Hebrew because it's well-taught and fast-paced.",
    "Absolutely. This course requires a lot of effort, which makes the language so easy to learn. Once you take this class, you are immersed in Hebrew and in Israeli culture.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who has a passion to travel to Israel or if they are undecided about what language to take. It's a course that creates a tight knit community, and has been a positive part of my Yale experience. The workload is demanding time-wise but you'll really be able to speak and understand Hebrew beyond your expectations."
