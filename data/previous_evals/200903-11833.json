    "This class is a broad introduction to different methods of art criticism. It is a required class but I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Cooke.",
    "This course is not only of the best, but also by far the most useful, art history course I have taken at Yale (and I've taken 8 so far). Everyone who teaches it does it slightly differently, so try to take it with Professor Cooke if you can. The course itself, as he organized it, was a topic a week, for example \"Formalism\" or \"Social Art History,\" and you read 3 or 4 articles and write a 1-2 page reading response. Very manageable did a great job of including art of all sorts of periods and cultures, so no matter what your favorite area is it will probably be included somewhere. He also made sure the discussion was grounded in analysis of actual art, not just talking abstractly about the theories, which was really nice. The course itself, as he organized it, was a topic a week, for example \"Formalism\" or \"Social Art History,\" and you read 3 or 4 articles and write a 1-2 page reading response. Very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend HSAR 401 to all history of art students. It's a requirement for the major, though I might suggest that they take it their junior or senior year and not earlier than that. I would also recommend the class to anyone who is interested in art or art historical theory.",
    "of course! It changed the entire way i look at art history.",
    "Fantastic discussion based class. Each week was a new engaging topic and I feel so much more knowledgeable about my major now. There is no final paper, but instead weekly reading responses. The reading is a lot, but worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if you have an interest in critical theory and want a broadened perspective of different ways to look at art.",
    "Obviously majors have to take this course-but if you can take it with Professor Cooke. He was AMAZING. The readings were long but interesting, classes included weekly fieldtrips to the YUAG, BAC, Furniture Study, and all over campus. Very interesting course.",
    "Prof. Cooke is WONDERFUL. This class is tough, and it will challenge you to think about the field of Art History in ways you never did. You'll find some topics really interesting, and other weeks, you'll finish the reading in complete confusion. But, with Prof. Cooke, you can be sure that you'll leave seminar feeling very confident about the week's topic. It's also a great class for getting to know the other art history majors and hearing their ideas, which is the class's greatest reward.",
    "Critical Approaches is an essential theoretical background for anyone interested in art history. Even if you're not a major but are serious about art history, you have to take this class! And Professor Cooke's syllabus is amazing and he is incredibly kind. Definitely take this class -- I learned so much and can't imagine how I didn't know this stuff before."
