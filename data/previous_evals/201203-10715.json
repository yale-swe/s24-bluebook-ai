   "comments": [
    "The organization is a bit of a mess, but the material is important and, frankly, fundamental to consider when doing biological engineering. I would recommend any student take the course, though for best understanding I think doing the book readings is important.",
    "Biomaterials begins with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of materials science and then examines how different classes of biomaterials (polymers, ceramics, metals, and natural materials) vary in materials properties and how these materials are therefore applied to different biomedical solutions. This class does require a basic understanding of biology and chemistry, and without the knowledge the class would be a little more challenging. Otherwise, it is a good course for other in the BME department to consider.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. It is an overview of biomaterials and gives the student a better idea of recent developments in the field. It was an enjoyable class.",
    "A well balanced mix of biomedical engineering and materials science. Yes, I would recommend to other students."

   "comments": [
    "This course filled in some holes in my understanding of materials science which I believe will prove useful in advancing my research.",
    "This course allowed me to gain further insight on research on surface modification and novel materials that I otherwise would not be knowledgable. I also learned basic materials science testing methods that will be helpful to know in the future.",
    "This course directly prepared me to perform my research, which is a synergy of materials and biology. Anjelica was an excellent resource for feedback, ideas, and information. I'm soglad that I had the opportunity to take this course!",
    "The overview of materials and the in depth discussion of polymers was extremely useful to my study and evaluation of polymer membranes. The concepts of protein\/cell adsorption should also be highly useful."
