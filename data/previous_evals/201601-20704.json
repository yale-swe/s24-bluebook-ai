    "A fun class, relatively easy but a lot of steady work! Best language class I've ever taken, not too hard to wake up every morning at 8:30am for because class is relatively easy and mwalimu is a good teacher.",
    "Great language if you struggle learning a new language.",
    "Definitely take Swahili if you are at all interested! It's a fantastic class, I have nothing but positive things to say and I'm very glad that I took this chance to start learning a new language.",
    "The class is an introduction to Kiswahili that is enjoyable and informative.",
    "It's a little harder grammatically than first semester, but if you study a little, you'll be fine. Also really try to do the readings without Google translate. If you do, you'll get a lot better, and it'll be easier to remember the grammar stuff since you've seen it used. And, of course, ask questions because all the professors have been great thus far.",
    "Definitely take Swahili! It's a lot of fun and very interesting, and the workload is pretty lighthouse and manageable."
