   "comments": [
    "It is a time-consuming class so you might as well be dedicated to it and learn the languages. Tests are half speaking every week.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student who is interested in French. The Yale French program is renowned as the country's premier French language program and I certainly believe the hype after taking the class. It features a unique form of immersion developed at Yale in the 1980's by Professor Pierre Capretz with his \"French in Action\" program. Not only is this program fun and interesting but teaches French really well and really quickly. Taking the final exam, I was shocked as to how much I retained form the course that I hadn't had the time to study during reading period! It is really phenomenal and the teaching is some of the best language teaching at Yale, if not the best. It is a very difficult course though so be prepared!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to any student who is interested in French. It is a tough but very rewarding class.",
    "YES!!!! The language is really useful. the class is difficult but manageable. there are tests every monday and homework everyday but by the end of first semester you feel you've learned a lot.it's not hard but it needs proper work like every language. only problem was we didn't get enough speaking practice.",
    "I would certainly recommend French 110 03 to a fellow student. The course travels at a steady pace, allowing one to build on what they've learned. You feel truly accomplished by the end of the term. I found that the setup of the course, with a weekly video and workbook exercises, made learning the language a very natural process. A 20 out of 10. 2 thumbs up. etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 110 03 to another student. It is the French class you would want to take if you want a teacher who honestly cares about whether you understand a lesson and a teaching style that allows you to improve in both your writing skills and your speaking skills.",
    "Yes, i would recommend it. Its an intense course but you definitely feel like you have learned a lot by the end o the semester.",
    "Its useful and fun in the third week or so when you get past the initial hangups of how difficult it will be. If you take it then do it with Candace Skorupa and you will not regret it."
