    "You are asked to create a theater piece every week. Take this class. Easily the best class I've taken at Yale. It requires a LOT more time and thought than most classes, and demands equally of your heart and mind and creativity. But you will learn so much. Take it, take it, if you have any inclination of going into the theater, take it.",
    "This was a course that challenged and stretched me in valuable ways. It allows students to grow in a lot of ways. It is sometimes a bit overwhelming--creating a new piece each week, finding actors, etc. is very demanding, especially when you have no idea how your piece will be received. You might work very hard on a piece only to have it not be received very well. On the other hand, you might come up with an idea that the class finds compelling for one reason or another. It is a challenge and teaches you about the use of certain techniques, but there is also some randomness involved. But, then, there is randomness involved in how we as audiences view and judge performances in any setting. I would recommend the class to students who are interested in really stretching themselves as directors or performers or theatre makers of any kind.",
    "This is a very important class to take. It changed the way I work in the theater. It also demanded a lot of psychological and spiritual recourses. You will be spending a lot of your week obsessing about your assignments for the class (you make a ~5 minute piece of theater every week). You will have to ask a lot of people for help. I found the class both humbling and freeing."
