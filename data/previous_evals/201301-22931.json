    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in art. This is a great course that deepened my conceptual understanding of art and sculpture. The reading was challenging and very interesting; it explored the philosophical basis of sculpture and conceptual art. The technical expectation was high so it was intimidating at first. However, I feel that there was more emphasis on the conceptual ideas conveyed in the work, which I loved.The time you put in really depends on what your specific project is, as some pieces could have taken five minutes and another ten hours, so that seemed a little arbitrary. It could have been a little disorganized at times, and I often didn't know what to expect or what I needed to prepare showing up to class.",
    "Great class. This is exactly how i would expect to art to happen.",
    "I would highly recommend this course."
