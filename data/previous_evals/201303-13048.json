    "Thought I came to Yale with great confidence in my conviction to become a medievalist. This course has had such a profound effect on me that it has led me to think that perhaps I would find equal intellectual fulfillment as a Renaissance scholar. The course allowed me to become familiar with major critical voices in the period and to explore my interest in gender. It has also inspired to pursue further study and research on the period."
