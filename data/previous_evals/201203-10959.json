    "Yes, I would highly recommend the course to someone who is interested in the topic and is motivated come prepared to class, speak-up and spend a long time writing about\/reflecting on the subjects.",
    "This class discusses the various definitions of \"resilience\", especially in the context of conflict and health. It will discuss the various definitions to the point of exhaustion - but it will do so in such a way that the weight and appropriateness of a certain word within specific cultural contexts will resonate with you and you will understand how something as simple as a single word can change a study, plan, and an intervention. There are many lessons that will be learned in this class that are not listed in its course description. The readings will facilitate ideas and the discussions will broaden your mind.",
    "This course covers topics related to conflict and health, specifically how individuals can remain resilient when exposed to situations of extreme adversity. It was a small, tight-knit group, making class discussions really rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me an opportunity to delve into and discuss current issues in the field of risk, resilience, and health, as well as the chance to meet with a number of renowned professionals in small settings. I've never been in a course this small (5 students) and really appreciated getting to know the professor and other students so well.",
    "This course stimulated my thinking and opened my mind to new ideas and new ways of looking at the world. The knowledge base I now have will help me be a better, kinder, and more culturally intuitive physician to my patients."
