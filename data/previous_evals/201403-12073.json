    "A great continuation of Russian at Yale! Your conversation and abstract language skills will improve greatly, and you finally get to read good Russian literature in the original.",
    "Irina is so, so lovely. Please take this class! She's happy to discuss anything Russia-related, from literature to current events to religion. (You should probably go to her office hours!) Also this is the only way you're going to maintain your Russian. (!)",
    "This is a great course. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to improve your Russian.",
    "The course is really great. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to improve your Russian.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for students hoping to continue studying Russian and beginning to attempt reading some real Russian literature.",
    "If you want to continue taking Russian, this is definitely a great class. Similar to other Russian classes, but Irina is one of the best professors in the department.",
    "Russian 160 is a great review of Russian grammar, grounded in interesting and varied readings. I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to improve their Russian."
