    "I would recommend Japanese Screens. I think it was the \"dark horse\" of my semester, one that seemed like I was fulfilling a requirement for my major, but then became a very full and wonderful class-- one of my favorites. I think some people think that it's a very specific thing to study, but in fact Japanese screens are essential to understanding Japanese art and culture. (Plus sometimes there is a trip to Kyoto over Spring break!)",
    "Yes! Definitely take it. Easy course load, interesting topic, and a lot of fun."
