   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as largely a waste of time. I found it impossible to learn anything from the lectures, and I found myself searching through textbooks and the internet in attempt to learn something relevant to what we were supposed to be learning in this course. It baffles me that the department has let this course go on this way. I would not recommend this course to anybody for these reasons.",
    "No. Should take the one offered in the Physics department instead.",
    "I regret to say I could not recommend this class to another student. Perhaps if it were a smaller class, with more focus it could be useful to someone already very experienced with coding, but for the level it was aimed at, it was not.",
    "A good course for learning programming basics.",
    "Getting a familiarity with some common methods and techniques is definitely important, and an important thing for any student to have.",
    "Since this course is required for all graduate students, this will be less of a recommendation and more of a description of what is to be expected. As the course stands currently, I would tell new students that you should be very clear at the beginning of the semester what you would like to cover in the course, and make sure you ask that projects have well-defined goals and deadlines as early as possible (this sounds strange, but will likely help you not bash your head against a wall at the end of the semester). I think you can get a lot out of this course and professor, but it will take some dedication."

   "comments": [
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of my field. I am doubtful that it will contribute to my research.",
    "Helped me learn programming in C",
    "I am not certain that I will use many of the techniques and methods I learned in this class in my own work, but a passing familiarity with all of them will certainly come in handy.",
    "From this course I learned bits and pieces of how code is compiled an run on computers. Basic techniques for numerical differential equation solving and integration are now clear to me, and I finally think I'm starting to understand how Monte Carlo techniques are used (especially Markov Chain-style techniques)."
