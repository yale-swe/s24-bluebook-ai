   "comments": [
    "I loved this course and found that I learned a lot by the end of it. I don't really think there are any weaknesses.",
    "gooooooooooooooooooooooood",
    "The material is very interesting. And the instructor is very good at teaching.",
    "I thought the course was a great overview of important concepts in health policy and econ and their applications to current events and politics today. Lecture was entertaining as well. Class is a bit long, so taking a 5-minute break in the middle would be great. It would also be good to have a way to check grades online as we progress.",
    "Excellent blend of economics and policy - could even go a little further and assume more knowledge for those who have already taken other courses in the policy program.",
    "good",
    "The strength is the amazingly condensed amount of content in the lectures. We learn so much every lecture, and the assigned readings are on point as well. The bi-weekly health policy memos are challenging, but nourishes critical thinking. I can't think of a weakness.",
    "Overall, this was a pretty solid class: it's not a super exciting topic, but you get a great overview of health care in the U.S., and I feel like I'm coming out of this class with some solid health econ knowledge. Cooper is an awesome lecturer, if a little sure of himself. The policy memos were quite useful as an assignment -- though I feel like towards the end of the semester they veered away from the topics addressed in class, and thus required outside reading. That was not clearly articulated, which was somewhat frustrating. Overall, a great foundational course with a few very minor kinks to work out.",
    "Strengths: policy memo writing skills, the subject matter",
    "This is an interesting overview course. Cooper discusses fairly basic, but fundamental health care realities and economic concepts. The briefs are a great idea and an excellent way to measure student understanding and to get people to cultivate an important writing skill. For those who concentrate in health policy, it is primarily review. The class could benefit from higher expectations of what the students need to learn and take away from it.",
    "Strengths: the actual material covered was great, the memos were a great learning tool Weaknesses: the organization of the lectures seemed a little haphazard",
    "I think the knowledge is useful. But I kinda don't agree with the way he teach. basically, if you read all the reading material, there is nothing exciting in the class.",
    "Good class for someone interested in health econ. without much background",
    "I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, this course has the potential to teach us a wealth of information on the US health care system from an applied economic perspective. However, I constantly felt that we were just brushing the surface of topics and not diving into them to a level I wanted. I recognize that students in the class have varying knowledge of economics and health care policy, so that the course content can't speed through and must accommodate each student. But as a health policy student, I needed and craved a more rigorous course. I didn't want to sit in class and learn the definition of capitation for the zillionth time. This course was useful, but too easy.",
    "This is in my top 3 courses at YSPH. Prof. Cooper knows what he's doing and connects every class to the (current!) real world-- something other policy classes sometimes fail to do.",
    "The strengths were the teacher (Zach Cooper) and the policy memos. I thought the assignments were fun and very practical. I also learned a lot from them. One weakness could be that the class was big in size, so sometimes when people were on their computers or having side conversations, it was distracting. The class is definitely in high demand, so bigger class sizes make sense, but I might have gotten more out of the experience had the size been smaller.",
    "Basic course in health economics. While I didn't always want to write them, the policy memos are a great part of the course.",
    "This course really helped me understand so much about the health care system, which is important not only as a future public health professional, but also as a consumer of health care. The memos are also a valuable assignment in terms of skill development and learning the course material. Lastly, exams are very fair.",
    "Good survey course on US health policy\/econ. I definitely do not understand why this is a mandatory course for policy students as the material overlapped heavily with the intro health policy course. Recommend either not making it mandatory or making it a much more in depth course. I do not feel like I learned economic principles to the depth I expected or wanted, especially after taking the intro micro course.",
    "A great course that covers crucial information that every health policy concentrator should know. I really enjoyed the course materials and readings. However, I would strongly urge administration to reconsider providing this as a core health policy option for non-health policy concentrators. While I still gained quite a bit from the class, I was hoping for a deeper dive into the course material - I wanted a more upper-level health econ and policy course but was in class with other students who didn't even know how to properly structure a supply and demand curve. In that sense, I think the course could be enriched and strengthened by restricting it to just policy students and diving into greater complexities.",
    "The course provided a good breadth of information and understanding of economics' intersection with health policy in the United States.",
    "Needs consistent grading on the memos. What the professor wants is NOT WHAT the TAs grading the memos want. And the TA's grading system is nonsensical and way subjective. For example, TAs will dock points for not including one aspect in a memo, only to dock points on another memo for including the aspect. Having little mistakes can cost you major points. No rhyme and no reason to the memo grading system. Definitely needs work for consistency and clear expectations for the memos. And the \"sample memos\" consist mostly of 8+page memos that don't really help with our 2 page limit. Only 2 of the memos are 2pages. I would highly recommend having blind grading, where TAs do not see the student's name."

    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Prof. Cooper was very engaged and made it incredibly easy to pay attention during the entire two hour lecture. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Amazing and dynamic professor, learned so much",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Gooooooooooooooooood, He is super nice!",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Charismatic. Good at leading discussion and controlling flow of the lecture. Good at conveying ideas.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is approachable, charismatic and clearly well-established in his field. His lectures are clear and concise, and he gives memorable examples to talk through more complex concepts.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Intelligent, interesting, and a great speaker. A little full of himself, but hey, I would be too if I had done the things he has.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is evidently a professional in the field of Health Economics, and his expertise was clear throughout his lectures. His syllabus covers very important themes, and has a nice flow throughout the term. He was skilled in combining lectures with discussions.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0See below",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great teacher with so much knowledge, interesting stories and perspectives. Available to help you with material and is able to explain it in a way that makes sense. Very honest",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is great at explaining important concepts. He also assigns wonderful readings. However, I often felt that he focused on the main takeaways to the detriment of some of the more complicated underlying issues.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0great teacher makes every class fantastic!",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Strengths: extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, great instructor\/professor Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Intelligent but talks about LSE a lot",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0You can tell how knowledgeable the professor is, and how passionate he feels about US health economics. I think we could have sat with him for those 2 hours and hashed through so much. But he had to speak in a way that didn't confuse the entire classroom. I just wanted so badly to hear more about his thoughts on exchanges, privatizing health insurance, the ACA, etc. I did feel at times that he didn't want to be there\/didn't prioritize teaching. On many occasions he ended class early (either because he breezed through his slides, or he had to catch a flight somewhere). He also showed up late quite often. Felt a little slighted, but whatever. I'm over it.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0See above. In addition, Prof. Cooper engages almost all class members and answers questions thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zach was incredible. Not only is he engaging and entertaining in class, but also he is incredibly amenable to student feedback. He had just the right balance of being chill and also expecting a high quality of work from his students. I met with him a few times outside of class to talk about life and vocations in general, and he was super helpful. Zach is so passionate about the material he teaches, and it is often hard not to get excited about the material when he is teaching it.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Talented and engaging instructor. He brings the class in and leads discussion well.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I cannot say enough great things about this course and Dr. Cooper. Having taken micro and macro economics in undergrad (and struggling through those courses), I can confirm that Dr. Cooper does a fantastic job of breaking down economic principles in an understandable way. Although the class was 2 hours, it always felt much less because Dr. Cooper has a way of keeping students engaged and interested in the course material.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is obviously well accomplished and knowledgeable in the field. Unfortunately, it is quite evident that he does not have his teaching requirements as much of a priority. It would be helpful to all of his students if he were more available after class and not constantly leaving to travel or readily pushing people's questions off to the TAs.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is a fantastic lecturer and teaches the material with knowledge and expertise.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He was a great teacher and attempted to spur discussion in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0The discussion seemed to be a bit restrictive to class participation, questions seemed to remain unanswered despite the instructor suggesting getting back to them in future classes.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Very good instructor. Learned a lot. Very knowledgeable. Very good at breaking down complicated topics into concrete bullet points. To improve: make sure the TAs are on the same page in terms of grading. Make the grading system for memos clear and consistent. A memo I spent a few hours before class writing got the same grade as one I spent writing 1 week in advance, with drafts to\/exchange with the professor beforehand. There is no clear system, and grading is unpredictable, subject to the mood of the TA for that day."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to students. It gives a thorough explanation of health policy and provides multiple perspectives of the US healthcare system (as well as healthcare outside of the US). Your writing will also improve through the almost-weekly policy memos, without even trying.",
    "Challenging, but worth it!",
    "Gooooooooooooooooooooood!",
    "Yes for those who have similar interest in healthcare economics.",
    "I would recommend. A broad overview of policy and health econ concepts. If you do the reading you will get a lot more out of the lectures and the memos will come more easily. Develops your memo writing skills as well, which is key!",
    "Definitely take it! A great culmination of health policy and the underlying incentives that shape the decisions we make.",
    "good for basic understanding of health policy",
    "Overall, this was a pretty solid class: it's not a super exciting topic, but you get a great overview of health care in the U.S., and I feel like I'm coming out of this class with some solid health econ knowledge. Cooper is an awesome lecturer, if a little sure of himself.

    "This course has been one of my favorite policy courses so far at YSPH. It ties together other policy courses without being redundant. You are able to learn new things on material that you may think you know, but really you only have just scratched the surface. Also, Dr. Cooper was right about policy memos, it is a necessary skill that you will appreciate and value. After the first few, I enjoyed writing policy memos for the course.",
    "This is a great class but it is very similar to the introductory health care class and Health Care Strategy and SOM.",
    "I think this course is a must-take for anyone in public health!",
    "take the fall one. this one is not that good. too much policy memos",
    "If you know nothing about US health care policy and economics, you'll do fine. If you know a lot about this topic, opt out and take something more advanced.",
    "This was a great introductory course to health economics and policy. I had never taken an economics class before, so I think I learned a great deal from it. The workload is very doable and the classes are fun. Also the material is very relevant to everyone's lives, so it was hard to not be engaged. Zach Cooper is AMAZING.",
    "Very basic course. It's very similar to healthcare strategy in SOM and seems to repeat much of what we've learned in two years. I think it's a great course for first years, but repetitive for second years.",
    "The class is helpful in understanding the fundamentals of health policy and for practicing writing policy briefs.",
    "Take it because you will learn very important topics in health economics and policies. But make sure you do your memos EARLY, and send copies to the TAs, or whoever is actually grading them for comments. Prof and TAs have different and inconsistent grading systems. Least favorite TAs in the world."
