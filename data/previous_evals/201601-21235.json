    "Pretty good class, the lectures are definitely interesting if you're into evolution or are premed. Wagner's lectures can be kinda boring tho and all the slides are online so it's pretty easy to not go (you should tho, bc he's brilliant and cares a lot about the material). Three midterms, straight memorization. The class is essentially uncurved with 95=A, 90=A- etc so it's not too hard to get B+\/a- but A requires perfection. I aint mad at this class, it was solid, I'd give it an A-.",
    "Take it!",
    "Good, interesting class to take if you are interested in comparative or even just human anatomy. The tests are very fair as long as you go to lecture and do your fair share of memorization. No homework, and the entire grade is based on 3 midterms.",
    "Minimal workload -- just 3 exams and virtually no reading or other assignments. This can be great or scary depending on how you do on the exams. Sometimes it's hard to know what to expect for the tests because there is so much information covered in lecture. I would recommend trying to synthesize the information and major topics as you go along otherwise it can seem as if you are learning information randomly. I would recommend you take the lab (E&EB 291L) at the same time as you take the lecture because it will help you do better. Having spoken to other students who took them at different times, I can certainly say that I am very happy I could take them simultaneously. Gunter is a good lecturer and very funny. Just be sure you give yourself enough time to study before exams and you should be fine! Sometimes things can be difficult to understand but he always takes questions in class.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student!",
    "Fascinating course, especially for those interested in the origin of structures and behaviors! Although I am not in this department and am interested in medical school, I sincerely enjoyed taking in all of the volume of information on other vertebrates \/ invertebrates! Understanding biology from this perspective proved to be quite useful and opened my mind to a new field.",
    "Interesting class and material but there is a lot to get through. The slides presented are very informative which helps with review but you'll probably have to go through them a few times to get everything. If you really want to know about this material then I would recommend otherwise maybe try to take something that is a little easier if you are taking this course for fun.",
    "This class is fantastic. It changed the way I view ecology and evolutionary biology. Honestly, I wish there were follow-ups to this class where I could learn more developmental biology.",
    "Its a fun class! No outside work is a major plus, and I personally really enjoyed the material. It's definitely memorization heavy, but nothing unusual for a bio course.",
    "Great class, a lot of material to keep up with, but still worthwhile.",
    "If you are interested in anatomy, development, or organismal biology, E&EB 290 is a good choice of course. Prof. Wagner is excellent; he really knows his stuff and is a very fun lecturer. You'll learn mostly about anatomy, both that in humans and in various vertebrates, with additional discussions of development and evolutionary biology. Some of it will be repetitive if you've taken an organismal biology course, but not much, and you'll get new contexts. The workload is fairly light - just three midterms, no final - but this concentration can also cause problems. For example, we had a midterm on the same day that the E&EB senior thesis was due; this was a real challenge. Still, very much recommended."
