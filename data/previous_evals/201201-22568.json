    "Music 303 is a music theory course that challenges students in both composition and analysis. Music 303 also taught me a great deal about music performance through in-depth study of music. I would definitely recommend the course to any musician.",
    "great class, friedmann is awesome and you learn a ton.",
    "Wonderful course - friedmann can be tough at times and you need to put in a lot of worth, but you learn so much. An especially useful class for composers.",
    "If you seek any growth as a person and as a musician, take this class.",
    "This class gave me a new appreciation for classical composers, especially Mozart. Definitely a rewarding class. It's great to have the experience of composing a full sonata movement.",
    "Do it do it do it!",
    "This course was definitely the highlight of my semester, and was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. I especially enjoyed the fact that we only studied a small number of pieces and were able to analyze them in real depth. It was very helpful for me to keep learning new concepts from the same handful of pieces, which I was able to become familiar with and allowed me to understand the nuances of their structures.I think the model composition aspect of the course was incredibly useful and also very fun. Having to write a composition the exhibited the structural principles that we had discussed in class was the best way of making sure that I really understood the principles and engaged with the examples we studied. it was also just very exciting to learn to write phrases and eventually a whole sonata movement in the Classical style! Another strength of the class was the amount of time Professor Friedmann spent correcting our assignments and giving individual feedback, which was especially helpful for the model compositions.Professor Friedmann does have very high expectations for the amount of time you should be spending on the class and how the model compositions sound, so you should be prepared to make this class a priority if you take it!",
    "I would recommend the course to anybody who really want to learn music from the Classical Period."
