   "comments": [
    "I was disappointed initially with how theoretical this class was, but did ultimately come to appreciate having a historical arc of environmental thought in which to place current views. Many of the readings were very good, if dense.The class was frustrating when I wanted to actually discuss the events, practices, environmental methods and approaches in the readings, rather than only their framing and theoretical context. Other EEB\/EVST students in the class expressed similar sentiments. I have heard that Political Ecology covered many of the same bases more effectively.Professor Carpenter is accessible and helpful in guiding each student through a self-motivated paper at the end of the course.",
    "Environmental Anthropology is a great course for those students who have not ever taken an anthropology course. Although at times it can be very theory heavy, the topics discussed and the manner in which they are discussed are intriguing.",
    "Great class! The readings are really worthwhile and changed the way I think about humans in the environment.",
    "This is a course in the history of anthropological theory regarding the environment. It totally changed the way I think about the environment, and I recommend it for everybody. I think the non-anthro majors in the class struggled a bit with the theory (as did I, frankly), but they mostly seemed to think it was a good experience. Every week you have to write thesis sentences for each reading, an exercise that was incredibly useful to me as a reader of academic writing. That was definitely one of the most important things I got out of the course.On another note, it is fantastic to hear Carol introduce each author at the beginning of every class. She knows many of them personally, so this is really fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a background or interest in critical theory, not necessarily related to environmentalism. It helped me break down dichotomies in my own thinking, and build up new ways of approaching everyday scenarios.",
    "This class will change the way you see the world. The material is fascinating. It requires a lot of thorough reading, but it's worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students considering getting involved in environmental causes worldwide. It was very challenging but I always wanted to work hard. It gives a good history of anthropology, which I was very unfamiliar with beforehand. The most important thing it did for me was change the way I think and read - now I will approach mainstream environmental literature with a more discerning critical eye.",
    "Great course in general--alternately theoretical and very case-specific. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the theories behind land use. Regular reading responses, two comparative analyses, and a substantial final paper you work on all semester.",
    "This class focuses on the history of ideas and theory in anthropology that centers on the issue: how do we influence nature and how does nature influence us. The readings are interesting and varied and writing thesis sentences (summaries of the argument of the article) for each one was the best way for me to really read the articles, think about them on my own and formulate ideas and questions to bring up in class. I wish more professors would ask their students to do that! The final paper is a big undertaking but very satisfying because it makes you synthesize ideas from the whole semester and apply them to a subject that interests you in particular. This class really made me change the way I think about everything around me, my relationship to the environment as well as others'. I would definitely recommend it (especially with Carol Carpenter)."
