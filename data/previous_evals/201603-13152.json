   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write more succinctly as a journalist and how to make a career in journalism. I also learned how to be a tougher journalist.",
    "This course helped me develop insight not just into the practice of writing itself, but also into the other components of journalism - interviewing, story mapping, revising, career planning, and more. I'm glad there was a bigger emphasis on the business of journalism and the role of the industry today than just on the quality of our writing. I learned about getting access, $50 word cuts, how to pitch, where the field is likely headed, and other real-world tips from a true expert, which was really valuable.",
    "In this class I thought a lot about journalism and how it's changing in the face of new technology and new problems. I now think more critically about the news I read, instead of simply reading all articles without criticism simply because they come from a reputable source. I also appreciated Prof. Brill's dedication to the course and his commitment to help us succeed as journalists.",
    "Really learning by doing, going out of one's way to unearth and excavate information, to follow the money",
    "I learned a lot about the field of journalism and how to take a better critical eye to my own writing and to others'.",
    "This class will teach you the business of journalism, how to give a good interview, how to work against hard deadlines",
    "This course was a productive, real-world peek into the ever-changing occupation of journalism. Learning through Brill's extensive and qualified personal experience in journalism was eye-opening.",
    "Probably the most valuable thing about Journalism with Professor Brill, especially at this particular sociopolitical moment, is that this class imparts (and stresses the importance of) the traditional ethics and practices that make journalism a vital part of democracy. From the first day forward, Brill makes clear that a journalist's duty is to be an honest surrogate for the reader. With that comes a relentless pursuit of the truth, a healthy dose of skepticism, and compassion. Journalism is ever more important--and endangered--moving forward. This class teaches how to take up the mantle.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the business of journalism and the nitty-gritty details and techniques of journalism. A SKILLS based class, which is fantastic to see in Yale College."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it's a great course for what it is meant to do, which is meant to provide an academic setting for students to learn about journalism. Steven Brill could not have been any better.",
    "This class really was great, strengthened by our in class discussions and the field trip we took at the end. Some of my favorite things in the course were that Prof. Brill would talk about his own personal experiences, which were interesting and the type of story we could only hear from an accomplished professor like him. I also liked the readings we did throughout, and loved the two assignments - the final more so than the profile - and am so proud and glad to come away from the class with those pieces under my belt. I think if anything, I would have liked to talk more about current events and a little less about healthcare, as we read and did a lot with the topic and definitely could have spent some of that time on other subjects.",
    "Strengths: great insights into the nuts and bolts of journalism Weaknesses: seminar time itself could have more in class discussion",
    "Professor Brill has taught this course for a long time so the syllabus is pretty well-tested. The assignments are enjoyable and all very useful in Brill's mission to prepare students for the field. I did think the career counseling that was promised could have been a little more guided for students that want to take Brill up on his offer to get them a summer job but may not know where they should apply.",
    "The course is not particularly structured and the readings occasionally feel like they have been assigned for the sake of it. Also, the ridiculous amount of time we spent on Brill's own \"America's Bitter Pill\" was not, in my opinion, a relevant use of precious class time.",
    "This course is really well mapped and planned. There's challenge and rigor but space to explore. Seminar is especially interesting with Professor Brill cold-calling on students.",
    "This seminar is pitched as a class primarily for students with a demonstrated interest in journalism -- and its composition reflected that -- but even so, it didn't assume a baseline-level knowledge. While that occasionally meant it got repetitive, it was nevertheless an interesting class from which I gleaned several nice tips and tricks of the trade.",
    "The strength : manageable reading, hands-on work, meaningful discussions and exercises, a workload that keeps students engaged without overwhelming them. Weakness: too much emphasis on the professor's own work and background"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES!!! Take this and not Bob Woodward's class. If you put in the time and are respectful and aren't jarred by Steven Brill's toughness at the beginning, you will have an amazing mentor for the beginning of your journalism career. Steven Brill really cares, and if you express that you care too, he will try his hardest to help you get jobs, connect with people, etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially someone who might be interested in journalism because that is definitely assumed of most of the students in the class. Regardless, we get to read a lot of insightful stories and reflections about the field, and it never hurts to get good practice in this type of writing - particularly with a professor who is really willing to give feedback and help everyone do their best.",
    "For any student considering a career in journalism, or who simply cares about good journalism, definitely take this class. Brill wants his students to succeed, and he helps us consider the intricacies of the journalism world. The work is different from any other classes I've taken, but we had freedom over assignments and got to explore journalism in new ways.",
    "If you want to go into journalism, yes. My writing classes at Yale have taught me to be a better craftsman, but this one taught me how to be a better journalist, in the practical sense of world, in all the messy realities and transitions that journalism is going through today.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in working in the field of journalism. It consisted of mainly 2 large assignments which were very time consuming but ultimately some of the most rewarding work I've done at Yale.",
    "Probably the most valuable thing about Journalism with Professor Brill, especially at this particular sociopolitical moment, is that this class imparts (and stresses the importance of) the traditional ethics and practices that make journalism a vital part of democracy. From the first day forward, Brill makes clear that a journalist's duty is to be an honest surrogate for the reader. With that comes a relentless pursuit of the truth, a healthy dose of skepticism, and compassion. Journalism is ever more important--and endangered--moving forward. This class teaches how to take up the mantle. If you're considering journalism, or care about the state of truth and knowledge and sanity in our democracy going forward, it'd serve you well to take this course.",
    "Sure, but with a few caveats. Take this class as early as possible and know that you're only going to get out as much as you put in. Professor Brill can be fairly off-putting, but he's willing to do whatever he can to help his students.",
    "Absolutely, if they have a strong and pervasive interest in journalism, and are willing to work harder than they've ever worked at Yale before."
