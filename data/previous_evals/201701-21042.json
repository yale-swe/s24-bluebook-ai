    "Psyc 477 was an incredible class and I loved every lecture. I've been taking psych courses all my time at Yale, and there has been significant overlap in most of the courses and I can honestly say I've never learned more material than in this class. It was always interesting and engaging, and viewing psychopathology through the lens of the family was honestly very exciting and eye-opening.",
    "Capacious insight into family systems and family therapy. Great overview of theory and practice.",
    "This course gave me a greater understanding of the importance of family dynamics and how they contribute to psychopathology. We learned about the many ways structural family therapy can aid immensely in the therapeutic process.",
    "Basically, I went from zero to a pretty good understanding of clinical psych and family therapy approaches",
    "This class was fantastic for developing skills for synthesizing different research topics into a strong, cohesive argument. I learned a lot of about historical growth and interpretation of psychology in America.",
    "Psych skills thy help to look at problems from different perspectives and not just scientifically",
    "Great class to learn about a wide variety of family types and issues and how these variously affect children."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the initial interactive part of the course, and was hoping that would carry through to the end of the semester. The presentations were definitely a strength, for it allowed everyone to learn about specific topics and then teach others, which is a fun set-up. I think the thought questions were a strength of the class, because it allowed us to engage with the material thoughtfully and more in-depth.",
    "The weekly reading responses served to keep students engaged with the material throughout the course. I also really enjoyed the student presentations. I do wish we had had a little more time for class discussions, as usually we were in a bit of a rush to get through all the material necessary for the week. By the time the end of the semester came around I was extremely grateful Professor Lockhart asked for outlines in advance. It made researching and writing exceptionally easier.",
    "This course was very well structured: the readings were fairly given, with plenty of free choice of responses, articles, and paper topics. It's a class that really lets you choose how you take it- choose the date of your presentation, choose your final topic, choose the stances you take on each weekly reading response. And the lecture-style seminar is great, because it gives you the vast information of a lecture while leaving room for intimate discussion.",
    "Good discussion but kind of lecture style not really a seminar",
    "The structure is fantastic. I love the seminar setting and the choice to do certain family \"types\" each week - it organized it in a really wonderful way. Only weakness would be the readings; they were all wonderful but SO many were assigned that it just wasn't possible to read all of them."

    "Anyone interested in abnormal psychology\/therapy\/families\/developmental psychology\/their own family SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "A great course!",
    "Yes",
    "This is a wonderful introduction to the role of structural family therapy. We had incredibly engaging discussions about a variety of psychological disorders and the role the family plays in exacerbating these conditions. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in psychopathology in general.",
    "Yeah, this class is great. A lot of triggering things, and a lot of possibly scary introspection. But an awesome course.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Lockhart is the once in a lifetime professor that Yale students crave: knowledgeable in her field, but open to new paths of discussion in topics she discusses. She's so adamant about engaging the students in each lecture, regularly pausing for discussion, commentary, personal anecdotes from students, etc. Definitely in the top five courses I've taken at this school.",
    "Yeah! Great senior class especially if interested in family",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course; while it isn't the most \"omg amazing slap you in the face intellectual\" class, it's very interesting and a great choice for any senior looking to take a senior seminar. It's not really a seminar tbh; there's a once a semester presentation you'll do, and the fact that it's easier to raise your hand and get questions answered in the smaller format, but otherwise it's just a small lecture. Still, each week will be a different family \"type\" (i.e., single parents, gay parents, mentally ill families, etc.) and you'll learn how these families affect their children psychologically. It's a wonderful class if you're interested in that and aren't looking for class discussions as much as just learning material."
