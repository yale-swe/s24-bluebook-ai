   "comments": [
    "You read a lot of black women's lit in this class, obviously. The material is really interesting itself. But what really makes this class is the other students in it and Professor Goldsby. We somehow lucked out and had 11 dedicated students with different and interesting points of view. Professor Goldsby is a wonderful professor - she's smart, listens to your views, poses interesting questions, and is hugely accommodating. TAKE THIS CLASS. It has by far been my favorite class at Yale.",
    "The discussions are great, the readings are great, the professor is great, what more can you ask for? Take this class.",
    "Without a doubt. The syllabus rocks, full of new discoveries, and two provocative plays I wouldn't have discovered otherwise, as well as the novels from the 40s and 50s. The workload felt very light, and I found myself strangely wishing for more reading and writing assignments - a wild emotion. Professor Goldsby is the ultimate discussion leader. She is chatty and opinionated and incredibly open. If you want a thematically narrow (in a good way) seminar, you want it with Professor Goldsby. Most importantly, the course was VERY FUN. I felt like we created a real \"sisterhood\" (plus one brave boy). The class usually ran 90 minutes (15 minutes over, after dark!) and I don't think anyone cared.",
    "Take it take it take it! You'll read amazing books, have great discussions about race and feminism (although this depends on your class and you should scout that out during shopping period), write interesting papers, and enjoy hearing Goldsby gift you with her academic brilliance each week. I genuinely loved doing the readings for this class and attending class each week to discuss. We also had a field trip which was an awesome extra bonus\/way to apply the lit we read to a larger social\/artistic context.",
    "A handful of texts in the Black women's canon - not exactly representative but better for reading distribution. Several small assignments that allow for some focused attention on texts. Seminar style, so class content is somewhat dependent on the quality of the class contributions. However, Dr. Goldsby is always good at supplementing discussion when students are able to get the ball rolling."
