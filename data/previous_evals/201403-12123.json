    "It's probably one of the easier electives you can take for the chemistry degree. Workload is light. Exams were reasonable, though a bit too short in my opinion; as a result, if you messed something up on either of the midterms you would lose 10% of the grade. The material itself is interesting, but Prof. Crabtree is not really that engaging as a lecturer and I'm personally not fond of being taught chemistry off slides. Take it if you're interested in the material or if you want an easy elective.",
    "so during my grad school visits everyone was so impresses\/jealous that i was taking a class with THE organometallic god. so i think for this you should take it. plus to interact with one of the most brilliant chemists in our time is kinda rare at Yale.",
    "Would recommend if you're interested in inorganic chemistry, but wouldn't otherwise. It's useful material but the class can be kind of hard to get excited about.",
    "A pretty decent class, though the lectures feel superfluous at times. I highly recommend the textbook. Not too much work, and the material is interesting.",
    "Kind of like 252 but with more information, the book is pretty helpful."
