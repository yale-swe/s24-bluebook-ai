   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class someone with a definite interest in the topic. The lectures cover a lot of information and can be pretty dry, but the labs are very fun and interesting. Prof. Sargis is very knowledgeable on the subject and will be a great resource if you have questions.",
    "Despite a great prof and TA, the material got killer boring by the end. And then it came time to memorize all of primate evolution for the last quiz, which was a horrible experience overall and really unsatisfying. There need to be some structural changes to the course in order for it to be effective and engaging. Less lecture and more lab is one way to start. Lectures are absolutely useless if you can't see the object he's talking about. Also, studying from pictures on slides is likewise useless-- you need to always have direct access to the specimens. That's the only way this stuff is going to make any sense.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who has an interest in primate evolution and phylogeny. By the end of the course you will have learned a large amount about most of the genera of primates. The workload is not too heavy, just a few lab reports and a final.",
    "Take this class. Very reasonable workload. Meets twice a week. Two lab practicals and a term paper. Great for anthro majors, those interested in animals, and\/or human origins. One of the more enjoyable and relaxed classroom atmospheres. Plenty of in-class labs that reinforce the lectures and let you get hands-on with a great specimen collection. A relatively hidden gem in my mind."
