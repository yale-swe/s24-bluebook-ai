    "One of the best, if not THE best, class I've taken at Yale. Listen to Lofton for two minutes and you'll know why. It may surprise you just how much religion has influenced popular culture, and vice versa. Whether you're a pop culture fanatic, don't care either way, or hate it, this class will make you look at popular culture with a whole new perspective. And the same goes for religion! I loved going to class, the readings were great, discussions were even better. The feeling of leaving class just dumbfounded\/shocked\/intrigued was a great one. She's definitely not an easy professor, and this is not an easy class, but you get to do some interesting assignments like short cultural critiques on songs, movies, etc.; an in-class presentation; and a final paper. Just awesome.",
    "Take this class. It's a fair amount of work, but the reading is interesting and the other people who take the class are great. Professor Lofton is an experience of her own, and you feel enlightened for having been in her presence.",
    "It provoked thought in typically mundane topics and issues. Who would have realized that Oprah is really like an empire of a religion (even though she herself does not believe in religion?) or the religious undertones in Star Trek? It was an incredible class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else! You will get to think about things you don't normally think about from a very different angle. The discussions are always interesting and Professor Lofton is really fun.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Prof. Lofton is hilarious and brilliant. Her teaching style may be overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of her rather fast speech you will have an amazing time. I learned more in this class than almost any other at Yale. It teaches you to see all cultural productions differently. The intersection of religion and pop culture is fascinating and fun. TAKE IT!",
    "I would summarize Religion and Popular Culture as an exploration into the complex relationship between religious expression and American popular culture through the frameworks of religion in popular culture, popular culture in religion, and popular culture as religion. Methodologies of popular culture analysis as well as a basic background in religious studies provide the framework for this exploration. While this sounds serious, the class is a ton of fun, with forays into raves, hip-hop, and cock-fighting, not to mention student presentations on their favorite items of popular culture. You\u0092ll never realize how much deep discussion a Youtube video of Justin Timberlake or Carrie Underwood can lead to. I would 100% recommend this class to any Yale student who is at all interested in American culture, religion, or would like to be more knowledgeable in these areas (it\u0092s a great primer of American popular culture if you know nothing about it too!). But only take the class if you can devote the time to at least skim the quite lengthy readings, otherwise you won\u0092t find the class rewarding.",
    "pop culture studies, proving that everything comes down to some type of religion, but not religion in the conventional sense. the workload isn't bad at all, which is a plus, but the class is better for more independent-minded students.",
    "Yes I would, saying that it is a class well-worth the student's time and with an instructor he or she will be better for having had.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture is, though the syllabus may claim otherwise, essentially a study of Popular Culture as a form of religious expression in America. And it's fascinating. Lofton is an amazing professor, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying the readings.There are four short writing assignments over the course of the semester and a final research paper at the end, though the class is really not a writing class. Very little time is spent discussing theassignments, including the final paper.I had a blast in this seminar. It is entirely American Studies in its execution, so if you like that kind of thing, take this class.",
    "the premise of the class points towards an idea that religion prompts us for the consumption of popular culture. i have already recommended this class, as well as, taking a course with kathryn lofton to my colleagues already."
