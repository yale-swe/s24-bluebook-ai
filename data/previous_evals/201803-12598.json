    "I love the workshops that is very practical in real work data utilization.",
    "Insights in data and the skills needed to conduct particular types of research Interesting speakers",
    "I was introduced to a slew of data software that can be leverage to solve emerging problems in environmental science. This was really great, because I have become cognizant of available state-of-the-art tools that can be very useful in solving not just environmental problems, but challenges in other disciplines.",
    "Lots of exposure to new data resources, and new techniques and software to handle various types of data visualization and computing",
    "A big-picture view of when to use what types of data analysis tools",
    "Great introduction to the world of quantitative social science",
    "This course gave me a great overview of different data science techniques, resources, coding practice\/actual code, and ideas for future research and coursework. I am very glad I took this course the first semester of my PhD, because (now that I have taken FES 611) I have a better understanding of what data science techniques are out there, I will be able to dive deeper into ones that are more specific to my own research as I continue with my education.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of what is possible in data science research. A lot of the methodology was new to me and I feel I have a much better understanding of different types of analyses and the tools out there to perform them.",
    "I gained a broad overview of the types of tools and environments that are available to data scientists, and the wide range of potential applications of these methods to social science and many other important questions.",
    "I learned different softwares to analyze data and learned more about what data is in general.",
    "How to obtain data from different sources such as the web scrapping social media and different social analysis software",
    "An introduction\/conceptual understanding of the range of data science applications that exist or are emerging, particularly in the context of big data; Introductory skills in using some data analysis and presentation\/visualisation programs: Tableau, SPSS, Python Scripting, LaTex Scripting; Some of the benefits and challenges (based on experiences, perspectives) of the data analysis techniques\/fields that we covered in class; Insights into jobs\/fields that are data-intensive, particularly provided by some of the external guest speakers."

    "It aligned with my expectations pretty well. I liked the workshops that I needed to attend during the semester",
    "knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned extremely well with my expectation expectations.",
    "It was pretty clearly outlined in the syllabus and covered exactly what I was expecting.",
    "I like the class discussion, the bootcamp, and the guest lecturers. The instructor and TA give us a good balance of structure and flexibility.",
    "It aligns well with my expectation",
    "Very well, I learned a lot about data science techniques that I did not even know existed.",

    "This class was pretty much exactly what I expected - very interesting high-level overview with some good discussions.",
    "I thought the class aligned well with my expectations.",

    "Very well. Justin outlined the course's intentions early and the course very much kept in line with those."

   "comments": [
    "Strength - great material overall, liked the exposure to various topics. Liked the flexibility of the course! Weaknesses - some of the readings were not really interesting Some discussions could be better moderated",
    "I feel like the boot camps were awesome, it provided an opportunity to try my hands on some of the software discussed in class. The only weakness I see is the time for the lecture, it was late.",
    "I really liked the workshop aspect of the class. It gave the class some hands-on technical experience that contrasted nicely with the spoken lectures. I also liked the wide range of speakers we had; I would actually say that I would've preferred more speakers or demos as opposed to student presentations.",
    "This is a pretty good course, everything is great!",
    "The flexible workload and bootcamps are probably the best part about this course. However, I wish the class could improve its time management",
    "Incorporating a final project might help apply some of the techniques we learned in class -- that is the only suggestion for improvement I can think of. Everything else was great.",
    "A strength is that the course covers a large variety of topics and serves as a good introduction to what analyses and tools are available for data science for social research. A weakness is that it is hard to know which topics you are interested in exploring further in workshops because many of the workshops occur at the beginning of the semester before a large chunk of the material is covered.",
    "The only thing I would change about the course is it would be great to hear a little more from Professor Farrell - the group presentations and guest speakers were all good, but I think the group presentations could have been shortened in order to give more time for us to hear from Professor Farrell",
    "I wish that there had been more bootcamps suited to qualitative data analysis.",
    "The course offered a great opportunity to learn different software to analyze data although not enough time to learn how to use the software well but one has an idea that triggers the interest to learn more",
    "The course was a good mix of conceptual\/theoretical instruction and reading, as well as flexible, practical instruction (flexible in the sense that students chose which areas of data science they wanted to engage with, and chose training sessions accordingly)."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Great as an intro class but might be a bit too general for those who are deep into data science",
    "I really recommend this course to people who want to have an overview of what data science is all about and how it can be leveraged to solve emerging environmental problems.",
    "Do the readings! They're very helpful for a good background on what the speaker's work relates to. Oftentimes, they also include interesting links and tools to play around with, too.",
    "Take this course if you are curious about big data and real world application",
    "This class would be great to complement your social science focus since it is practically scratching the surface and it doesn't take too much time investment",
    "Do a little research on all of the topics covered at the beginning of the class so you know which ones you would like to dive deeper into through the workshops",
    "This class doesn't have any busy work - it is a lot of interesting readings, exposure to great resources, and high-level discussions about data science applications. If you are looking for a hands-on data science class, this is not it, although the professor does provide a lot of in-depth coding resources if you choose to take advantage of them.",
    "take advantage of the boot camps and the stat lab staff to learn more on social science at CSSSI",
    "A great conceptual introduction to data science and various techniques, applications and fields of work and study that could be explored. Much more beneficial if you're already working with a data set for a project\/research (typically encouraged in any case)."
