   "comments": [
    "Everyone in the world should take this class. It was the best thing that ever happened to my freshman year.",
    "If you want to become a better writer then take it. the work load honestly wasn't that bad, it was rather steady and I never felt like it was out of control. Solid class for people who want to improve their writing.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to almost any student who's willing to put in the work to become a better writer. Because the writing assignments are more personal than literary analyses, they are good opportunities to reflect and write about things you enjoy. It may be tough while in the process of churning out so many essays and reading responses, but at the end you'll find it rewarding.",
    "This course was one of my favorites this semester! Rolf is an engaging and helpful teacher (not to mention an awesome person -- he's had some crazy adventures all around the world). You'll get to try your hand at many different styles of writing and read a lot of interesting essays. With an essay due every two weeks the class is pretty time-intensive, but if you will definitely get a lot out of it if you put the work in. Time in class is spent picking apart essays and figuring out how they work. We also got to Skype or talk in person with the authors of many of the essays we read. Rolf's feedback on essays is extensive and very helpful. If you want to get better at writing, this class is definitely the place to do it.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend it! i feel like my writing improved a significant amount within a short time period",
    "English 120 is great for almost any kind of student because it stresses a kind of writing few students have been exposed to with a traditional high school curriculum - personal writing. Almost everyone struggled with this concept at first (it shouldn't make you feel bad - we're just all very used to cookie-cutter argumentative\/college application essays). However, at least in my section, the different strategies that the professor used - reading sample essays, work-shopping our fellow students' papers, skyping authors of the published essays we read, close readings, and LOTS LOTS LOTS of revision and feedback on your own essays - everyone had notably improved by the end. Everyone says this class is a lot of work - but it's really not. It actually had the least amount of work of any class I took this semester (and NO, I am not a science or math major whatsoever). There are really only five essays (1200-1500 words each) that you have to write throughout the semester, each one a different genre (for us it was memoir, place, cultural criticism, personal profile, and satire - but I think it varies by section). Either way it was highly manageable. Truly, this is a great class for anyone who's looking for a fulfilling, yet not too time consuming writing credit (or someone looking to go into an english\/literature field as well. I'm not, but several people in my section were and they adored the class).",
    "Engl 120 is one of the must-take Yale classes. Potts is a good professor and has experience teaching in a lot of different settings. If you have a chance to take a class with him, do it.",
    "read really interesting\/important short essays and craft your own. highly recommend"
