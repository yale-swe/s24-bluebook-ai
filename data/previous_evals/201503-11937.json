    "ENGL 460 is a class where student poetry is workshopped to develop greater facility at the writing of verse. In tandem, contemporary poets of note are read to explore the state of the art. I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
    "Class was very literally divided between white men and everyone else. Like two halves of the table. Everyone else was cool.",
    "You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Great class with interesting prompts, good reads, and a wonderful professor. You'll get from it what you put into it.",
    "An amazing workshop course consisting of three main components: 1) writing one poem a week, with prompts ranging from poems written in response to artwork found in the University Art Gallery (so-called \"ekphrastic poetry\") to simply being asked to produce \"the best poem you've ever written\"...no sweat. 2) a secondary source reading about poetry or critiquing certain kinds of poems\/poets 3) a book of poems by a contemporary poet Each week you get a workshop with your peers and Prof. McClatchy of 1), and discussion of 2) and 3), mostly 3). Prof. McClatchy is fun, raunchy, NOT politically correct, opinionated, and a fantastic presence in the classroom. Be prepared for him to be unafraid to express his thoughts, positive or negative, and know that his praise is all the more worthwhile after being on the receiving end of his critiques."
