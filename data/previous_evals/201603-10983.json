   "comments": [
    "This course was challenging but one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. It allows you to engage with your data throughout the semester, and tackle the daunting process of writing a manuscript with the excellent guidance of Prof. Bradley.",
    "How to format and write a peer-review-able health paper; how to navigate the politics of journal submissions; how to work with classmates to discuss ideas.",
    "I learned so much from this course! I learned about how to develop and deliver a strong presentation, how to perform and present several statistical analyses, and how to write a peer-reviewed journal article. This course shed insight into the importance of developing a methodologically sound experiment and the importance of asking for help from more experienced researchers.",
    "Research writing and presentation skills! This class helped me to write my research paper in a way that no other class could have, and Prof. Bradley and other students in the class always helped guide my writing process and ideas. With the midterm and final presentations, I gained a lot more confidence in presenting and thanks to Prof. Bradley and my classmates' constructive feedback, I was able to improve a lot of aspects of my presentation style that I never would have noticed otherwise. It seemed like pretty much every student in the class also had this experience--the midterm presentations were great, but the final presentations were amazing! I'm really glad I took this class.",
    "I learned about the process of writing a research piece. I learned about qualitative and quantitative research methods and presentation of results. I improved my presentation skills and learned from my classmates.",
    "This course taught me the keys to developing a proper academic work. It added on skills that were being developed through other courses required by the global health program at Yale.",
    "Favorite class. We really built a community and engaged with each others work"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Bradley ensures that you understand how to write each component of the manuscript, and you learn how different types of research projects are presented. She gives very constructive feedback on drafts of your manuscript and is a wonderful teacher! You also learn about the projects of your classmates and present them with feedback to improve their work (and they do the same for you). This set-up is conducive to an engaging learning environment.",
    "The strengths of this course are its professor and structure. Professor Bradley makes this course what it is. Her knowledge, expertise, and commitment to students, make her an outstanding teacher. The course is structured such that students can workshop their projects in class and get feedback from the other students and Professor Bradley. This maximized the learning that happened, especially because you were able to apply what you learned from other students to your own project.",
    "The strengths are the size of the class, the level of students, and the amazing professor.",
    "The size of this course was perfect. We were able to work together to help improve each others projects. Collaboration and advice were an asset to this course.",
    "Each student has an individual project that they develop throughout the semester - most of us were working with data collected over the summer."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in writing a manuscript for past research -- it helps you every step of the way!",
    "Yes! Bradley is amazing and it felt like the course with the most \"real-world\" relevance of anything I took. Especially helpful if you want to go into global health post-grad, obviously, because you'll emerge with a publication-worthy product.",
    "Most definitely!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has done global health research and wants to learn how to write up their data in a meaningful way.",
    "Most definitely. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "If you did global health or medical research and you want to write a paper on it, this is the class for you! Amazing professor, amazing classmates, and it helps you structure your paper and organize your ideas. It also forces you to have a basically publishable paper by the end of the semester, so it's great to have that deadline set and hopefully publish your research!",
    "Completely, one of the best courses I have taken at yale.",
    "I recommend this course to all students who hope to see through the writing and construction of a useful academic product and how to present it."
