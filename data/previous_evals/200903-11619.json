   "comments": [
    "It is a great class and I would highly recommend it. It's not as bad or as hard as what people make it appear. Stay on top of the reading and it's pretty easy.",
    "I would summarize it as reading and talking about political philosophy. I would recommend this class to other people.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone seeking a liberal arts education. The thinkers read in this class are phenomenal.",
    "Class about the evolution of Western political thought.",
    "Not a bad course. The readings were interesting (and very manageable) and the lectures good for the most part. Sections could get stale at times so if you're looking for really enlightening debate take DS.",
    "Looking at the theories of Hobbes, Aristotle, Plato, and others to get a basic understanding of political philosophy. I'm on the fence about recommending it--if they are interested in the subject, it's a great class, but if they're not really interested, it's probably not for them.",
    "Do not take this class. Very boring and dry. Not what I was expected. The TA's and professor didn't work together well, which led to misguided information regarding exams and papers.",
    "A good intro that is not too work-intensive.",
    "Good introduction to the great thinkers of the subject. Very large lecture, don't expect any relationship with professor. Lectures can be dry at times. Course is more focused on understanding the various political works than analyzing them.",
    "Yes, very interesting, great survey in political philosophy....not too hard.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in reading great philosophic works, but be prepared to maintain a steady work ethic, or else catching up on reading becomes problematic.",
    "PLSC 114 is a wonderful course for an introduction to the philosophy of politics. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who is interested in the grander questions of politics, such as \"what is the purpose of the state\" or \" what ought to constitute political morality.\" Prof Smith is also an amazing lecturer (insightful, entertaining, and non-dogmatic).",
    "Yes! It is an amazing course!",
    "Phenomenal class--you will never look at the political spectrum the same again.",
    "It's exactly what it says it is. The scope is broad - Plato to Tocqueville - but that means the class only covers the really big names. Then again, it's an introduction. Smith isn't an extraordinarily engaging lecturer, but if you're interested, he's fine. Also: get into a WR section. Less papers, more time to do them.",
    "Good class, AWFUL sections",
    "Good class if you want to read some classics in political philosophy and\/or you're thinking of majoring in Polisci or EP&E. Professor Smith is great of course, no complaints.",
    "Good reading that can be skipped when necessary. Take a WR section; you get writing credit and write fewer papers, twice as long to write them, drafts with comments, and fewer total pages. Makes no sense that non-WR sections are harder, but that's the way it is. WR sections weren't distinguished on the section signup (infuriating!) so look for the ones with 15 spots instead of 18.",
    "Take it!",
    "Don't take this class just for the writing credit. If you enjoy philosophy this will be a good class and you will cover a lot of the most important philosophy works. Be prepared for a lot of reading - it is definitely tough to keep up without doing it all. If you do take the class, definitely take the writing section. There are two essays instead of three and you get to write a draft which is very helpful, especially if you have never written a philosophy paper before because it is different from English, history, or another subject.",
    "Intro to Political Philosophy is a great way to learn where a thought of modern political thought has come from. Prof. Smith is incredibly engaging and presents philosophy as a pertinent aspect of political life. This is a great lecture course and even if you're in a non-writing section, it is a wonderful experience.",
    "A must. If you are interested in any discipline remotely related to politics, this is the intro course for you. Gives you the essential theoretical basis for political analysis and exposes you to the political science at Yale. In PLSC 114, you are presented with the opportunity to engage closely with some of the most influential texts ever written under the guidance of one of Yale's best professors. If you don't like Steven Smith at first, stick around. Hegrows on you.",
    "At best this is an average class. It seems that most people taking it are first-semester freshmen who want to prove themselves and it definitely shows through some of the pretentious debates in sections. Professor Smith seems like he's a nice guy, but he's definitely overrated as a lecture, especially compared to some of the amazing lectures that are at Yale. If you really want to learn the material, I'd recommend just buying the books and reading him. Your time at Yale is limited.",
    "A good overview of some of the key political philosophers. There is quite a bit of reading, some of it very slow (Aristotle, I'm looking at you).",
    "This is a good survey of major trends in western political philosophy. You won't go into extensive depth, but it will provide at least a conversational familiarity of the philosophers covered. Prof. Smith has a lot of experience with this course and his lectures provide well-considered insight into relevant topics.",
    "Steven Smith is a great lecturer, and I feel like the texts we read are texts everyone should study at least once in their lifetime - think Machiavelli, Aristotle, and Hobbes, among others. Section is hit-or-miss. This is definitely a course where you get as much out of it as you put in. Be prepared to do a lot of reading! It is very tempting to fall behind on the reading for this course (since there is so much of it), but you will regret this when you have to write a paper\/study for the final exam. However, I thought it was a great course for a first-semester freshman.",
    "I liked this class. It isn't too hard and is interesting at least part of the time. I would encourage you to take it if you aren't familiar with this subject.",
    "Yes I would. It can be fairly dry at times, but it certainly serves as a good introduction to political philosohpy.",
    "This class is exactly as advertised - you read political philosophers, go to lectures on them, and talk about them in section. Lectures are good, but only if you've done the reading - Smith isn't clear enough to make up for reading, probably intentionally. He's a funny guy, and it's a good class to take if you want a background in this material. Go for Shawn Fraistat if he TAs again - he was excellent.",
    "It's alright class, nothing bad about it. Just your usual three papers and a final. Done.",
    "If you want to expand your horizons and look at society in new ways, take this class. It's a great first year class and it's in general a great introduction to philosophical thought. I'm going to save my lecture notes and cherish them.",
    "Highly recommended if you're willing to actually read all of the books. Sometimes the reading assignments can seem a little bit daunting but they're not unreasonable. Highly enjoyable and don't skip the lecturers- they make the class Take it as a writing credit if you do, the paper schedule is much more reasonable.",
    "PLSC 114 is a good course for a basic run-through of political philosophy\/philosophers. The workload is not bad, take the WR section if you can - you only have to write 2 essays instead of 3 (and get a WR credit...). Get Turku as your TF if she does the course next year. She's great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in gaining a good overall perspective of political philosophy. We read several books and so we get a great exposure to different ideas.",
    "Lecture is interesting, but make sure you get placed into a section with a TA that keeps you interested. Also, make sure the material is something that you enjoy.",
    "I would recommend it to another student interested in government and politics and philosophy.",
    "You read the canon of political philosophers and learn at lot by comparing them and considering them in modern contexts. Take the class!",
    "Three 5-7 page papers. One final (identify the author, text, and significance of 5 of 7 quotations) plus one essay (choose 1 topic out of 4 choices and use five works in your essay).Course is not too difficult, but it is very difficult to stay on top of all the readings. The readings seemed to get increasingly longer as the semester progressed. Advice: use Sparknotes first on the material you have to read and then read\/skim it. It will focus your reading so much more and you will retain it much better.",
    "If you are at all interested in the history of politics definitely take this course.",
    "This is a good class with a strong reading list, offering selections from many classic works that one might not otherwise read. Steven Smith is interesting and his lectures are good, even if he's not necessarily the best presenter.",
    "You come to Yale and do not take this course, then you ve missed the major part of Yale experience.",
    "Yes, if you need a good social science credit.",
    "If you like to read some though, but important books and think about literature in different ways, definitely take the course. Doing all the reading is not even necessary and the course will still be interesting. The quality of the section really impacts how much you enjoy and get out of the course, so shop several so that you have a good TA who helps you breaking down the books. It really gave me new perspectives on the world, politics etc. and it is a course into which you can put as much work as you want. What you put in, you get out and you do not necessarily need to work very hard to get out a lot.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but the writing isn't too difficult, and Steven Smith makes the class something special.",
    "Definitely take it if you think you might have any interest in politics and\/or philosophy. Steven Smith is the man, as you'll learn very quickly. Take it for a WR credit, it's less papers anyway. Definitely take it as an alternative to DS to learn about all the important political philosophers and gauge your interest without mounds of work.",
    "Introduction to Political Philosophy can be likened to an abbreviated, less in-depth version of Directed Studies. There is a lot of reading involved, and not a great amount of direction on how to approach the texts. However, Professor Smith is a good lecturer who provides interesting analysis and the TAs are helpful with answering questions. The testing setup, which is three papers and a final examination seems like it isn't a lot of work, which it is. However, it was really rewarding to finally understand the concepts. Even though it's an introductory class, I'd recommend going into it with some background in philosophy. I'd never taken a philosophy class, so I felt that I needed to do more work to compensate and comprehend the material.",
    "A strong intro course that provides a good overview of major thinkers. The readings are classic, and good, but the lecture can be a little much sometimes. Professor Smith clearly is passionate about the topic, which is great, but his enthusiasm sometimes leads to grandiose statements about the arc of history, philosophy, or politics when it might be nice to have a more grounded perspective. So, I'd recommend taking it, but also realizing that Smith's highly intellectualized approach that emphasizes great books, great thinkers, and the \"great-souled man\" isn't the only way to make Political Philosophy relevant to studies of politics (or anything else).",
    "PLSC114 was my favorite class this semester. I think it's a great class to take if you're interested in politics, even if you're not planning to major in polisci. Steven Smith is a great lecturer, and don't be thrown off if the first couple of lectures don't blow you away--he picks up steam. Also, I believe all his TFs are wonderful. And take the class WR because you write 2 papers as opposed to 3 and get to write drafts--it's always nice to be able to develop your ideas more.",
    "Political Philosophy was a very interesting class. The lectures, sections, and readings were all very informative and interesting. The toughest part about this class was keeping up with the readings. Professor Smith is an amazing lecturer and always has the most interesting topics. I would definitely recommend this class if you like this topic. Otherwise, it can be difficult to remain interested.",
    "Yes, gives a thorough introduction to the greats and allows for a good overview of the different philosophies and texts.",
    "I wouldrecommend this course if you want an introduction to political philosophy on the fast lane. While the reading is interesting for most parts, it does require contemplation (as always with philosophy). There are 2-3 papers and a final. The TA determines all of your grade, so make sure you get a good one.",
    "This was a good introduction to political philosophy, but any student taking this course should know that it is Western political philosophy, and that it is much more a philosophy course than a poli sci course. Papers are structured like literature analysis papers, and section discussions are focused around what different political philosophers thought, not so much how their thoughts and theories are applicable to the modern world.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. You basically just have to keep up with the readings, and do a few papers. The final is not extremely difficult either. Steven Smith is an excellent professor and will breath life into all of your readings. If you love political philosophy or not, this course is a must.",
    "Only take it if you're really interested in political philosophy. I enjoy philosophy, but do not enjoy political philosophy. I found the readings to be dry, boring and outdated. Smith is good though, if you take it get it as a WR credit. It is a TON of reading.",
    "This course is such a negative outlier in the range of courses at Yale, it only serves to weaken the esteem I hold for all Yale courses. I have taken many classes and in general I love my courses and I love Yale. It has great professors, I learn a lot, and even if I don't enjoy every aspect of each class, each one has redeeming qualities. This course does not do justice to Yale courses, and is by far the worst course I have taken at Yale. Evaluating this course goes beyond my comfort zone and my limits of propriety. I am a strong believer in evaluating courses because after spending so much time taking a course I feel it is my responsibility to try to improve the course and inform others about my honest feelings about the course. That being said, I would feel bad about honestly evaluating this course. It would not be proper to publicly embarrass the professor and his staff by sharing my true feelings about the class, so I feel it is my responisiblity to withhold my evaluation because it wouln't serve to benefit the course. I can merely recommend that this course not be taken by any other student. Although i found the course material to be surprisingly interesting my problems to the course boil down to the staff involved. My feelings are so strong that anything I have to say would only be meant to discredit Master Smith and Shawn so I choose to withhold my judgement and I apologize for the lack of input.",
    "I highly recommend this class other students especially those that have had little exposure to philosophy in the past because we cover many of the great philosophers such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau. Professor Smith gives amazing lectures and always leaves you thinking.",
    "A must-take for EVERYONE at the university. Mind-expanding.",
    "PLSC 114 provides a generally good introduction to political philosophy. I don't have much to compare it to, but we seemed to read a pretty wide range ofauthors, and you get to know\/understand those authors very well. Although writing sections write one fewer paper than non-writing sections, the expectations of those papers seemed to be much more stringent than in non-writing sections, and the papers were graded significantly harder."
