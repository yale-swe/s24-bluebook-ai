    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. While you won't learn many new grammatical structures, you will review all the ones you have starting with the present tense and building in times and moods, all the while gaining fluency. You will be able to use the grammar you already know much better by the end.The course curriculum is extremely strong. Not only is it incredibly well organized (in terms of there being a syllabus with clear expectations and assignments), but the pedagogue works. I feel that I was able to synthesize all of the grammar I have learned over the past six years and that now I am able to speak and write more fluently using that grammar. Specifically, the fact that many of the activities were repeated over and over again with new vocab and grammar helped me learn, as did the fact that the literature reinforced the vocab and grammatical structures that we were learning. While the website was helpful in terms of making it easy to do homework, it often midgraded my work, and there was no means to note that. However, they will hopefully change that for next semester.Daniel was an incredible teacher. He pushed me to speak Spanish always and thus gain fluency as a speaker and listener. He is also extremely gracious when we make mistakes so that we learn from our mistakes without feeling embarrassed in front of the class. I also appreciate that he stuck to the syllabus because it kept everything clear, and I liked that he was a rigorous grader because it forced me to improve my writing. He was extremely accessible, which was nice.",
    "L3 is a great review of pretty much all the spanish you need to know. Garcia-Donoso was a great teacher and I enjoyed the class. Beware, though - it will be very difficult for you to get an A. Garcia-Donoso grades by the rubric. If you value your grades, shop around and find a prof that isn't so strict.",
    "I would recommend spanish 130 to anyone who wants to take spanish. It is as good a spanish program as any.",
    "Only if you have to take it."
