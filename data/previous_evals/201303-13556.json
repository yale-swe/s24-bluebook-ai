As a 1-credit class meeting for 1 hour a week, it wasn't my first priority, so I wasn't always very well-prepared for class, but of course that's my own fault! The readings were good though, so I think if I read them more carefully, I would have gotten more out of the class. I look forward to re-visiting the readings from time to time."

A great introduction to land-use planning.",

    "The guest speakers were great as were the field trips.",
    "Guest speakers make for a dynamic course. Discussions at the end of class really bring everything together and allow students better understand the material of each class. The field trip was very well planned. Professor Nolon is really passionate about the subject."
