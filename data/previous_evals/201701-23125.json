   "comments": [
    "This class teaches you to seriously reflect on every aspect of your life: faith, community, vocation. It is a challenging exercise but if you take readings seriously and engage with Brooks, he will surprise you with gems of knowledge",
    "I learned how to approach my commitments more thoughtfully and realized that, as much as we like to keep our options open, making commitments is how we learn and grow as people.",
    "A great course to take in your final semester at Yale to think about finding meaning and purpose in the years after graduation.",
    "Successful Global Leadership is hands down one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. You learn to evaluate your own life in relation to wait individuals in the fields of psychology, philosophy, etc. have say. It's based on the idea that there are four different commitments in our life, and that we must find a way to balance these commitments even if they conflict with one another.",
    "I gained little. This course does not really develop your knowledge or skills. At the beginning I thought we were discussing interesting ways of categorizing \/ compartmentalizing things in the world, but I found these to be lackluster, reductive, and falsely simplistic by the end of the semester.",
    "I learned to reflect more deeply on things and think of the meaning in both the positives and the hardships in life.",
    "Knowledge about life and life decisions.",
    "Honestly can not think of a single useful thing discussed. The discussions we had (between students) broke the tenuous hold I had on the belief there are in fact reasonable people at Yale. Extremely disappointing to have what could have been an interesting course end up an opportunity for a handful of over-confident, dismissive undergrads to sermonize to others on their thoughts given extremely narrow experiences.",
    "I began to learn an academic vocabulary to think about how i want to make commitments in my life",
    "Self-reflection, synthesis of information from my life into a coherent narrative, application of literature to my life (past and present), analyzing my existence at Yale on a less academic and more personal level, learning to ask questions rooted in lifestyle choices in a career context",
    "The class focuses on the idea of commitments and living a committed life. Professor Brooks spends the semester arguing and trying to convince you that committing to his four big things will make you a happier person.",
    "This course challenged my world view in ways I could never have imagined. It provided a structure for thinking about the \"bigger\" questions of life, and truly promoted a genuine concern for morality in the face of contemporary issues and social norms."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class as chill as any class gets. Maybe for this type of class, there could be less people allowing more in depth conversation but everyone wants to take it as well, I guess.",
    "Strengths: It's a course that asks you to reflect on the nature of your commitments and how to lead a life worth living. Not many Yale courses make you slow down and see the bigger picture. Weaknesses: The class was too big. I know it's because the course is oversubscribed, but having a smaller seminar would make for more fruitful exchanges.",
    "The class explores topics that aren't discussed in other Yale classes and makes you think more deeply about your priorities and choices at Yale and beyond.",
    "I loved this course. My only suggestion would be to eliminate a few of the readings, some of which were repetitive or a bit unedifying.",
    "Strengths: You get to know Professor Brooks extremely well. He holds office hours which are extremely engaging. Weaknesses: We don't always have enough time to discuss the readings because there is so much material to get through.",
    "Strengths: was interesting at the beginning, could be a cool way to evaluate society \/ community \/ the self through an intellectual lens (but it doesnt really work) Weaknesses: the reading wasn't good and there was too much, Professor Brooks doesn't know how to lead a seminar well, the people in the class were aggressive \/ section assholes, just saying things to get a comment in and impress the professor rather than to actually say something substantive Improvement: make the readings shorter and more interesting, discuss them more in class, find a way to facilitate classroom discussion better \/ more substantively",
    "I thought the course was a great way to think about life and commitments and the future. I wish we were given more guidelines on expectations, though, especially with papers.",
    "Driven primarily by the views of the professor and the chosen class. Organization could be improved in terms of the syllabus and readings. The readings were sometimes too dry and similar.",
    "Some of the readings were interesting, but it was difficult to justify the time spent reading an entire book for weekly seminar when often we never discussed the assigned reading. What's the point of spending $12-$30 and hours and hours of limited time each week if it is not a focus of, or at least relevant to, the conversation? Either assign the readings and then discuss them or make them optional. Only a few were even useful. The concept of the course is fine. The major commitments we make in life--to family, faith, career, community--are important and well worth considering and discussing. Having these conversations largely led or monopolized by undergrads who, while terribly intelligent, have comparatively little life experience, was frustrating and disappointing. I often dreaded attending class because of this and it became a struggle to make it through the two hour seminar by the end of term. The people who spoke often and brought up interesting points in the opening weeks were largely quiet by the end. 4 or 5 people had something to say about every single topic, whether anyone else was interested in their 8th opinion of the day or not. David Brooks is an outstanding writer, but not a particularly good instructor. He just never seemed to ask the right questions to make the conversation engaging to most of the group, and he did a poor job of bringing in new voices. As a teacher or discussion leader, these are pretty basic skills to develop. This is one of the vanity classes at Yale and should be understood as such. Maybe he was just distracted this term by other events in his life.",
    "The class size is WAYYYYYY too big. I didn't know the names of eveyrone in the class, and this made it more difficult to share and have back and forth discussions. I think next year Professor Brooks should count the number of chairs at the table in the room, and then pick the number of students based on that. it means fewer people will be able to take the class, but it will be a richer experience. As for strengths, I am always surprised by how committed professor brooks was to his students. I appreciated his care and insights - and that he really did want to get to know us",
    "The biggest strength of the class is how drastically different it is from every other class in the major: as David said in the very first seminar, this class has nothing to do with successful global leadership. And yet, after taking it, I felt more equipped for that kind of leadership than ever. The course's structure and progression, I thought, also worked very well though some reorganization of the topics' order might be worth considering. The biggest weakness of the course is its lack of a transition into a tighter, more emotionally trusting\/open environment which, as someone who took a class a while ago pointed out, makes it difficult for students' comments to transition from scholarly \"section asshole\" remarks to genuine reflections.",
    "The topic has got to be one of the strengths. The size (24 students) could be shrunk just a bit to give each student more time to participate. Brooks began the class doing a great job at leading the conversation and discussing the readings, but as the semester progressed, it seemed students stopped reading and Brooks stopped preparing for the class.",
    "This course was without a doubt the best class I have ever taken at Yale. Its only weakness was in ending too soon.",
    "I enjoyed the readings and discussions a lot. I thought the topic was useful and relevant for young people thinking about their future. My main suggestion is that the readings incorporate more female authors (there was only one for the whole semester). Women have written much about marriage, commitment, choice, and the search for meaning. I understand that in studying the historical \"classics\", female authors will of course be scanty, but perhaps there could be a little more attention on recent, contemporary works (I appreciated Coates being included). However, I was glad to be able to read authors such as C.S. Lewis and Orwell."

   "comments": [
    "If you feel like your Yale career has not given you an opportunity to truly enjoy a class, take this one. Brooks is extremely personable and wise. He does not talk down on people, which is rare at Yale, especially when talking about life choices. You will learn and grown from this class. Easy A-. 9 AM kinda sucks but it is worthwhile.",
    "Definitely! It's really a one of a kind course, less therapy with David Brooks and more life worth living with David Brooks. One piece of advice: as much as you may want to take this class, beware of who else is admitted.",
    "Absolutely! A must-take. And be sure to attend office hours on Monday nights.",
    "Yes. Learning with and from Professor Brooks was one of the highlights of my Yale career.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. NO one liked Brooks by the end of the semester. I wanted to take it for the wrong reasons (hard to get into, thought Brooks was cool, thought I could learn something about the conservative perspective, thought it would have interesting people), and I was wrong on all accounts. This class is not interesting, it does NOT provide you with a new way of seeing the world (through an analysis of emotions \/ society) -- do not take this class! It's a waste of time!",
    "The class is interesting and you get out what you put in. David is really nice and the dinners with him in Barcelona are definitely a plus. One warning though, it is definitely not an easy A type of class.",
    "Yes.",
    "David was thoughtful and insightful, but it seemed like he was trying to stretch a few seminar discussions into an entire course. In the second half of the semester, he often repeated anecdotes from earlier in the course, sometimes up to three or four times. The reading, which was rarely touched upon in seminar, was hit-or-miss (David Whyte could use an editor), becoming overtly religious later in the course. The syllabus was inaccurate, resulting in me acquiring a few books at the beginning of the semester that were later cut from the course, and contributing to the general sense that David wasn't particularly invested in the course outside of Tuesday mornings. On the plus side, the papers are relatively short and David is an easy grader. But overall, as a senior STEM major, I was underwhelmed. The course felt like a missed opportunity.",
    "With the right mix of students, or a smaller cohort, say 15-18 instead of 25, this could be a solid course. Under the current configuration, if you are the stereotypical DS student everyone on campus rolls their eyes at, this might be a perfect fit for you.",
    "Yes. This course gave me some tools and vocabulary to begin thinking about what it meant to make a commitment in life. Although I didn't always agree with the frameworks, it was important to try them on for size, and try to think about what i could take from them to add to my life. Also professor brooks is one of the kinder, more generous professors I've had while at Yale. He makes time for his students, really reads your papers, and is interested in what you have to say.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is genuinely seeking another kind of course at Yale and is ready to engage in a class that is much less academic or \"applicable\" in a traditional sense of the word. This class is for people who are comfortable admitting they feel lost, uncertain, misguided, clueless and are willing to remain curious and open throughout the semester to discover some sort of a direction or some sort of an answer or at least venture into reframing the questions they have in a more revelatory, informative way. I would not recommend it to anyone who simply wants to take a course with a famous professor (you'll be \"found out\" pretty quickly and will have a terrible time) or who just wants an easy credit (there are plenty of those at Yale that don't actually require real thinking). Consider this class only if you are serious about what you can bring into it and what you are seeking to discover in it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want a nice intellectual, yet undemanding course. However, I cannot guarantee the class will be rewarding. You might also wanna consider taking it cr\/d\/fail.",
    "Without a doubt, this is the best course I have yet to take at Yale. If you have the opportunity to enroll in this class, do so with full force. The readings and discussions challenged my world view in ways I never expected, and I learned more about myself throughout the semester than I could have ever imagined. Professor Brooks is a wonderful seminar leader and his insights on contemporary morality are quite formative. This class is truly exceptional. It should be required for every Yalie, and helps to dissect the major commitments of life-- the ones which, when done right, make life worth living.",
    "Yes--I found it enlightening and thought-provoking."
