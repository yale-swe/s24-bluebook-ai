   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course. You learn a lot more about papers that you've already seen before and can understand the context in which they were written. The professors are really nice, and the discussions they lead often challenge your mind. If you're an MB&B major looking to fill a requirement (or just someone interested in science), I would DEFINITELY recommend it.",
    "This class is a great way to solidify the lessons that you learn from MB&B 301 and other classes you have taken as part of the MB&B major. You basically read and critique journal articles, several of which are from classic experiments in molecular biology. The instructors will throw technical questions at you (e.g. \"How might pipetting technique affect the conclusions made by Meselson and Stahl?\"), as well as theoretical ones as well (\"how would you identify the binding partners of X, Y, and Z?\")It's a big learning experience, and I feel like you'd get the most out of it if you've taken Adv. Eukaryotic Biology or classes that deal with molecular biology in E. coli and S. cerevisiae before. But if you haven't you'll be fine as well. Just try your best to read the articles very closely, paying special attention to the figures!",
    "It is a great class. If you are doing BS, take it!",
    "The best class you could ever take at Yale. Not a bad workload, though you will definitely have to read and reread the papers over and over again. But seriously, the workload shouldn't be a consideration because it's not bad. And it's the best. Class. You can take. At Yale.",
    "This is a good upper level MB&B course that really makes you think through the papers. This is the smallest science class yet, meaning I learned closely with Professors.",
    "You get to read basic science papers and discuss them. I would absolutely recommend it for other students who are interested in that type of research, and who want to learn more about how to critically analyze scientific literature."
