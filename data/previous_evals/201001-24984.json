    "This class is basically whatever you make of it.",
    "MCDB 475 is a good way to get credit for doing research you would have done anyways. There is a minimum requirement of 10-12 hours a week, so make sure you leave gaps in your schedule for lab. The research paper at the end is supposed to be 12-15 pages, so try to get started on that earlier and make sure you're recording complete results from your experiments to make it easier at the end.",
    "Solid course that is what you make of it. The ten hours a week can be rough if you have a busy schedule. The course is very well organized and well led.",
    "I would recommend MCDB475 to other students, even if you're not planning to do research as a career. Being part of a lab and collaborating with other researchers to solve problems that don't have textbook answers is an invaluable experience. However, you have to be willing to put in the work and not have experiments work the first time or go as planned.",
    "MCDB 475 allows you to gain lab experience, but the truth is that 10 hours a week doesn't really allow you to accomplish anything significant in the lab. It is likely that you won't have any nice data, but you will still learn new techniques and be able to spend time in the lab.",
    "Great way to get research experience. Choose a good lab, and you're set!",
    "sure, if you want to do research during the term you may as well get an a for doing it."
