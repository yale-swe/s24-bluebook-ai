    "Do it. It's honestly the best way to get science credits out of the way. As long as you pick a project you're actually interested in, you end up learning so much more from this course than you would in an ordinary lecture. Definitely 10\/10 recommend.",
    "Make the most out of your research time and spend a lot of time in lab! Otherwise, you really wont get anything out of this. Take it for an elective, but unfortunately, the class cant be taken for a grade.",
    "A great way to get a ChemE ABET elective. It is most effective if you do it in the fall as a continuation of summer research, or in the spring and you plan on doing summer research. This is because ten hours per week (the required time commitment) is not enough time to get a considerable amount of real work done. Choose a PI whose projects interest you, but also a group with enthusiastic researchers. This is really important, since you will often learn from these people."
