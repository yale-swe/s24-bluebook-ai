    "Take this class if you want to write and to read your classmates' writing for a semester. It is so fun to just be able to write whatever you want! You workshop 3 pieces a week, so you really get to spend time with each others' writing, and it is a very worthwhile experience.",
    "It's a fulfilling and demanding fiction workshop. A lot of work has to be put in to it, and you really get a ton out of it.",
    "A student driven course where most of the time is spent talking about peer's work.",
    "This is the most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale. Each week, you read and workshop three stories that are written by your peers.",
    "Really good class. It is highly satisfying and worthwhile to produce two fully developed stories.",
    "Yes! You write two short stories over the term and spend the rest of the sessions workshopping (discussing) other students' work. We also read a short story selection each time through that week's lens plot, narrative, etc.",
    "I think it was a great way to discipline myself into producing two pieces of writing. I thought Nalini's individual pieces of advice were super helpful. I think that seminars and workshops could have been structured better. We definitely could've done more short writing exercises throughout the class according to each week's theme."
