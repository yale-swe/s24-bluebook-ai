   "comments": [
    "Personality Psychology was a very interesting and enlightening course. I particularly enjoyed the relevance of the material--and it was very interesting\/helpful to learn about my own personality and the personalities of the people around me. I highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would be ambivalent. There are some interesting ideas and it's pretty easy, and if you split up the reading with other people, there is not too much work. However, the Mayer book (and yes, you have to read the whole book) is simply awful, and the course is full of BS.",
    "Great. My favorite class this semester. Very educational, perfect pace, great material, and amazing professor. Prof Brackett is a handful, but you'll be able to tell during shopping if he's too much for you or not. My friend and I loved him, and he made the class for us.",
    "I would recommend it! I learned a lot about myself and the people around me. The tests were fair, the class participation was simple and the paper assignment was really fun!",
    "Fun and easy to understand and do the work for!",
    "I came to Personality Psych a little jaded with psych classes in general for being too full of fluff. However, this class was AWESOME! I learned a lot about the factors that govern personality, and found myself analyzing my own emotions and motivations outside of class. We had regular in-class activities and even got to take a personality test (that costs a lot of money to take normally), which kept lectures fun and lively.Professor Bracket is a love-him or hate-him character... highly neurotic and self-opinionated, but ever-ready to make fun of his own quirks. He is honestly the best person to be teaching this course simply because of the extremes in his own personality traits.The workload was a little heavier than most psych courses, with 3 exams and a 10 page paper, but still very manageable. The paper was really fun to write (we had to psychoanalyze a person of our choosing from their autobiography).In summary:TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Personality Psychology is a great way to learn about yourself and other people's personalities. The work load isn't too bad, your grade is spread out over three tests and a paper. You gain valuable insight into yourself, which you can then use to your advantage. Overall great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The tests were straightforward and so was the material. It was worth getting up at 9AM.",
    "It's a great psych course for someone who wants to take psych, but hasn't taken any intro class(es). It's early in the morning and I think Marc Brackett is an acquired taste. I personally thought he was great!",
    "This is a course that combines together every single psychology theory that could, perhaps, maybe touch upon affecting a person's personality. The problem is, most psychology does. So that was frustrating.",
    "yes, dont need any experience in psych",
    "I would recommend this course since you get to know more about yourself. The readings are important so I recommend that you do them.",
    "Yes, great class. Interesting material and Prof. Brackett is entertaining.",
    "It is not really worth it. Yes, the lectures are somewhat engaging, but most of the material was common sense. Professor Brackett and his TAs, however, are all really great people. The lectures often had the class laughing. The exams might be a tad difficult for a class of this kind.",
    "If you are a psychology major, yes. the 10 page paper at the end was not hard to do because you got to choose what you were going to write about which made it interesting and not boring.",
    "Great class! Not a lot of work, but good information to know that you will use in everyday life!",
    "Sure - but take it for credit (at least if you're a senior). The multiple choice questions can be a bit nit-picky even if you do the reading, and it's an enjoyable class if you don't have to stress about it.",
    "This course requires you to do all of the reading, especially the smaller articles that students often feel they can skip over. The tests are not difficult, because they pick up on general themes, but you have to have read to know the themes in the first place. Professor Brackett is a bit sarcastic but he can be funny and he has a very interesting life story which you will hear a lot about throughout the course. The material is pretty much what you would expect and although the course doesn't have a ton of cohesion, the topics are still very much worth learning about and quite interesting. One thing that makes the class exciting is that you take various personality assessments to learn more about yourself which is a unique opportunity and very informative.",
    "It's an interesting course. Prof Brackett is a great guy, and it's true that you either love him or hate him. He does care about his students, but sometimes he rubs people the wrong way. He's moved on from talking about karate every day to talking about his voice lessons and other stuff going on his life; it's interesting, though. You do learn about personality psychology, but not as much as I would have hoped. There is a lot of overlap with intro psych and intro cog sci, but not enough to deter one from taking the course. The textbook you use is AWFUL. It's EXTREMELY repetitive and it even has mistakes, but Brackett helped write it so you'll still probably use it. The readings book is fantastic, with lots of fascinating readings.The exams are generally fair. Oh, and Brackett doesn't post his slides online. Actually, sometimes the lecture material isn't even covered on the exam - like there are things that you would think would be on the exam, but aren't. You have to study everything and know it well because the exams will ask random, inconsequential details once in a while. But generally speaking, it's a lot of list memorization (e.g., what are Maslow's five needs in order; what are the three chars of Arnett's emerging adulthood, describe the first three steps in Erickson's stages of life, list and describe three ways that responses are scored for verbal fluency on IQ tests, etc.). There is also a big theoretical\/philisophical aspect to the class, mainly covered in the readings. Some good guest lecturers. Spoiler: the one on stress at the end of the semester is A FAKE LECTURE DESIGNED TO STRESS YOU OUT SO THEY CAN TEST YOUR CORTISOL LEVELS WITH COTTON SWABS (if they do it next year). DON'T GET STRESSED OUT BY THE TASK OF PRESENTING A SPEECH - you won't have to do it. The final essay looks easy, but it is actually a challenging paper to write. TAKE YOUR TIME AND START WORKING ON IT EARLY! I found the paper to be rewarding in that I learned how to integrate the 43213557814214 theories that we learned throughout the semester. Oh, there's also a large self-exploration aspect to the class, which for some people is meaningful. The course can be frustrating at times, but potentially worthwhile if you're interested in personality.",
    "This was a pretty good course, I would recommend it to any psychology major.",
    "Great intro course. You learn a lot about your personality traits and how to change them for the better. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take this CR\/D\/FAIL if you're going to take it. It's not particularly hard, and the subject matter is interesting, but the 9:00 time, and sometimes dense readings make it difficult to care about.",
    "An introspective, self-based psych class that's not too sciency. You don't need to have taken psych before.",
    "Yes. Fun time in lecture. Light readings.",
    "If the student is interested in taking an intro psych course, and doesn't want to\/ can't take intro psych, I would recommend this class.",
    "Good as a freshman or sophomore introduction to psychology. I don't recommend it to an upperclassman psychology major, because much better courses exist that really delve into studies, methods, and discussions. The best part of this course is that it makes you think about your own personality more than ever, and evaluate it in interesting ways. Beyond that however, there isn't much more that one couldn't learn by cracking open a textbook.",
    "This is certainly an interesting class as it does encourage a great deal of introspection and self-realization. The assignments (personality analysis of a biography and personality tests) were by far the best parts of the class, so I would recommend taking it if only for these aspects. The material, unfortunately, is pretty fluffy. It may be interesting for people who have never taken a psychology class before but soon becomes dull for psych majors who have taken most of the survey courses. Lectures generally consist of reading off slides with a few personal anecdotes to illustrate the points, so you can literally absorb all the information just by reading the slides. However, you can't skip class either because Professor Brackett doesn't post the slides.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a general overview to psychology and do not wish to take intro psych. I took the class credit\/d\/fail and it was perfect for this - it's interesting and you do learn about yourself in taking the class, but I am not very interested in psych so credit\/d\/fail was the perfect option for me.",
    "Take 110",
    "I would say it's pretty good. Don't take other level 1 psychology courses at the same time though. In general there will be overlap. Also, Professor Brackett has a personality that you have to get used to. But overall, a good class.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Just sucks that it's at 9 am.",
    "yes, but human emotion overlapped a bit&was a better course",
    "Fun class and manageable material. Highly recommend it.",
    "Do not take this class. This is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. It's not interesting, it's not well taught, and you will learn nothing. Do not be fooled by the promises Brackett will make at the start of the semester, you will learn nothing interesting about personality. Please, I'm begging you, do not take this class.",
    "pretty easy, enjoyable class. bad time (9am)",
    "I'd recommend it. It's pretty interesting and has a great professor. Not a lot of work.",
    "overview of general theories about the human personality",
    "More work than it at first seems, and less interesting than it at first seems. Basically like any other psychology class. Good fifth class.",
    "I would recommend Personality Psychology to others, even if they aren't psychology majors.",
    "I would recommend it as a very broad course even given the fact that it is about personality. It's fun and very entertaining even at 9 am.",
    "Not as useful as you might think, but interesting. It gives you new perspectives for looking at yourself and other people.",
    "Yes. It's informative and Professor Brackett is a riot.",
    "I took the class cr\/d\/fail and it was very interesting. It might be hard to do well in if you're looking for an A, but it wasn't very much work taking it this way and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Definitely recommend. Very interesting material and Brackett definietly keeps lectures entertaining. Three non-cumulative exams and one paper. Take it!",
    "Psych 165 is an introductory, but interesting, look into the specific realm of personality. It's taught with the \"structural approach,\" which means that topics are integrated into broader theoretical ideas as opposed to isolated, as they are in intro psych. This really helps connect the ideas into a broader schema, and Professor Brackett is really good at connecting the dots and showing the greater point to the individual topics. Speaking of Brackett, he is kind of a nutcase. Sometimes you'll be vaguely offended, sometimes totally confused, but always entertained. He basically uses himself as an example for everything, which is useful and fun, and it makes him really engaging. Expect to interact with him at every class--it's good, it'll keep you awake. It's especially good as a 5th class. There are 3 exams and a fun paper, so it's not too bad (although the 2nd and 3rd exams are a little tricky and detail-oriented, so watch out!) on the workload, and although it's at 9am, it's definitely worth waking up for!",
    "It's not a difficult course--three exams, one 8-pg. paper, no final. Professor Brackett is not a professor I loved or even liked, but the lectures were bearable. The supplemental reading was only sometimes interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The hours are annoying, but it's not a bad way to start the day.",
    "A fairly straightforward class with a very entertaining teacher. Take it if you're interested in the topic and you have an opening in your schedule for it."
