    "You cover the entirety of Machado de Assis's career and nothing else, if this doesn't appeal, don't take it. But if you're interested in South American literature at all it, it will be very helpful and interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course if you're interested in character psychology. We dedicated a lot of seminar time to discussing the overarching psychological framework of each novel, which really forced us to become parts of the novels ourselves. There's a great deal of historical context to be understood in all of the reading, so a knowledge of nineteenth-century Brazilian history helps. The workload is low - three papers and a short-answer take-home final exam. Not much more that you could ask from a literature seminar.",
    "Lots of reading, lots of writing, lots of fun."
