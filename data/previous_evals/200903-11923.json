    "Yes, it is better than doing a Tutorial and Research and Senior Essay just to get a BA in biology.",
    "I mean...it's research. It's pretty simple. You do research.",
    "um. you need it for your major right?Find a lab in the BIO department. Make sure you have a good lab and project right away and switch if necessary.",
    "It's a great course, but it really depends all on your lab. Find a lab from Spring of Junior year and volunteer to make sure you would enjoy it there and it would interest you to continue research in that area.",
    "Yes, only because you need a year at least to get something accomplished in lab.",
    "Research is fine -- it's research. I have to say though that Prof. Mooseker -- despite the minimal role he plays -- is the worst part of this course. He picks on details during your presentation, trying to trick you rather than help you learn. He misses the big picture to trick you. He also took 2 weeks to respond to my email. Considering the tiny role he has in this course, it's shocking how little he cares\/invests in his students.",
    "Choose a good PI, and it will be well worth it."
