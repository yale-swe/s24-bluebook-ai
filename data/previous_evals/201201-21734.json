    "I would say that it is great, and would be PERFECT with a more reasonable TA.Also, the Hegelson reading is DREADFUL, but you live through it.",
    "Psych of Gender provides a basic overview of the psychological community's perspectives on gender (and to a lesser extent, sexuality). This class would be an excellent choice for students who have never taken a WGSS class before -- the fact that it's a 315-level course in the department is very misleading. The gender perspectives offered in this class are very basic and uncomplicated, and it could be greatly improved by taking a more nuanced approach to what are legitimately very complex issues.",
    "Seemed to touch on a lot of simple and more obvious topics than delve into anything really meaningful. It's a good intro course to some gender-related issues in psychology.",
    "This class focuses mostly on society's ideas about gender as well as differences based on gender and sex. It is pretty broad, but usually interesting. I would probably recommend it to another student.",
    "If you are interested in psychology or gender issues, then yes.",
    "Psychology of Gender is an interesting combination of gender through psychology. I took it after taking Intro Psych and enjoyed the class. I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in psychology and gender studies, but would caution anyone planning on majoring in WGSS because the class focuses more on psychology than gender studies, and at times the gender aspect can be a little basic.Professor LaFrance is a great teacher, and it was definitely a fun class for me!"
