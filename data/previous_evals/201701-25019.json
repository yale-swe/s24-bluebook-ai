   "comments": [
    "I think my writing improved throughout this course because of the structure: draft and then revision.",
    "This course helped me improve my critical writing skills significantly.",
    "I learned *so much*. Professor Campbell did a wonderful job of allowing us to develop our writing skills in an independent environment. Class discussions were great, and there were many takeaways.",
    "I gained strong and comprehensive revision skills that I never had before. I learned how to develop my own topic and find strong secondary sources to enhance my arguments.",
    "Greater appreciation for children's literature and improved writing skills, mainly in composing analytical academic essays.",
    "I gained extensive knowledge in the history of children's books, and exercised analytical skills in reference to literature and children's literature, as well as a bit of psychological perspectives.",
    "The progression of this course is organized in a very sensible way that allowed me to work on my writing in steps, building towards using Yale's resources on my own to create an evidence-based argument.",
    "I loved this class so much! I learned a lot about the historical aspects of children's books, such as the commercialization of childhood as well as old notions of how to teach children proper morals. I revisited old childhood favorites like Charlotte's Web and Peter Pan and properly looked at the way the books presented concepts like death and growing up. I absolutely loved our unit on Harry Potter, especially, because I'm a huge HP fan and I explored so much into Prisoner of Azkaban that I had never known before (such as the fact that Voldemort doesn't appear in this book, and this book only, representing a different sort of learning that Harry undergoes). I really appreciated how Professor Campbell talked about how race and sexuality affects childhood - we read American Born Chinese, excerpts of \"Black Boy\", \"Fun Home\" and did an AMAZING collaborative project with the picture book \"Brown is Black is Tan\" with a 3rd grade New Haven class. I LOVED THIS CLASS. I learned so much! The coursework isn't too much (and the reading is literally Island of the Blue Dolphins or Harry Potter) and I improved sooo much with my writing and Professor Campbell was AMAZING. You do amazing projects with little kids, the Beinecke, and more. Amazing class. I loved it!",
    "I deepened my knowledge of analytical writing, and learned to apply psychological information on childhood development to literature.",
    "I learned to write with more continuity, and with more concrete language. Prior to taking this class, I wrote more flower-y and made many vague sentences because I beat around the bush and did not get straight to the point. I feel that this course has allowed me to be more careful with my writing, to notice my weaknesses and strengths, and to work hard to improve them.",
    "In this class I continued to develop my skills in critical reading, analysis, and composition. More importantly, I gained insight into the exciting and surprisingly complicated world of children's literature. I acquired a more critical lens of thinking in looking at some of my favorite books including Harry Potter, Peter Pan, Fun Home, and Charlotte's Web. In addition, the first hand experience with talking to kid about poetry was helpful in gaining a new perspective on how important children's literature is to both kids and adults. Discussing memoirs also allowed me to self-reflect in ways I never have before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are a lot of short writing assignments which is helpful because it ensures that you do the reading and helps to make class discussion interesting.",
    "Professor Campbell is definitely one of this course's strongest strengths. She had obviously put so much time into this course, and it showed. We met with her at least once (if not twice) per paper, so there was consistent feedback. Additionally, the content of this course was amazing. Very rarely does one have the opportunity to say they wrote an entire research paper on \"Harry Potter.\" Also, the visits to the Beinecke, the British Art Gallery, and the visit from the elementary schoolers really helped to reinforce this course's themes. This class's biggest weakness was its organization. While the syllabus was well laid-out, there were many changes that happened over the course of this semester. This is understandable, since it's the first time this topic has been offered, but I would've appreciated receiving a revised syllabus to help me plan my work. And speaking of work, I felt like Professor Campbell was constantly trying to gauge the rigor of the class, as she kept adding additional assignments to the syllabus. I think that we got a respectable amount of work, but I would've liked to see it better spread out. For instance, reading 100 pages, writing a 1-page reflection, finishing a paper, and peer-editing 1 (or 2) classmate's papers should not all be due on the same day. I'd rather see the reading and the reflection shifted to earlier, if possible.",
    "The discussion was always interesting and productive. The reading and writing is very manageable and helpful.",
    "I loved this course! A strength is that the material is mainly works with which the whole class is familiar. This led to great class conversation and focusing more on the importance of each work. Each unit of texts ties well together. The works are engaging and fun, but also lead to interesting conversations about how adults today, and historically, treat children's literature.",
    "This subject matter is extremely interesting and well organized, although a few of the books are less relevant in discussion than others. Professor Campbell is engaging, knowledgable and helpful, and overall the organization of the class facilitates learning well.",
    "I think the timing of the class could've been adjusted (more time for the memoirs - I really enjoyed them and wish we talked more about reflecting upon childhood) and MORE times with the kids but otherwise amazing! I learned a lot with each essay as Prof. Campbell gives a lot of timely feedback and is super receptive to meeting with students to discuss paper topics. Also, she brought us chocolate frogs and we watched the harry potter movie so I love this class and her!",
    "The course material is amazing, and superbly laid out.",
    "I thought it was great to be able to read such a variety of children's books and books about children. Everyone knew at least one book from the list that we read, and when it came to writing papers, we were often able to choose the book or the prompt we wanted to follow. That gave us freedom, while still encouraging a certain structure. Class discussions were engaging-- the only thing I would say is that often times we would get carried away in one part of the book or one aspect of something we read, and that would take away time to talk about other parts of the books.",
    "The strengths of this course include a clear and defined trajectory of class topics, a logical progression of literature that included both well-known and manageable books as well as more obscure, yet more intellectually challenging, books. Our class discussions usually culminated in concrete truths that we gleaned from the books and I enjoyed hearing other classmates have some interpretations that I could never come to. However, I think a weakness of the class is that the assignments were sometimes not specific enough to guide us towards the important points in each section of a given book that we were reading. That being said, as a whole, the class was phenomenal and I got more out of it than I thought I would."

    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This class embodies what Yale is. It's a place to learn, and it's a place to have fun. Professor Campbell made this very clear in her course on children's literature. The conversations were intriguing, and the visits to the Beinecke and the British Art Center were amazing. Additionally, interacting with elementary schoolers is an incredibly unique experience, and I really hope she utilizes them more in the future. The writing was certainly harshly graded, but I'm sure that's consistent across most WR classes. Professor Campbell certainly \"made\" this class, though. She always brought fascinating perspectives to the discussions, and her way of linking essays to literature is truly intriguing. This class is by no means easy, but it is certainly a \"must-take\" literature course.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I definitely would. It is a great course to take.",
    "Absolutely! I have gained confidence as a writer and a reader in this course, Professor Campbell was a joy, and the books were extremely enjoyable on many levels.",
    "Yes, 100%! Amazing topic (especially for a \"childlike\" freshman in college reflecting on growing up and leaving home) and a great transition to college level writing with a great teacher.",
    "Yes, for sure. I loved this class so much.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Yes! If you love reading about children or reading children's books, this is a great course to have the opportunity to look back on your childhood and revisit your old favorites, but with a new perspective. You get to write papers about topics you actually enjoy.",
    "In a heartbeat! For anyone who loves literature, this is a unique approach to analyzing cute but profound stories. For anyone who loves Harry Potter, your mind will be blown by the contexts with which we read The Prisoner of Azkaban. For those who are looking for nostalgia and feel-good stories, this class is the one for you."
