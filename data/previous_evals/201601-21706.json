    "Amazing class. Not a lot of work but I learned a ton. Cunningham is awesome and really cares about his students.",
    "This class was recommended to me by a friend and I would definitely recommend it - to English and non-English majors alike",
    "I would unreservedly and passionately recommend this course to another student. It provides an environment in which a fantastic and inspiring discussion of many facets of the art of writing can take place. It is a study of the way in which many successful short stories in the past have been written, and this is such an incredibly effective method. It follows a gradually building workload, and by the end of the course, students write their own short story and are offered a great deal of invaluable classroom and professor feedback. If you are fortunate enough to be offered a spot by Professor Cunningham, take it immediately without a second thought. It is my favorite course I have yet taken at Yale, without question. Take this course for the unbelievable opportunity to hear one of our most gifted modern writers discuss his craft in an exquisite way and in context with a great number of short stories written by authors throughout history. But take it above all else for Professor Cunningham, whose thoughts and insights are staggering.",
    "The simple answer here is to go see for yourself. It is difficult to explain the inner workings of a class that had at least four different names throughout the semester. That being said if I had to attempt to distill the nature of the class, it is an exercise in thinking and collaborating as much as it is one in writing, teaching students that the practice of each is made better by an understanding of the others.",
    "ENGL 134 is an excellent intro creative writing course for a very specific kind of student. ENGL 134 is for those people who have always wanted to be writers and love writing but for some reason nor another haven't been able to formally pursue it or get training in it. There is not a fancy application to get into the class that will ask you to submit prior examples of your work. Instead, Michael Cunningham cares about your dedication and reasons for wanting to take the class. The course helps students learn the basic \"principles\" to fiction writing, specifically short stories, and pushes us to practice different elements through weekly assignments. The workload of these assignments and the readings we had to do each week was quite manageable, but very helpful in pushing me to chip away at the daunting task of writing. The final product of the semester was a short story--which I was very intimidated to write, but amazed at my ability to do so when I sat down to it. It was incredible to have a community of people with the exact same goal as me, and I was continually inspired\/amazed\/intimidated by the quality of work my classmates would submit. The feedback I received from Professor Cunningham and my classmates was very thoughtful, considerate, and constructive. Professor Cunningham is an amazing person just to get to know let alone learn from. His advice to us as young writers was always heartfelt. Altogether, a truly wonderful experience."
