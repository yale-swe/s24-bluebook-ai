    "This was a very fun course. Professor Rogers leads seminar very well. He lectures a bit at the beginning of class, and though he responds directly to almost every comment that students raise, there was still plenty time for students to talk. Like every English class, you should look at the syllabus before you sign up for the course. It strikes me that this material will appeal to some more than others, but if you are uncertain in anyway, I assure you that you can't go wrong by choosing to take a course with John Rogers.",
    "We started with the Biblical scene of Christ's temptation in the wilderness and tracked its literary manifestations from the sixteenth century to contemporary works. We read some weird things, but it was all fascinating and the discussions were fun and interesting. Plus it is a seminar with Prof. Rogers, what's not to love?",
    "If it's offered again, definitely take it. The reading list alone is phenomenal. The professor (John Rogers) is fantastic. The writing (2 papers, one7-8 page and one 10 page) is not bad at all, considering you have free choice on topics and can write about whatever you want (I ended up writing on a work that wasn't on the syllabus but still related to the topic of the course, and Professor Rogers said that was more than okay). Really, well worth your time.",
    "Temptation, up until my senior fall, has been my favorite class at Yale. I'm not an English major, but I needed a WR, and the only reason I got in was because I simply refused to remove the course from my OCS worksheet. That perseverance was well worth it. John Rogers is brilliant. He offered this course as a thought experiment where you basically take for given Satan's temptation of Jesus in the desert and then go on to explore this motif throughout subsequent literary works. Rogers always listens intently to each student speaking and often he'll point to a passage, claim that he has no idea how to begin interpreting it, and offer it up to us. The blog posts were fun to write each week and the workload consists of two papers (8 and 10 pp) on any topic you want involving the class readings. Finally, the reading list was very good: Paradise Regained, (a few chapters from) The Brothers Karamazov, Miss Lonelyhearts, and BLOOD MERIDIAN. Need I say more?",
    "It's a rundown of some works throughout the history of English that deal in some way with the dichotomy between Jesus and the devil. Reading list is great, Rogers is awesome. Sometimes it's a little disorganized, but overall very enjoyable.",
    "Take this course if you can! John Rogers is funny and engaging and the reading list for the class is pretty awesome.",
    "John Rogers is the MAN. As he said on the first day, this class was just a \"thought experiment\"; it's unlike any English or literature seminar I've taken here. Although not all of the readings were enjoyable, Rogers made every class discussion fun and as engaging as possible. It's easy to see that he really cares about his students (even if he's not great at responding to emails) and he makes sure that everyone gets a chance to participate. If you like the syllabus, or are even remotely interested in the topic, try to get into this class. It's absolutely worth it.",
    "This is an excellent class. The reading list is great, and the theme of the Temptation story draws a lot of diverse literature together in a cool way. Most of all, John Rogers is one of the kindest and most brilliant professors at Yale, and the discussions he leads are quick and engaging, and better then I've had in any other class at Yale.",
    "Take Milton if you want the best John Rogers experience. Take this course if you're interested in the readings.....which are a bit dry and tough to get into.",
    "I would heartily recommend Temptation in the Wilderness to another student and summarize it thusly: This particular intensive study of the battles of Christ and Satan in literature not only offers a reading list full of extraordinary texts, it gives you an opportunity to pour over the technical forms in an in-depth study of narratology and character development.",
    "only if you are very enthusiastic about the material. rogers is the saving grace of a repetitive syllabus and several very dull readings.",
    "Do it. It's awesome.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- if you are at all interested in how Biblical influence works in western literature, it is a must. You also get to read texts of all different styles and time periods, so there is something new each week."
