    "Great class! Professor Jacobs is absolutely brilliant, and, further, the way she leads section is generous, open, but also honest: the subject always comes first. Wonderful wonderful intelligent kind woman. Great books. Re-taught me the value of close reading, showed me how beautiful and collaborative it can be (as opposed to violent, for example).",
