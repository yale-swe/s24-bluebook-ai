   "comments": [
    "'Twas an excellent course! This is not a course you should take without having done Syntax I. If you did not enjoy Syntax I, you probably would also not enjoy Syntax II; but if you did enjoy Syntax I, then I wholeheartedly recommend Syntax II! In this class, we took our knowledge from Syntax I much farther, and this gave me a much deeper understanding of the structure that unites all of the world's disparate languages. Even more important than the specific topics we learned were the ways of thinking we learned. After this course, I feel much more comfortable with understanding, analyzing, and critiquing linguistic theories. You will have to put in the work to gain this increased understanding--the class involves reading many original papers--but I think it is definitely worth it.",
    "Syntax II is a good class, and you learn a lot, but it's very different from Syntax I. While Syntax I was mostly focused on giving you the terminology and the basic concepts needed to construct syntax trees, Syntax II looks a lot more at different theories in syntax, some of which are really interesting and some of which are honestly just kind of confusing.",
    "I would highly recommend it to someone on the condition that they had a strong interest in linguistics and had taken Syntax I, with the fair warning that the two courses are very different and that Syntax II is far more challenging.",
    "If you liked Syntax I, Syntax II may be for you! The material gets much more in depth compared to Syntax I, and you'll confront lots of difficulties with the various theories, without coming to a definite solution. But even though you don't solve all the problems, it's a wonderful class that will make you able to engage with primary research in the field of Syntax."
