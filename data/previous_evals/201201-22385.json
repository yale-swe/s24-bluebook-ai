   "comments": [
    "If you enjoyed MUSI 210, but want to know more chromatic harmony and study romantic music, take this course! It was a lot more work than 210, but well worth it.",
    "Take this class only if you really like music theory. If you are someone who just wants to be better at music, then there are a lot of tedious analysis parts that will get you down. But if analyzing the works of Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin, the composers that we focused on at least in my section, excites you, then you will really enjoy it. This class is challenging and packs in a lot. It could be rewarding with the right professor I feel. I would not recommend taking it with Matthew Schullman. He is very enthusiastic, but he is not one of the better teachers I have had at Yale, and he is by far the hardest grader.",
    "do it only if you have to. Tough, generally unsatisfying.",
    "A really neat class, especially for a pianist, since much of the repertoire studied is Beethoven piano sonatas, Chopin nocturnes and mazurkas, and other familiar melodies in addition to some vocal music, opera, and other instrumental music. It moves at a fast rate, so be sure to be solid on roman numeral analysis of scores and have a decent ear. There are some prose assignments and one model composition.",
    "This is a great class and very different from 210: more variety and more work. Even so, the work felt more relevant than part writing exercises and you are definitely exposed to everything from song cycles to solo piano to opera. My advice: ask as many questions as you need to ask! The information can often be confusing the first time but asking for things to be reviewed (and reviewed and reviewed) is not a waste of time."
