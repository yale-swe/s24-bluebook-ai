    "Cicero's Political Speeches gives you the opportunity to read all or significant chunks of 4 Cicero speeches: De Imperio, In Catilinam I, De Domo Sua, and Pro Marcello. With the exception of In Catilinam, these aren't super commonly read speeches, which I thought added to the experience of reading the texts with a professor who is well versed in Roman history and Cicero's political motives behind the text. These insights definitely made reading the texts a richer experience than in high school. On the other hand, although Professor Johnston assigned secondary readings and surveyed us mid-semester about topics we'd like to focus on, we did not get to spend much time discussing context, modern reception, and secondary interpretation in class. We generally spent too much time on the Latin to get to any of these things (we translated almost every line of the reading out loud in class), so I think I would have preferred more of a balance in class time. Otherwise, Professor Johnston is incredibly nice and knowledgable, and I would recommend any class with him.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course. Even though I found that I did not like Cicero much as an author, Professor Johnston is extremely helpful and knowledgable, and it's definitely rewarding for the amount of work you do. You really get a good understanding of Cicero as an author and orator.",
    "It is a course on four of Cicero's speeches, from the famous First Catilinarian to the apparently obscure De Domo Sua. I would recommend it to someone with specific interests in Cicero\/Late Republican Politics\/rhetoric. I am not as interested in these things, but this course still helped my Latin skills improve a lot. I would not recommend it to someone who has strong Latin skills and does not care very much for Cicero.",
    "Take this class if you'd like to read Ciceronian political oratory, but don't expect an exciting, rigorous L5 Latin course. The professor is awesome and the class has the potential to be great, but only if your fellow students are committed enough to doing the readings and coming to class prepared...which mine weren't.",
    "This was an excellent class that challenged me greatly but is absolutely worth taking. Professor Johnston made the material extremely enjoyable and approachable. The class does a very good job of enriching one's understanding of Cicero and the Late Republic."
