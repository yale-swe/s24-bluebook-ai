    "Yes, take this course! Professor Lee-Smith is an excellent professor and the way the class is set up is very enjoyable and makes learning Korean a pleasure.",
    "Yes- its so much fun and its such a great course!",
    "This is the most fun class you'll take at Yale. Definitely take it, and don't feel hesitant if you don't have a lot of background knowledge in Korean-- the teacher tailors the class to every student's pace, and no one ever feels uncomfortable.",
    "The class is really designed for heritage speakers, so if you're a regular Level 3 student, you might find the pace of the class not much to your liking and not structured the way you are used to (no textbook, listening CD, etc). If there is no other option, however, you won't be disappointed by the class - Lee Sunsaengnim makes a real effort to include everyone, and your speaking and listening skills will improve because most of the people in your class will speak better than you! I'd say take it. You'll have a great time.",
    "It is very well taught. You will enjoy it.",
    "Yes, the teacher is amazing.",
    "Good class if you have a strong interest in learning.",
    "This class was amazing. Professor Lee-Smith is really sweet. She taught Korean in a way that was effective and easy to understand. I definitely recommend this class."
