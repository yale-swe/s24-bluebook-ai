   "comments": [
    "This course has a lot of information that needs to be learned, but it presents it in a manageable way. The tests and exams didn't feel as though they truly presented the knowledge base of the students. They seemed to be more technical rather discovering if the students had a grasp of the Spanish language.",
    "The book is very expensive and the penalties on the online homework are excessive. As a grad student who works evening shifts at a restaurant, having a daily nine am deadline after which points were lost was incredibly frustrating. It also feels like hand holding and the activities were not helpful. It should be that college students should be accountable for themselves, doing the course packet homework when required but otherwise knowing themselves when they should do extra exercises from the book etc.",
    "Strengths are brilliant teaching quality and great structure. Weakenesses are the speed at which the students are expected to move through the subject material.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the daily meetings, which helped reinforce the language well. The weaknesses were probably in the homework assignments, which didn't always feel useful for helpful.",
    "The point distribution throughout the quizzes is not logical. You can get 90% of the quiz right and still get a C on the quiz. The department knows specific topics are tough for students and instead of ensuring that those areas are given more emphasis, they choose to penalize students through the quizzes."

    "Yes, due to the strength of the instructor Jose Sabin Lestayo.",
    "Yes. This course, depending on your instructor, is an effective way to engage more with the Spanish language.",
    "Definitely! I hadnt taken spanish in over 3+ years and thought this was a great reintroduction to the language!",
    "Yes! Take this course with Professor Lestayo. Our class became our own little community. He's a very great professor and made it enjoyable to go to class every day."
