    "I would recommend it for anyone looking to join the department as all of the papers were extremely relevant.",
    "It is a dynamic, interesting and helpful class for advanced study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I began this course with what I considered a strong cell biology background and a good grasp on reading primary literature, but I still think I benefited tremendously by taking this seminar.",
    "very good seminar course. really useful for learning to read scientific papers.",
    "It took me a lot of time to read the assigned paper, but it was worth.",
    "Yes. The seminar course was more interactive. I learned a lot from the course.",
    "Recommended only for people with no or extremely limited background in cell bio. Could easily be supplemented by reading a textbook.",
    "I really liked this class since it really taught me how to critically read papers. I'd say that this is a must take class for anyone interested in cell biology.",
    "Papers were assigned by each professor relevant to the topic they had covered during 602, and these papers were then discussed in detail during class once a week. I thought the class helped with my understanding of 602 and I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Please take it! The articles we read were really food!"

    "It enabled me to get to know many recent hot spots in cell biology research.",
    "I don't feel like my knowledge was really deepened at al. It certainly did not help me learn to think critically.",
    "I now have a much better knowledge of current research in the topics that we covered. I also became more familiar with techniques used in cell biology research.",
