   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommended- this class will familiarize you with the Earth's history and the evolution of life on Earth. As a component of the Earth living 3.5 billion years after the first lifeforms, how could this not interest you? It's important as a class in which you can pay homage at all that came before you and understand how and why you-- and not some dinosaur-- are sitting at your computer today.Take it.",
    "Whether you are a geology major, a science major, or a humanities major, take this class!! It is a great science credit for those non-science majors and is very interesting and informative. The class is basically a survey class of the entire history of life in 20 lectures with some lab sessions instead of lectures throughout the semester (look at fossils or walk around Peabody Museum). I definitely suggest this class to anyone interested in any of the following: early life, dinosaurs, evolution, paleontology techniques, paleontology, Earth, life.",
    "This class is somewhat interesting but the lectures are tough.",
    "boring class but if you really need a science credit, take it.",
    "Take it - science and non-science majors alike. It's so rewarding to know about the evolution of life on Earth and has really instilled an appreciation for paleontology in me. One midterm, one paper, one final. Papers are graded easily, midterm had a nice curve. Tests are decent, 3 questions on midterm, 7 on final. Derek, Leo, and Nick Longrich are all fantastic.",
    "A great course with great professors that will teach you a lot about the history of evolution of life on Earth.",
    "Yes, especially if you're at all interested in the material. The lectures were engaging and interesting.",
    "If you like fossils and\/or need a science credit, take it. It can get pretty boring, but there is no required reading: only a midterm, paper, and a final. The professors are good, but your mileage may vary on the topics.",
    "History of Life is one of the best ways to earn a science credit at Yale. I am a history major - take it from me, this course is completely doable! Professors Briggs, Hickey, and Longrich were fun, engaging, and incredibly thorough. The course is also extremely little work -- just a midterm, 8 page paper, and final, with zero reading. I learned a ton about life and how everything came to be. Just a word of caution: Be sure to plan your studying so that you don't find yourself cramming 5-10 lectures of material into your brain with only a few days to study for an exam. If you pace yourself properly and pay close attention in lecture (given the absence of a textbook), you will really walk away with an appreciation for paleontology and one of the best non-science major science credits at Yale.",
    "This class was great. I feel like I can visit a natural history museum and actually understand a ton more on display labels and appreciate the displays way more.",
    "This class was surprisingly fun - a very good option for non science-majors. Lectures were interesting for the most part, and the workload is light. The tests require a decent amount of studying but are straightforward. I think the child in me really loved learning about dinosaurs in detail, and I think a general knowledge of animal lineages and such is a good thing to have. Take it!",
    "Wonderful class if you're looking for a Sc credit that's not just a boring gut. History of Life is a look at real, interesting material, and though it can be a lot of memorization, the lectures are interesting and the class is never overwhelming.",
    "Memorize 500 million years of evolution in one night for the final. Enjoyed writing the paper though.",
    "Not bad for a SC. I definitely learned a lot of really cool things and felt humbled by how little we humans comprise of the whole history of life. You'll dig this if you loveeee looking at dinosaur fossils. Nick and Derek Briggs are great teachers and really entertaining. Leo Hickey could use a little work (he sometimes uses too much jargon and loses me to boredom partway through his lectures), but he's not terrible, just not as good as the other two, and I think he will definitely improve upon teaching this class again (I think this was his first time?) Exams were really manageable as long as you study the slides and go to section before the exam, and the paper is great for helping bump up your grade if you work on it.",
    "A really interesting class, both scientifically and philosophically, with work load that was very manageable. I didn't particularly like the lecture style of two of the three professors, but that's just personal preference and the class was enjoyable nonetheless. Recommended!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who needs to fulfill a SC requirement, although it is not an easy science course",
    "Good overview of a large amount of Geology and EEB-type science. Lecture slides are available online but you're making a big mistake not to attend class. Each of the different lecturers has a bit of a unique style but brings a lot to their own specialties. I really enjoyed it as someone with a strong EEB background, but its also accessible to non-science majors.",
    "This is a great class. All three instructors are amazing and it is very well-organized. I also think this that the material it covers should be part of every educated person's general knowledge. The only thing I disliked was the emphasis on memorization in the midterm, I hope they change this - it would make a great class even better.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who has an interest in science. You don't have to be a science-major to enjoy the class but a slight interest in the topic is necessary.",
    "Yes, it is great to know about how life on earth came to be how it is now. And these professors are topnotch in their fields while being really accessible so it was wonderful learning from them.",
    "Take it. Its a relatively tough but extremely useful class. I see the world differently now thanks to it.",
    "This is a great look at biology and all life from the earliest signs of life to the present day. As a geology\/paleontology course, I learned a lot more than I had originally anticipated, and I was able to gain a better view of the history of life.",
    "Yes. I think it's a valuable class, maybe just for a science credit, but I learned just so much information. And it's weighty material too -- you're learning about the history of earth, which, years after Yale, I'll still probably be able to bring up during light conversation, which I wouldn't be able to do if it was some other, less interesting class.",
    "This is a great science credit. The material is interesting and well-presented and the workload is quite manageable. The instructors are enthusiastic and clearly love teaching.",
    "History of Life is a fun course, particularly the second half of the course. It isn't all about dinosaurs (only a few lectures), but the professors do a mostly good job at making the class entertaining, interesting, and relevant. It could be really boring, especially if you're looking for an intense scientific approach to natural history. At the same time, it is what you make of it and could be just as interesting and enjoyable.",
    "I LOVED this class---but I'm a self-confessed paleontology nerd, so take that with a grain of salt. This class isn't all about dinosaurs and woolly mammoths, nor is it all about tiny organisms preserved in chert. It's a bit of everything, and you can learn a lot if you come to lecture consistently and take good notes. The exams aren't at all bad if you study for them, and the one big paper we did was actually pretty fun\/easy. All in all, a good science class for non-sciency people who don't want to take a gut.",
    "This was my favorite course, it was fun and interesting and gives you a great background. Also, museum plaques make sense now."
