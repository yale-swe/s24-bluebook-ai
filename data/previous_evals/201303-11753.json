   "comments": [
    "Simultaneously sprawling and narrow in its scope, this was a really informative class. Great for both Japanophiles and those who don't know a whole lot about Japan. The theme of \"nationalism\" is such an important concept to learn about, and becomes even more interesting when viewed through the lens of Japan.",
    "HIST 312J is a seminar on modern Japan and how it dealt with nationalism. So it also is a course on nationalism itself considered more theoretically.I'd recommend it with some improvements - more history, more people in the class for more fast-paced discussion.",
    "Interesting readings. You don't really conclude the course with a firm sense of anything, just more questions--if you're comfortable with that, then it's good.",
    "Definitely a great class to take if you're interested in East Asia, international affairs or history. Or if you just want to gain a new perspective on race, ethnicity and the nation-state.",
    "I would recommend this to students with some knowledge of Japanese history, especially in the Meiji and postwar eras, but also an interest in the concepts of nation, state, and country. I would recommend this course for students who want to learn to think objectively about these concepts.",
    "This is a strongly discussion based course so if you have a general grasp of the theory and of Japan, it helps with the course. That being said you don't have to necessarily have any background in these topics and the first two weeks was a nice brief introduction to the topics in the class. I found that because this course focused so much on discussion, there was little consensus on any topic, though this was intellectually stimulating I also found it a bit exhausting trying to find an answer which never really materialized."
