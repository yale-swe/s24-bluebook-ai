    "If you know you're going to spend at least 20 hours\/week at lab, why not take Intensive and get more credit for it? The difference between 495 and 485 is really minimal. Instead of giving one power point presentation per year, you give two! Working on another presentation midway will probably even help you understand your project better and make the final paper easier to write."
