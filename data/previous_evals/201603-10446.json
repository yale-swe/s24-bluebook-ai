    "I really knew nothing about evolutionary biology, other than what a phylogenetic tree was, before taking this course. I learned a lot about the field, and also how to analytically evaluate scientific papers and how to conduct a literature review. All around a great course.",
    "I literally learned not a single thing from this course.",
    "Biol 104 is an interesting class that I really enjoyed in terms of the content. I highly recommend it. However, this course was not well done. Professor Near was an interesting and engaging lecturer, but he tried to fit WAY too much content into each lecture and just ended up rambling on and on. It went too fast and just glanced over way too many topics to really delve into any of them. In lecture if you stop for even a moment to think about a slide, he is already three slides ahead. Also, it was very unclear what we needed to know for exams and paper, and the final paper was extremely not well defined and very confusing. The pace of this course was ridiculous and I have heard much better things about the Spring semester Biol 104 class. This was definitely my favorite in terms of content, but least well done module in the Biol 101-104 off-track sequence.",
    "Bio 104 was all about ecology and evolutionary biology. You'll get a good introduction to phylogenetics: how to construct and analyze phylogenetic trees, evolution of plants and their adaptations to new environments, the paradox of sex, etc.",
    "Figuring out how to study without a clear outline of the material",
    "This course was a general overview of ecological and evolutionary concepts.",
    "Knowledge about evolutionary biology.",
    "Still studying for the final. Kinda confused about what I should know. Pray for me.",
    "Basic knowledge about evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned very little.",
    "Evolution and ecology",
    "I learned a ton about the history of life. Just so much, primarily in the week before the final.",
    "I gained a greater appreciation for how the world has developed and changed over time. However, I also became very uncomfortable with the level of disdain showed in this course towards certain segments of society (i.e. towards third world countries with high birth rates, developing countries that are using a lot of fossil fuels, etc.) and so in that way I developed a greater sense of how science goes wrong in treating people as mere numbers.",
    "cambrian explosion",
    "All I learned about in this course was stickleback fish and other forms of marine life. I understand that Professor Near is an ichthyologist and is therefore obsessed with fish, but what relevance does this have to my life? I also learned that even with \"absolute dating\" we still have no way of completely knowing the exact timing of geologic and evolutionary events. From this class, I learned to sit through excruciatingly boring lectures that jumped from one species to the next without any logical flow. I also learned not to base my self-worth on an exam grade that was the day after the presidential election :)",
    "A lot of memorisation of time periods.",
    "I learned about the basics of ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned about the evolution of various organisms and how to interpret phylogenies to understand relationships between species.",
    "e&eb is pretty cool! really neat to see how we fit into the history of things.",
    "I learned a lot about animals. I feel like there was definitely more of an emphasis on evolution than ecology.",
    "I have gained a solid understanding of the evolutionary history of the Earth and a new interest in plant biology. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this module as much as I did, and I'm glad to find that my interests in biology are broader than I initially thought.",
    "I better understood ecological biology.",
    "I learned the basics of evolutionary biology and the interplay between evolution and ecology. It was interesting to think about phylogenetic relationships and how molecular data can be used to study patterns of evolution.",
    "I have learned about how organisms came to be, how they interact, and how we know. I have come to learn more about the non-human world we live in.",
    "Information on evolutionary biology, phylogeny, how genes evolve, causes of speciation and extinction.",
    "I learned basic principles of evolution and some ecology.",
    "I learned how to read and construct phylogenetic trees, as well as abilities in looking at the evolutionary history of species and questioning why it took that pathway. The classes involves learning many facts and applying them, somewhat, to larger topics of evolution.",
    "Bio 104 was a completely different type of learning compared to the previous three bio modules. I learned three-quarters through the class that I had to make a major shift in my learning style, so that I could digest and understand what Professor Near was teaching us. Especially after failing the midterm, I believe I have really started to understand my own follies in being overconfident in my understanding of the material, and to realize that each class comes with its own challenges, and that in this class, I had to memorize a lot more information than previously. In the future, I hope to be able to adapt to each professor's teaching style and develop my own learning style accordingly.",
    "I am able to map and read phylogenetic trees",
    "broad phylogenetic and evolutionary history concepts",
    "Huge depth of knowledge concerning phylogenetics and ecology. Very interesting class that taught me how to look at the big picture.",
    "Concepts in ecology as well as evolution.",
    "The main takeaway from this course was the historical perspective one must have of biological processes.",
    "I think I got a clearer picture of evolution as a science for sure, but nothing huge that I will carry with me in the future.",
    "I don't think that this class really taught me very much.",
    "Learned about evolutionary history of genes (ie what duplication vs. speciation is, and how gene interactions control different phenotypes) Studied the everyday interaction between ecology and evolution Real life applications such as how to set the molecular clock of a fossil given radiation rate and how to constrcut a parsimonious tree Realized the gravity of anthropogenic impact \/ global warming on species abundance and distribution",
    "I learned about a lot of different things about phylogenetic trees and mechanics of evolution, and the Peabody tour was interesting. However, the whole thing was a lot in not very much time and was very crammed.",
    "I learned some evolutionary biology. I guess.",
    "I learned about the intricacies of evolution and learned how to identify its occurrences on a micro and macro scale. I also learned how to begin writing scientific papers.",
    "mostly evolutionary biology, very little ecology",
    "This course largely taught me about the amazing biodiversity of life on Earth, and it was pretty cool to learn about this stuff. I just came back from a trip to Belize, and I could apply some of the facts I learned from BIO 104 to the fauna and flora around me, and this information made the trip more interesting.",
    "I learned about the evolutionary development of organisms and how theories were developed.",
    "Information on evolution and ecology, writing scientific papers",
    "You learn avout evolution mainly and other things about ecology and history of earth.",
    "This class taught me about evolutionary history of life, as well as how evolution and speciation works.",
    "This class had the potential to be the best class in the bio series but it was so boring and we weren't assessed on our ability to understand the big picture of evolution and ecology but rather our ability to memorize random details from the slides. Also why do the instructors get so passive aggressive on Piazza?",
    "In addition to covering the basic facts of E&EB that need to be memorized, this class encouraged us to make inferences with data that we were given and to evaluate experimental hypotheses in light of the results of the experiments.",
    "I learned a lot more about the history of life on Earth and about the relationships between various animals. I learned how to read and interpret phylogenetic trees.",
    "I learned a lot of evolutionary history and trends for how various structures developed.",
    "This course taught me about the complexities and intricacies of the history of life on earth in an interesting and engaging manner. I learned how to read and interpret phylogenetic trees and also write my own research paper based on interpretations from a phylogenetic tree.",
    "A great introduction to biology",
    "I don't feel like K learned anything valuable in this course.",
    "I gained a thorough knowledge of evolutionary biology.",
    "This class was useful for learning about ecology and evolutionary biology and how to use different techniques in the field, like using phylogenetic trees.",
    "Phylogenetic trees, thinking broadly about evolution, gaining foundational knowledge of the history and development of life on earth",
    "I received a very solid introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. I learned about phylogenetic trees and how to interpret them. I learned about the evolution of species and how our species is related to others.",
    "BIOL 104 taught me how to approach biology from an evolutionary perspective. I learned about the theory of evolution, the origin of life, and how biodiversity is maintained. I will be able to carry this knowledge forward in future biology classes that I take.",
    "A focus on phylogenetic trees and the evolutionary history of how humans came to be. Briefly touch upon plant history\/anatomy, ecology, etc., but the class culminates in basically a huge phylogenetic tree.",
    "BIOL 104 has been an enjoyable class--I've learned a lot about phylogeny, ecology, and evolution.",
    "Evolutionary processes were highlighted in this course as well as how to predict them using molecular and fossil records.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the history and principles of ecology and evolutionary biology. I learned how to better filter important information out of extensive lecture notes in a biological context. I learned so much about the earth's natural history and the evolutionary relationships between organisms of all types! I also practiced writing preliminary research proposals and was able to conduct research using many different scientific databases."

   "comments": [
    "Lecture was very much Professor Near reading off the slides, so I often felt like it was a bit of a waste of time to sit there when I could go over the slides myself.",
    "Weakness: Piss-poor professor. Disorganized Lecture. Unnecessary paper. Unclear instructions. Useless section. Poor delivery of concepts. Strengths: Only 6 weeks.",
    "I really liked the course. The only thing I would change would be to be a little bit more realistic about the material we could cover in a given 75 minutes. Sometimes if we didn't get through a third of the lecture slides the course would feel disjoined and Prof Near would move too quickly. Other than that, though, I don't have anything to change. I really liked the Marsh Botanical Garden Tour.",
    "This class was so disorganized. It made it hard to glean anything when half of the people (teaching scholars included) didn't know what was going on. Also, the paper was a dumb assignment. It was not well explained, as evidence by people posting on Piazza the day before it was due that they didn't understand what the research approach was. I hated attending lecture because I knew I was going to sit there for an hour and fifteen minutes, try to focus, and then realize it was a waste of my time.",
    "Biol 104 is an interesting class that I really enjoyed in terms of the content. I highly recommend it. However, this course was not well done.

This was definitely my favorite in terms of content, but least well done module in the Biol 101-104 off-track sequence.",
    "Strengths include interesting information. Weaknesses include how fast the course went and how the information was structured. It felt quite disorganized and by focusing on so many details, I feel like the main takeaways from each lecture was lost.",
    "Lectures could have been filled with more useful information, rather than examples of the material.",
    "The course was able to cover a lot of breadth and raise some interesting questions. I really appreciated having lecture overviews in BIOL 101-103, and that is something I missed this semester. Also, for the final paper, I wish that the class received more guidance on the expectations and how to complete it.",
    "The lecture content and slides were hard to follow, jumped around a lot.",
    "Weakness: paper. what the heck was I supposed to do? so much confusion everywhere. Strength: museum visit! so dank Weakness: grading. I know. I know. Considered everybodys grades for the midterm. Compared them to other grades. Took a bunch of time for analysis. Not weeks fam. You took too long. Not cool. Gotta get grades back faster. You know you're dealing with a bunch of neurotic messes right? We were dying, and it felt like you didn't care. Strenghts: prof seems engaged, has good anecdotes Strength: offering enrichment weakness: not accomodating everybody who wants to be in enrichment weakness: not running section like enrichment. The papers aren't tested on, so everybody blows them off. Just make section enrichment. If you want people to pay attention to the papers make their grade depend on them. Assign homework. Don't sit us in a room and make us listen to a talk about the papers for an hour then have the papers disappear forever Strength: offering piazza, amazing, thank you so much! weakness: not confirming if student answers were good or not on piazza. weakness: the final and the midterm are on the same number of lectures, and the final isn't cumulative. They should be worth the same amount of my final grade.",
    "Less material would make us understand better.",
    "This was a very poorly run course. One of the very first slides in the first lecture stated that we wouldn't be tested on readings, but then three days prior to the final we were told the opposite. When I posted it on Piazza to ask for clarification on the contradiction, they deleted my post. It's honestly disappointing, because I like Prof. Near as a person, just... not a good course.",
    "The strengths of this course were its set-up (6 weeks, 12 lectures) and the inclusion of discussion sections. The major weakness of this course was definitely the Five Page Paper (I felt like I didn't have the background to read and analyze the necessary scientific literature to develop my own hypothesis).",
    "The paper was very difficult, the problem sets were helpful, the lecture pace was way too fast",
    "I found the research paper to be a very good exercise that definitely required a great deal of thought and creativity regarding evolutionary biology. I am not sure how I feel about trading the 5 quizzes for a midterm. It definitely made it so I didn't break up my studying at all. Rather I spent an immense amount of time in reading week memorizing vast amounts of material. I still learned it, but a lot of students might prefer quizzes so that they are forced to study throughout the semester.",
    "The lectures were so hard to follow. There are too many slides that get sped through and it makes it hard to take notes and listen at the same time. Often times before I was even able to click on the next slide I would have already missed information. There were also term that were referred to during lecture that were not defined or explained and it is hard to build an understanding off of them while trying to keep up with the fast pace.",
    "Yale students come to Yale because they like to learn. Yale students hate this course. There are so many things wrong with it. Grading is incredibly subjective. Assessments need to be more frequent and clear in what they are asking (there were poorly worded questions on our only midterm and the final), TFs took away points for arbitrary reasons, etc. Students are constantly confused and the teachers became very snippy on Piazza, the question asking site. Resources (i.e. lecture slides) were not posted in a timely manner. Finally and most importantly, because this course was so incredibly subjective, it made biology miserable. THERE NEEDS TO BE A TEXTBOOK THAT EVERYONE CAN REFER TO AND IS ACTUALLY RELEVANT TO OUR SUBJECT MATTER.",
    "Strengths: I'm honestly struggling to come up with a response. I guess the one strength of this course is knowing that if you've made it all the way to BIO 104, you're almost done with intro bio, so if you can hold onto that you might just make it out alive. Weaknesses: 1) The fact that 2 exams are worth 60% of your grade and that the other 40% consists of easy assignments that anyone can get a 100 on. Since the class is curved, the 40% counts for nothing and if you happen to be affected by lack of sleep after an extremely stressful election night, good luck doing well in the course. Quizzes are a must and it was extremely disappointing that they were not included in this module. 2) I'm not going to be sympathetic to the fact that this was the first time Professor Near taught this module because it's also my first time learning this type of content and I wasn't shown any mercy. Lectures were disorganized and I would much rather have content on lecture slides than photos of random species that I don't need to be familiar with.",
    "In lecture, the professor spoke very fast and rushed over a lot of slides. I found it very hard to take good notes for this reason. Often, each lecture had way too many slides to even finish in each lecture.",
    "This class is a wonderful introduction to the entirety of biodiversity and geologic biohistory, but in that broad span lies a problem, as well: such a large survey course at times feels disjointed. What is important? With so many facts thrown at students each lecture, it is sometimes important to see the broader significance, or even just to distill the important facts to know and digest. Given the class's difficult mandate of instructing a diverse, large group of students, it does a reasonably satisfactory job of remaining interesting and stimulating.",
    "The biology modules are miserable. It makes students interested in biology or related fields completely hate the material because it forces you to hold down watered-down gruel. I hate more difficulty in this class than a 300-level biology course because the material is very watered-down and the assignments are so burdensome.",
    "I think the Bio modules in general are great because it allowed me to learn about many different components of biology, so that I could get an idea for what interests me and what I might take in the future. Although I think there is a lot of interesting information to be presented concerning evolutionary biology, I think this module packed too much information in, especially as we seemed to jump quickly from topic to topic. Furthermore, while having historical context and dates for different evolutionary events were interesting, I feel that it sometimes distracted from me actually gaining an understanding of the processes that underlie evolution and how those are analyzed.",
    "The course is good in that it gives students a brief introduction to the material, in an accessible way. However, often the expectations of the course, including assignments and exams, were unclear. This could be improved if the Professors stopped relying on piazza to communicate with students and instead engaged face-to-face. Professors and TAs were often difficult to be in touch with by email and were unavailable to meet in person. Issues with the course and material and assignments could have been cleared up if there was better communication.",
    "strengths: material was neat, and both prof Lin and prof Near clearly cared a lot about the class and did their best to make it interesting and exciting for us, and challenging but on a relatable level. weaknesses: I appreciated the thought behind why there were so few words on the slides, but sometimes that made it more confusing if we didn't take good notes for a part of the class and then didn't have much to go back on for the slides. logical flow of the slides was also sometimes a bit confusing, and there were often a lot of big words on the slides that were explained in a sort of confusing way (although explained better verbally in class). generally, this just made it harder if you didn't happen to take good notes one day or something, but otherwise it was fine.",
    "The material is good, but I think there is a lack of clarity with what the assignments require students to do. Also, there is a lot of memorization required because there are no weekly quizzed like the previous BIOL modules.",
    "Strengths: breadth of material and good storytelling Weaknesses: 5-page paper was strangely broad (although worthwhile in the end), admin-to-student communication was sometimes reactionary rather than proactive",
    "It could be improved by having detailed study guides like the first three modules.",
    "The class suits my learning style in that a principle is presented and then examples demonstrating the principle are shown. I would have liked to see a more clear progression from lecture to lecture.",
    "Sometimes assignments were not completely clear. There could be more clarification with assignments like the 5-page paper. And if a TA is not very responsive, there can be disparities in student understanding. Otherwise, well done. Enrichment is helpful for those who desire.",
    "The paper was a good pedagogical tool and I suppose that this class would be super interesting if you love ecology and evolutionary biology. The lectures were just very unorganized and that was probably the largest downfall. There was a ton of really great info on the slide and it just would not be properly explained and instead most of the class would be anecdotes about certain species. It was thus very hard to stay engaged with the material or follow it during class. Because our assignments weren't very consistent time wise it was very easy to put this class on the back burner and not be engaged.",
    "This course was taught terribly. Unlike the other bio modules, this course did not support student learning. The other courses had clear expectations, study guides, and weekly quizzes, whereas this course had vague assignments, such as a paper where the whole assignment was super unclear, and the lectures were not taught well. The lecture slides were 80 slides long, with too many unnecessary details and examples that took time away from explaining any of the actual important material. While the topic was interesting, the teaching made this class not worthwhile at all. Piazza, which was supposed to be used for the instructor to answer student questions, was instead a burden on all of the poor TAs since the professor did not address student questions in the slightest. He instead answered \"this is very simple,...\" and then proceeded to give a one sentence rewording of the very unclear statement already written on his lecture slide, often missing the entire point of the question. He did not try to eliminate any confusion or go out of his way to provide us with any study materials, such as practice exams. The TAs and Professor Lin tried to help us, at least attempting to answer questions thoroughly on Piazza, but could not save the course.",
    "As this is the final module in the introductory biology sequence, it is fitting that the structure differs somewhat from the previous three. Instead of weekly quizzes, there is a more conventional midterm and final exam, which admittedly does make the course more challenging. It is also radically different in terms of course content, covering evolution of species with heavy emphasis on organism relationships in the tree of life. Because this is such a shift from the type of biology most students are used to (and some having never seen this type of material at all), it seems that the course did not adequately situate students before delving into the details. There was more information about various species than could ever be retained in the lectures, which were also 80 to 100 slides each. Nearly every lecture also spilled into the first half of the next as well. Although I understand that fitting a broad overview of the field into 12 lectures is an burdening task, one that the course accomplished quite well, it may be better to cut some of the details given the jarring change of pace. Instead of assuming that everyone knows what a naked mole rat or a tree fern is, start with even more basic units. I felt constantly lost in a sea of knowledge that I was completely unprepared to handle with the actual content of the course on top of that to synthesize a grasp of ecology and evolution from. Without the background to understand the ecology of the world, students would certainly benefit from less detail and more situation. Perhaps start with the biodiversity of the world and an introduction to various groups of organisms and then begin to discuss their evolutionary histories and ecological niches instead of devoting each lecture to a theme of ecology\/evolution with the presumption that examples of organisms will be known and understood. Another important aspect I found to be missing from the course is an explanation of the geologic time scale of the Earth, with a timeline of the various eons, era, periods, etc. and where they fall relative to each other. I found myself spending vast amounts of time trying to reconstruct evolutionary history in the context of the history of Earth (does the Devonian-period?-come before or after the Eocene-epoch?). All in all, the course provided exactly the kind of general overview of the field as intended but I feel that I spent more time and energy to get there than if it had been somewhat more welcoming to newcomers.",
    "This class focuses a lot on the evolutionary history and biology of our planet and sometimes requires memorizing a lot of facts. It was a great course and Professor Near was excellent, I just wish that there was more ecology involved in the course.",
    "I loved the excitement and adventures I embarked on in this class--through interesting facts learned in class as well as an actual field trip to the Marsh Botanical Gardens. I wish that some of the written components were better explained or if there was a sample of the 5-page paper beforehand.",
    "A huge glaring weakness in this course module compared to the others was the incredibly unclear and disorganized format. Professor Near was the only professor who chose to not have quizzes--which is fine. But in doing so, he should have been meticulous in making sure the material was communicated clearly and effectively to the students so that they would have better outlines going into the Midterm and Final. Instead, he had powerpoints that were 99 slides, completely unoutlined, sequenced ambiguously, and overfilled with unimportant and stupid pictures of animals without headers. Thus, if you missed even one class you would be at a complete loss in what the material in the slides were about. Furthermore, because Near rambled on endlessly about his work with fish, cracked many jokes\/puns, he would lose track of time and would have to spend two days for each lecture. It got so bad that he had to start breaking each lecture into two parts--adding to the confusion. Lastly, even if you wanted to get clarification on some of the things he discussed, Piazza was a very hostile place with instructors posting pretty snarky and inappropriate, frankly, responses whenever they received a question they didn't particularly feel like answering. Secondly, if you wished to really try to give Near the benefit of the doubt and go to his office hours, multiple students complained that he wouldn't show up or would be late. The peer tutor also missed one or two sessions, due to forgetfulness. However, the peer tutor is a student...Mr. Near is not. Don't even get me started on the instructions for the 5 page paper. The assignment instructions were so unclear that even my TA admitted that he didn't understand exactly what the point was until it was finally clarified over piazza. Overall, 104 needs a lot of work.",
    "While the course provided useful information and the assignments\/exams were fairly graded, in a couple of instances the professor did not clearly outline the expectations for exams\/assignments. This led to widespread confusion (and for some, panic) due to not knowing what we were supposed to study or write. In addition, the course could have benefited from a more structured lecture format, although I understand that this is the first time that the professor is teaching this course.",
    "Strength: well organized section and good correlation between papers and lecture material. Very helpful teaching staff and professor. Weakness: Lectures were somewhat scattered and difficult to organize. Perhaps more chronological ordering would help with understanding where events fall in time.",
    "The course's subject material was interesting and Prof. Near generally lectured fairly well, but the structure was a departure from all other modules (not an imiprovement, in my view) and not much help or context was given with what we were asked to do, whether that was the paper or the final. Things, particularly timelines, weren't put together cohesively.",
    "There were many weaknesses in this final biology module. In Bio 104 the whole structure of the modules was destroyed. This module included no study guides or weekly quizzes. The lack of study guides resulted in student not knowing the central themes of the lectures. The lack of quizzes caused students to be unfamiliar with the types of questions that could be asked of the material. In addition students got no feedback on their understanding of the material because there were no weekly grades. Because of this student could not see if they understood the material or where they fell in the class. The only main grades for the course were the midterm, paper, and final. The midterm was not returned until more than 3 weeks after it was taken, which continued to leave students in the dark about their understanding. In addition the paper grades were not posted until during reading week. This made the drop deadlines useless because student did not have any understanding of their progress in the class until the end of the module. The other biology modules did a very good job at keeping students informed of their progress in the class. This final module seemed like a step backwards from the success of the previous 3 in the series. Another weakness was the length of each lecture including almost double the amount of slides than previous modules contained. These excessive slides made it hard to find the essential information and therefore made a very interesting subject boring because it was hard to follow. These weaknesses could be improved by making bio 104 fit into the format of the other modules. This would allow for the fluidity of the modules to return and students would be able to receive feedback because they would have to exercise their knowledge weekly, like they did in previous modules.",
    "This course was extremely interesting, however the lack of precedents (because it was taught my a new professor) made it hard to follow. It was very different from what I expected from a ecology and evolution class.",
    "Presentation length! The first lectures, in particular, were way too long, so it was hard to focus and see what the logical progression of ideas was. Also, it would have been much better to have quizzes as they help you study and understand concepts better (especially if the previous courses did have quizzes). Additionally, the super rigid structure of the course that led to the retention of the midterm date despite all the political and emotional distress is something that should be modified.",
    "Near is the strength of this course; he's a good professor. Everything else was more of the same if you've taken other modules. We sped through ecology and evolutionary biology without any really depth on anything. Tests felt like a matter of memorization, which sucked because facts won't stick me with after the exam. Hope to see this module become more application-based in the future. The final paper, while ok in hindsight, was especially confusing when I was doing it (unclear instructions) and felt rather useless (didn't learn anything from it).",
    "The class was not taught well at all. The lectures were very disorganized and way too much information was presented with with not enough time spent on each topic. There was no flow to the lectures, which made it very hard to study and organize information in your head. He would go from one topic to another with no transition at all. While he may have been an engaging lecturer, the confusing manner in which he presented the material made this class terrible.",
    "I absolutely loved the trip to the Peabody museum and seeing the variety of rare and extinct birds, Ediacaran fossils, prizewinning dog skins, and reconstructions of extinct mammals and giant arthropods of the Carboniferous. It added a level of realism to the concept of evolution, of which so much takes place in the past.",
    "This was a pretty standardly taught intro class. I like how the class was structured--discussion sections reviewed scientific papers which we did not have to know the details of but helped incorporate the material we learned in class. The textbook was a source of supplementary learning as opposed to a primary source and Professor Near was a very clear teacher.",
    "My only concern with this course was that I felt like there was very little support in the 104 Discussion Sections compared to those of 101-103. We were instructed to write a 5 page research paper but I felt like besides one paper-topic check-in, it was very difficult to tell if I was going in the right direction with the research paper. I wish there had been more periodic assignments and more concrete feedback so I could have written a stronger final product.",
    "This course was very badly handled, logistically. We received our midterms on the last day of class. This was kind of egregious. Lectures were vague, or too specific, and the things that we needed to know for the exam weren't always spelled out. It was also, weirdly, the lsat of the bio modules and changed the format dramatically. The quiz-a-week format was honestly much easier, because it allowed us to learn the material piecemeal and spread out the stress a bit. Also, it helped me learn what I needed to learn.",
    "I wish it had been clearer what information we were responsible for before the exams, as there was a ton of information (including a ton of names, dates, etc.) and it was hard to tell what was really important. I also wish it had followed the same assessment format as the other biology modules (i.e., having a quiz every week and one final instead of a midterm and exam). Having a quiz every week held us accountable for information every week instead of ending up cramming for midterms and finals. I loved the inclusion of the Peabody Museum field trip.",
    "The course seemed somewhat disorganized or poorly planned. The implementing of two exams (after many were used to weekly quizzes and a final) caught many off guard and having a midterm the day after the election seemed like poor planning. The directions surrounding the paper, or lack thereof, made many people confused about what exactly it was asking, so the directions should be more clear. The field trips replacing section were a nice way to apply the concepts from class to the real world.",
    "Strengths- interesting material, section papers, peabody tour Weaknesses- disorganized, unclear instructions on assignments, especially for the 5 page paper (in the 6 pages of instructions we received, it wasn't clear whether the paper was supposed to be a lit review, a proposal, or a research report, and many of the TAs also didn't know what was expected). slides often had a lot of examples\/details so that it was unclear what we were responsible for knowing- For example in the history of life section it was unclear whether we needed to memorizes the species of single celled eukaryotes, the classification of fungi, etc.",
    "One strength of the course is how much information it covers. I think some main ways this course could be improved are as follows: - having more infrastructure to help students with the material: more peer tutors, hiring more E&EB grad students as TAs, having regularly scheduled professor office hours, etc. - I think the exams in this course focused on rather small, random details sometimes, and I believe this lends itself to unfair testing of a student's knowledge of the material. I see two ways of making exams fairer: 1) focusing less on small details and asking more questions to make students apply their knowledge of evolutionary mechanisms\/hypotheses to different not-seen-before situations. 2) making the exams longer and more comprehensive in their testing of small details. In its current form, I think some students can get lucky by studying the small facts that end up being included in the exams, and some students that study everything but forget some minutiae get punished. - this might be a stretch, but I would consider moving this module to an earlier place in the module order because it is largely a memorization-based course. BIO 103 required students to think experimentally and analytically, which is more conducive to preparing students for many more of the upper-level biology courses that students take. I think ending on BIO 104 is a kind of reversion to a memorization-based biology that we were taught in high school.",
    "I wish we had the weekly quizzes again so I'd know what I didn't know before the midterm ! There were a lot of slides in each lecture which made it very hard for me to focus - I feel like I know a lot of facts but am unsure if I truly understand that much",
    "The two problem sets we had were a great way to engage with the material and see how we were grasping what was being taught. I liked how sections covered scientific papers and allowed us to see how the concepts taught in lecture appeared in real world situations. The additional examples of the concepts allowed me to better understand the basis and development of the material. Unfortunately after the two problem sets, if became very unclear what aspects of lecture were important and what was just fun additional facts, which made studying for the exams difficult. The paper and summary were fairly pointless activities in my opinion. The summary was just rewriting what we talked about in section, which is not helping me learn anything new or come to new conclusions. The paper was not well explained and it was unclear how we were supposed to develop a theory about evolutionary concepts with a very crude understanding of basic evolution and without having and data to back up our conclusions. I think it would be more beneficial to have problem sets that actually relate to the course material. I understand the idea is to apply what we have learned but we have not learned enough to make such giant claims without any data to back it up.",
    "Interesting content, though it was a little overwhelming. Also the information was so varied that the teaching of it was a little disorganised.",
    "The course is boring but not hard to understand.",
    "A LOT of information is thrown at you with much less guidance on what you need to know compared to the other modules. Fun material though, I'll be sprouting fun facts about plants and animals until I forget the stuff.",
    "The major strength of the class is in Professor Near's lectures, but the weaknesses are the lack of preparation for the exams, notably in that there is little guidance given on what to study meaning that it becomes a task to find and extract the relevant information from the lectures. If more structure was given to students regarding the material covered on exams as well as the research paper, the course would have been greatly improved.",
    "This course was not very engaging or interesting.",
    "The strengths are that the slides are posted online, but the weaknesses are that it is unclear what information we should be focusing on and there is very little support for students who are struggling. Most help is vague and unstructured. Sections have very little to do with the material of the course.",
    "Strengths: research papers read in section were interesting Weaknesses: not a strong emphasis on experimental approaches (especially quantitative approaches), very ambiguous guidelines for the research paper, no weekly quizzes",
    "It's really easy but really boring",
    "The course is a good general overview of the biology that's on the syllabus, and the topics are interesting. However, it would be more enjoyable if the focus was on reasoning rather than memorization, and specifically in the case of Biology 101-104, if more of the class were devoted to reading and analyzing papers rather than being tested on memorized facts. Also speaking generally about the bio sequence, it would be helpful to cover processes such as respiration and photosynthesis so that the chemical basis for the subjects that are covered later is included in the course. And it would have been helpful to cover fewer topics in more depth. I understand that some of this may be impractical because of the large size of the bio sequence and the fact that it is a series of survey courses, and the classes are well taught, but if it's possible to implement any of these changes that might improve the sequence for me personally.",
    "The exams do not match the material given. They are nitpicky and regurgitation of vocabulary not stressed, not useful in synthesizing material. Needed practice exams to have better understanding of this post true concept class BIOL 103 Grades and feedback need to come in faster so we can improve, especially in big exam heavy class.",
    "The class is a strange mix of very broad concepts and very specific facts. It was hard to know what to focus on in terms of studying. It is also hard to summarize what I learned.",
    "Strengths of this course include the focus on trends and application towards the end of the course. The papers complemented lectures nicely. Weaknesses include rote memorization for a lot of theory names or time periods.",
    "The course covered plants in great detail, but some topics were typically brushed by and not sufficiently expounded on in my opinion.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, however, I found that without weekly quizzes it was more challenging to remain on top of all of the material.",
    "The major weakness of this course is the lack of organization. The lectures were long, often boring, and terribly organized.",
    "This course had good pacing and fair testing\/grading. I enjoyed Prof Near's lectures. My only complaint with this course is that we covered a large amount of material and never went into significant depth with any of the concepts. I also felt like the different lessons seemed somewhat disconnected from one another, and I would have enjoyed having some kind of overarching theme to tie all the lesson material together.",
    "This class was the least engaging of the biology sections. The strengths were that the instructor was very interested in the material and was therefore energetic in presenting a lot of the information. A weakness was that parts of the class seemed disorganized or the instructors could not clearly explain what they wanted from assignments. An example of this was the final paper assigned to the class, which was difficult to follow and explanations on Piazza seemed to simply restate previous comments rather than explain what was wanted from students.",
    "The lectures could be covered at a slower pace- too many slides for one lecture it's hard to keep up",
    "The discussion sections were good but I wished it reviewed a bit more the material learned in class. Professor Near's powerpoints were also very condensed, compared to the other Biol modules, and he often went through them too fast, I wish he had focused on going over each topic with a bit more emphasis.",
    "Strengths: More interesting content, and less memorization-focused than the previous bio modules. Weaknesses: The Paper Assignment!!! The assignment itself was unclear, it hardly related to what we were learning in lecture, we did not have nearly enough background to complete it in a thoughtful way, it didn't help me understand lecture better, and the grading of it was a joke. (By that, I mean my TA gave me no helpful feedback, and other students I talked to across sections said the same). Also, I miss the weekly quizzes-they were a good way in the other modules to help me assess my knowledge on a more regular basis.",
    "The only part of the course that could have been better was the Paper on Evolution and Modern Society. The instructions could have been more clear and more demonstrations given for how to conduct research on the gene we selected.",
    "The lectures contained too much information that at times seemed a bit jumbled.",
    "Way too much material that the lecturer just rushes through, instead of pausing and asking questions and ensuring that we were following along. Furthermore, the homework assignments were unclear and the midterm was right after the election, which just was a cause for disaster.",
    "The class has some interesting points, but because you have to get through quite a bit of disparate material, it often feels like there is little organization. Even when you are building knowledge towards where humans \"fit\" in a phylogenetic tree, you tend to feel like lectures ramble on and on. The homework is a lot more \"figure it out yourself\" in comparison to 101-103, especially because you essentially write a paper without aid, so having more help with that would be great too.",
    "This course was too heavy to be taught in one semester, it seemed like the topics we covered sometimes had little cohesion with each other on a lecture-lecture basis.",
    "This course is very memorization-heavy. There was not nearly as much application of material as in the other modules.",
    "The lectures went though material very quickly, making it difficult to keep up without taking notes on printouts or on laptop. The aim of the 5 page paper was difficult to grasp, and the feedback given during the checkin was not detailed, so I felt confused during the process and almost every other student I talked to felt the same. Overall, I do not feel like I benefitted in any way from writing the paper. The research papers covered in discussion section were good illustrations of the topics covered in lecture and were well chosen.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of this course are the instructors and TFs! They are always available to help and answer any questions you may have, and they are completely invested in their work and their teaching. I enjoyed the information presented in this class; however, I would have preferred having the weekly quizzes as previously included in the BIOL 101-103 sequence. Other than that, I really enjoyed this course!"

   "comments": [
    "I think the was the best of the four intro bio modules. Professor Near was definitely my favorite professor because he was more engaging than the rest. It wasn't always necessary to attend lecture because the slides were all on line, but for some topics it's best to go because they're easier to understand in person.",
    "If it is a requirement, sure. I hope you don't have T. Near. It is like BIOL101\/102\/103's neglected cousin. It should, on paper, be a riveting class. However the course design was horrendous. The paper was, to put it in layman terms, dumb. The course just lacked anything inspiring, which I would expect from a class that details our rich and diverse evolutionary history. Sucks.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to, but embrace it and really dive in. There's a lot to learn and it's all really cool!",
    "If you are taking this class, it's most likely because you have to do so. I would not recommend otherwise.",
    "Biol 104 is an interesting class that I really enjoyed in terms of the content. I highly recommend it. However, this course was not well done. Professor Near was an interesting and engaging lecturer, but he tried to fit WAY too much content into each lecture and just ended up rambling on and on. It went too fast and just glanced over way too many topics to really delve into any of them. In lecture if you stop for even a moment to think about a slide, he is already three slides ahead. Also, it was very unclear what we needed to know for exams and paper, and the final paper was extremely not well defined and very confusing. The pace of this course was ridiculous and I have heard much better things about the Spring semester Biol 104 class. This was definitely my favorite in terms of content, but least well done module in the Biol 101-104 off-track sequence.",
    "Not really. I would take a different EEB course if you are interested in the topic of evolution or ecology.",
    "Something you have to take if you're MCDB or pre-med. Try to take it with a more experienced professor than Professor Near. The workload was lighter than the previous modules, due to a shift in the course design, but I highly preferred BIOL 101-3 to 104.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the concepts.",
    "Yes, its very interesting information.",
    "104 is good as far as content goes. The final essay is a struggle, not because it is hard, but because the goals aren't clearly outlined. The tests are ok. Different from 101-103 in that they focus more on memorization than application.",
    "Great intensive materials, very interesting, you'll like it.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. Why would you otherwise?",
    "Take it if you have to, you will definitely learn some interesting things about EEB, even if you are pre-med. Near's okay; this was his first semester, so the teaching was a little all over the place, so be prepared to take your own notes and organize effectively. Definitely not the worst of the BIOL modules, but certainly not the easiest. The discussion section readings, p sets, and five page paper make this class anything but a gut, be prepared to work hard.",
    "Take this if needed for pre-med or evolutionary bio major",
    "A lot of the material is very interesting, and I often found myself getting distracted during studying by particularly interesting details. That being said, I did not find the material interesting during lecture, simply because I knew I had to memorize it all, which was impossible to even to begin to do in the course of a lecture. Overall an interesting intro class, however somewhat stressful.",
    "My learning style (and many if not all of the students I spoke to) did not match with how Professor Near taught the class. I love the topics we were learning, but the way we were being taught them made me only frustrated with them.",
    "THIS COURSE IS MISERABLE. IF YOU ARE A SCIENCE MAJOR AND HAVE TO TAKE THIS COURS, I'M SORRY. STICK IT OUT. THIS IS NOT SCIENCE. THIS IS A COURSE DESIGNED TO SEE IF YOU'LL LET SCIENCE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SET UP TO FAIL. TEACHING SCHOLARS ARE OFTEN UNHELPFUL, UNPREPARED, AND UNKIND. THE PROFESSORS INSTITUTE INCREDIBLE BUREAUCRACY.",
    "if you're premed",
    "So the issue with this question is that if you've made it BIO 104, you're likely pre-med or need the intro bio sequence for your major. Since this is a half-semester course, there's nothing you can really do to avoid taking the class. I wouldn't recommend the class at all because of how poorly organized and unclear material is, but what can you do?",
    "Only for the requirement\/major.",
    "I would really only recommend this class to a fellow student if she has to take it for major reqs., pre-med, or distribution. Otherwise, there are better uses of a Yale credit.",
    "Only take this class if you need to.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has even the slightest interest in pursuing biology or a path that requires this course. For somebody considering taking further classes in biology, I think this class (in conjunction with the other modules) is useful in determining what is of interest to them.",
    "Many students have to take the bio sequence for major requirements or pre-med requirements. The course isn't bad and should be taken for those reasons. However, the course often felt rather disorganized, so I wouldn't have taken it if I didn't have to.",
    "I originally thought E&EB was not going to be at all something I was interested in, but this course proved me wrong - definitely one of the better STEM intro courses at Yale I've taken! I was expecting one of those bland, check-off-the-box courses that I needed for my premed and major requirement, but this course was pleasantly surprising in that it was much more than those things.",
    "Unless you can place out of it, you have to take BIOL 104 if you're premed.",
    "Even if you only have a vague interest (or disinterest) in evolutionary biology and ecology, this course is likely to transform your opinion in a positive way. I consider myself to be a very biology-oriented student, and yet I never found plants and plant evolution as interesting as I did sitting in this lecture. Be wary of the paper assignment, but overall this course gave me a considerable amount of information concerning the world's evolutionary history.",
    "Yes, because it is a requirement for pre-med.",
    "You can't really avoid taking this course since it's part of the 101-104 sequence. Professor Near is amazing and Dr. Lin is also very helpful, and I really enjoyed taking this class with them.",
    "I don't love learning about phylogenies and whatnot, but it useful to have a background on the nature of our earth and those that inhabit it (other than humankind). Worth taking if you are pre-med, environmental studies, etc.",
    "Take this class if you really are considering the E&EB major, but most likely most people who take it need it for pre-med requirements and for their other bio majors. It seems a bit out of sorts with the other classes and although Dr. Lin was very organized the lecturer was not and it was very easy to feel removed from the class However it was probably the easiest conceptually of all of the intro bio modules.",
    "Do not take this course with Professor Near. Wait a semester. Seriously. He is terrible. No quizzes, no study guides, vague and limited responses to questions, incomprehensible assignments, exams that ask you to regurgitate history facts or one of billions of examples instead of actual important concepts (which you won't get back until at least a month after you take it), 80 slide long lectures that don't explain anything at all. Just don't do it. Save yourself the misery.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that would like an alternative to common biology instruction given to most science majors. I think evolution and ecology are incredibly important. However, this course still could use more application of topics and ecological thinking, which both be a matter of my preference.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about the subject, go on the field trips, or has to complete it for their prereqs! Go to office hours and attend enrichment if you can--it'll go a long way to helping you understand the material!",
    "I mean no but like anyone who is pre-med or in STEM will probably have to take it anyway.",
    "You probably are taking 104 because you have to. If you don't have to, don't take it. Personally, the course content (phylogeny\/\"macro-\" biology) doesn't excite me nearly as much as the first three modules, and the organization of the course leaves much to be desired.",
    "Prof Near, a Darwin blowhard, blundered through some of the most interesting topics of the entire BIOL101-104 sequence, often devoting only a slide or two to major topics that are covered for weeks in other courses. The amount and scope of information covered by the class is simply absurd, and a prime example of why the intro bio sequence is desperately in need of redesign. But, if you've made it to 104, you'll enjoy it much more than previous modules.",
    "Would recommend class because it is a very different experience from the bio modules and gives you a great intro into the E&EB major.",
    "The version taught by Prof. Near was still pretty young, so hopefully changes and improvements will be made. The module was the least intuitive in terms of its departure of structure (midterm instead of regular quizzes, paper with less lead-up than 103, etc). Material was interesting but the structure burdened and muddied the learning a bit.",
    "Yes this class was very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. This was my favorite BIOL sequence and Professor Near is amazing!",
    "Take this class, especially if you have never been exposed to evolution. You will certainly change you think about biological processes.",
    "BIOL 104 was the least painful module since BIOL 101, and Near is probably a huge reason why - he's a clear, straightforward lecturer who clearly cares about ecology\/evolution. That said, it is also the last module, so if you're tired of the modules by 103 (like I was), it was still a pain\/chore to get through because it's ultimately more of the same. Honestly, you could get away with never going to a lecture but there's a surprising amount of info you'll have to remember for the final (as I unpleasantly found out during reading week).",
    "The content could be dry sometimes. I think I would have preferred the weekly quiz format over two exams.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. This class is very disorganized. The lectures had way too many slides in them and the lectures were very disjointed.",
    "Be prepared for a very fast-paced course with a lot of material never seen before in 101, 102, or 103. The subject matter is extremely interesting when studied as a cohesive, chronological unit. It is not as interesting when presented in 12 different chunks. Even though there are no weekly quizzes, it is best to spend some time keeping up with the previous lectures and section papers. Content: 8\/10 Workload: 6\/10 Much less than other biology modules, but again, devote some time to keeping up with lectures Section: 8\/10 Section papers were very interesting and relevant to course material, and the tours of Peabody Museum and Marsh Gardens are awesome.",
    "This course is very different from the others in the BIOL sequence. Even if you enjoyed those, it is not guaranteed that this one will click in the same way. If you are interested in how fauna and flora have changed over time or are interested very deeply in natural selection, take the class. Otherwise, consider taking a more specialized E&EB course.",
    "I doubt anyone is taking this class who doesn't need to. Interesting material, but it feels very surface level- I felt like everything I learned in this class could be prefaced with \"Fun Fact!\" Its fine if you need to take it but look elsewhere if you want a deeper understanding of evolutionary bio (also there was only 1 lecture on ecology)",
    "This course, regardless of the instructor, is a module that requires students to memorize a lot of information about evolution and the biodiversity of life on Earth. If you stay engaged in lectures, the information is pretty interesting. Fair warning: this course will require you to devote a significant amount of time to studying. Tip: read over lectures after each week to keep up with the material, or else you will find it hard to cram all the information in before the exams.",
    "Only if you're premed or it's required for your major - other than that don't go through the struggle",
    "Yes, I found the class interesting and enjoyed the trip to the museum.",
    "Take this course only if it is a pre-req.",
    "You're probably taking it because you have to. No quizzes means the few assignments\/midterms you have are worth much more, with no opportunity for a \"dropped quiz\/pset.\" Prof Near was engaging in lecture but didn't really narrow down what we needed to know. He went on a lot of side tangents and squished a ton of info onto each slide. Guess I liked it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who needs to complete the biology sequence. The professor is good but the course lacks structure and can be confusing to study for exams. In addition, the class is very different from other classes offered in the bio sequence in grading, which can trip up people as well. If the material is very interesting to you, Professor Near does a good job of making it engaging, but if you are just looking for a science class there may be more organized options.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they have to take it for their major. Professor Near, while a brilliant scientist, he lacks an understanding (and sympathy) for the students he's working with and will also say some very yikesy things. He's smart, but he doesn't really see beyond his own identity and position in society, so watch out for that. The slides are full of details and I would encourage you to ask what specifically you should be focusing on for the exams because the exams can catch you off guard. It's such fantastic material though. It's a shame that so much stress and confusion is integrated around fascinating subject matter. Dr. Lin is a ray of sunshine though. Talk to her if she's the course instructor because she'll give you the help you need.",
    "No it's boring and a waste of time",
    "If you're planning to go on in biology or you find the subject matter interesting, definitely take it. It's useful and well-taught. Probably not a good class to take just for the science credit, though, and if you aren't comfortable with memorization it's unpleasant. Reading and discussing the papers was the best part in my opinion.",
    "This course is memorization, not synthesis, plan accordingly. Much different twist than BIOL 103, which is more synthesis heavy. Beware the exams. Professor Near is kind and understanding, and gives a very entertaining lecture. Hopefully he will have figured out when to break his lectures, and not over estimate time next year. BIOL 103 is actually better.",
    "Only take it if you need to. The lectures were not very engaging, and the material seemed kind of all over the place.",
    "Take it if you have to. Professor Near is a passionate lecturer who tries to make the subject interesting. However, the class is disorganized. You really had no way of knowing how the information was going to be presented on the test, nor did anyone have a clue about how to write the 5-page paper. Dr. Lin is helpful but there's only so much she can do. I know other people enjoyed the class, but I personally couldn't stand it.",
    "I would recommend this course for those interested in an introduction to evolution and ecology. It provides a good basic understanding of various theories and processes. Lecture material often gets a little boring though the professor is awesome and entertaining! It all depends on how much you really want to learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in biology, especially ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "This is a solid intro biology course. The professors and TAs are very helpful, the material is easy to grasp and the curve is usually very forgiving. One warning for those interested is that this class is slightly more memorization heavy than some of the other intro bio classes.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is a major requirement.",
    "If you have to take the bio sequence, 104 is definitely the most clearly taught and I would recommend taking it in the fall.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biol 104 to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a great introduction to ecology and evolution. This class is mainly lecture, with a weekly discussion section, two problem sets due and a midterm and a final.",
    "It's better than the other bio modules, and interesting enough to take even if not required. But beware the paper assignment--it is a terrible assignment for many reasons (unclear, difficult hardly related to lecture material, no support from TAs). It was due right at the end of the semester so I may just still have it on my mind. Either way, the rest of the class is interesting all about evolutionary bio and workload is manageable",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in biology. It is important to approach biology from an evolutionary perspective, and this course will provide you with that framework.",
    "If you have the option to not take it, don't.",
    "Only recommend to those that need the class as a prereq or want to credit\/D. Don't think it would be worth a \"gut science\" or anything like that. The material is interesting, but very bulky, so it is very memorization heavy. You will need to work for your grade. Lectures can ramble and get disorganized, so you should only take this class if you need to. That being said, it is not a bad class at all, it just lacks more grounded topics. It all is very widespread: phylogenetic trees, plant history, a bit in genetics and ecology.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Out of the bio sequences, this was the most fair and in my opinion most interesting. Everything that is spoken of makes sense and there is less trying to drill you with methods.",
    "Only take this course if you have to for your major\/pre-med. The lectures seemed like info-dumps. Assessments, for the most part, required rote regurgitation. The only exception was the 5-page paper, which ended up being interesting. Overall, I left this course with some important fundamentals; however, a lot of the information was composed of somewhat arbitrary examples. It is very conceivable that a student who understood important concepts could do poorly if he\/she did not memorize most every example.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If said student was interested in biology, especially ecology and evolutionary biology, I would think that this class would be engaging and worth their time and efforts. Also, any premedical student would benefit from the knowledge gained in taking this class. The professors are wonderful and truly invested in their students' successes. The workload is manageable and the material is interesting."
