    "Great course in continental political philosophy -- awesome introduction to thinkers you will\/should return to. Highly recommend.",
    "This was a fantastic course. One of the best I've taken at Yale. And though the reading list is intimidating, the lectures are great. Don't be afraid of the pre-reqs: If you care about this stuff and feel comfortable with the idea of taking a philosophy course and you have a good TA--like Stefan Eich--you'll be set.",
    "Great course, with a great syllabus and a great professor. If you're interested in political philosophy\/theory of the German\/French tradition, this is your course.A lot of readings, but manageable work load overall, esp. given that there are only three shorter papers (5, 8-10 and 8-10).",
    "Really excellent; one of the better courses I've taken at Yale. Recommend without hesitation.",
    "If you think the syllabus looks really interesting, then I would highly recommend this course to you. There is a lot of philosophical jargon in the course, and it is certainly helpful to have at least some background in Nietzsche and Hegel. Also, many of the students in the class are either grad students or undergrads who have seen a good deal of the material before. As someone with only limited experience with a couple of the authors in the course, I can attest that getting a grasp of the material was definitely possible. Seyla is a good lecturer (the first lecture is sort of, jokingly, meant to scare off people who won't be interested in the course). She is truly one of the top in her field, and one of the few professors at Yale who specialize in the continental tradition. The readings, especially from the Frankfurt School, Habermas, and Foucault, were very interesting. It will help if you have a friend in the course to talk about the readings with. In the end, if you like philosophy, history, and\/or politics, this class will not disappoint.",
    "Thisclass is NOT about European Political Thought of the 20th Century.Seriously.DO NOT let the title fool you. This class is about Political Philosophy in Nazi Germany. If you don't believe me, check the syllabus. There are only 3 thinkers (out of like, what: 20?) who are non-german, and they're at the very end of the class where much attention cannot be provided to them.I repeat: This class is about the political philosophies of different German thinkers during early-to-middle 20th century. It is NOT European political thought of the 20th century. Only an American would say so, based on their only historical knowledge of Europe, which is: Hitler happened at some point.I cannot stress this enough, ALL the thinkers and ALL the reading have to do with Nazi Germany, Judaism and German political philosophy. A breakdown of ALL the reading material can be found below:Hannah Arendt, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" (themes: Nazism, German thinker, German philosophy, Judaism)David Cesarani, \"Becoming Eichmann\" (themes: not needed, same as above)Seyla Benhabib, \"Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem\" (themes: same as all of the above. Also, this is the professor's book...not much left to wonder as to why she's focusing so much on Nazi Germany - it's her expertise)Showing of documentary on the Eichmann trial (themes: SERIOUSLY???)Max Weber, \"Politics as a Vocation\" (German thinker, German politics, German political philosophy, very german political philosophy actually)Weber, \"Bureaucracy\" (Same as above)Weber, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Meaning of Ethical Neutrality in the Social Sciences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (same)Weber, \u00e2\u0080\u009cObjectivity in Social Science and Social Policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (same)Weber, \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (kind of the same as above, but not as German-y. Very interesting read)Benhabib, \"Rationality and Social Action\" (Again, our professor shines with her knowledge about and commentary on German political philosophy of early-to-mid 20th century)There's a trend here, I'm sure you've spotted it. The restis literally more of the same, with gratuitous amounts of Arendt. And then an a french philosopher, an American person who commented once in a book about Arendt (??!?!?!?) and an Indian thinker.THAT IS IT. SERIOUSLY. ONLY 3 NON-GERMANS??? ONE OF THEM AMERICAN, WHO WRITES ABOUT A GERMAN THINKER????? THE OTHER, INDIAN??? WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY? AND THE FRENCH ONE IS PUT THERE JUST SO THAT THE AMERICAN'S PAPER CAN BE UNDERSTOOD??WHERE IS:-Gyorgy Lukacs? (Hungarian)-Raymond Williams (Welsh)-Antonio Gramsci (Italian)-Henri Bergson (French)-David Durkheim (French)-Gilles Deleuze (French)-Henri Poincare (French)-BERTRAND RUSSEL (British)-Pierre Bourdieu (French)-...The list goes on for like.. FOREVER. THIS IS EUROPE, DURING TWO WORLD WARS, DURING HITLER, MUSSOLINI, FEMINISM, RISE OF DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM, SOVIET UNION, DECOLONIZATION, SPANISH CIVIL WAR, CREATION OF ISRAEL, THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, YUGOSLAVIA, EUROPEAN UNION, GLOBALIZATION...AGAIN, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON, FOREVER And DOES NOT STOP AT \"ARENDT, NAZI GERMANY, JA, ARENDT, AND ARENDT UND ARENDT\"THERE ARE SOOOOO MANY THINGS TO COVER. this class covers but a very small portion of European Political Thought of the 20th century.I'll repeat, one last time: This class is NOT ABOUT EUROPEAN POLITICAL THOUGHT OF THE 20TH CENTURY.The thinkers are all brilliant, do not get me wrong. But it's is entirely too focused on Germany and German political philosophy. It does not give a good idea about the major influences and the main thinkers that makes up European Political Thought of the 20th Century.",
    "I would recommend it whole heartedly for anyone interested in critical theory or modern European philosophy. If you don't have any background in philosophy or have not taken a course covering Kant, Hegel, or Marx, this course would not be the best for you.",
    "If you're into political philosophy, this is the perfect course! It was very challenging to me as a sophomore, but doable, and I loved it every second. The ideas are really complex, but this renders them interesting, and you will be learning something every second of lecture and section. It's a ton of reading, however, and it's some the most dense texts I have read at Yale so far. But even then, if you sit down with a good chunk of time and just read at the proper pace to understand everything going on in the text, it will be interesting enough to keep you going.",
    "Yep. This is an INCREDIBLE overview for anyone interested in the intellectual contributions of the 20th century. There's something here for historians, intellectual historians, philosophers, political scientists, economists, sociologists, Germany-lovers, and even the stray literary critic. Benhabib takes an integrated approach, weaving together philosophy, history, and the social sciences to put some of the key texts of 20th century intellectual history (Eichmann in Jerusalem, Being and Time, Dialectic of Enlightenment, Discipline and Punish, etc. etc.) into a coherent narrative. Be prepared to learn a ton and think pretty critically about radical ideas. The course goes pretty fast - you don't have to read every page in the 1500-page monster of a course pack + two 300-page books - but you'll be taking frantic notes on big issues such as value judgment, post-genocide trials, capitalism, meaning, death, politics, the human condition, public deliberation, constitutionalism, and Eurocentrism. If any of those things excites you, go all-in. That said, you should go into this course having *some* background in the issues it tackles, particularly philosophy or political thought - surface familiarity with Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche especially will be assumed. Sophomore ex-DSers are decently prepared, but waiting a year or two to do a bit more coursework might not hurt.",
    "Good as advertised. I really enjoyed Benhabib's lectures. Do make an effort to find out about the TAs before signing up -- I had a fantastic one, I heard more iffy things from some other students about theirs.",
    "MY FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE!!!!!! (I'm a senior) I would recommend it if you have a background\/interest in political philosophy, and you're willing to do the work, even if you take it CRED\/D. But that being said, the lectures, TA's, and other students will motivate you to do your best! The grading on the essays was also much easier than anticipated, so just make sure to meet with your TA and don't stress out! Enjoy the class, because you're not going to get this material in very many other courses at Yale!",
    "A survey of 20th century european (mostly german) political thought, from Max Weber to Derrida and Chakrabarty - mostly focusing on different critiques and views on \"modernity.\"I would recommend this course to another student. It seems like a good introduction to critical theory from one of its most well known modern practitioners.",
    "This is an intensive lecture course on twentieth century German political thought, ending with a brief look at its impact in late twentieth century France. The reading load is massive, and the expectation that students have a knowledge of the history of philosophy, especially Kant, is real, but don't let yourself be intimidated and scared away! This is a fantastic class, and Professor Benhabib is absolutely brilliant. Make sure that you are in a good section, though, as the discussion was a key part of the experience. (Stefan Eich was a great TF.)"
