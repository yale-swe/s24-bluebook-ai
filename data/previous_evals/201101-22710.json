    "Hard work with very real results.",
    "Ah! The senior essay!It was a good course, I'm glad we had the deadlines along the way otherwise it wouldn't have turned out so good. Hooray English Dept for knowing how to get their students to do good stuff!Really depends on your relationship with your faculty advisor. Mine was great.",
    "classic senior essay",
    "I would highly recommend that all English majors consider an independent senior essay! I'm thrilled to have devised and completed my own scholarly project, with the support of my advisor.",
    "Only write the senior essay if it's a topic you really want to write about and know that you'll have personal motivation for writing it. Otherwise, take a senior seminar - that's way easier.",
    "The prospectus for the course should be heeded: the project of an independent study is very difficult, and the satisfaction for all of the work is very often difficult to appreciate. The strength of this course is that ability to work closely with a member of the English department. There are no weaknesses to the course except for the ones created by the student.",
    "It's really hard and if you're after a good grade, it's difficult to say if you're going to get it. This kind of project requires the kind of training that you don't really get as an undergraduate. If you want some taste of what graduate school work might be like, do this. Also if you have the time and the energy to do a lot of background reading and research and thinking, do this. But if you're taking plenty of other exciting classes and want to enjoy life a bit--especially in your final semester of Yale undergrad--don't do it. That said, the kind of challenge and tussle with the material is really exciting and enjoyable. It's just a question of how much of a life you want to have."
