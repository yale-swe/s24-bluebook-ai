    "If you're thinking of taking French 140 you either have to, for the language requirement, or you know how these lower-level language classes work (everyday classes, everyday homework, history, culture, and readings). So I won't bore you with why I hated the course. If you for whatever reason are considering a language course, I recommend that you take French 140 with professor Bedoui. She clearly knows what she's doing in terms of French language, culture (she's lived in Tunisia and France), and teaching. I frequently left class feeling happy about how it went, despite not being interested in the material, not having done the homework, and having to run to and from class at 9:25 in the morning.",
    "YESSSS honestly and amazing class that wasn't that hard",
    "A lot of work. Take it seriously and your French will get a lot better (mostly in terms of grammar and written work).",
    "A lot of work - class time, homework, assignments, and quizzes are a lot. Learned a lot of French though and am confident about going to France. Depends on professor - Very nice and supportive. Helpful and encouraging. Sometimes rambles and doesn't get to all the work though."
