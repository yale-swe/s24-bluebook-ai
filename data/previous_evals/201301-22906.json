    "AMST 437 has the strange distinction of being a broad survey course of a narrow discipline. As such, I would not recommend it if you think you will only be interested in one or two weeks of the discussion, as it is a reading-intensive course. Michael Denning, however, is a fantastic professor and this is a must-take class if you are at all interested in ethnomusicology or music cultural studies.",
    "Recording Vernacular Musics is a fun look at a side of musical history that doesn't get discussed as much; it takes you from the American South to Egypt and Brazil, and there's a lot of space for the interests of particular students to shape the musics that you discuss. There is a lot of reading, and the class relies pretty heavily on student contribution and participation, so be sure you're willing to put in enough work to be able to hold a good conversation on the material!",
    "Yes I would. For anyone who would claim to love music or be interested in it, it is a great perspective on music not only from the view of a listener, but songwriter, producer and consumer. It is a great class that opened my eyes to many topics and arguments surrounding the field. What you take out of it is what you put in.",
    "I would only recommend this class if serious changes are made to the syllabus. We did not need to be reading a book for every class. Also do not take this class if after shopping there are only a few people there. This class needs bodies; 6 people does not make for a good seminar size in this case."
