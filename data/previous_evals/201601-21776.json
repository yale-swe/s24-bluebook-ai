   "comments": [
    "An intensive, advanced study in French focusing on reading and grammar. Highly recommend for students who are strong in French, although, even if not strong, this course will allow you to develop a proficiency for the language.",
    "FREN 140 is what you would expect as the course following 130; I would recommend the course if a student is feeling unfulfilled from their 130 experience, and want to continue their mastery of spoken and written French. The texts are mostly depressing (though fascinating!), but if you take the course with Madame Burton, she will make every assignment a joy. You leave the class with a larger arsenal of French grammar comprehension and expression in your foreign language tool belt; something I did not feel after 130.",
    "An analysis of stories combined with complex grammar exercises and oral practice.",
    "This class is a continuation of the French program with more reading and less grammar work than 130, and probably more enjoyable for that reason; everything you read is quite sad, though.",
    "You're taking 140 for 1 of 2 reasons: either you want to or you have to. If you want to, it's a great course. Madame Burton is fantastic and really caring and energetic. If you have to take this course, don't worry too much. It's a lot of work but Madame Burton makes it as stress-free as it can be. Would recommend."
