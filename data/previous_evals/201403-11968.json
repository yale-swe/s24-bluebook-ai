   "comments": [
    "A great literature class that covers poetry, plays, and short stories from the Latin American Vanguard period. The reading is interesting and manageable, and the classes always make sure you understand how the pieces fit in with the larger history of the period. You analyze works in their historical and political context as well as in regards to their literary themes.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this class to another student. The readings are interesting and the class is not extremely high stress. Professor Gonzalez is very nice and kind and cares about the students. My only caveat is that the readings would be very hard coming directly from L4 Spanish. I think it would be better to do another L5 class first.",
    "SPAN 353 is an engaging, in-depth exploration of Latin American and Spanish Vanguardist Literature. It exposes students to an exciting literary current, the avant-garde, through close readings of poetry, short stories, memoirs essays and other works. I would definitely recommend the class to another student who is interested in the culture of Spanish-speaking countries, in literature and in the intricacies and potential of language itself."
