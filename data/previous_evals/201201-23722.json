    "Overall, the course was extremely valuable in the amount of knowledge it gave on the different Asian religions. So often I find that survey courses never fully get at the material, and I lose interest quickly. However, this was not the case with this class. Although we touched on multiple religions, I gained a strong basis in each one that made all of the reading and coursework highly valuable and entertaining.",
    "Question 7:Professors Tucker and Grim were wonderful. That they were both teaching provided for a great class dynamic in that the were both able to offer their different insight of the course material. Their comments were invaluable and enabled students to truly grasp the fundamental concepts of religion and ecology.Question 9:The out-of-class exercises were very helpful and insightful in that they allowed us to physically engage in many of the practices described in the text.",
    "perhaps there should be field trips...",

    "The best thing about this course was the professors, hands down. This course could have been dry and slow, but instead was engaging and exciting.",
    "The reading was really good. The teachers were so friendly and helpful. The classroom discussion was of greatest value.",
    "I loved all of the class discussions we had because it was amazing to hear the perspectives of each student from entirely different backgrounds and cultures.The incorporation of religious practices like qi gong and meditation into the course was also incredibly valuable for a practical understanding of the significance to each tradition we studied.",
    "The class discussion was great. Everyone had insightful comments and was respectful to each other. John and Mary Evelyn are also a great team and have a structured but flexible approach to teaching.",
    "Aside from the fact that they were the instructors, Professors Grim and Tucker constituted an integral part of the course in that their input about the course material was extremely insightful. They constantly went out of their way to ensure that their students internalized the key messages of the course.",
    "Warmth and excitement of the professors.",
    "the professors",

    "I think the class might have worked better if it had been shorter and more often than once a week.",
    "If the class was not once a week for 3 hours, it may be a little more beneficial, so that people could always keep focused.",
    "The only time I struggled in this course was with my comprehension of Hinduism, which is a complex and varied tradition.",
    "Although the readings were very interesting and useful, perhaps limiting the amount of reading each week would allow more in depth discussion of the text. Often times we would have insufficient time to discuss the weekly reading questions and would have to postpone the discussion until the following week.",
    "Perhaps, bring in invited speakers to the class"

    "While not directly applicable to my studies, this course provided me with an incredible depth of information and a new way of thinking about the environment and religious practice. As a geology and geophysics major, I am very interested in environmental issues like climate and energy, and this course gave me a way of relating these topics to the social aspect of religion.",
    "This course was different from the other things that I have taken at FES, but I thought that the things I learned ended up being more useful and helpful for opening my mind to thinking about environmental management than some of the classes that were more closely about traditional environmentalism.",
    "As an environmental studies major, I felt that this course provided insight into a different approach of how to resolve contemporary environmental crises. Many would not view religion as an effective means of inspiring environmental concern, but this course has revealed otherwise illustrating that religion is one of the most important social vehicles for change.",
    "Very much!",
    "This is a course to open up into different ways of understanding our environment."

    "I took this course not only because I am interested in environmental studies, but also because I wanted to learn more about Asian religions.",
    "I took this course because I am very interested in our current environmental situation and the role of humans in the environment. I have not studied religion in any capacity before this course, and I wanted to gather an understanding for how religions can contribute to positive environmental action because of the vast power of religions to move groups of people. I also was very curious about Asian traditions which I previously knew almost nothing about.",
    "I have heard great things about John and Mary Evelyn's teaching, and I wanted to do something that was different from other classes I would normally take. It was also a good experience to be with divinity students.",
    "I took this course to both broaden my understanding of east Asian religions and what role religion has in inspiring environmental concern.",
    "Matches my interests, scholarly and academic, very much.",
    "wanted to take a course with both professors",
    "I found the topic very interesting and the professors highly motivated and qualified!"

    "Be sure to keep on the reading when it is given, or else you will have nothing to contribute to the three hour discussion every week.",
    "I would recommend that, while the amount to read each week may seem daunting, it is very important to do all of the readings in order to participate in class. Sitting for three hours without having read the paper being discussed would be brutal.",
    "It's a lot of reading, and may be difficult to be introduced to so many new concepts at the same time, but it is a class with a great vibe, and a different approach to teaching.",
    "I would advise students to do all of the assigned readings. As class discussions of the readings comprise a majority of class meetings, it would be to a student's benefit to be able to contribute to and understand the exchanges being made in class.",
    "do the readings - ask if you can write a paper at the end instead of taking the exam - it will be harder, but more rewardingunfortunately, this class is only offered every other year - make sure to take it when it comes by",
    "If you would like to have a perspective on how spirituality and word religions play a role in the environmental world, you will love this course"
