    "I learned a lot about the Spanish language and culture. My writing and grammar have definitely improved after taking this course. The course has allowed me to learn more vocabulary words and phrases in Spanish, as well as work on my conversational skills in a second language.",
    "I improved my writing and speaking skills considerably, and feel much more confident in my ability to communicate in Spanish.",
    "Outstanding course: well-organized, efficient reader\/schedule, and first-rate clarity. This is a strong model for other classes. I improved speaking\/reading\/writing abilities based on a logical sequence of tasks and effective, well-constructed assignments."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It provided a lot of opportunities for us to practice our speaking and writing.",
    "One strength of the course is the fact that it meets everyday. If I did not have the class everyday, I honestly do not think my ability to speak and write in Spanish would have improved as much as it has. The everyday class meeting essentially forces the student to put in the work and stay engaged.",
    "The course was very intensive, which was both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, the level of written and reading assignments we had allowed for a rapid development of skill. However, I sometimes felt as though the online assignments were less helpful, especially when compared to the aforementioned reading and writing homework.",
    "The strength of this class is repetition. The weakness of this class is a lack of practice with conversational vocabulary.",
    "Strengths: planned-out, reasonable sequence of topics. Nice balance of activities (i.e., speaking, group work, writing, in-class and homework tasks), instructor (we started on time, ended on time, she NEVER had a single tardy to class or an absence except for a planned, professional academic conference for which she got a sub so we did not lose any class time). Excellent short films (nice variety). Katie Brown responded to all emails and never missed office hours. Her availability and sense of professionalism is first-rate to students and the institution. !Bien padre!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take this to improve your Spanish skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student at Yale. It is an engaging, practical and fun class that gives a STEM student like myself a break from all of the science\/math based classes, but also a different perspective on learning.",
    "Yes - this is a class with usable, relevant skills that are applicable immediately to communicative contexts. The class is organized clearly and reflects an informed, L2 sense of what is possible and what matters in this portion of the larger Spanish language study we need. I think this structure and approach is a model for all of the Yale schools and classes. I recommend it without any reservation and, in all honesty, I hope to audit it again in the future just to reinforce the more challenging parts (i.e., subjunctive in adverbial clauses and the use of the future\/subjunctive in hypothetical situations)."
