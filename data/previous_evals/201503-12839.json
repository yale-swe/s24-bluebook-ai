    "This course covered some history of philosophy texts, as well as modern essays. I am lacking in history of philosophy, so I really appreciated that.",
    "More than many other philosophy courses, it has allowed me to think more carefully about my assumptions and arguments. Prof. Steve takes seriously what students say, but does not allow sloppy thinking and at the same time points out hidden assumptions that underlie certain arguments. While in my response about him the compliments are explicitly so, I need to say something that might not seem to be a compliment, but is truly one of the deepest compliments I can give (I guess second only to \"your ideas are like Aristotle's\"). He is very careful about the text that is being studied, and when you start to infuse the reading with your own ideas and assumptions (as we are prone to do unconsciously), he will call you out on it. It might feel like slamming into a wall, but that is the way to better understand and observe the assumptions you are making. Thanks to his patience and guidance, I better understand not only what Kantians believe, but also what I myself believe and sometimes hold others to believe, even when they do not. (Moving from the previous response's water based analogies and metaphors to fire based one) Reforging the mind into a better mind is a great objective, but like any forge it needs a flame, and flames burn. That is why a person whose mind is being improved might feel like he is burning.",
    "Relevant but often neglected area of moral philosophy. Definitely deepened my understanding."
