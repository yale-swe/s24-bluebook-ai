   "comments": [
    "If you don't have to take this course, don't waste your time on it",
    "If needed, impossible class",
    "It is a lot of work, but as long as you stay on top of it you should be good! If you like biology and all the details, this is the course for you.",
    "Take this class if you are an MCDB or MBB major or pre-med. It is a lot of work. But the work you do in this class can be mitigated if you 1. Go to every lecture and pay attention 2. Go to every discussion section 3. Go to every Monday night review led by the peer tutor (you have a 10 min. quiz every Tuesday) 4. Go to peer tutoring hours on Friday evening \/ Saturday evening \/ Sunday evening (no one ever takes advantage of this time but it is worth it.",
    "I would recommend taking this class early on (although some people will know a lot more than you!) because I think it will really make all other biology fit smoothly into what you already will have learned. I don't know what I want to major in but I think this class is great for everyone if you are interested in the study of life. (Note though, that this review has been slightly difficult to write after a final which I thought was not exactly a fair evaluation of all learned course material, and the fact it is worth so much of our grade makes me somehow feel that this excitement I had all semester about the course is only worth 60% as much).",
    "I would recommend Cell Biology. It's a very comprehensive class, and you will learn a TON. Expect to put in a crap-ton of time and effort into learning this material because it is a lot! The quizzes every week are exhausting because there's a lot of material that could be on each quiz, and you have to be prepared for anything. You have 12 quizzes total (which is a lot and very tiring), but you get to drop 3. Make sure you sit towards the front because Professor Pollard is a little difficult to understand, but he says such wonderful things that you want to hear what he's saying!",
    "I really enjoyed the class and highly recommend it to anyone interested in cell biology. Despite what the professors may say, there is a decent amount of memorization that goes into the course, although you won't succeed unless you understand the general picture as well. Keep up with the readings if you can, or at least be prepared to read the textbook if anything seems confusing. Also, take notes on the slides during lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class to those who enjoy detail-oriented science classes. While the instructors try not to stress memorization, the nature of the subject involves a fair amount of memorization--some people are good at that and enjoy that, while others do not.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course if you want a solid foundation in biology. This class is a lot of hard work but it will be extremely rewarding in the end when you realize all you've learned.",
    "Not easy... lots of weekly studying. Ton of information. But well worth it in the end. Must take if you're an MCDB major.",
    "Good intermediate bio class if your goal is to learn a lot about a lot of things. Weekly quizzes force you to stay up to date with the material, but be forewarned: there's a lot of it.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! Yes, there was a ton of material and it was challenging to learn so much in one semester. However, the topics were interesting and the professors were good! The workload was manageable once I got used to the weekly quizzes.",
    "MCDB 205 is a solid course that every biology major should take! It is a lot of work but a rewarding experience as you learn a tremendous amount.",
    "A intensive and well-structured romp in cell biology. Recommend for sure just know it will be hard and dry\/detail oriented at times.",
    "This class is like drinking from a fire hose. I would recommend it if you would like a broad overview of cell biology and but also are interested in molecular biology.",
    "If you need to take an biology course I would recommend this one as its comprehensive and you actually learn from it throughout the year and don't have to kill yourself the night before the final.",
    "Good MCDB class. You learn a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "Not going to beat around the bush, but this class is going to be challenging yet very rewarding. You learn an INCREDIBLE amount of material, but the weekly quizzes do not let you fall far behind. The TAs this past year were wonderful, and all of the professors are extremely accessible. If you actually want to learn a lot of information that will be applicable to any type of biological research, take this class! It will be a solid workload, but if you get in the groove and keep to a weekly study plan, it is definitely possible to do well.",
    "Cell biology is a really interesting class, and you will learn a lot! However, don't underestimate the workload. The weekly quizzes made the class very stressful.",
    "Cell Biology was obviously extremely work-heavy but it was also a very good class. By the end of the semester, it was amazing to realize how much we had learned (although it made studying for the final stressful!). Completing this class made me feel ready to fully enter into the world of science and biology, and I would definitely recommend this class to another student as long as you are both extremely interested and committed to the subject material.",
    "I would recommended cell bio to another student. The workload isn't too bad. You have to study for the quizzes for about 4 hours a week and review the PowerPoints but it isn't too bad. It's an interesting course and the professors are great.",
    "It is a good course for MCDB majors, but I wouldn't take it unless you need it for your major because it is a good deal of work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's not the faint-hearted. I had a bit of difficulty keeping up with the coursework given that I was taking 4 other heavy classes. However, I loved the material and can happily regurgitate the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway.",
    "This course is a ton of work, but I feel like I learned a lot. Make sure you keep up with the material for the quizzes.",
    "This class has been amazing. Although it is more memorization-heavy than other bio classes i've taken at Yale, the purpose of it is to really learn the language of biological processes in the cell. I've never felt more empowered by the knowledge I've learned in a class. I think it could be improved by including more experimental thinking and more application of the material on quiz questions, etc. But overall an incredible course. Don't be daunted by the other reviews of this class. If you stay on top of the material, it is 100% manageable, and the fact that it is so well organized makes all the difference. This class is so important and will teach you so so so so SO MUCH! it was a wonderful experience and I am so thankful for it.",
    "I unequivocally recommend this course to MCDB majors. Cell biology is an interesting and necessary subject. This course gives an thorough overview of cell bio. I found the course to be quite challenging, and the material is incredibly dense. However, the level of organization and helpfulness of the teaching staff make this course a very positive experience.",
    "Cell Biology is the class that made me sure I wanted to major in MCDB. There is a wealth of knowledge that you will gain from this class, and it spreads across so many facets and styles of biology that you can start to get a feel for specifically what you are interested in. It is a difficult class, there is no doubt about that, but the weekly quizzes prepare you well for the final, and force you to review each week, which is extremely helpful. If you stay on top of your studying, you can come out with a broad understanding of one of the main fields of biology, and feel confident about any other class in the major.",
    "I would recommend only if you are willing to put in the work every week to study the millions of pages of lecture notes (it's important to pull the main concepts) for the quizzes each week, and if you have a good TA (get Yumi!) and if you genuinely find this material interesting. You definitely have to take extra time to understand the concepts because it's almost impossible to understand everything in lecture.",
    "This course is definitely information heavy, but luckily the professors don't expect you to memorize every single detail. Rather, they want you to know the information enough to apply it to solve various problems in different contexts. The professors--all 3 of them--presented the material well and the weekly quizzes really forced you to keep up with the material, which was a pain at first but definitely something to be grateful for when the final came around."
