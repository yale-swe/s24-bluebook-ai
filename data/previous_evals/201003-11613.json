    "Recommended.",
    "I would recommend the course, but with reservations. I would say that a course with Professor Hartman is always worthwhile, but that the other students leave something to be desired. I found the texts assigned to be wonderful but there was no structure to the course, the syllabus was very loose and the expectations were sort of loose, which meant everyone read at their own pace, which for most meant that they did not read at all. I think if you are a self-motivated student able to take responsibility for your work and your reading, this is a perfect class. If you need guidance, perhaps this is not the course for you.",

    "I imagine it made everyone- whether they admit it or not - a better reader.",
    "I don't think this course added to my knowledge of the profession, though it did many other things, among which making me familiar with the Romantic period. I think this was a good survey class for the non-specialist, but in terms of professionalizing students for work in the field, it left something to be desired. At the same time, I don't think it is the job of an emeritus professor to help 'professionalize' students. That is the job of younger faculty members who know what the job-market is like; it is the job of advisers, of the director of graduate studies, etc. Professor Hartman did everything he was supposed to do - namely to teach students about his field of speciality."
