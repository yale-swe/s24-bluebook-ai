    "Greater understanding of basic paleontological practices; broad-strokes understanding of marine invertebrate taxonomy and evolutionary history; greater understanding of geology research practices.",

   "comments": [
    "Some groups were completely left out (e.g. insects) and I wish we could've looked at ecology and how these different groups may have interacted with other organisms or with their environments, or in general if we could've looked at these by time period versus by group. But I'm really glad this course does exist, especially because the only assignment is a research project (+ presentation), which both takes stress away from studying and allows the student to explore their interests scientifically.",
    "Prof. Briggs was very knowledgable and helpful, very willing to support us when needed. However, the lectures could get very dry and disengaging, which made it hard to focus.",
    "The teaching is strong and the lectures are always very interesting and engaging. The ability to interact with specimens every class was special. The project was a good opportunity but a real commitment, and some people would maybe want to audit the course without having to go through an entire project, although I found it rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "Anyone who's interested in paleontology, biology, invertebrates, or the history of life should take this course! And it gives you good hands-on experience with a research project (whether it's a lit review or an actual experiment).",
    "If you're super interested in marine invertebrates and\/or paleontology, take it to get a greater understanding of form\/function relationships and paleontological practices. But, if you're just looking for a science credit or an elective but don't have a strong interest in the above fields, maybe don't, since it can get kind of dry. Prof. Briggs is super knowledgable and supportive, but it can still dry. There's also only one assignment the whole semesteran independent lab research projectso if you don't have strong experience with this kind of work, it can be overwhelming."
