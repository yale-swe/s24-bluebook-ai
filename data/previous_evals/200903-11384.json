    "It's a great class if you don't have much experience about filmmaking. It trains my filmic vision and techniques.But the class is how much you want to get out it. You can make it demanding or easy yourself.",
    "YES. You should take a filmmaking course with Roemer. He takes a different, but very important, approach to filmmaking.",
    "For anyone who wants to practice conceptualizing and writing a film, but is not overly concerned with learning technical skills. Also, it helps to have a thick skin and avoid being defensive about one's work.",
    "If you want to work on one idea and hone it the entire semester, I would recommend this class. It is a very interesting workshop for sure.",
    "Recommend completely! Very few production courses at Yale, and you will learn a lot from this."
