   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It is amazingly fun. You spend every week learning about a different set of bird families of the world. There is a weekly quiz, but it's not too hard and graded on a curve. Plus, you get to go to Ecuador during Spring Break! Why would you NOT take this class?",
    "Definitely take it. Ecuador is fantastic if you get to go (You will be waking up at 4 in the morning though. Don't be surprised). You will actually start being able to recognize birds in the real world.",
    "This class is phenomenal. There is really nothing else like it at Yale. It is very challenging, as every week you must memorize between 10-30 bird families in Latin, their natural history, and what they look like (bring a camera!). There are 3 Saturday birding trips, and of course the trip to Ecuador (all I can say is this is really a once in a lifetime kind of experience). The TAs and Rick are some of the most interesting people I have met at Yale, and are willing to give it their all to help you know what it feels like to be a real ornithologist. TAKE IT!",
    "Take this lab if you want to work your butt off and change your whole perception of what science can be. Be prepared! Give it your all. The payoff is great for nature enthusiasts and biologists. Take it with the lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend taking the Ornithology lab; you learn so much about birds, and I can't imagine taking the lecture without it. It is a lot of work: the quizzes every week keep you on your toes. But less work than other science labs. You learn all of the bird families of the world, and better go birding several times during the semester, in addition to the spring break trip.Going to Ecuador was one of the most amazing things I have done since coming to Yale: totally paid for, and we traveled all around the country (highlands, cloud forest and rain forest) and saw 500 species of birds. We were birding all day every day, and got to get to know the amazing people who work at the Peabody. Do it.",
    "Ornithology Lab was one of my most memorable classes at Yale, and not just because of the Spring Break trip to Ecuador, where we saw around 500 different species of birds. Being able to see and touch different families of birds in the lab allowed me to learn about birds in a lasting way. Field trips outside of class helped me integrate the knowledge of the bird skins that we acquired in lab with the actual real-life behavior and habitat of individual birds. Our class also became close over the course of Spring Break and various field trips in New England.",
    "If you like birds and want to learn about every bird in the world this absolutely the right course for you. The trip is really intense, but worth it. Only take this course if you are into birds though. It is a lot of work and a lot of bird-watching.",
    "There is no lab course in all of Yale College that an undergraduate should pursue if he\/she is interested in birds. There are some incredible perks to this lab: a strong foundation in bird ecology and taxonomy, a thorough introduction to birdwatching and conservation efforts through field trips to the American Northeast and Ecuador, and a group of students and instructors really interested in the field. As cool as this class is, be forewarned: there are cumulative quizzes every week and some comparably organized quizzes and exams that WILL teach you all the avian families, albeit through a lot of studying and rote memorization. Take this course if you can--and you should by all means take it if you are in the lecture--but be prepared for the work."
