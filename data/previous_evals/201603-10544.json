   "comments": [
    "I learned a tremendous amount of historical and political thought throughout this course. The historical works taught me a bunch of important historical moments and the ways in which different authors engage and interpret these events. One particular highlight of the class was figuring out how to discuss the different authors' tones and intents with their historical works. The political philosopher works were also fascinating in learning the different ways in which authors, each with their own unique backgrounds and biases, describe the best and worst types of human civilizations. MY abilities to compare the intents, purposes, and consequences of different authors and apply authorial thought to a variety of different works was greatly improved through the course of this class. My skills as an essay writer were also greatly improved.",
    "I learned how to read texts and see historical trends\/patterns in them. I also learned how to see history not as black and white, but as a colorful narrative, almost like literature. This course really taught me how to discuss texts with my classmates and how these discussions can be incredibly rich and interesting!",
    "The lectures for this course was always on Friday this year and was always on the book that we would be assigned for next week. This was the only class that this was like, as Lit and Philosophy have their lecture on the same material on that same week. I actually like it this way as it made for a great preview of what to expect in the coming week. I think this class challenged me the most of my three DS classes and it made me think of many ways to bridge history with political thought. Keep in mind this is NOT a history class and is instead meant to teach you how HISTORICAL thought changed over time. So if you're bad at history like I am, don't feel afraid! This is a very doable course.",
    "How to argue a thesis in a 5 page essay. Learn lots of stuff on the early threads of historiographical and political thought (as well as some cool history on the Greeks and Romans).",
    "How to analyze historical texts for their rhetoric and true meaning",
    "I learned how to write more controversial and persuasive essays that deeply analyzed the texts I was reading. I gained insights by listening and engaging with other students' perspectives during seminars.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of western historical and political thought. I feel like my writing quality improved quite a bit, in particular the kind of analysis necessary for an HP paper.",
    "Finding and then comparing the voices of various authors as a tool of critical analysis -- how to anticipate what Augustine would say to Herodotus as a way of anticipating the issues that a future author will deal with, for example.",
    "I improved my writing a lot.",
    "We develop the ability to critically analyze seminal texts and to tease out the complexities and what those complexities may suggest.",
    "From this course, I developed an understanding of the progression of Western political thought in its many forms. I also refined my writing skills, particularly in the realm of argumentative essays.",
    "I learned deep analysis of great historical and political works. I learned to analyze history with different predispositions, and learned the complexities and implications of political writings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the great works we have the opportunity to read, which lend themselves to be compared and analyzed for hours on end. Professor Thompson made the class far better than it was on its own by constantly encouraging us to engage with the text beyond simply summarizing the works. The seminar style of the course greatly aided in analysis of the text through cooperative and informative discussion amongst peers. The weakness of this course was that too much reading was assigned for certain authors that were discussed for a very small amount of time, such as Al-Farabi, Maimonides, and Augustine, which caused a very unnecessary amount of rushing to complete the reading in time for the seminars.",
    "This is a very challenging course with lots of reading. The reading can feel a little daunting at times, but the richness of discussions in class makes it worth it. If you keep up with the reading, the course is wonderful and enriching, and class discussions are great!",
    "Strengths were that we always had thought provoking classes and I like the starters that Norma Thompson does with a student leading the class for the first 20 minutes. It was a good break from just having Prof Thompson lead all of class and it made for a friendlier atmosphere as well! No weaknesses here (at least if you have Prof Thompson as your professor).",
    "Strength: Get to cover a huge range of books. Mary Beard was fantastic as a colloquium speaker. Weakness: In covering a huge range of books you won't go deeper into any of them than in a class that's more focused and specialised. That's an inherent trade off you make when taking DS. Improvements: Would be nice to do Cicero",
    "Weakness= (this first one is just a me thing) Not a big fan of the texts personally. secondly, understanding exactly what she wants in her essays can be really difficult-- it's something very specific and hard to parse out Strengths= Engaging, interesting teacher. Probably the best DS H+P prof for this semester",
    "My thinking critically across texts has improved greatly.",
    "This course, though it somewhat improves one's writing, is not the best class for one whose intent is to strongly improve her writing. The feedback one receives is not very applicable to most of the writing one will do in one's Yale career and onwards. I do not appreciate the mentality of this class and all Directed Studies classes that on the first essay, the professors should grade exceptionally hard, regardless if one's essay was deserving of an A. A professor should grade consistently throughout the semester and should hold all students to the same standard. If one truly deserves a certain grade, she should earn it despite the fact that it is a first paper. This course is narrowly focused on Western texts mainly from Greece and Rome, so one should expect that when signing up for this course. I did appreciate that this class allowed one to read and discuss the works of some of the most famous, ancient historical thinkers all in one semester, which is unique to this class. This course does guarantee seminars, which is great for student engagement, but this also highly depends on the professor leading the seminar. When my classmates and I were able to engage in deep discussion of the texts, I learned the most. I loved listening to the different perspectives my classmates had to offer. But, each professor's seminar style was unique. For example, when I was attending a class of another professor, he was intent on summarizing the text rather than deeply analyzing it, but was also known for giving excellent feedback on essays. Some professors are focused on examining the minute details of the text that may not be significant for better political thinking. Some professors use seminar to lecture at the students on some days. Overall, the Directed Studies program requires some great improvement if it can expect to sustain itself in the following years. The program should be more receptive of students' input. The writing style is highly subjective and some professors lack in giving applicable feedback. When we were recommended to see writing tutors, the DS tutors would be booked in less than an hour, and most students would go to tutors that didn't have expertise in DS. There is a limited amount of resources for those who really wish to improve their writing in DS. Also, it is highly disorganized, especially at the beginning of the semester when we were placed in sections, and had less than 24 hours to switch sections if there was a scheduling conflict. I appreciate the endeavor of the program to cover most major Western authors in the semester, but some authors deserved a bit more time than others, and in some cases we would read a play that we would spend an hour of section discussing.",
    "The works hold together into a historical narrative relatively well, although the course might have benefitted from more broad historical context to help place each text in a grander scheme of things.",
    "Strengths: strong reading course load, interesting narrative to follow between works. Really cool starters for class! Only weakness might be a lack of class participation for certain books people are bound to find superficially boring?",
    "We go through the material rather quickly, but I feel like the papers allowed me to get a more in depth understanding of several of the works. I do however wish that the final had been one large paper instead of passage IDs.",
    "One possible weakness of this course is the apparent diversity of its material. Occasionally, and particularly early in the semester, I had difficulty understanding how the authors and texts in this course formed an integrated whole. By the end of the semester, however, this diversity had become a strength of the course, illuminating common threads among texts of different formats, styles, and contexts. Though several lectures and many seminars throughout the semester suggested ways to think about the course as cohesive, emphasizing this \"strength through diversity\" aspect of the course early could help students start this track of DS with more confidence. A final comment: occasionally, this course presented noticeably more reading than the other two DS classes. Trimming some of the selections, particularly in Herodotus and Augustine (though of course we can only read a small part of these works as it is), could help focus students on specific parts of each text.",
    "The reading, as expected, was great. The politically-oriented texts were all excellent, but perhaps the course would benefit from a mild reduction of the amount of historical reading."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student at Yale. In my opinion, this course is the hardest to get a grip on what we are actually supposed to be doing, as the transition from the first historians (Herodotus\/Thucydides) to the first political philosophers (Plato\/Aristotle) can be very jarring and cause some confusion in what the purpose of the class truly is. However, as you go along in the semester, the class becomes very enjoyable and synthesizing the historians and political philosophers becomes extremely enjoyable and intellectually challenging. The major difference in how much you will enjoy this class depends on the professor you have. By far, Professor Thompson is the best of the DS HP professors in her level of engagement and explanation. She demands a higher level of intellectual engagement with the texts than does other professors, but the reward was well worth it. Form first-hand experience visiting other professors sections when our professor was unable to hold section, the other professors are not at all as interesting or helpful as Professor Thompson. All the DS professors are great, but Thompson is by far the best professor to have for the first semester HP. The gap in quality of section compared to other professors was very noticeable. Also, she is very clear about her expectations for essays, and her grading was extremely fair.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's so amazing at the end to see how all the works you've read connect.",
    "PLEASE TRY TO TAKE THIS WITH NORMA THOMPSON. She is amazing and gives great feedback on essays. She challenges you to think and make connections with the first texts you read (Herodotus, Thucydides, etc) so always be thinking of how the text you read can connect to the rest of the other books you have read. DS is great and even if you are a STEM major, it is very meaningful and worth it!",
    "Yes. The breadth of DS really exposes the thread of historical and political thought that has helped shape the modern world. Also really helps you with writing, rarely ever do you get such good professors actually look through your work and give it feedback.",
    "The texts are really hard to get through at times. I knew I'd like the spring semester texts better (Locke, hobbes, etc.) so I stuck it through, but the fall semester H+P texts can be rather dry. Machiavelli, Arisototle, and Thucydides were highlights. Thompson is probably the best H+P professor we had this semester, but still I wasn't a huge fan of the class mostly because of the texts (which, again, is a personal thing). She analyzes the texts on a much deeper level than most of the professors-- making you think about what the author truly means and subverting the surface level thoughts being presented",
    "YES! I absolutely loved this course and Thompson was fantastic!",
    "I would not recommend this course to student unless she was strongly interested in pursuing a humanities based major. The writing and reading skills gained in this course could be gained in other English courses. I would recommend this to a student who wishes to read some of the major classic texts in a short and limited amount of time. There are few courses at Yale that allow students to cover Herodotus to Machiavelli in one semester.",
    "This course was definitely interesting and challenging.",
    "Amazing introduction to the critical analysis of non-fiction texts.",
    "Yes, as I would with the entire DS program.",
    "Absolutely - I found H&P to be the most interesting of all DS classes due to the foundational nature of many of the texts we read.",
    "The syllabus for this course is diverse -- historians, philosophers, theologians, and politicians meander through the first half of Western thought. Forge ahead! The common threads linking these authors will emerge, making this course, for me, the most unexpectedly rewarding of the three.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any DS student. The attention to individuals, and the discussions that developed, were excellent and highly productive."
