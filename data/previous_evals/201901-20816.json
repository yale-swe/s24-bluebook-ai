   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of writing a TV spec script and series bible, all the way from deciding on a premise to actually writing the screenplay. I went in with a few ideas that I thought might be fun to write, and I'm finishing the class with the confidence to actually try and pitch a show to a studio at some point.",
    "I had taken a handful of creative writing courses before this one, but I'd never had a class that actually explained what makes writing good. It was like a lightbulb clicked on. In the other creative writing class I've taken, we discussed other's writing and how to improve our own, but there was a mystified element of \"creativity\" that was always just sort of presumed, but in this class, we learned how to generate a \"creative\" idea through a deliberate and quantifiable process. It's honestly like learning magic. It was incredible.",
    "I learned a really effective, systematic approach to writing drama for television. I learned how to start with a list of tv concepts and develop one into a pilot and workable series.",
    "I learned a lot! Learned mostly how to read and evaluate television scripts. Also learned the hard elements of plot, character, and story that make a good script. Learned about the TV script development process. Learned a little bit about the Hollywood business.",
    "This course was incredible! I arrived in the course having no idea how to even go about crafting a TV show, and left with a finished product. I think the biggest part about this course is the way you work up to each new part of crafting your TV show. It's so cool to get to work with one idea from start to finish and see it evolve.",
    "N\/A",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It strengthened me immeasurably as a writer and opened my eyes to different writing styles, genres, and career possibilities.",
    "Learned how to write a script, how to build a story world, how to create drama worthy characters!",
    "Fantastic intro to the art of writing television; bottom-up approach to development, building the characters and story world and outlining in depth before ever writing \"Fade in\"; practice in thinking of new ideas, abandoning old ones, combining; asking \"What if...\" to try and make your story better (in whatever way)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All strengths, it's truly a fantastic class! The only weakness is one that couldn't really be helped: sometimes students would send out their material to be workshopped REALLY late (in some cases a couple of hours before class), and it was impossible to really read all of the material in depth and leave good comments for class discussion. Maybe set more strict deadlines for distributing what will be workshopped?",
    "The main strength of this course is that you learn how to be a good writer. It seems obvious, but honestly, Professor Green and my classmates made me more considerate of the choices I make, and I learned how to write creatively. If the course has any weaknesses, they're that Professor Green wants to put way more into 13 weeks than he feasibly can, and we had to rush through a decent chunk of the course.",
    "Strengths: Professor Green is fantastic, every class flies by with fascinating discussions, workshops, and lessons, assignments build on each other and I never felt like I was wasting my time. Weaknesses: none!",
    "Strengths: we really get into the nitty gritty of what makes a good script--character, plot, story elements. It was a very structured approach to script writing, which I appreciated. Weaknesses: I didn't really like the partner work so much. Overall that's a pretty small point though.",
    "Loved the very formulaic process Prof. Green teaches.",
    "N\/A",
    "Weaknesses: I wish we workshopped a little more (2x rather than once) to promote more student engagement. Strengths: literally everything else I loved this class",
    "Strengths- the workshops were always fun and productive and prof Greens explanations and meetings were always super helpful! I wish we did more of both throighout the semester. I also wish we started writing our scripts a few weeks earlier.",
    "After we settled on our show ideas, I think more intermediate assignments would have kept me better on track to finishing a full script by the end of the semester; that said, I thought this course was excellent. Any strength you could think of, it had."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! You will learn so much, and you will probably start considering TV writing as a possible career. It's always good to leave your options open! Even if you just want to take this as a \"fun\" class, do it. You'll get so much out of it!",
    "Take this class!! It's super fun and exciting and you will literally learn how to be a better writer. I've never taken another class at Yale where you learn how to write better, and I didn't realize it until I took this course. Like, it would be cool on its own if you could take a class where you leave having written a fully-fledged TV show pilot episode, but this course goes way above and beyond that and makes you feel like you could go and write a movie or a novel or a short story or whatever you wanted with ease and professionalism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student.",
    "YESSS! This is the best class Ive taken at Yale and I literally wish I could take it again. Its hard to get into the class, but the group of students chosen ends up being really talentedmy classmates always inspired me.",
    "Yes! If you can get in, take it. Derek is great in that he really makes himself available to meet with students. He also knows a lot about the Hollywood industry. He gives you a lot of great scripts to read and add to your repertoire\/knowledge. And he really teaches you how to write a script. I'd say this isn't something you can easily learn on your own, so if you can get in take it. It's interesting to hear what your peers are working on. You will pick an idea midway through the semester and spend the second half of the semester developing it. It's awesome to watch your idea grow!",
    "Absolutely. You will not regret taking this course. It will be one of my favorites during my whole time at Yale!",
    "N\/a",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Be ready to write a lot, and read every pilot.",
    "Yes! If you love writing and want to learn how to write for tv, or just build characters and tour own voice as a writer take this course!!!!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course. Prof. Green is fantastic -- funny, charming, helpful, patient, kind, flexible, understanding. One of the best professors I've had here. And take it for the content, too; made me start appreciating TV much more as a genre. Plus, now that you are writing your own show, you can watch a bunch of Netflix and have it be a useful exercise for CLASS, WHAT?!!!? You'll read a lot of pilot scripts, will find a bunch of new shows to check out. You'll think up your own ideas, settle on one, and develop it -- then write it. I bet most of the class will continue working on their show ideas and scripts long after this class has ended. Really cool to have a project that you start and come close to completing in a semester."
