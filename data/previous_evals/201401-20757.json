    "It's a larger amount of work than other classes, but it also ended up being the least stressful one for me. This is because of the everyday distribution of assignments (maybe an hour or two per night). Also, since there are little quizzes all the time, when the tests actually come, it's nice because you're much more confident about the material by then. Finally, since there isn't really a 'cumulative' test, it made my finals period a lot less worrisome.",
    "Its a decent class. A fair amount of work but manageable.",
    "This class is basically the same as L3, so if you enjoyed L3, take this class too. Constant stream of medium quantity of medium difficulty homework.",
    "It is a very good class to continue your Chinese study. It is a very interactive class and thus a fun class. The materials are pretty repetitive and sometimes you might find yourself bored, but it's important to submit your homework in time. Pay attention to all the deadlines.",
    "I would definitely recommend chinese 140, the teachers are supportive and the learning curve is very steep. It was one of my most challenging courses, but if your up for the challenge it is an excellent class.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "It's a difficult class but you'll learn a lot of chinese.",
    "Chinese 140 is a comprehensive Chinese language class that helps students hone their language skills primarily through oral exercises and written assignments.I would recommend Chinese 140 because of the program's emphasis on strengthening students' speaking skills, a crucial aspect in improving a student's overall comfort level with the language.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot of new vocabulary and patterns through CHNS 140, however I think the class is very tied to the text book, and could use more emphasis on conversation, without such focus on particular grammar structures.",
    "Solid continuation from CHNS 130. The skits are particularly fun.",
    "I highly recommend this class, although the work load can be very heavy at times."
