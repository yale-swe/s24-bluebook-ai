He seemed very knowledgeable but not a great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Amir Chireh Mehr \u00a0Amir played a bigger role in the professional modules than the professor. He has a tendency to go very fast because he assumes everyone knows as much as he does, but he knows much more than everyone else. He should slow things down and do more frequent assessments to determine the level of experience of the people in the room rather than saying things like \"do people already understand this\" and then moving on when one person says yes.",

Not sure who created it, but I feel that I spent too much time on meeting the requirements on format and the results were still not satisfying. I understand reading the answers could be difficult, but I believe you could find a way to make it both easier for students and TAs.",

However it would have been better if Amir slowed down a little bit in his explanations in class and TA sessions so that we could fully follow him.

   "comments": [
    "The course was very valuable to me because it covered a huge range of energy topics. I've worked in the field for two years and was still surprised by what I didn't know. Despite this, I don't think the course was laid out well. It seemed like an overwhelming scatter shot of information. We would cover so much diverse information at such a rapid pace it left many students wondering how\/what we could be tested on. There wasn't much clarity on how to learn this material (ie should we focus on key concepts or memorizing energy stats and definitions?)",
    "This course needs to be scrapped, a completely new teaching team needs to be recruited, and it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. I had heard mixed reviews from past years with Grubler, because some people were frustrated by his teaching style of just telling stories and not really covering the material. But with a different teacher this year who actually used his material -- it was a painful experience. Often the lectures presented graphs and charts that were indecipherable (literally), and the content was not geared toward a practical problem-solving approach at all. Our global energy systems have to change, and this class gave me minimal practice in the analysis and problem-solving that would go into changing those systems. The most interesting lecture was when a utility executive spoke and actually explained a real energy system and all the tradeoffs and decisions that have to be made (also when Amir the TA did a short presentation, that was good too). It feels to me like Yale knows it needs a class that teaches you energy conversions, gives an overview of different systems, and they've had Grubler teaching it for years so why change. But honestly, our energy problems are too big for Yale to stick with this default teaching approach which clearly has no pedagogical instincts or training. Every single lecture needs to be scrubbed and redone with the question in mind of, \"how will students use this in real jobs or in making decisions.\" Furthermore, a lecture style of simply putting up slides and reading them off is not a way for students to learn. Imagine a course where a concept is presented for 10 minutes, then students get into pairs and do a small assignment around the concept for 10 minutes, and then repeated on the next concept. Or, imagine that each week features some kind of \"energy problem\" facing a stakeholder (utility, policymaker, investor) and then going through the analysis and decision-making involved. THAT would be useful & cover the material. Instead - we get hours of bulk info dump from slides and then work on concepts we haven't even discussed in class on our problem sets. The problem sets however, did have some value. They made us engage with data sources, which is valuable to understand. And we went through types of analyses (LCOE, cash flow for renewables) that are useful to do so that you comprehend the fundamentals that go into them. However - the tests were useless. They ask about small minutiae that you can only know by looking it up on the notes. In our modern age, we will be able to reference that kind of information when we need it and won't have it memorized. There are clearly some key statistics that are important to have memorized (i.e. how much coal is in the world's energy mix), but that is probably 3 pages of raw facts that we could study, which could be one section of the test. Then a later section could be some problem solving, or analysis of some kind of actual energy situation that makes us think. Instead, the test is crammed with too many questions in too little time on facts that you can't and won't remember. The tests don't support the real knowledge you need to know nor the real analysis you need to be able to do. Overall, Prof Pachauri clearly just used Grubler's slides and tests and just read it all off in class, and didn't bring a better pedagogical approach to the material. Lectures often only took up 2 out of the 3 hours allotted even, and she even spoke kind of slowly. My recommendation: recruit a new two-person teaching team, where one person works at a utility, and another is an energy policy analyst, give them both a few hours of teaching training, and have them redesign the class completely to cover the important theory and then the real decisions you have to make. I know that sometimes students complain when something is difficult, but that is not the case (I got an above-average score on the midterm). This is a serious pedagogical complaint.",
    "It would have been nice to have a field trip to actually see a power plant, other energy generator, or any other hands-on experience related to the course material.",
    "15.) This course should be subdivided for people with an energy background (for them, this course was too easy) and for first-time energy people (for them, this course was too difficult).",
    "Shonali is very knowledgeable about energy and in particular energy access. However, as this was her first time teaching, she was not a very charismatic teacher. However, she was always available and made herself accessible to the students. I also appreciated her humor.",
    "I was extremely disappointed in this course. It was the worst one I have taken at FES. I would not blame Shonali for this. Rather I think the fault is of the course design. Those with a background in energy find it too slow and those with no background in energy are overwhelmed by the material. I believe anyone with a background in energy should not be encouraged to take this class because it is too basic and stresses conversions over key concepts.",
    "Shonali did a poor job teaching this course. Regardless of if the other professor gave her the material, she should have known the material and done better answering questions. What we covered in class did not match what we were expected to know for homework and exams.",
    "I was highly disappointed with this class. The course topic has so much potential and could be taught in a way that is exciting, relevant, informative, and beneficial, but unfortunately, it was not. The lectures were dry and uninteresting with zero interaction and it was challenging to track the material. One-on-one, Dr. Pachauri was very helpful and effective in communicating the material, but her lectures were unfortunately not. I want to say that the course is still valuable for students since there are certain tools that can be gained through the problem sets, but these tools would have been so much more effective if the lectures were improved so that the problem sets, lectures and exams were more in synch.",
    "The course is one I was greatly looking forward to when I enrolled at Yale. I think that it is a valuable course for those interested in energy policy or markets who has no prior background in the energy field. However, for those with a background in energy policy such as myself, the course provided significant redundancies that could be improved upon. Rather than dwelling on the foundations of the US and global energy systems, a course that built on the basics and dug more deeply into the issues currently facing world energy systems would be more useful for the many students enrolled in the class that already had a prior professional background in energy issues. Additionally, much of the course material had not been updated in approximately 10 years, and I would recommend that the course receive an overhaul that accounts for much of the changes that the world has seen in the past 5 years, including falling prices of solar, wind, and storage systems, and the recent impacts of low cost-oil and natural gas on energy infrastructure investment decisions, as well as such impacts on combatting climate change.",
    "I appreciated all the concepts taught in this course, but a) the instructor was not an engaging lecturer and b) the course was not structured in a way that optimized our learning. For instance, the lecture slides were sometimes difficult to read, and it was hard to tell what we should be taking away from each lecture. The 3 large problem sets were certainly valuable, but I would have preferred smaller, more frequent problem sets with more TA office hours so we can ask questions one mini problem set at a time to better understand the nuances. There are 3 TAs after all, and we take a similar approach to the Economics foundations course, where I felt that I was able to absorb much of the content from week to week.",
    "16-24",
    "The course instructor has done great work in the energy and development field. That being said, many of the lectures were not very engaging and Dr. Pachauri could have done a better job of communicating concepts during the course.",
    "There was not enough analytical thinking or discussion involved in the course. It was only observing facts, learning numbers and not enough material that I would expect from a graduate level course. The exams did not pose questions around analytical thinking and were only about looking up hard facts from the reading, I did not end up learning a whole lot from the exam study."

    "Definitely the midterm. It did not test my understanding of the course, it didn't even test wrote memorization of energy facts. Instead, it tested if I knew the energy primer well enough to flip to a specific page based on what the questions asks in order to find the question. In order to do well in this course, you don't have to know the information, but only where you think you can find it in quick enough time to look it up during the test. This made studying feel a bit like a waste of time.",
    "Lectures and tests - both were practically useless.",
    "This course is designed very poorly and taught very poorly. There is a plethora of useful, interesting material on energy, and the class touched on much of that material. But the way that material is presented is in dire need of improvement. It is clear that this class attempted to duplicate the same class that Arnolf Grubler has been teaching 10-odd years. That class needs to be revamped. The model of reading a dry 120-page document and trying to internalize it for exams is archaic and a very tenuous pedagogical strategy that I can't imagine would prove valuable if measured empirically. The class should involve more discussion and student engagement. There are a lot of students in the class with relevant experience and valuable perspectives but the class is 3 long hours a week of dry lecture from PowerPoint slides with no room for useful discussion just given its format. All professors, even visiting professors, should be required to go through some kind of teaching training. This class was unengaging, painfully dry, and poorly taught. All teachers should need to know strategies for how to teach effectively, not just how to give a 3-hour PowerPoint presentation where they try to draw things out to fill up the full 3 hours.",
    "Assignments could be made clearer and easier for students to follow the required format. Exams involve things that I don't believe is neccessary to remeber.",
    "This class will not teach you about the energy industry. The assessment methods do not reflect understanding of energy systems. Rather, the assignments test your ability to format excel spreadsheets in an arbitrary way e.g. points deducted for hard coding numbers. The exams are an exercise in technique rather than ability. For example, with ~2 hours of highlighting key material I was able to index the energy primer correctly and achieve the mean mid-term grade. My understanding of the energy system was not tested, just my ability to write-facts from the energy primer.",
    "Where do you begin? The exams probably are the worst aspect. But then again they're given in the same format every year so don't expect that to change.",
    "The Primer has old statistics, not sure what the point is of getting quizzed on global energy statistics from 2005. The course materials need to be updated.",

    "This course was designed by Arnulf Grubler, who is on leave this semester. It is my understanding that Professor Pachuari had strict instructions from Arnulf on what and how to teach the course. Granted, Arnulf and Shonali put a lot of time and effort into the course, but there is a lot of change that can be made to the course. First, there is very little in the course that cannot be looked up online. Though the goal of the course is to get student to be comfortable converting units and assessing the amount of energy a system might need and what that might look like and its environmental impacts, the way that the course is organized makes it very difficult for the students to do so. The content is too difficult for people who have no background in energy, and too light for those that do. The course is very reliant on the energy primer - which the version provided initially to students was a draft version. 7 of the 13 classes mostly reiterated information from the energy primer, with very little additional information. This could be condensed in order to talk about energy systems more technically (like how does solar work, or what are the different types of generation, how do you account for power losses along transmission lines, what are ways to plan for energy systems in places that are newly electrifying), which would have been much more beneficial than repeating the required reading in class. I think that the class would have benefitted from additional discussion opportunities, especially as there was a significant amount of knowledge and experience in the energy sector in the room. This would have given concrete application to the ideas and theories in the lectures. The class materials had been created for the original class (in 2010 or so) and many of them had not been updated since. Some of the resources and information was a bit dated, which is a draw back as the energy field is constantly changing. Though the problem sets were very helpful in learning how to find energy data, practicing conversions, and understanding concepts, they have very little to do with the content of the course. If, during some of the excess time we had in class (lectures usually went from 2:30-4 or 4:30, instead of 2:30-5:30), to discuss the problem set, that would be a great opportunity to really talk about the concepts and the findings. For the most parts, problem sets were not difficult, they were mostly busy work. The excel spreadsheets could be reorganized to be made better for both the grader and the student. The exams were not really a test of knowledge, as much as they are a test of how you can locate the answer. I think that if the course was organized a bit differently, knowledge could be tested either through a group project\/paper. However, since there is so much information in the course, it would be difficult to have a non-open book test, unless only certain concepts were covered, or if the test did not consist of definitions only, but also of ideas and strategies to solve problems. Though this year's course was taught by a substitute professor, my understanding is that these issues have persisted in the class for the past few years. I would be willing to work with past and current students and Professor Grubler to create a course that did meet the needs of the energy students at FES.",
    "The Energy Primer is a very useful reading. It would be good not to repeat what is in the Energy Primer but expand on it so that we do not feel it is a waste of class time. There are a lot of students who have experience in Energy in the class and the instructor should tap into these students for a more engaging and educational class rather than pure lecturing. And the exams badly need improvement! Instead of short answer questions there should be longer qualitative or quantitative questions that tested our analytical skills, not how quickly we can look up obscure information or do simple conversions.",
    "Where to to start? The syllabus. This course needs to be redesigned. I honestly believe that FES is at a competitive disadvantage if it does not provide more robust energy course selections. But more importantly the students are hurt because they do not have the opportunity to learn the valuable knowledge and skills on this important topic. 1. The key aims of this course need to be revised. A listed key course objective is to teach students where to go for energy data. That should not be a key objective of a graduate class. Yale should demand more of its students. 2. Too large an emphasis is placed on simple unit conversions. Few jobs require individuals to simply convert energy units. Though this course could still teach the conversions without making it a key goal of the course. Let's be honest. In the current workforce, there are programs that will help with conversions. It's more important that the students understand the key concepts. 3. The testing is impractical and not a strong way to understand the depth of a students knowledge. The midterm and final are designed to force students to regurgitate information as fast as possible, but they should be seeing if the students can apply the information. There is minimal utility in being able to find a precise piece of information in under 2 minutes. That is not how the working world functions. 4. Students should be allowed to take their midterms home in order to learn from them. I appreciate that we can review the midterms in Rosanne's office, but it is laziness on the part of the professor that we are unable to keep them and review them to actually learn from our mistakes. It readily appears that he is unwilling to write new questions for the coming year rather than truly teaching students. 5. Course materials should be updated. The energy sector is changing and there have been many interesting students. Yet, the course uses old material and many of the slides are not the most updated material. For example, an older version of the IPCC report is used in many of the slides. If students are only supposed to learn to repeat information, they should at least learn to repeat the most up to date statistics.",
    "Almost everything- I am leaving it to my fellow students to explain this one.",
    "I think the exams were odd in the sense that they were designed to see how quickly we could look up information on graphs rather than really testing what we knew. I think the exams could definitely be improved.",
    "Out of any of the classes offered, I would think that teaching assistants should have weekly discussion sections or office hours for ESA. Unfortunately, they did not offer this. The problem sets were helpful but would have been far more beneficial if the TAs were available to help us understand the concepts and calculations, rather than only being available via email. The organization of the class could be greatly improved. The discussion section or \"professional modules\" were offered within the first week of the class for concepts that didn't appear until the last month of the class. These should be better coordinated. The most frustrating and disappointing aspect was we were unable to have our midterm exam back and instead, had to view it from the registrar's office. If the professor was truly interested in our learning, she would have reviewed the material in class after the exam, allowed us to ask questions and would have ensured that we understood the concepts. The material was just so poorly taught that students were essentially forced to learn on their own. The inability of this class to effectively teach the material is demonstrated through the poor scores the students got on the midterm--an average of 60. I also appalled that the professor announced the top students after the midterm and brought them chocolate in front of the other students, and then proceeded to scold the other students for not working hard enough.",
    "See response to questions 16. Additionally, the problem sets were extremely time intensive, and the first two provided limited useful experience. The third problem set was more valuable in a practical sense.",
    "The timing and structure of the problem sets as well as the student engagement during lectures. Many students lost interest very quickly during lectures.",
    "The course materials, slides, readings, and data sets need to be updated to include more recent energy trends. The structure for both exams also need to be changed. In the current format, students are tested for how quickly they can look up answers from printed course materials rather than actually testing knowledge of energy systems. Tie current events into class discussions.",
    "I was negatively surprised by the exam structure, it felt like a high school exam rather than a graduate level examination. I would have expected to see more analytical questions.",
    "The way it's taught... lectures from slides is too boring. It needs to be more interactive and visually appealing."

    "I have been a researcher and practitioner in the energy space for several years and was confident that this class would be a good foundational review of energy systems and teach me new things about energy in an interesting way. I was very disappointed in the results. There are very few energy courses available at FES compared to the amount of interest there is in energy from FES students. This class or rather fully overhauled version of this class should ideally serve as a foundation course for a number of other more advanced energy courses. This course did not serve that purpose, and seems like more of a course that FES uses to check off the \"we have energy courses\" box rather than a well-thought-out, well-designed course on foundations of energy.",
