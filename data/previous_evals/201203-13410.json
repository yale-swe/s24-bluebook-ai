   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take it. The title may be dry, but you learn to appreciate Yale so much more by understanding how much work goes into making a university function and live up to its purpose.",
    "I would recommend this course, as long as you have a professor teaching it. You may not do as well as you would like, but you learn how to write properly.",
    "Great course to improve writing ability. Yes.",
    "I would say English 114 as a course is fine, the texts are pretty dry and old school in the beginning (Plato etc.) but they pick up towards the end to modern day education and are really interesting. I would say the main reason to take it would be if Professor Andrews is teaching it- she really makes the course worthwhile.",
    "Its a lot of work, only take it if you like the specific focus of the section.",
    "I would recommend the class because it does help you become a better writer, and also helps with being able to analyze information and writing styles.",
    "I would recommend English 114 to anyone who is not confident in their writing skills. It helps establish a good foundation for you and help you understand what is exactly academic writing. However, there is a lot of reading involved in this class in addition to writing 4 papers. The grading is also quite harsh, but I think it lets you know how your writing improves over the semester.",
    "This class is basically for learning how to write a well-structured, logical, and coherent paper on the topic of higher education. First we read some influential texts about education and write an analysis on them. Then we write our own position paper using those texts. Lastly the class culminates in writing our own research paper on the topic of our choice with the books\/resources we choose. I would recommend this course because it really helps us build a strong basis of writing before beginning any other more sophisticated writings. Comparing with the beginning of the semester, I feel more confident in writing.",
    "The class discussions can be really interesting, but I wasn't really enthused to read the assignments or write papers regarding education and college. Thus, consider your willingness to write a ten page paper about college\/education, after having researched for it (as well as writing other, shorter papers about c\/e).",
    "this is a great class if you're not too confident in writing or you're just looking to bridge the gap between high school and college"
