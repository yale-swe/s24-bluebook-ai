   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. If you are at all interested in Morocco, feminism, women's right, Islamic studies or international relations, you will enjoy this class. There are so many themes that are interwoven in the readings and conversations.",
    "I would recommend this if you are interested in the specific field of feminism in Morocco. We do not discuss much else, and you have to do the reading to be able to keep up.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Its a great intro to Islamic feminism and Moroccos social history. I really appreciated that we didnt need a ton of prior knowledge on Islam\/Morocco but were still able to go deep into the material. All the books\/articles that professor El Haitami teaches are easily approachable no matter the level of your knowledge on Islam\/Morocco.",
    "If you are interested in topics on the interplay between politics and religion in a Muslim-majority country or if you are interested in feminist movements within the context of a Muslim population, I would definitely take this course. Professor El Haitami is stellar. She is well-informed on all the topics, and she holds a deep-set passion that reflects in our discussions. I personally very much appreciated the fact that this course was being taught by a woman who grew up and lives in the social, cultural and political paradigms discussed in class. This is not common unfortunately in ethnic studies courses at Yale so I would take advantage of this opportunity."
