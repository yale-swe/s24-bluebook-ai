   "comments": [
    "The expectations in this class are very high. Your writing is measured on a very rigorous scale. Furthermore, this class requires a large time commitment. Students should be prepared to put in a lot of time for little reward.",
    "The course was hard but highly recommended. A few stories increasing in length are pitched, written, and workshopped. By the end, you'll have a much better grip on science writing, and writing just in general. Zimmer istough but great, and he has a sense of humor. All in all great class. Take it if you can get in.",
    "Highly recommended. This is one of the most helpful, challenging courses at Yale. Class time is not outstanding, but the chance to work with a professional science writer and editor is invaluable. Reading load is light and high-quality. Writing load is heavy, but the effort pays off. Absolutely worth taking for both scientists and non-scientists.",
    "A solid introduction to science (and in part, environmental) journalism. This course felt much more pre-professional that most courses I have taken at Yale -- that's not really a bad thing, it just meant that we weren't really grappling with big ideas so much...we were really focused on improving writing technique, how to structure a story, grammar, etc. This could sometimes be boring and feel repetitive, but I think in the end I did gain some helpful skills -- I can hear Zimmer's voice in my head as I edit a piece. Unfortunately the quality of our graded work was somewhat dependent on forces outside our control. So my biggest RECOMMENDATION: choose good topics for your 3 pieces -- if you don't, you'll have a very tough time. Professor Zimmer let's you use your own judgement on what to write about, but this can be a problem later if your piece is not strong because the topic was a weak one (it will unfortunately be graded accordingly). I recommend choosing topics for which you can easily get interviews from people at Yale -- this will make your life easier. Anyway, I would recommend this course if this is an area you that you're really interested in -- inthe end of the day, it's very good practice for aspiring scientists and writers and science writers! But it requires a large amount of work and sometimes even personal field trips (for interviews)!",
    "You read a lot of great articles, and are writing constantly. It's great to be able to pick whatever you want to write about, and it's possible to get some great experiences from the assignments. Zimmer is really tough to read, though he's anexpert at what he does. Class time seemed a little like a formality. Be ready to put a lot of time into this class. Also be ready to get zero positive response or encouragement from Zimmer.Note: Unfortunately, doing well in the class is only possible if you put a ton of work into it, and are also just naturally good at writing. Solid effort and\/or improvement is not going to be recognized. Be prepared to recognize that on your own, pat yourself on the back, and move on.",
    "Yes absolutely! Yale needs more classes like this one. Expect to throw yourself into this class completely--it will take up all your time. Also, I would start planning on what you will write for the longer two pieces a few weeks ahead of time. These assignments are not something you can pull off last minute, and my initial plans fell through for some of my pieces. Zimmer really emphasizes in-person reporting, so keeping up with what interesting research is going on at Yale will be helpful. I have probably learned more in this class than I have from any other so far. I have a new understanding of how to write well that I think will transcend the journalistic style we focused on in this class. Each week we discussed professional pieces of science writing and workshopped a few pieces by other students. Zimmer is pretty intimidating, but he really cares about helping his students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Its very tough and takes up a ton of time. This is not a good way for a science major to get an easy writing credit. It is a serious writing and journalism class, in-depth, in-person reporting takes a lot of time and can be very draining. Professor Zimmer is brilliant and a very good teacher but also very harsh and critical. He pushes youto do the best reporting and best writing you can do, but his harsh style is sometimes counterproductive. Still, he's a great professor, and I learned a lot from him. But the class is definitely stressful. The reading is fantastic though. You learn to deconstruct and construct all kinds of articles involving science aimed at many different types of major publications."
