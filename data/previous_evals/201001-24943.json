   "comments": [
    "A good course and a must-take for graduate schoool-bound math majors. Not always easy or intuitive, but very rewarding. Strongly recommend.",
    "Absolutely take it. An AWESOME subject. This is not interesting like the way you tried to claim that 230 or 301 was \"interesting.\" This stuff is actually really cool and has a very intuitive\/natural appeal.",
    "I strongly recommend it, but make sure you have ten hours a week to spend on problem sets. You can do them in less, but you won't get much out of it.",
    "Fun class. You should have some algebra background though.",
    "The first month of the course treats point-set topology, which (by Dymarz's admission) isn't too exciting, but is important to know, since the bulk of the mathematical objects that give rise to algebraic topology are defined in terms of point-set topological concepts.The rest of the course deals with Algebraic Topology: Fundamental groups, covering spaces, Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, and classification of surfaces. Fun stuff, but if you want to reallyunderstand what's going on, be prepared to go beyond the assigned reading and problems and do some outside reading on your own.",
    "This was an interesting introduction to Algebraic Topology. The class begins from the very bottom, so no prior knowledge of topology is assumed. Some experience with analysis\/set theory would be useful for the first half of the course, while familiarity with groups would be useful for the second half. I recommend this course; the material is really cool and Munkres' text is agreat presentation of it. However, be prepared to read and reread results. A lot of the material is difficult and one reading will not necessarily be enough to internalize everything."
