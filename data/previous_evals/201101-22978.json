    "Absolutely! Sweet professor and the focus is on solving problems, not just being force-fed statistics from the WHO. Painless way to get rid of a science credit. Tests\/assignments\/all evaluated work come from in-class notes, not the reading materials, so attend class.",
    "EE&B106 is a worthwhile science credit that covers interesting, challenging material in a pretty low-key, straightforward way with a low point of entry. You learn a lot about Malaria and Lyme without having to do a ton of work. Professor Belperron really gets your brain working hard while keeping your course-load light. The quizzes and midterm are quite hard, but the material presents a worthwhile foray into problem-solving from various perspectives.",
    "TAKE THIS FOR A SCIENCE CREDIT! quite interesting, not much work, you never have to do the reading, learn quite a bit, fair assignments tho quizzes can be a little tricky so be prepared. plus no final",
    "I really liked Malaria, Lyme and Vector-Borne Disease. There are 3 quizzes, a midterm and a final research paper which is a fair amount of work but nothing that is unbelievably stressful. The material is interesting, though there is a lot of memorization. Professor Belperron is super nice and helpful. I highly recommend this course for anyone - you do not need to have prior knowledge of the pathogens as everything is explained!",
    "This class is not a gut! It's better: challenging, but totally doable. Plus the prof. is soo nice and smart.",
    "This is a great class. I seriously recommend it to anyone interested in learning a great deal about not only infectious disease, but also public health policy, immunology, and pathogenesis. I began the class thinking that \"West Nile Virus\" was actually \"Blue Nile Virus,\" and finished by writing an extensive paper of DNA vaccination against the Plasmodium Falciparum parasite. The incredible attention to detail exercised by Prof. Belperron is astounding. Moreover, she is seriously dedicated to her students, and will make perfectly sure that you understand the material before moving on to the next topic. Beware: THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! It is seriously challenging, but so worth it. The quizzes can be a little scary (the average of the second quiz was about a 68), but the midterm and the paper will seriously give you a great chance to show what you've learned. You have plenty of time to write a solid final essay, the topic of which is your choice. Now, if the class is offered again, and you seriously want to take it, do not let the huge amount of shoppers deter you. Most don't actually realize how challenging the course actually is, and these will drop out from the running to get in almost immediately. The worst mistake you can make is to take E&EB 106 just to fulfill a science credit. Of course, I counted this course toward my distribution credits, but I took the class because I wanted to learn something totally different from what I'd regularly studied. It was hard, but seriously worthwhile.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is supposedly an easy A, but while I haven't gotten my grade back yet, I thought it was very boring and had a lot of work. the quizzes are really hard. But professor belperron is really sweet and cares a lot.",
    "It gives you a good sense of what a vector-borne disease is, the different types, and you learn a lot about malaria and Lyme. You learn about the human immune system.",
    "great coverage of the topics. very well organized and you learn everything.",
    "This class is in no way a \"gut\" science class, do not let the fact that it is intended for non-science majors fool you. It is a lot of work, the three quizzes and the midterm taken in class all require an immense amount of studying and force you to actually apply the concepts that you are learning as opposed to reciting the biology and facts. Lectures have slides which go up online, but you must take notes and pay attention, and the class can be a bit monotonous and hard to follow. The final paper is the best part, 6-10 pages, but with .5 margins all around, so really 8-15 pages. You can write on whatever topic you want, which gives you some freedom. Do not take this class looking to slack off and get a science credit, if the subject matter interests you, Professor Belperron is a good teacher and you will be forced to learn, but if you find it boring you will struggle and your grade will reflect that, definitely not a pushover when it comes to grading. Last years evaluations oversold this class as very easy and interesting, I would take those assessments with a grain of salt.",
    "Not a gut course. I thought it was going to be easy, but found it to be one of my most challenging classes. The workload is not much, and the professor puts powerpoints on classes v2 (which is really helpful), but at the end of the year the research paper is very time consuming. Prof. Belperron is a great teacher, but do not go in to this class thinking it'll be a breeze. High school offered a fairly poor biology class sophomore year - I assume going into the class with at least AP bio would be useful.",
    "THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT. Professor Belperron makes sure of that. If you are looking for an easy A science credit, this class is not it. On the plus side, I was challenged, and did learn useful information through the class.",
    "It's a good science for non-science majors, though the workload is not small and you can find an easier Sc credit if you look for it. If you're interested in the development and transmission of disease, this is a great class for you. If your interest in this class comes from the belief that you'll be spending a lot of time examining the spread of disease and the ways of combatting it, you'll find less time spent on this than you may have hoped. An interesting and worthwhile class, just be sure you understand what you're getting.",
    "yes, but you have to be able to make conceptual leaps in your head throughout the class. she will teach you if you have ambition to learn the material.",
    "Great course. Really interesting diseases. Structured very well so you learn about disease, immunology and ways of preventing\/fighting disease. Definitely take it.",
    "This course will teach you a good deal of information about vector-borne diseases \u0096 primarily Malaria. If you are not a science major, but you are for one reason or another interested in vector-borne diseases or even just how the immune system works and what different vaccines and drugs do for our bodies, I would recommend taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It is an excellent way to learn a subject while also fulfilling a requirement. It is a bit more difficult than other science classes for non-science majors, but there is value in that. The reading is a bit more complex than the class itself, but the material that really needs to be understood is taught in class. Professor Belperron also really wants to get to know the students in her classes, and does so through lunches outside of class. Her office hours are particularly helpful in brushing up before the midterm and before handing in the final paper, but only if you come in with questions beforehand. The class was taught in a more lecture-type format, but also allowed students to ask questions during class which lecture classes do not allow.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 106 to a fellow non-science major student. This course is really what a science-for-non-majors course should be like: it isn't a gut, but it isn't too difficult, and it provides both a great general knowledge base (of how the immune system functions, of the various ways in which interventions vs. infectious disease can function, etc.) along with specific insights into malaria, Lyme disease, and other vector-borne illnesses.",
    "The class is pretty laid back on work load until the end of the semester when it gets a bit heavier, but its important that you go to lecture because there is a ton of information given that you can really only fully understand if you're in class asking questions, especially if you're a non-science major. The tests are not always the most straight-forward questions and require some thought before answering but if you know the information well you can usually figure out how to answer them. The end of the semester is a bit more work intensive because you have to write a research paper. BE WARNED THIS IS ON AVERAGE A 10 PAGE PAPER WITH 1\/2 INCH MARGINS AND SIZE FONT 11!!!! Keep in mind this is the only real time consuming assignment you have for the class, the rest of the semester is pretty chill.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, take this course. You'll learn tons of information about malaria and lyme disease. If you're just looking for a science credit, you can definitely find something easier. If you only want to fill a requirement, the information is much too detailed and hard to memorize for tests since the Professor often comes up with questions that require \"application\" not \"memorization.\" Overall, this is not the course to take if you want an easy science requirement."
