   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wishes to continue their study of Russian and greatly improve their control of Russian.",
    "Very well taught class. I wish more of the reading materials were contemporary (as opposed to famous Russian literature) but that's just a personal preference for career development. Strongly recommend, though it's a substantial amount of work.",
    "Russian 151 is an intermediate Russian course that moves at a fast pace and integrates grammar instruction, vocabulary-building, and reading. I would definitely recommend this course--it is a rigorous introduction to higher-level grammar and will prepare you well for more literature courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "If you're studying Russian at third year level, this class is your only option, but that's for the best because it is AMAZING.",
    "If you want to improve your Russian following beginning and intermediate courses, this class is a must. Dr. Muravnik will push you, but always be there to help as well. I wholeheartedly recommend this class.",
    "A strong course on Russian grammar with ample opportunities to write and receive feedback on short essays, and present short oral presentations. Also provides for first contact with major Russian writers such as Chekov, Pushkin and Tolstoi.",
    "Professor Muravnik is one of the better professors I've had at Yale, and he makes this course an excellent one. Although the course is a lot of work, it is not challenging because of Muravnik's teaching ability and fair exams. It will be a bit difficult adjusting to his expectations for oral work, but if you put the effort in, you will find it a rewarding class, and one that will substantially advanced your proficiency with the Russian language."
