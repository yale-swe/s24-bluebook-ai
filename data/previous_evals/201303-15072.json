   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend, but not with Maripaz. She's condescending and it made me dread the class.",
    "I would not recommend Spanish 130 to another student unless they needed the distributional requirement. I do not feel that the course enhanced my conversational abilities at all.",
    "You know what you're getting into. Busy work, something graded every other week, and class every day. That being said, I'm not sure I would recommend this class with this professor.",
    "Only take if required.",
    "Good way to get language credit and not too challenging if you already have experience with Spanish. Very grammar heavy so that should be considered in selecting this course. Previous knowledge and understanding of Spanish grammar should be present before taking this course. I would recommend if you want to learn a language.",
    "I think that she was patient and did her best to help me out in terms of writing and speaking in spanish.",
    "The class has work everyday, but it generally takes less than an hour, and if you do it everyday you really will improve your Spanish. However, if you fall behind and\/or fail to master a concept it will haunt you until the final, and it can get exhausting thinking about Spanish all the time, because there is never a break in the assignments.",
    "A fine L3 Spanish course. Most of the grammar, especially at the beginning, was review from L2. Profesora Garcia was a fair and nice teacher. Just be sure to participate in class and do the nightly homework, and with daily practice in class you will be well prepared for the assessments."
