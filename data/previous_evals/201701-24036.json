    "This class changed my entire outlook on the world, science, and humans as a species. I began to acknowledge everything around me, as well as question it. The anthropocene is an odd day and age, and this class dives right into the \"why\" behind science for once, instead of the \"how\".",
    "Scientific literacy",
    "I got a much better grasp on how to understand data and analyze the real world.",
    "I learned about many environmental problems and mechanisms to combat them. I learned about ecosystems I previously knew very little about.",
    "Really nice intro course into environmental studies.",
    "I learned a lot about the Anthropocene, and I have a much better understanding of how humans interact with the environment. I now know how to make a carbon budget and how to evaluate and global supply chain.",
    "Systems thinking and application of case studies to general principles",
    "Greater knowledge of systems thinking and better able to interpret food webs and environmental interactions",
    "I learned a lot about ecology, an academic area where I have had little experience. Specifically, I developed efficiency in my scientific research skills."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed how inclusive lectures were. Professor Schmitz worked to make it so that everyone in the class had a say, and that their opinions were thought through logically.",
    "I was a bit skeptical about the grading\/work structure at first but I ended up really liking it! There are 6 ~5 page research assignments, two midterms, and a very manageable final assignment. The structure definitely forced me to learn some of the important concepts of the class, and it gives you a chance to get in-depth knowledge about a specific ecosystem and resource as well as connecting it to the bigger picture.",
    "I feel that we could have more field trips to visit areas the course would be improved. Sometimes there is a lack of connection with the material.",
    "The assignments were vague and confusing and it seemed difficult to do perfectly on them given the limited available information.",
    "Field trips!",
    "The strengths include a cultivation of understanding how ecological and socio-ecological systems work. A weakness is that the weekly assignments are a lot of busy work and are frustrating.",
    "Creative assignments, but all the lectures tied back to kind of the same materials. Readings were interesting but not terribly well integrated",
    "The weekly assignments forced me to be consistently engaged with the course. The testing was a great way to evaluate our progress and many of the topics on the tests were directly related to our own personal research that we were doing for our weekly assignments. There are really no weaknesses that I can think of."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone that is sick of science classes simply telling you what to do. If you want to understand why, if you are interested in the environment, if you are interested in humans... If you want to finally have an optimistic discussion about the damages we've done as a race, but the simultaneously reversible ones as well: THIS is the course.",
    "Yes! Take this class. Yale seems to have very few interesting and well-taught intro-level science classes but this class was great. At the beginning of the class Os said he was going to \"trick us into learning science,\" and that was definitely true. The workload is manageable (6 5-page assignments, 2 midterms, one 10-page blog post) and the tests are reasonable. Engaging lectures, professor seems like a really nice guy. The class is really well suited for non-science majors, gets very social science-y at times.",
    "Very interesting course, great if you want insight on the environment.",
    "Yes, contingent on certain aspects changing because the assignments were frustrating at times.",
    "Yes.",
    "I do recommend this course so that a student can learn how to think critically about the environment we live in and also cultivate a positive image of human interaction with the environment.",
    "Yes, good way for non science major to be exposed to scientific thinking",
    "This class will help you think about the difficult problems we face as a society in a new and refreshing way. Anyone who wants to stop hearing the death day news about climate change, land use change, etc., and wants to hear some good ways to fix the problems instead should take this class.",
    "Yes! It is a good class for non majors and tackles interesting subject matter",
    "This class will allow you to explore many interesting topics within the broad scope of ecological studies. The class material is not too in depth and the professor and TFs are very engaged with the material and your learning.",
    "Yes--great course that doesn't require all the energy you ever had. There's a lot of focus on human systems, and how that effects the environment, and on human society as an ecosystem to ensure sustainability."
