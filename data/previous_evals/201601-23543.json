    "Great speakers; appreciate the diversity of speakers",
    "Stellar. I love this class.",
    "Great opportunity to hear healthcare leaders talk openly about their career trajectory, accomplishments, and failures.",
    "Learned a lot, oved the structure of the class.",
    "Loved this class - great opportunity to hear from current people in the field. Mainly focused on hospital administration, though a few others sprinkled through in policy roles and more social justice related roles. Highly recommend!",
    "Definitely a highlight of my MPH education! I really enjoyed hearing about the different life experiences of different leaders in healthcare. I learned a lot from their own careers and gained a better perspective on what I want to do within healthcare.",
    "This class is a wonderful experience. I am so glad I decided to take it to make sure that I attended all of the sessions. The learnings from this course will stick with me throughout my professional career.",
    "Great caliber of speakers speaking about a diverse array of healthcare topics.",
    "Strengths: includes speakers from many backgrounds and ideologies. Excellent opportunity that could only be recreated by having over a dozen shadowing experiences or internships.",
    "The speakers were fantastic, and the overall format was great. Maybe if the food was less healthy and a little more filling I would have enjoyed it more.",
    "This course is possibly the highlight of my past year in the HCM program. The speakers are so inspirational and offer great insight on different careers that could be pursued in healthcare. It is a different experience to see examples of people who started out just like us and got to the positions they are in today. The advice that they give could not be found anywhere else! This course has been very valuable to me and I would encourage anyone to take it.",
    "I really loved colloquium. I think the attendance practices were a little ridiculous. Some people were told they could write papers if they missed too many session while others were told they had to repeat the course.",
    "Great course. It would be good to switch up the food sometimes.",
    "Great seminar to hear from industry leaders!",
    "It is a great experience to attend this class. I will never regret to take this one.",

    "It was a great class",
    "Course is good, learned a lot about healthcare leadership. Would like to learn more from non-white males in regards to leading healthcare organizations.",
    "Great variety of speakers",
    "I really appreciated the diversity of speakers, although a few more women could have helped. I especially enjoyed hearing from the policy focused speakers, it was great to learn more about how they combined management and policy in their work.",
    "Useful!",
    "You have to take this, but it doesn't feel like a class. It's a lot of fun and extremely rewarding to hear real people make a difference in the field"
