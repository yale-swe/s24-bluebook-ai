Class time consisted of mundane and monotonous exercises which she photocopied from other textbooks. I often found myself wondering why I was enduring such a class when there were so much better professors. (Sometimes she was unnecessarily\/unintentionally rude and mean...one of my classmates cried leaving her class on many occasions)."
