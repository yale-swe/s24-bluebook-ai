   "comments": [
    "Above and beyond! I learned R very effectively and feel I have a mastery for what I need to do.",
    "Way too much statistics at the expense of other programming tools. I feel like there are significant gaps in my knowledge of R tools after finishing the course.",
    "The knowledge aligned with my expectation very well. This is specifically the case for students from the school of public health.",
    "It was a little bit easier than I expected, but I am still happy with what I learned.",
    "I dont think I have walked away thinking that I understand R very well.",
    "Exactly what I was hoping to get out of the course.",
    "It aligned very well. My only suggestion would be to start the statistics portion earlier in the semester.",
    "Better. I have been a code dunce my whole life. This course helped me get over the hump where missing commas and can completely shut you down and pods you off. It got me to the point where I could trouble shoot which seemed pretty impossible.",
    "Yes and no. I gained plenty of new skills in R, but also expected the class to move a bit faster - I hoped to learn for loops, programming, and some more exciting packages. That said, I do feel incredibly prepared now to teach myself those skills since I have a functional knowledge of R.",
    "They aligned fairly the same as expected.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations in learning how to code and analyze data. I definitely feel more confident in coding with R.",
    "Course delivery met my expectations.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class were beyond my expectations.",
    "Very well. I learned just about everything that I wanted to and the timing of the learning worked well with the data analysis that I am carrying out.",
    "My expectations for R and data analysis were met and exceeded in certain cases.",
    "On a scale on 1 to 5, 4. I would have expected the \"conducting analysis in R\" to be heavier than the \"coding\" part, since a more applied knowledge would have better suited my personal needs.",
    "Very well.",
    "It met my expectations"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course ramps up very rapidly (difference between first lessons\/labs and the ones towards the end of the course is huge). Unclear value added of the lessons in class.",
    "The R package used to teach the course interactively was fantastic. It was perfect to submerge you into programming and writing code immediately. Additionally, the course moves at an appropriate pace and content is organized well. However, I did not like that we did not have a syllabus that included the dates that lessons\/labs were released or due. I often found myself confused about when these things were assigned or due and this could have been easily remedied by having a clear syllabus from the start that included these dates. I was not able to plan ahead with my other coursework and this became a little challenging to deal with.",
    "Course started too slow and accelerated too much at the end. The workload should be evened out across the semester. It was almost impossible to keep up with labs, lessons, AND the final project in the end. Especially since you had to learn all the statistics if you didn't already know it. The project expectations were very high- essentially we were asked to complete a publishable article which was not out lined early enough in the course. By the time we got the rubric, it was too late to really do a good job.",
    "The strength was swirl and labs assignments that challenged students' knowledge. I also learned a lot of data analysis skills working on the final project. I think the course could improve by teaching statistics a little earlier perhaps. Statistics is sort of hard but most needed concept. Learning to plot is equally important. I think the first basic skills could be taught a little faster and make more time for \"explore\" and \"statistics\"",
    "Because this is an intro course it is a little slow at the start. It would be great if there was a more advanced course offered. Otherwise, I appreciated the freedom that the class offered to learn on our own time.",
    "The lectures are not really helpful but Swirls are. Some swirls need to be updated to reflect the correct answers. The pace is very slow and this class does not challenge you to advance your R skills.",
    "Strengths: Amazing instructor support and TA support. Both Simon and Andrew were extremely willing to provide personal assistance to students- which was essential for learning. Additionally, I appreciated the flexibility with due dates, and lab hours. Weaknesses: I don't think lectures at the beginning of class were very helpful. Maybe increase workload at the beginning of course and cove statistics in greater depth later on.",
    "Strength: Hands-on component Weakness: Lectures Really this course needs to span two semesters- one for intro to R and one for data analysis in R",
    "Class is run pretty well. It would have helped me to get the hard stats sooner but I was behind in the course work at that point as it was. I think I started with denser stats and the. Learned to understand them much better right at the end. Thats my only suggestion. The flipped classroom and flexible structure were great for maintaining research and learning at my own pace. Swirl is a great idea. Labs were manageable but still puzzling. Project structure is great for grad students with research goals.",
    "Strengths: SWIRL! Swirl is fantastic. Great TA help. Simon is a great teacher. Weaknesses: Class time for users with any R experience (even light) is not very helpful, class moves slowly.",
    "Strengths- Simon and Andrew are incredible instructors. They have a very relaxed approach to the class and encourage you to make mistakes and learn from them. I loved both of their approaches to teaching. Swirl and Simon's website were so helpful throughout the course and the Friday boot camps were awesome. Finally a graduate school class that treats us like adults with appropriate grading and projects that challenge us!",
    "Simon was so nice and wonderful, just very very hard to hear and struggled to keep class engaged during lecture. Interactive lectures maybe?",
    "SWIRL - interactive learning\/teaching was perhaps one of the strengths of the course plus both instructors and TA were an excellent teacher.",
    "A major strength of this course is that we mostly learn by doing. I thought the SWIRL lessons were useful and helped me walk through the material. I suggest refining some of the lessons that come at the very end of the course. Especially the Statistics section. Although I don't expect this course to be a statistics course, it would be helpful for those of us that are a little rusty on statistics if there were a little more information on interpreting the results or the output of the tests.",
    "The course covered a lot of piratical skills, as well as some best practice.",
    "I'd like to see some of the earlier topics be covered a little bit faster so that more time can be spent on statistical analyses.",
    "The strengths of the course include the instructor and TA's knowledge and time\/willingness to help and work through problems.",
    "Strengths: the class is organized, the professor and TF are very receptive and available which is very conducive to your learning process. Weaknesses: sometimes assignment prompts (or questions) are not very clear and it can take an unnecessary amount of time to do the labs because of it. Some labs were also extremely long, and it was hard to keep up with that, the project, and the lessons per week. It would be great if you could work on your project instead o the labs, for the analysis part. That way you can conduct all types of analysis on your data, and learn while working on your project. Lastly, while swirl is very conducive, learning through a little more interaction with the professor would've been ideal, since students are hoping to learn from them, who have been working with R for a long time (i.e. learn different tricks and ways that make your life easier, otherwise every time I did learn something like this from them, I wished I knew it sooner).",
    "SWIRL IS AMAZING",
    "The course moved very slowly at first and then rapid fire the last couple of weeks. I also think having the students self teach themselves advanced stats and coding at the same time is a huge mistake. It made the end of the course kind of miserable, and I felt like I was just doing the work to get a complete assignment in, and not to actually learn.",
    "I think the course was well and thoughtfully designed. For those of us that kept pace with lessons and labs, the material was logically developed, and the pace was appropriate - fast enough to be challenging, and slow enough not to scare us off.",
    "The course is well designed"

    "Although the work load is high, the professor and TF are receptive and flexible which makes the workload more manageable and feasible. It is also the type of class where what you get out of it is proportional to what you put in; and it is a nice, fun class to attend to (which is always a nice addition)",
    "Do not fall behind on weekly assignments.",
    "Make more time in your schedule for this course at the end of the semester.",
    "Take it! This course will serve you well, especially if you have data to analyze and expect to be running statistics in the future.",
    "The course is interesting and the lecturer quite accessible but the learning will be dependent on you."
