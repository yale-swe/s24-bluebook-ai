    "Take it.",
    "Yes if you're at all interested in photography\/photo theory\/memory, this class is absolutely eye-opening and will expose you to methods of thought and analysis that you don't get elsewhere.",
    "It is an excellent study of the way memory is shaped by photography and affects our historical vision. The readings are fascinating and the seminar is very lively",
    "Definitely take this class no matter what major you are.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Really interesting readings and class discussions that helped me consider photography in new ways. The final project is really open and cool to work on.",
    "Of course! Yes! I didn't want this class to ever end!!! Wonderful, rich discussions with thoughtful classmates and a brilliant, generous professor. The kind of material that makes your brain and world expand week after week. The material is intellectually demanding but not at all inaccessible or impenetrable. Do plan to dedicate time to the readings as they are not skimmable, nor will you want to skim them. The final archive project (find a set of photographs in an archive, pair them with a text of your choice and think through that pairing in a paper) was a joy after spending months reading lots and lots of other people doing the same kind of work. Also, the class is definitely not limited to students with a preexisting interest in or knowledge of photography, so don't worry if your experience is limited to looking at family albums and reading the news--those types of interactions with photography are really the premise of the course. If you're at all interested, take it, because Prof. Wexler will probably change your life and you'll be SO happy you signed up."
