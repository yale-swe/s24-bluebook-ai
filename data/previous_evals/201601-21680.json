    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to another student. Not only do you read a lot of great literature, but you read them for craft, so I feel that my writing has improved a lot by emulating great writers.",
    "For anyone even mildly interested in creative writing, don't be put off by the \"nonfiction\" title of ENGL 120 - this class has SUCH enjoyable essay prompts (i.e. cultural criticism, portraying a place, telling a personal story, etc.) that will give you so much inspiration when writing. You'll learn a lot from analyzing the class readings for craft, and you'll also find that applying that analysis comes easily when writing the essays.",
    "English 120 is a class on writing creative non-fiction. You will read interesting essays by a variety of prolific authors and study these essays for craft. The pace of writing is intense (1 draft per week), but you get a lot out of the class.",
    "Take this class!!!! Its great. Will make you a better writer and person. Especially with Saraceni",
    "Great class to take, practically a creative writing course.",
    "This is a course that teaches you to love non fiction essay writing. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to write in any capacity.",
    "You will read and write a lot."
