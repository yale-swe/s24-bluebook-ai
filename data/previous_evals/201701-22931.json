   "comments": [
    "- A better intuition for where concepts and formulas come from, and a better intuition for how to apply them in practice, reinforced by very well-written homework problems - An excellent example of how quantum mechanics should be taught if I find myself teaching it in the future - The ability to think more flexibly about concepts in quantum and about connections between those concepts - A much deeper understanding of second quantization - A taste of quantum field theory",
    "Quantum theory at a higher level",
    "Learned a lot about approximations in quantum mechanics, especially perturbation theory. In particular, careful attention was paid to the regimes in which various approximations hold, and their applications to physical systems - photonic crystals, spectroscopy, ultracold physics, etc.",
    "Approximation in physics.",
    "I learned a lot about how quantum physics is put into practice in experiments, something I feel most other courses in the subject lack.",
    "I gained a lot of intuition for methods with which I was already familiar (perturbation theory, Fermi's Golden Rule, various approximations) and was introduced to scattering in a straightforward way.",
    "very good prof"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: primarily the instructor and the quality of his lectures\/problem sets\/exams Suggestion for improvement: spend a little less time on relatively familiar concepts like variational principle, WKB, perturbation theory",
    "very good course, clear, modern, and related to research",
    "Strengths: Lectures were interesting and very easy to follow. Problem sets were difficult but solvable with enough work, and actually asked interesting questions rather than just textbook questions. Perturbation theory was well-presented - very clear and thorough. Weaknesses: Insufficient time\/strange time management by the end of the course - second quantization wasn't on the final despite being studied for two weeks, and pretty much no field theory was introduced.",
    "Great lectures. Midterm too closely parroted the HW.",
    "The one weakness of this course was that there is not a single textbook that properly covers all the material in the course. However, the topics were well presented and a textbook was not needed to understand the material. Another weakness was that not all the material was fully covered during the class. We barely got to second quantization.",
    "I felt the course was very well spaced. We explored many topics you wouldn't normally get to see, which is very cool, but sometimes they went over my head, like the material on Barry's phase."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor alone makes it worth it, but I also found it to be a very solid introduction to many fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics.",
    "yes. strongly recommend for those who encounter quantum mechanics in research.",
    "Yes; this is the first quantum mechanics course I've taken where I actually learned quantum mechanics rather than just mathematical formalism with brief applications to physical systems.",
    "Yes! Some of the best lectures that I have ever had.",
    "Yes. Solid course. Nice coverage of current quantum research topics.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you find quantum interesting, even if you are fairly confident in your undergraduate course's thoroughness.",
    "yes!"
