   "comments": [
    "This class sort of fit into a similar vein as the Psych and the Good Life phenomenon in that it was a unique opportunity to critically reflect on our personal experiences at Yale in an academic context, except much more impactful and worthwhile. We gained a much more nuanced understanding of our purpose in coming to Yale in the first place, and also challenged those purposes and thought critically about what a liberal education experience should really accomplish. Unlike any other course I've taken here, even as an Ed Studies scholar, and really fascinating to think about in relation to my time here.",
    "Synthesizing large amounts of reading into concise and effective argument",
    "This course helped me make sense of the purposes and nature of effective liberal education, and thus helped me explore how I can craft a meaningful Yale education from the myriad opportunities we have here as well as view liberal education programs with a more critical eye. This course is incredibly worthwhile.",
    "I learned much about the state of college education and what ideally it should be. I also gained a better sense of how to take advantage of Yale.",
    "I developed an awareness of my own education and what I'm doing at Yale. This class really made me consider my class choices and made me realize that Yale will not structure my education for me. I also learned, skills-wise, how to synthesize and integrate information from readings into weekly papers. I definitely learned how to write more efficiently over the course of the semester.",
    "I greatly improved my writing skills, and have a comprehensive, extensive knowledge of what a liberal education should be.",
    "After this semester I learned the origins, purpose and the current practice of liberal education. This course is excellent if someone wants to know more about college education or have a chance to reflect on the education she or he has received so far.",
    "I undoubtedly became a better writer from this class. But more than this, this class completely changed my life at Yale. It gave me newfound purpose and motivation in my learning and helped me to understand more clearly the educational structures that surround me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Depth and consistency of feedback on written work, engaging texts without being overwhelming, Hersh has an amazing breadth of experience but really values working closely with students, very small size of the class (9 students) made discussions intimate and worthwhile Weaknesses: Seminars sometimes felt a bit like lectures, the week-to-week pacing of essays sort of breaks down after the midterm which made the lighter workload nice but made expectations for class preparation in the off weeks less clear",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course is the writing component. Developing and articulating an argument through the weekly papers greatly improved the quality of my writing and helped me confront the central questions of this course. Professor Hersh is also a fantastic teacher, engaging the entire class in (riveting) critical discussion and consistently offering ample, timely feedback on our writing to help us refine our ideas. The experience of this course is precious.",
    "Strengths: -involved discussions -interesting readings and essays -very dedicated professor -get comments and grade back on weekly essay within hours or at most a day -have the ability to rewrite essays as many times as we want (this does NOT mean you will automatically get an A on your last draft) -class lives up to the ideals of a liberal education Weaknesses: -a lot of reading per week and an essay per week (not so much a weakness, just a lot of work) -how the professor assigns grades to essay is not entirely clear. Would be better if there was a rubric",
    "This course was structured in such a way as to allow for the seeming mastery of the subject area (i.e. the nature and purpose of liberal education)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This class is notorious for its workload but it is more than manageable and is actually really rewarding. Hersh isn't afraid to push you, but with reasonable expectations and the ability to revise and rework the papers that don't go so well. Maybe not a great idea as like a fifth class, but for anyone interested in taking a self-reflective approach to how and why they got here, it's an amazing opportunity.",
    "Take this class! It is a lot of work (an essay a week in addition to the readings), but it will help you to process and better understand your time at Yale. If you can get in, take it during your first or second year. Professor Hersh is amazing, and the readings\/projects he assigns are all very thoughtful and interesting.",
    "Absolutely take this courseit will help you make sense of why you're at Yale and how you can make your higher education meaningful. Professor Hersh is an incredible teacher and mentor, and the syllabus content is extremely interesting. I highly, *highly* recommend taking this course and any other that Professor Hersh chooses to teach.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Students at Yale should know what a liberal arts education ideally is and what it actually is. This helps you put your Yale experience in perspective and helps you take advantage of your time here. Although, this is a lot of work, so definitely don't take it unless you have the time and are willing to put in the work.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an intense writing experience and wants to reflect on why they're at Yale and what higher education means. It's work-heavy, but worth it.",
    "Yes! Professor Hersh is an amazing professor and human being, and all he wants is for his students to truly learn. It's also just really important to reflect on why we pursue higher education, and why we're at Yale specifically, in order to maximize our time here.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. Not just because of what I have learnt from this course, but also because the course instructor is very devoted to teaching and student learning development. In this course you will have the chance to practice your writing skills (the instructor spends considerable amount of time in reading and revising students' papers) as well as to know what is a better way of learning.",
    "If you're interested in Ed. Studies at all then this class is a 100% must take, but honestly I think everyone at Yale should take this class. I would require it if I could. I think it's that good."
