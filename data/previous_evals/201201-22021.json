    "I loathe Hebrew, so take everything I say with a grain of salt:- The course is a lot of work, but probably not more than most other L2 language classes.- Dina is organized (something Ayala is not), but frigid. If possible, go with another instructor.- Ayala is a sweetheart. Take Ayala. Love Ayala.There might be worse things you could do with your time than take Hebrew at Yale. I can't think of any, though."
