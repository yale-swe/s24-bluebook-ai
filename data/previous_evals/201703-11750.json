    "I learned so much about music theory and the (Western) Classical style. It was so interesting to be able to look at music in a new way and to learn something completely new, something that I knew almost nothing about before. I was able to compose pieces based on Classical forms that I definitely would not have been able to do before this class.",
    "I learned the basics of classical music composition. I learned basic theme structures and gained more familiarity with constructing cadences and proper harmonic structures.",
    "I learned some more about basic music composition and analysis, specifically in the 18th century classical style. This included things like chord function, compositional techniques, and special tools that composers use.",
    "I learned counterpoint, voice-leading, harmony, and musical form of the Baroque and Classical periods.",
    "How to analyze music and compose in 18th century style.",
    "I learned about counterpoint melodies, writing figured bass, composing quartets and themes and variations, harmonies, and other concepts in music theory."

   "comments": [
    "This is a really strong course. Every class I felt I was learning something tangible and I feel like I received individualized feedback on everything I did. Maybe if there was any time for it this class could be improved by introducing a bit of the applications of what we're learning beyond the Classical period, like where we still see these aspects of music theory in later music and how they still shape our musical sense. But in general, a great introduction to Western Classical music theory.",
    "The small size of this class was a strength. I felt like the professor could focus a lot more on my and my progress and I think that led me to improve. This course is a large jump, however, from the intro Music courses and I felt very unprepared.",
    "The teacher wrote up many handouts himself, which was extremely helpful. The material was personalized to fit the questions we asked after each lesson. The teacher was also very willing to meet with students outside of class, which helped a lot. I feel like there was an aspect of connection missing in the material. The syllabus could've spent more time connecting the different techniques we learned after we studied them individually. Also, there could be some more distinction about techniques used for analysis and techniques for composition.",
    "I don't see a way it can be improved.",
    "It is a very strong course: the instructor is very approachable and every class is very interactive."

    "Yes! You learn so much. You really feel yourself learning class to class, week to week, and you produce compositions for the midterm and final projects that (at least for me) are beyond what you thought you'd be capable of doing before taking this course, and that you can really be proud of. It's a decent amount of work because unlike a lot of classes you do have usually-substantial homework due every class, but in general the work is interesting and in class you get to spend lots of time listening to and being able to critically analyze music which can feel so great.",
    "I would recommend this course but highly warn that the material is a lot more difficult than the intro courses. The homework was graded for correctness so you have to do well on the homework.",
    "If as student has a lot of time they can dedicate to this course, it is a great course to take. You will learn many things about music theory that will help you as a musician, but it will take up a significant amount of time.",
    "Yes, it gives good fundamentals for a musician.",
    "I would recommend this class if you like classical music and would love to understand how they were composed in a technical way."
