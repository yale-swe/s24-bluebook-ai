    "I would recommend. After all it is an introduction to statistical physics.",
    "It is a requirement, so students have to take it.",
    "I would recommend it to almost any student if Prof. Read was teaching it, as Stat. Mech. is useful in almost any context, and it was a very well taught course.",
    "I would recommend Physics 512 to other students, though they should know what they are getting into. It is a very difficult course.",
    "Statistical Physics is very important in many fields of Physics today. The tools developed in this class will be often helpful, although the physical content of the equation is not always very well explained, from my point of view.",
    "It is a typical statistical physics class. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course for any students wishing to either pass the qualifying exam or to go into theory, or both. Otherwise, it currently doesn't seem to be very relevant to experimental pursuits.",
    "It is standard course on statistical physics. I wouldn't especially recommend it, but it is one of the required courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, since it is necessary and good to calculate things with.",
    "yes it's a very important, and useful course!"

    "Went through a lot of math and derivations I had not seen before. There was always a heavy emphasis on what assumptions were being made which I liked.",
    "I did learn much more about Stat Mech than I did in my undergraduate course, but I felt like so of the material was too advanced and covered too quickly for me to fullyunderstand it.",
    "It was not immediately relevant to my research but still good to have some knowledge of.",
    "This course somewhat improved my overall understanding of the physical disciplines. It falls short, however, of fitting into a paradigm of physics that I have been striving to mold through the rest of the graduate courses. Perhaps I need to take the second part of this class to see how everything fits in, but to use a metaphor, this subject currently exists on an island for me, one that is difficult to access without losing touch with everything else.",
