    "Good lab course if you want to learn a ton of techniques in a short amount of time. If you're already working in a lab, however, it'd be much easier to waive this requirement for MB&B and not worry about it. It's not a lot of work outside of class, with the HUGE exception of the reports which can take quite a bit of time. Start early if you can, or you'll have a couple of pretty late nights before they're due. But it evens out because the in class quizzes are easy and you don't have to do anything outside of lab besides the 4 reports. And 2 of those are just results sections and aren't quite as tedious as the full reports.",
    "This is a good course that introduces you to various necessary techniques in biochemistry. The lab is laid-back and focused o understanding rather than technique which is awesome. Sometimes the labs can be dull, but I suppose that is somewhat expected. If you are deciding between taking this lab and waiving it, I would certainly take it.",
    "MB&B 360L is a lot of work. You spend a lot of hours each week in the lab, and a lot of hours working outside of class around the periods when each of the four reports is due. I felt like I got a lot out of this course though, especially as someone who had not spent much hands-on time in a wet lab before. I became very comfortable with almost all the techniques we learned, so I was very satisfied at the end with all I had learned. Also, Aruna is wonderful, and she was the best lab instructor I've had out of the eight lab courses I've taken.",
    "I would think very carefully about taking this course. On one hand, you will get hands-on experience with many of the canonical biochemical laboratory techniques (cloning, protein purification, etc), which can be very useful in future research work and in having a deeper understanding of biochemistry. On the other hand, the four lab reports require a lot of (seemingly needless) work and have been some of the most unpleasant and miserable experiences so far at Yale. Consider getting this lab waived with your own lab work.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but you will learn many procedures as well as the theory behind them. The lab reports are a LOT of work - do not procrastinate!",
    "The lab reports take a long time, but the techniques you learn are pretty interesting. You also get to know the other people in your lab very well.",
    "This lab is a lot of work, but after you are done taking it, you will feel really accomplished. Don't start writing the lab report the night before- that's a really bad idea. Stay on top of things and keep asking questions.",
    "This Biochemistry Lab is a survey of important lab techniques that helps the student practice investigative processes, from performing experiments to writing reports. That being said, the course is extremely demanding. Be prepared to write about 75 pages of lab report at minimum for the semester. The class can be tedious, confusing, poorly organized and a tremendous amount of work, but if you are willing to do it, the class can be incredibly rewarding - you will get to know your instructors well, your lab-mates will become your good friends, you will play with dry ice, Aruna will teach you yoga and you will be happy you signed up for this course."
