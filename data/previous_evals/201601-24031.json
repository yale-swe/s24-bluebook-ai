    "If you have already applied, accept the offer if you get into the class. If you are wondering if you should apply, do it. The readings are great classics and the experience to work with these professors is once in a lifetime. However, do look through the syllabus to determine if the readings are to your interest cause they can probably do cater to a specific crowd.",
    "Because the subject matter is so broad, and because the professors leading the classes changed every week, it can be a bit hard to judge this class. I think the themes of it are incredibly important and I'm very happy I decided to take it because I think I've learned a lot from it - but some of the sessions were absolutely terrible, while others were amazing, and others were just average.",
    "Grand Strategy is only a bad experience for those who come in with exceedingly high expectations. The best part of the course is getting to converse with the interesting guests they bring in for lunches and dinners. Don't miss out on them it's also free food!",
    "If you get the chance, take it. Grand Strategy opens so many doors - through dinners, workshops and a summer project - that its cons are far outweighed by the pros. The other students are smart and interesting, so don't only network with the professors!",
    "Yeah definitely take it if you get in. You'll have to grit your teeth at some points but hopefully it'll be worth it.",
    "Mixed bag. Not enough women or people of color, so be prepared to deal with a lack of intellectual diversity - this makes conversations sometimes monotonous, especially since certain professors especially were not adept at teasing out different versions of history. Syllabus isn't particularly rigorous (especially the first semester) and relies more on studying biographies of influential men rather than on theory of state-to-state interactions. Summer funding is nice. Beware that two-hour seminars are immediately followed by two-hour leadership development seminars on most days, so there's more classroom time than what first appears.",
    "As a class, the first half of Grand Strategy is pretty interesting: every week is a different historical episode, analyzed through the lens of \"Grand Strategy.\" But you don't do the program for the class, really, you do it for the wonderful resources and the community: intimate dinners, fascinating lecturers, amazing classmatesit's Yale on steroids!",
    "An involved hands-on leadership training course designed for leaders from a variety of disciplines -- not necessarily EP&E and Poli-Sci (though you'll find many of those in the course). I would highly recommend it to anyone passionate about leadership who has a keen interesting in current events and global affairs, but be ready to deal with quite a lot of egos in one room and with some really conservative perspectives in the course.",
    "Grand Strategy is a very specific course and I think it would not suit everyone. That being said, I have enjoyed it and learned a lot. Visible efforts have been made to get rid of the unwelcoming reputation that the course might have had in previous years.",
    "It is a great survey course where you study in depth some of the most important decision makers in the history of the world. Class discussions are great, and it is a lot of fun thinking of the summer project and working with the faculty to develop the idea. Beware, though, as grading is very hard.",
    "Grand Strategy didn't quite live up to the academic expectations I had going in. The course seems to invite over-ambitious students to apply with its grandeur of elitism and its global scope (the word Grand in the course's title, after all), which causes discussion to feel unduly competitive and hinders the atmosphere of educational attainment. It sometimes felt like the worst attributes of Directed Studies rehashed for upperclassmen. Lots of dead white men studied as the great actors of history, overshadowing the influence of broader socio-economic trends, let alone women and people of color (I couldn't help but feel like the weeks on Civil Rights and Aung San Suu Kyi were token throw-aways, compared to the central importance the faculty gave to figures like Clausewitz and Bismarck. Master Bradley is easily the best part of the course, and I could tell throughout the semester that she was pushing the institution in incredibly positive directions (her class on public health was a refreshing new look at the diversity of strategic thought, something rather obscured throughout the semester that focused pretty squarely on great statesmen) The perks are nice, though, and I can't complain about the free meals, lively workshops, interesting guests, and funding for summer travel.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of academic background. I believe this is a course that celebrates diverse perspectives, and is enriched by them. Moreover, I would argue that any student at Yale has something to learn from a course designed to engage an individual's ability to develop and execute a strategy to achieve some set objective.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a fellow student if they are interested in the study of war and statecraft. While the course (at least on paper) strives to create a framework through which strategies of all kinds can be analyzed and implemented, the overwhelming majority of texts and moments studied had to do with warfare. As someone who entered the course hoping to study a broader range of strategies, I was left somewhat disappointed by the course's curriculum.",
    "APPLY AND TAKE IT. Tbh the in class discussions have been pretty average either as a function of lack of student participation or the profs. But the readings are super interesting. the real reason to take it is all the out of class stuff. The dinners are AWESOME, solid food and you get to talk to really cool people. The workshops are pretty cool as well. And they give you money to do cool research over the summer. Additionally, you actually really get to know and make friends with the people in your class which is awesome.",
    "A fascinating class about how to apply strategy to all manner of situations. A great group of people - and funding for a summer project to boot!",
    "I would recommend Grand Strategy to any student of History or Political Science (or another related field), albeit with caution. The course demands more time than it may suggest. Attendance at many evening events is mandatory and not always directly applicable to the academic study that takes place in the classroom. Therefore, you should only apply to GS if you have the time to devote to it. That being said, if you do devote the time to it, the rewards are many. The benefit of the summer stipend goes without saying, the seminars are incredibly engaging and the nature of the course means texts you may have already studied are analyzed in a whole new way. There are flaws to the course, as with any survey course, in that it cannot be fully comprehensive in a short semester, but Professor Bradley has done her best to ensure the course covers a wide range of topics and isn't just an extension of DS. If you're lucky enough to be offered a place in Grand Strategy, I would urge you to take it, but only if you are sure that you'll be willing to give it the time it both requires and deserves.",
    "I would recommend; it's a history seminar with contemporary applications for the first semester, and your classmates are both knowledgeable and fun to discuss with. Really have enjoyed the course."
