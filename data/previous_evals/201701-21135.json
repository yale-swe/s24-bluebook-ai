   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is its intensive nature. You get the opportunity to speak Spanish for 2 hours each day which really helps the language come more naturally. You also get to combine L3 and L4.",
    "Strengths: you get really good at Spanish really quick Weaknesses: a lot of work, and it's largely busy work",
    "It would be great if the L3 portion of the semester was shortened as the L4 portion had a greater amount of new material to learn",
    "It's a lot of time in class, but you get a lot of practice, and you come out knowing a lot of Spanish. Nothing is really too focused on staged dialogues so you learn how to say whatever kind of stuff you would naturally want to say."

    "YES! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the language! Added bonus is that you get to get 2 language credits out the way together! L4 material is significantly harder but L3 can give you a nice buffer for when that challenge comes.",
    "If you're willing to put in the time and effort, this is a great way to get your language requirement out of the way and become conversational (if not quite fluent) in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend if you are truly interested in learning Spanish; not if you want to get the language requirement out of the way as quickly as possible. Two hours a day is a time commitment, and it will be best enjoyed and appreciated if you want to push yourself and go the extra mile.",
    "It's basically like high school Spanish. If you want to learn the language, this is a good way to do it. It's not fun or interesting, but you do come out with a skill"
