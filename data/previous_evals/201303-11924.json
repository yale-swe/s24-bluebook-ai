    "The vocab is infinitely more useful in an every-day setting than 110 and 120, but there still isn't enough emphasis on speaking and actual communication. Do it if you want to learn the language. Then go abroad if you want to be really proficient.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! You do learn a lot, and it brings you to a level that prepares you to begin taking a dialect.",
    "Take it with Youness!",
    "Yes I would provided they want to study a very demanding language",
    "This, like all of Arabic, is a difficult course. I took up by far the majority of my study time. Do not take it on a whim, but it does help you learn Arabic. If you can, I would recommend taking it credit\/d.",
    "This course is definitely a lot of work but Professor Elbousty is wonderful and you will definitely build your skills."
