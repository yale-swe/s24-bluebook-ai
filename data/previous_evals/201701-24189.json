    "The class's approach was highly interdisciplinary, drawing on novels, films, criticism, academic essays, gov't documents and more to provide access into the Vietnam War and the ways it has shaped American culture. I became much better at synthesizing extremely varied sources of information into a coherent picture of time period.",
    "I developed a keener eye towards analyzing historical questions through a literary lens. I thought this course did an excellent job of putting literature in discussion with the historical context to determine how that literature informed and shaped the historical narrative.",
    "I gained an understanding of how the Vietnam war was evaluated by the American public and also continues to be represented in popular movies\/literature. I was also able to think critically about the politics of representation.",
    "In this class, I learned a lot about the Vietnam War's effect on American culture, particularly through film, literature and journalism. This was the first class I took in college that required me to analyze movies, and I really enjoyed it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the syllabus from this course, particularly the films and novels incorporated alongside more traditional history texts. That being said, I think our particular class was a bit too small and too quiet to facilitate meaning discussions. There were often long, silent pauses after Professor Follansbee asked a question, which often kept any comments at a more surface-level. This went on all semester, and I wish our professor had decided to find a new way to structure our discussions so that our meetings weren't so flat or we didn't finish 20 minutes early. This was often especially surprising given just how much work we had for the class, which regularly involved an entire book and a movie, if not more.",
    "The syllabus for the course was great, although sometimes it was difficult to do all of it for one week (i.e., read a novel, watch a film, and read 50-100pp of criticism or academic work). Professor Follansbee was incredibly knowledgeable about the topic and provided useful context in which to understand the Vietnam War and its impact on American Culture. The biggest weakness of the course was that sometimes the discussion would feel like it was flagging. We had a lot of material to talk about, which gave us plenty of questions we could tackle, but often I felt like the discussion never really got too far beyond the surface of the works. Professor Follansbee was always very willing to step in and give her thoughts, but I think a few times we may have been better served by just having an awkward silence and forcing people to talk.",
    "This class sounds better than it really is. You usually have a film, book, and some other historical reading each week which is way too much. Discussions were weak (probably because nobody has time to do all those assignments for just one class) and I didn't learn much.",
    "I think this class could be improved if there were less readings assigned. There was so much assigned per week (a whole book, a whole movie, and additional readings) that almost no one could complete it all. Class discussion suffered as a result.",
    "I thought the reading list was absolutely superb. Class discussion could falter at times, but this is always, to some degree, a question of which students enroll in the class. I would have liked some additional focus on the history of the period, which might have aided in class discussion.",
    "This course is a great survey of how the Vietnam War colored American culture and has a great reading and watching list.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the vast amount of literature\/movies to which its students are exposed. However, in my opinion, the course suffers from the breadth of its assigned texts. I felt that because we were assigned so much reading\/viewing each week, students were often unprepared for class, to the detriment of class discussion. For this reason, I think the class could be benefited by less assigned reading. Furthermore, I felt the class lacked a general structure\/arc and I think its syllabus could be restructured to portray a bit more purpose.",
    "I think the syllabus was a little readings-heavy, but I enjoyed all of the readings. The biggest weakness, in my opinion, was stilted class discussion. I thought maybe if there were more people, or people spoke up more, we would have had more interesting and exciting conversations. But of course that's variable every semester."

   "comments": [
    "The reading list is a great, interdisciplinary look at the Vietnam War, and Professor Follansbee is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic. Sometimes the discussion felt like it was flagging but that might have just been a function of the people in my class.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The readings and films get monotonous and the assignments are poorly thought out.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a literature course on the Vietnam era. This course was not a history course (nor did it market itself as such), but it greatly improved my understanding of the cultural impact of the Vietnam War on America.",
    "Take this course if you enjoy reading or watching movies, because it requires a lot of both. The readings are interesting and the movies are what you expect from Vietnam movies of the 70s and 80s. Professor Follansbee is a great professor who really engages with the texts.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course to another student as I think, relative to other yale courses I've taken, I learned a bit less. I think that the class feels fragmented in many ways and oftentimes the reading felt inessential and extraneous. However, if the class' syllabus were revised, I might recommend it to someone as I do think Professor Follansbee is a very strong instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the Vietnam war era and are willing to spend a significant amount of time and energy doing the readings and watching the films. There are a lot of subtopics within \"the Vietnam War and American Culture\" but it could be frustrating\/limiting for some people to spend an entire semester studying one war."
