    "Yes, take the course. I feel that there are no other creative writing courses as great as this one. Although it is a lot of work and requires a lot of discipline to write every single day, it is truly rewarding and fun at the same time. I have not had any other undergraduate course as great as this one.",
    "I loved writing every day, and overall I think I grew so much and am so glad I took this class -- I don't regret it for anything. With that said, I'll say this: the lectures were not good. Deming has a goofy, loopy style that doesn't have any real direction. Lectures revealed nothing of substance about the process of writing. The guests weren't so great either; one spent her lecture talking about how \"metaphors are movement, metaphors are turning\" (all academic-speak with no real advice), and another even said really sexist things equating a translation to \"a woman: beautiful or faithful, but never both.\" If Deming is teaching again, take this class for the assignments, for the writing, for the chance to have your work read by a tutor, and for the chance to get to know yourself better. Don't say I didn't warn you about the lectures.",
    "Take it! As long as you're prepared to dedicate a couple hours to writing each day, your writing will improve so much.",
    "A great class for anyone interested in testing the limits of their dedication to writing and discovering daily what it is exactly that they really think.",
    "Take Daily Themes if the idea of getting random prompts everyday and finding out how you respond to them is appealing to you. You will not love all of the prompts - some weeks are much stronger than others - but if you look at this class as an opportunity for self-discovery through writing, it will be really rewarding.",
    "Great -- do it to improve your writing.",
    "Daily Themes is intense and rewarding, although I felt that this year did not live up to the expectations I had for it from reading previous year's reviews and talking to students who had taken the course in the past. You write a lot--somewhere between 1200 and 1500 words a week, and you will inherently become more capable and more disciplined from this fact alone. The kind of writing you'll do, though, may not be quite what you expect or want. This year's prompts were very hit or miss, which I think was largely a symptom of it being Deming's first year teaching the course and may be ironed out in the future, but still made this course less enjoyable and more tedious than I had hoped. Lectures are essentially useless (I say this having attended all but one) but the guest lectures are interesting and worth your time. You will also have a tutor, which for me was the best part of this class, hands down--not because my tutor was the greatest ever, but simply because I was forced every week to show someone else my writing and talk about it, which I was absolutely terrified of coming into the class. Take this class if you want to take it. It may not be the greatest course ever that some have promised, but it will be rewarding and valuable to your growth as a writer.",
    "Amazing. If you like to write, do it. If not, do NOT.",
    "lots of writing, but definitely worth it.",
    "An awesome class for practicing creative writing. You will get out of it whatever you put in. If you have a super busy workload, it's probably not a great semester to take it because you will want at least an hour, maybe two per night to write the themes.",
    "Great course to take Credit\/D. Really dependent on your tutor and if he\/she likes your writing style. Not much work.",
    "I thought the course was great in that it forced me to write every day. This helped me to hone my skills and just practice the art of writing. The prompts were also good in that they were diverse enough to explore all facets of writing and get a student out of his or her comfort zone. Sometimes though, the prompts did seem a tad obscure and constricting. Overall though, I feel as if my writing has improved from this course, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in writing.",
    "This was a delightful course. I loved the structure of writing in small bursts every single day, and the lectures were inspiring. Take it.",
    "Take it. Whether or not you want to pursue writing, this class really allows you to try out new things stylistically and become better acquainted with yourself as a writer. By writing and editing your work every day, you're essentially teaching yourself (with some help from your tutor). Deming is hilarious and insightful, and the class is only 75 minutes per week. The only downside was the guest lecturers, whose lectures paled in comparison to Deming's.",
    "take it!",
    "If you can possibly take this class, take it. Most of us will probably never again have the chance to do something so reflective and self-exploratory, and with such rigour.",
    "Daily Themes is a great class if you are a diligent student who can handle the commitment of having to write every day. It is obviously hard at first, but quickly gets much easier. I think that the main risk of Daily Themes is the writing tutor because so much of the course depends on the relationship between the writing tutor and the student. The lectures, at least with Professor Deming, were entertaining, but definitely not the bulk of the learning that goes on in the course. It is true that you will not produce a long or substantial piece, but it will make you a better, faster, and more creative writer.",
    "Daily Themes is pretty much what it sounds like--a daily (well, 5\/week) prompt that you write a response to, along with weekly lectures and meeting with a writing tutor. This is a great class for anyone who wants to narrow in on writing style& polishing, or who hasn't done much creative writing before and wants to try it out. Do be prepared for the daily commitment, though, which can sneak up on you!",
    "This is a great class! Richard Deming is 100% full of it, and the lectures are 80% a waste of your time, but the assignments are really well-designed- the pacing is just write.Getting a good tutor is really important, but they're randomly assigned and you can't swap. Most of them are great, though.Take it! It's a big time commitment, so expect that. Also, do credit\/D unless you already know you're a strong writer.",
    "No, I did not think the lecture was useful. I would recommend a workshop.",
    "A great class, if you can get in, but don't underestimate the time it will take. You end up writing 60 themes over the course of the semester\u00e2\u0080\u0094 not for the faint of heart! Still an incredibly worthwhile class, highly recommended.",
    "Definitely take this class. Maybe the best class I've taken at Yale. Forces you to actually write, and get way better at it and more comfortable with it. Deming is wonderful, as are the guest lecturers.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, but be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to it. One of the most important skills I gained from writing daily themes was an improved ability to just sit down and WRITE, even if I feel like I don't know what to say. This carried over to essays for my other classes as well. Some of the themes were fun and inspiring. Others were more of a challenge, but overall I'm very glad that I took this class.",
    "Daily Themes is incredible, if you put the necessary time into it, and if you really have the time that semester. I took five courses this semester, and I really wish that I had taken it during a semester where I had less on my plate, because I think that to get as much out of it as possible, it really demands that you spend a lot time thinking and writing - which is AWESOME. I could have definitely put more into it, but even having taken it with a lot of other things on my plate, I feel like the course prompted an immense amount of self-reflection. I feel like I am coming away from the course with many seeds of pieces that I hope I will be able to develop sometimein the future.I also think that Daily Themes has changed the way I personally think about writing and relate to writing -- before, writing was an assignment; now, recently, in these past couple of days where i haven't been required to write, i feel myself wanting to open up a blank work document and write. I also think that being a \"writer\" for a semester changes you, makes you more observant and more reflective in day to day life. Anyways, in conclusion -- incredible course, and you should take it and put time into it!",
    "If you have the opportunity to take daily themes, you should ABSOLUTELY do it! The course is admittedly a lot of work (writing every day, even only 300 words, is not easy) but it is so much fun. It may improve your writing or it may just get you into the habit of writing every day, but either way it's worth it! Also, no midterm or final, which is really nice. Just work hard consistently and it'll be really fun.",
    "Amazing!!! At first, I didn't like it, but I came to love it through the semester. Deming is an awesome lecturer, and you'll get a chance to devote yourself to writing every day. Although you probably won't get pieces you can publish, this class gives you a chance to test out different styles and voices to put some variety in your longer work.Also this class is a ton of work, but it's super nice having constant work instead of having a long paper or exam--it's great for a 5-class semester.Your experience will also depend substantially on your tutor--mine was the best!",
    "Daily Themes will, like any good course, change both the way you look at life and your very way of life. This course introduces you to seeing the world as a writer does, and by its end your writing and your perception will have changed dramatically and hopefully for the better. I cannot recommend this course more highly.",
    "Great course, so different from so many others. This is a great exercise in itself, and the tutors and teachers make it so much better. I came in hating writing and thinking I would suffer every day, but it was actually a great reflexive break, and sometimes pleasing!",
    "Sure! But you should be committed working on your writing - every. day. of. the. semester (well 5 out of 7 days a week for 12 out of 13 weeks in the semester...). I didn't always find lectures to be particularly useful, though.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to a student that wants to improve their writing but just be warned, this class is hard and takes up a lot of time. I wouldn't recommend this to a non-english major, like myself, unless they do some serious restructuring to allow those who want to better their writing but who weren't born the writing gene to still be able to do well in the course if they work hard.",
    "Take this class if you love words, and love to do things with words, and love the way words sound and look and feel. It's a pretty rigorous commitment--300 words a day, five days a week can become a little bit of a struggle, but it's so worth it in the end when you can look back on your themes and you have a catalogue, really, of an entire semester. Really, this class is nothing short of beautiful, and Professor Deming's lectures are pure poetry. Definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely. It's one of those classes you get what you put in. Not too difficult to do decently if you write well enough to get in, but if you work hard you could come out of it with really great writing. You also get to read a lot of work done by some of the best student writers at Yale--it's really good stuff. Deming's a fantastic lecturer, and he'll keep you entertained while making you think about writing and life in completely different ways.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Take this class. I became a much better writer over the course of this semester. It daunted me at first, but I'm glad to have done it. I know that the skill I have built will serve me for the rest of my life. I write slowly, and I found that I should budget one to one and a half hours for each theme (five days a week). I think other people spent less time than me. It seems like a lot of time, but there is never a wave of work to do, no final assessment, no reading. It may have taken more work, but it was much less stressful than other classes.",
    "Yes, but be aware that lectures aren't that helpful and that Deming has a body of students he already knows (or go to office hours to become part of his \"inner circle\") which he calls on to speak aloud. There is a participation grade, so this might factor in... The themes themselves are great, though some have specific instructions that take longer to complete than others. Get into them. Get enthusiastic about them and EXPERIMENT, take risks, and borrow styles from your favorite writers.From what I hear, tutors are really lax with deadlines, but if you try to stick to the midnight daily deadline, I think this is how your writing ultimately improves. Read the prompts on Monday night before the week begins and think of ideas throughout the week.",
    "This class is what it is--five 250 word things a week. This isn't really as much work as it seems since you really get into the habit of it. The theme length can be a little limiting, but overall that part of the class is great. The lectures were a little pointless, though; Deming felt more like an orator or a preacher than a lecturer. He was also very clearly more of a poet than a prose writer, which meant that some of the prompts were a little weird and post-modern. But the theme part of it is definitely worth sitting through the lectures.",
    "Yes--great to strengthen your writing.",
    "Don't be fooled; five 250-300 word themes a week gets really tough in the middle of the semester. I never really felt like I got much out of the lectures, even though Deming is a great and thoughtful speaker. The themes were difficult at times, but overall they were fun exercises that got me writing in various styles. I would recommend it to people who like small-scale creative writing.",
    "This class lives up to its reputation as a Yale legend. Don't hesitate for even a second to take it if Richard Deming is teaching it again -- he's phenomenal, and an order of magnitude of an improvement over Lanny Hammer. The \"Daily\" bit of the course title isn't kidding. There's a ton of writing, and sometimes it feels like writing your one page for the day is the hardest thing in the world. But you'll get through it, and you'll see it as one of your most impressive accomplishments at the end of the semester. The guest lecturers are, also, all really great, and a highlight of the class. Apply to it, regardless of how literary you see yourself, and take it if you get in. It was one of the better choices of my time at Yale.",
    "Very much so! Even just going through the exercise of writing every day (and having to stretch your brain around some prompts) is such an incredible experience, and the lectures are fun and truly meaningful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who enjoys writing. I've never enjoyed doing a class's work as much as I have for this class. I recommend it for all writers: beginners, advanced, science kids, English majors, psych students, everyone. Everyone except for, obviously, people who don't like to write.",
    "YES take Daily Themes it is a classic Yale course that everyone should take! Your writing is guaranteed to improve and you will learn a lot about yourself.",
    "You write a page a day. No matter if you're busy, or if you have a test the next day, or if you have absolutely nothing to do. 1 page. Every day.Let that sink in before you decide to take this class.Also, this class ENTIRELY depends on which tutor you get. Good tutor almost guarantees a good experience, and vice versa. The lecturer can and will be helpful at times, but won't make or break the course. (Unless he\/she makes terrible prompts on a consistent basis)",
    "daily themes is a wonderful undertaking. take it seriously and your writing and efficiency will improve dramatically. dailyness is difficult but entirely worthwhile.",
    "Daily Themes was a great opportunity to try out new things in your writing and experiment with fiction or nonfiction, or just generally get out of your comfort zone. Lecture was a bit pointless, but the meetings with your tutor are really informative and helpful, and you will really feel like you are producing a lot of work over the course of the semester. Take it!",
    "Practice writing every day with themes that may push your boundaries or let you live comfortably within them. It gives as much as you want to. Be warned that Daily Themes is what it is - you practice writing, not so much editing or developing longer pieces. Lectures may not necessarily teach you (understandably) the actual craft of writing. It's up to you to practice to distill meaning out of everything. Professor Deming's instruction is not everyone's style but definitely a highlight of the week if you like his humor.",
    "If you want to write a lot, every day, and be held accountable for it--take this class. Basically, even if you don't want to TAKE THIS CLASS (as long as you have time). I'm a biology major--this was my first English class at Yale--and it was one of the best choices I've made.",
    "Not only does this class make you wrote everyday, but that discipline made writing come so much quicker. Unlike Yale's workshop classes, it really fostered creativity. The lectures were kind of boring, but the writing practice and one-on-one tutoring made it worth it. Take note--its as much work as you make it. You can rush through each theme, but that will not be satisfying.",
    "If you're thinking about it, just do it. You'll never have another opportunity at Yale to write five days a week, much less about things ranging from ghost stories to profiles to being invited into someone's room and asking them about an object they own. If you put a good amount of work into the course (about 2 hours a theme), you will see your writing improve. I guarantee it. Deming is a good lecturer, and he obviously cares so much about this course. The one-on-one meetings with the tutors were extremely helpful, and I felt I built a really strong relationship with my tutor over the semester. Stretch yourself. Be challenged. Take this.",
    "If you are a writer, take this class. Especially if you are a writer who doesn't write enough. This class is a commitment-- one that will teach you a lot about your own writing and about what makes writing good in general.",
    "Yes, there is not a huge workload but you develop some great habits. It's a class that can never pile up on you.",
    "If you're excited about writing this much, take it. It is a ton, but it's invaluable if you use it properly. I took it Credit\/D in the end, and I think that helped me personally give the time to and take the chances I wouldn't have otherwise with my writing, which was important for me. Deming is great, if it's him again. Tutors vary, from what I hear, and while I think a great tutor can entirely change the course, if you do get assigned one you don't enjoy working with it doesn't mean the course is a bust. It's what you make of it.",
    "Writing every day will inevitably make you a better writer. If you're open to change then your voice will evolve and become stronger. I recommend it for a WR no question. It wasn't particularly taxing, but I got a lot out of the class.",
    "300 words every day, designed to help teach a number of skills specific to being a working writer.",
    "Very different from anything else I've taken at Yale, which felt like reason enough to take it. Writing every day is a challenging and pretty unique exercise, especially when you get this much freedom, and unlike other classes I've taken Daily Themes really lets you take ideas and run with them. That said, I never take English classes, so maybe they're all like that.Some of the tutors seem amazing and some are very problematic. Mine was one of the latter, and it really made a difference. Lectures are fun enough but sometimes feel perfunctory when the real work is in one-on-one sessions, and the quality of my one-on-one sessions was not what I'd expected from a class with this much of a reputation.Take it, though; especially with a good tutor, it's something special to do at Yale.",
    "A great course for writers; expect to get as much out of it as you put into it. You will be surprised to learn what you are capable of.",
    "Yes. You will become a better writer, and perhaps just as importantly you will find confidence in yourself as a writer.",
    "It's writing and it's daily. If you like writing\/want to improve your writing you should take it, and if you don't like writing, even more reason.",
    "Daily Themes is an amazing class! Take it take it take it!! Deming is a great professor, and the meetings with your tutor are very rewarding. The class is not an insignificant amount of work, but it's absolutely worth it!",
    "If you don't write often and want to get into the habit of writing, then sure. Not useful for those who have been in writing workshops before, though - the quality of that attention is just indisputably better.",
    "A great class for people wanting to start out with creative writing! Important to get a good TF as they are the ones you will develop a working relationship with and who will read your writing and give you feedback.",
    "a lot of work. Worth it if you want to do it",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IF YOU GET IN",
    "Great course. Your experience depends on your tutor, but regardless you will get to write a lot and it will be fun and you will get better. Its a lot of work but it doesn't feel like it because you just budget an hour for it every day.",
    "A daily rigorous practice in writing that allows for exploration of your writing skills",
    "TAKE IT!!!!!! EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AN ENGLISH MAJOR!",
    "Daily Themes is an ok class. It gets kind of boring by the end, even if you love writing. Try to get a tutor that you work well with, because that'll make or break the experience. Also, writing every day is a surprising amount of work. I don't really feel like I became a better writer, but I did get exposure to new styles.",
    "I wrote, rather, semi-daily themes, but even those did well to broaden my writing horizons. Take the course if you're serious about exercising your writing muscles!"
