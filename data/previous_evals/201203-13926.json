   "comments": [
    "I would summarize History of Art 700 01 as a course well suited for both artists and art historians. In the course, we explored the roll of painting in 20th century art production, examining it in relation to theoretical, aesthetic, social, and art historical issues. We looked at the way in which painting can be a productive format for viewing, and how it embodies issues fundamental to human experience.I would recommend this course to another student. In David's class, one learns to engage with painting both visually and conceptually, and to understand it from different perspectives.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in painting or history.",
    "Definitely recommended, even for students outside the History of Art department.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to others. Prof. Joselit is a generous and supportive professor, and really makes painting seem as important to modern culture as I've always suspected it to be.",
    "This seminar offers students a chance to read a variety of theoretical texts addressing a range of interrelated issues played out in and taken up by the practice of 20th century painting. While the assigned readings are largely art theory, in-class discussions rely on analysis and consideration of artworks and art objects.I would highly recommend the course to other students, with the caveat that it is very theory based rather than focusing on cultural context or historical trajectories.",
    "HSAR 700 introduces several important issues relevant to 20th century painting, but should not be considered a survey course of the period or even a historiography course. It would be recommended for any student wanting to learn about a handful of concepts without a broad historical background.",
    "I would absolutely recommend 700 01 to another student, particularly a student interested in painting. It is not a survey course, but moves more or less chronologically from early 20th. modernism into the latter part of the century. The theories around various movements and painters are discussed with rigor, but many view points are covered. Many of the readings have a structuralist bent, but that's not the rule. I would take this course again.",
    "Great preparation for orals."

   "comments": [
    "The class gave me a new understanding of how art historians look at and think about painting. It was a terrific experience to see and talk about works of art in person with David and fellow students.",
    "This course allowed me to explore some issues from outside my immediate area of focus -- which I hope will allow me to broaden the focus of my dissertation research.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of several theoretical concepts relevant to 20th century paining that could be useful for my own research, but did not contribute much to my historical knowledge.",
    "This course opened up many avenues for me in terms of the history and theory of painting. The topics covered were not new to me, per se, but the various angles we used to approach them and the depth of meaning we attempted in the discussion surpassed any previous courses I've had in painting."
