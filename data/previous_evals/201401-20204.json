   "comments": [
    "A course of the major works of Hitchcock, focusing on his themes that spanned his career. I would strongly recommend this course if you're interested in Hitchcock or film studies. It was well taught, fun, and interesting.",
    "If you like Alfred Hitchcock movies, this is certainly the class for you. Only two papers, although depending on your topic, the final paper can take a very large amount of time. The screenings are optional, and the readings are rarely mentioned, but of course your experience will be greatly enriched by doing them and seeing some of these classic films in 35mm. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about these classic Hollywood films.",
    "FILM 411 is an exploration through some of Hitchcock's greatest films. Every week, the students watch a different film and discuss it during the following class. The professor guides us through important clips from each film and assists us in analyzing them. I would definitely recommend this course to a student that is interested in taking a film class or seeing the films of Hitchcock.",
    "I would summarize the class as watching a lot of movies and then realizing that you were missing so many crucial hidden elements all along. Overall, a very thought-provoking course, without being strenuous. Every week we watch a new movie, and the grade was based off of two essays. I would recommend the class if you like Hitchcock films.",
    "ALL the hitchcock, level of class discussions really vary by year",
    "Professor Peucker is a fantastic teacher. The class is well structured and you definitely learn to understand Hitchcock through a unique perspective.",
    "YES! Definitely take it. It was my first film studies class and I loved it. You'll never see another film the same way again after taking this class. You'll begin the subtle references in a lot of films. The work load is very manageable. Also, Prof. Peucker was great and truly cared for the students. Her knowledge on Hitchcock was unparalleled. She always brought light on the most subtle of references which was very instructive.",
    "It's a fun humanities class with not much work.",
    "Definitely take this class. You will get to see a ton of great films and will learn so much about Hitchcock."
