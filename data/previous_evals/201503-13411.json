   "comments": [
    "One of my favorite classes so far! I learned so much and I never wanted class to be over. The 2 hours flew by even though it was in the 1-3pm time slot which usually means Im not even really conscious for class. Its structured really well. I love that we got to investigate our own stigmas of interest over the entire semester. I only wish we got grades back for presentations and debates in a more standardized and smooth way. Also, the debate topics were hard to understand from the way they were phrased, and I did not like the peer grading aspect. I did not think that was useful.",
    "I really am confused at the number of concepts covered in this class - it seemed like a lot of things were unnecessarily examined through a very academic lens, when they were just common sense. I'm unsure why this is a semester long class, as I could summarize the class in a few sentences.",
    "Very repetitive, mostly theory based.",
    "I really loved this course. Before taking the course I had a very vague notion of what stigma was, but after taking this course I have gained substantial knowledge on the subject. I appreciated the weekly assignments, as they were very helpful when thinking about the final paper. Lectures were also engaging, with debates and discussions on news articles. My only suggestion would be to eliminate the \"two minute\" presentations next year. Most presentations went over and they were not very engaging. I think having the presentation at the end is sufficient for hearing about everyone's chosen stigma.",
    "covers an important and interesting topic, but spent too much time talking about just the theory. It would have been more interesting to have the Professor and Teaching Fellow speak more about their personal research (maybe dedicate one lecture to both of their research). Also there should have been a greater emphasis on interventions and successes\/failure with the interventions. I don't feel like I left the course equipped with tools just theory and feeling somewhat paralyzed. they also shouldn't require that all weekly readings be included in the weekly assignment write up, seems forced to include articles that may not be directly related",
    "Excellent course - instead of dedicating each class to a stigmatized identity, this course allows students to pursue the issues they're passionate about while studying overarching themes.",
    "Stigma and Health was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at YSPH. The strengths of the course are endless, and it really gives students a solid foundation of theory coupled with real-life practicalities. In terms of weaknesses, I will say that the memoir assignments seemed \"fluffy\" to me and I really didn't get that much out of that. However, that could be because my memoir wasn't great, as I noticed a lot of other students bringing up points from their memoirs in class.",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to stigma and health. Although this course was a lot more work than some of my other courses, I feel that I learned more in this course than any other. The variation in learning activities, from debates to relevant news to presentations, helped to reinforce the material learned from the readings. The only suggestion I have is to incorporate more time for discussion as I love hearing from my fellow students as well.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. It provided an in-depth overview of stigma and its impacts on the health of individuals in marginalized communities. The course provided many opportunities to engage with texts on the topic, learn via lecture, and have quality discussions in the classroom. I really enjoyed the different teaching styles that allowed us to learn about the material.",
    "This was an awesome course. The format was great in my opinion, and I love the course allows students to follow stigmas that are interesting to them throughout while applying things learned in class to said stigmas along the way. This was one of my favorite classes this semester.",
    "Overall, this was an excellent class. One of the strengths was John's willingness to allow discussions to develop organically regarding current events and student interests. One of the weaknesses was the expectation that the weekly paper would function as a reading analysis as well as a contribution to our final paper --since some weeks none of the readings were especially relevant to our specific stigma. The 15-20 page paper at the end of the semester is a lot of work, though the weekly papers did help, it would have been better not to have 2 of the weeks devoted to writing about our memoir since that didn't help us work towards our paper. One way to improve the course would be to lighten the workload a little bit, in addition to weekly papers there are also periodic debates and presentations. While I enjoyed my memoir, I don't think it was incorporated well into the rest of the course. The syllabus said we would be sharing excerpts with the class but we didn't do that--I think that would have been interesting.",
    "This is an essential class for all Yale MPH students.",
    "This class was phenomenal and probably the most important course I have taken so far at YSPH. I think it needs to intensely integrated into the SBS requirement for other departments. It would be important to go over safe space rules at the beginning of class. We talk about sensitive topics and in this class in particular it was very hard to listen to others talk about \"my\" stigma",
    "Absolutely loved the class and learned so much!",
    "Strengths: super engaging, excellent layout of material, thoughtful assignments and discussions Areas of improvement: material can sometimes be obtuse: maybe anchor it each week in a particular stigma that is a bit off the beaten track?",
    "This is among the best courses at YSPH. John has obviously put a lot of thought into its structure; it flows well from topic to topic and covers a broad range of issues.",
    "The weekly writing assignments were structured as such that we would write a paper and submit that on Monday, and then that Wednesday would discuss the topics in class. Since many of the concepts were new to me, I would have found it a bit more helpful to discuss the topics in class prior to writing the paper(s). However, other than that, I felt the content of the course was great, and really appreciated the fact that John allowed us to choose what stigma we wanted to research for the semester as opposed to making that choice for us."

    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0It was such a joy to hear him lecture every week. He is so knowledgeable and really passionate about this, so it was cool to learn from him. I also really liked the dynamic between him and the class. It felt like we were all in it together rather than ascribing to a hierarchy, which I really appreciated. The class felt so comfortable contributing that once we started a discussion we could rarely be stopped in any kind of timely fashion.",

    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is a great instructor. He is extremely knowledgeable regarding this topic and is able to share seminal research studies and answer questions students have. It's interesting to watch him lecture and answer questions --he seems sometimes like he is scanning an encyclopedia in his brain and always seems able to produce an insightful answer. I appreciated his flexibility in terms of a daily agenda. If discussions took longer than usual he allowed that to happen.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Go ahead Dr. Pachankis!",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is wonderful at listening to students and allowing the conversation to take its natural direction. I loved class the most when he let this happen. Sometimes he was confusing but it is a difficult topic. He was great for 1 on 1 help.",

   "comments": [
    "This class should be a required course. The idea that stigma is a fundamental cause of health outcomes has changed the way I see medicine and society. Its so necessary and the class is a hidden gem.",
    "This is one of the only class that I truly enjoyed during my first semester at Yale.",
    "I know that some people loved the class, but I didn't connect to the material. It seemed that we only talked about frameworks that got repetitive very fast. I think the course should be designed in a case study manner, where you analyze a situation where stigma was present, what measures could have been taken, etc.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Stigma connects with many of the topics that individuals are interested in and is critical to look at when thinking about health outcomes.",
    "important topic related to public health, but feels very theoretical. expect weekly writing assignments which take 2-3 hours to do reading and write the paper",
    "Essential if you are in SBS - it really broadens your view of health and is extremely critical. Its one of the only spaces in YSPH where you can talk in a very real way about important issues of race\/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc.",
    "Take Stigma and Health! Worthwhile course that is grounded in theory.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. This course provides a great overview of stigma and goes into great detail on how stigma affects health. Although there is a lot of work outside of class, you will learn so much from this class and it will help you in any future career you may have.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provides a great overview of addressing the health concerns of stigmatized communities and how to create interventions as public health professionals for individuals with these stigmas.",
    "Very cool class, take it!!",
    "Take this course if you are interested in stigma! At the beginning of the semester you select a particular stigma that is of interest to you and you focus on it throughout the semester. There are weekly readings and papers. The final is a comprehensive review of your particular stigma. Keep in mind that this is a work-heavy course so it may fit best during a semester when you don't have other work-heavy courses or other classes with long final papers.",
    "This should be a required course.",
    "This must be integrated somehow into a required course, ESPECIALLY for non SBS.",
    "It was superb!",
    "An essential class for understanding the root causes of health inequalities. A lot of work but all worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend it to students who are interested in social justice and social change. As a non-CDE student I still felt very comfortable in the class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. John's class was my favorite course I took this semester, and I truly believe that this should be a required course for every MPH candidate."
