    "If you want to know how to write for The New Yorker, slate.com, etc, then this is the class for you. It is an excellent writing class that will help you refine your writing skills for the creative non-fiction genre. If you are thinking about or wanting to be published as an undergrad in any Yale publication, then take this class. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, and I would also highly recommend taking this course with Pam Newton.",
    "Its a good course! Not only a good way to get a WR, I think it really improved my writing, which is what I wanted. Great learning to work ratio. This was a course that I looked forward to because it broke up my kill-me-now CS lectures with some fun readings and discussions that were rewarding without too much trouble. It was also nice to get to know some classmates through pretty open discussion. Not much extraneous or wasted work--though I understand that varies by section. If you have the opportunity to take it with Pamela Newton, def go for it. You won't regret it.",
    "ENGL 120 is a solid writing course and teaches students how to write good nonfiction, not just good writing in general. It achieves what it set out to do.",
    "English 120 should be everyone-who's-fed-up-with-writing-analytical-paper's go to class. It's a really refreshing break from most high school curriculums. The course material could not be better. The authors are both widely known and never heard of, but all are great writers who will teach you something about non-fiction. If you want to learn *how* to write, and to be judged not on what you write about but on how well you say it, this is the class for you. The essays each require you to imitate a certain non-fiction style, like a personal essay, a profile piece, or a humor piece\/social critique. Writing them is challenging but ultimately rewarding. Also the group of teachers is one of the best for any introductory class."
