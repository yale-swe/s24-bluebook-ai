    "The last few classes weren't really helpful because it wasn't that useful to watch the instructor program on the dome for an hour. I thought the demonstrations were more useful in the first half of the class when we were learning how to use the software like ATM, Layered Earth, and Starry Night.",
    "This course really should be a full credit course. For the amount of time that students spend doing the assignments, this course is less akin to lab and more akin to a seminar that meets once a week. The material is really interesting especially if you take the time to think about the projects that you're doing. At the same time, dome projects are very time consuming and it's difficult to justify spending 20 hours on a project when it's only a half credit course.",
    "Cool class and a great chance to check out the planetarium. No astro background necessary at all.",
    "I like that we were given the opportunity to do what we find engaging in this course. It's not often that you get that opportunity."

    "This is very light workload course, but you only get 0.5 credit anyway. It's really fun to zoom around space on the giant dome screen, but the hike up to the observatory might not be worth it for you. Most projects were very simple and short except for the two larger projects, especially the ATM-4 narration project because ATM can be finicky and it's difficult to get the timing exactly right. You're basically just learning how to use certain software that projects space\/earth-related things onto the dome, like Layered Earth and Starry Night. There was a little bit of programming required for the last two projects, but you don't really need CS experience to do it. If you're looking for a 0.5 credit and don't mind walking up science hill, it's an easy and interesting class.",
    "If you have any interest in digital media or astronomy. Go for it. It is incredible and creative and just an overall blast. 10\/10 would take again and again.",
    "Yes - absolutely take this course. The only concern should be the half credit versus the full credit. Don't be fooled - this is definitely a full credit's worth of work especially if you want to do it right.",
    "Take it! Cool and fun class and a good chance to get into your final project (if you want). I took it with no Astro background at all--it's definitely not needed.",
    "Yes - it's interesting and fun !"
