   "comments": [
    "I'm left with a knowledge of what was going on in the American art scene in mostly the first half of the 1900s. I also have a better handle on what art-people see and think when they look at a piece.",
    "I had never taken an art history course before, so basically everything I learned was new! I really feel like I have a grasp on American art of the twentieth century now. I have already started to get a lot more references than I once did. I am super excited to revisit the MoMA this winter so that I can show my family around!",
    "I learned to engage with modern art in a new way.",
    "Profound appreciation of 20th century American art",
    "I came away with a really comprehensive understanding of American Art from the 20th century and how it changed over time. I gained a lot of confidence from the writing assignments and section in the gallery and learned how to read and think about secondary sources in art history.",
    "Broad coverage of modernism in America, starting with the rise of photography in very early 1900s throughout different movements in the 1970s.",
    "I learned about close analysis of artwork, how to perform a visual analysis, and how to think critically about musuems\/exhibits. I gained a more nuanced\/accurate\/holistic view of modern American art (contributions of women, people of color, immigrants, sexual minorities, etc.).",
    "I learned about the history of modern art through looking at the art but also the context of the time period and the artist's background.",
    "This course was a fascinating introduction of modern art in America. I learned not only about different artists and works but also how to engage with art, ask critical questions, and analyze using visual evidence.",
    "This class did an excellent job of introducing both iconic pieces of American art and rarer objects. I was impressed by the cohesion with which the objects were presented, so ideas from early classes were carried through. This was made especially apparent in slides that visually juxtaposed older with newer materials. (Overall, I found the visual juxtapositions set up in lectures some of the more innovative and compelling of those in history of art courses Ive taken at Yale!) One of the best examples of such cohesion between classes was the course devoted to utilitarian objects in which they were discussed using the same vocabulary as that used to speak about contemporaneous art. I really appreciated section in the Gallery, something possible only because lectures and sections were devoted to distinct objects, meaning I was looking at a separate body of material in both. Thank you for your decision to leave Gallery objects primarily out of class discussion allowing for a fresh encounter in section.",
    "Helped me look closely, articulate what is visible and extrapolate meaning",
    "Art history and related American history post 1900's. Critical thinking and visual analysis skills have also been improved.",
    "Modern Amercian art history knowledge and visual art analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Memorize 60-120 work titles + artist + date for exams. Then the memorized info counts for like 5% of exam grades while on-the-spot, in-depth analysis comprises the other 95%. 95% of study time, however, is spent pointlessly memorizing a bunch of artworks that you'll forget over Christmas break. Furthermore, lectures have almost nothing to do with exams or the essay assignments. You just listen to TAs and the professor read far too much into paintings that arguably have very little substance. I'm not sold on modernist art whatsoever after this class. Grading also seems pretty abstract. The professor might be a genius, though, and has an insanely impressive vocabulary and a real passion for the topic.",
    "This was an amazing course - I learned so much. I had never studied art history before, and I gained so much from this lecture. Prof. Raab is a wonderful lecturer - super engaging. Also, the class is very well-organized, so if you keep up with the material and put effort into the assignments, you can be sure to do well. I honestly can't think of something to improve.",
    "The lectures are extremely engaging, and I learned a lot about how to talk about abstract art.",
    "Sections at the YUAG were very interesting Not enough discussions about the reading",
    "The entire course was really excellent and there isn't that much I would change. Lectures, sections, assignments were all great. If I'm being picky, I feel like people weren't that encouraged to read the secondary sources as they weren't really discussed much in lecture or section and it was easy to fall behind.",
    "It was really great to talk about different art movements and then discuss them with the art objects in the YUAG. Really interesting art movements and artists were discussed.",
    "Strength: lectures were amazing!! Also enjoyed readings, section, and loved the visual analysis paper! Weaknesses: felt a little overwhelmed by the final paper\/not quite sure what was expected of me (but the guidance from my TA was really helpful!)",
    "It was a very good lecture course.",
    "Although the process of selecting objects was an exciting part for the final project, I missed the opportunity to engage in deeper research. Eight objects was too many to really dive into a single one, and the restriction of twelve pages was far too short to handle any one to its full potential. I would propose revising the project guidelines to feature fewer objects or a longer length. The greatest downside of the course was that it ended mid-semester, without a conclusion, which left many threads open and which, I ultimately feel, decreased my overall understanding of earlier movements as well as the later ones that remained uncovered. Of course, the circumstances certainly precluded Professor Raab from teaching! But I do wish greater measures had been taken by the History of Art Department to make up for the missed lectures, either in reading suggestions or guest lectures. Although I have taken a course on modern art in America, I really cant claim a complete understanding of the subject. Not having class in the final weeks did shed light on the fact that, while the readings were in general compelling and well argued, their selection did not endow a general understanding of a period or movement. Without lecture as context, or another form of contextualization, they were a challenge. Another amendment to the course I would propose is the inclusion of a broader reading on the movement for each week, not exclusively on niche subjects or artists. Lastly, the Ashcan school flew by in shopping period; Im not sure I was even in class for a lecture on the paintings. While this is not a critique of presenting the Ashcan school at the start of the course, I think the pieces would have offered a interesting points of comparison with some of the later modernist works we viewed, but our discussion of the work was never really revived.",
    "The slides could incorporate some key points for each art work rather than just the pictures",
    "Strengths: well-selected reading lists and discussion sessions Weakness: it requires certain level of visual art analysis basic knowledge, which is not clearly highlighted in the syllabus",
    "This course has no weakness!",
    "The material of the course is very interesting. I haven't taken any other art history courses, so I don't know what the standard syllabus looks like. That said, I enjoyed the experience of designing an exhibit much more than I thought I would, though thought that ten pages on 8 works was far too little. I also thought that the final exam could have challenged our thinking a little more, given that it followed the same template as the midterm. That said, I really enjoyed the course and the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it only if you're really, really into art. Like majoring in it. Or take it Credit\/D for fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I am a senior who has never taken an art history course before, but this is definitely one of the best lectures I have taken at Yale. Prof. Raab is such an engaging lecturer, and the readings for class are very relevant. The course was also extremely organized - it was helpful to get sheets with important terms on them. Definitely take this!",
    "Definitely take this class! The materials are extremely interesting and you learn a lot, not just about art, but about 20th century America.",
    "Absolutely, would recommend it to all majors interested in art",
    "I would really recommend HSAR 211 to any student, regardless of whether this is your first art history course or whether you have experience in the area. Super fascinating subject matter, amazing lectures, wonderful weekly section in the YUAG, and thoughtful assignments.",
    "yes",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Great, fascinating overview on American art in the 20th century",
    "An amazing course! Professor Raab is a brilliant and exciting lecturer, having section in the art gallery was lots of fun, and the material is fascinating.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but I would say that students who have already taken at least one art history course would get more out of this one. This course assumes a level of exposure to art that is difficult to match having never taken art history, but it is definitely possible to catch up. The material is so fascinating, and both lecture and section were equally engaging, so I would recommend this course regardless of previous experience.",
    "This is an exciting topic with a lot of diversity in the artwork. The lectures were so engaging, beautifully composed, and with exciting visual comparisons. Given that sections are in the Gallery, and the Gallery has a great collection of modern American art, this is the art history lecture to take!",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "A very good course for people insterested in modern art.",
    "This course is rad! Professor Raab is just an incredible lecturer and I would oftentimes be too absorbed with listening to take good notes (whoops). The course covers a bunch of different movements going on in the 20th century and as a result it can be hard to understand how they all fit together, but it all makes sense in the end and I think that jumping around from lecture to lecture keeps things engaging. Section in the art gallery is a highlight, YUAG has a lot of modern American art to talk about. I'd recommend this to majors and non-majors alike.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. Professor Raab is a great lecturer and the material is very interesting."
