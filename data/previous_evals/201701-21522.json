    "This course really opened my mind to different cultures that I have never been exposed to in my other classes. It has given me new insight into music and has shown me that what sounds beautiful to my ear isn't universal, so much as cultural.",
    "I learned not only how to play gamelan but also how to appreciate the cultural history behind it.",
    "Learned how to play some songs on the gamelan. Also learned about its significance in Javanese culture."

   "comments": [
    "This class is really wonderful because it is a nice break from the heavy academia you often face in other classes. Playing gamelan for a couple hours a week is a great stress reliever. It also is an awesome class because it teaches you about south East Asian culture, a culture not often taught about in our usual classes. It really expanded my mind, and I liked this dual aspect of having academic texts and actually playing music.",
    "Great course that exceeded my expectations for what I would learn. Nice and easy for anyone who wants exposure to a Yale music course.",
    "The Professor went overboard on this class. Ridiculous expectations and lacks an understanding of students desire to take the course. Lied about requirements of the class. Changed the culture of the class. Made up information about indonesia. Overall, very poor class. 60 pages of reading and 30 minutes of listening plus 2 responses a week. Random singing assignment during spring break, something that was never discussed until an email randomly sent during break. Final and midterm both lacked constructive reasoning for the assignment. Final was literally just having her students trying to pitch why gamelan should still be a class, which will probably be used to ask the department to keep the class. Maho was the weakness. The culture and music was the strength.",
    "I really felt like the course was a good balance of music and readings. Some students seemed unengaged in the discussion but I think that was because most were second-semester seniors."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other Yale students. In fact, I already have! It is such a unique experience and provides amazing balance in your day.",
    "Absolutely, especially for anyone remotely interested in Javanese history.",
    "Without Maho, yes. With her, be careful.",
    "Certainly! You don't get to actually play music (or otherwise engage up-front) with most classes relating to culture.",
    "I didn't know what gamelan was before this and then I got to spend an entire semester learning it for a credit. I think that's pretty cool. Grades-wise, it is very straightforward. The expectations are clear on both the homework (2 weekly assignments) and the take-home midterm exam. It's easy to do well if you put in the work. Attendance in class is mandatory and sometimes I found myself dreading going but once I got there, knew it would be enjoyable and pass quickly. A great senior spring class, but not necessarily a gut. If you're looking for a class with NO work, this isn't it. But it is a great chance to try something new. Take it with a friend."
