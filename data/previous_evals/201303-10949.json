    "Take this class with Strebeigh if you can. It begins slowly, but stick with it because by the end, I really enjoyed it. If you aren't really sure you're into writing, but want to try, take it Credit\/D\/Fail, because you can always change it halfway through the course. Strebeigh is fantastic, but not for everyone, and the fast pace of his class can be intimidating\/anxiety-provoking at times. The best part of this class is being able to see your writing improving from essay to essay.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class. I learned how to be a better writer through the development of more significant and meaningful argument.",
    "I would recommend it if you are truly ready to write on a high level. I thought I was coming out of high school, but I was not as prepared as I had thought.",
    "A truly amazing class. It's amazing how much you learn in such a short period of time. Professor Strebeigh is challenging, but the class itself is duly rewarding. I highly recommend it to all who seek to improve their writing skills. I think it has imparted skills that I will use for the rest of my life. Take it, take it, take it.",
    "Take 120!!! I decided to sign up for it last minute on a whim and am SO glad. It was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken. It will make you a million times a better writer and student. Through this class I found a community and a group of friends that I wouldn't have otherwise. The class is as much work as you want to make it. The first few weeks are definitely a lot of writing and revising, but by the end of the semester it slows down. Strebeigh is amazing. Hands down the best teacher I've ever had in my entire life. Aside from being genuinely brilliant, he's such a fun and interesting person. He pushes his students to think and perform on a much higher level, and created a fantastic community within the classroom. One word of advice: use the writing tutors\/partners! I learned this late, and wish I had utilized them earlier. They will make this class all the more rewarding.",
    "What a phenomenal course. The premise is brilliant, incorporating rigorous, engaging and frankly beautiful group analysis of powerful modern writing into the process of crafting our own pieces. My writing has improved in ways that I can point to in my essays. The readings are very interesting and diverse, and the essay topics are guided but broad. I am so happy that I have five strong essays to add to my portfolio from this class, and I really learned so much about writing and analyzing literature. Truly a wonderful course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 fun, challenging, and powerfully educational.I had Professor Strebeigh, and he's incredible. His lecture style is unique \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he has made an art out of guiding seminar discussion. He knows exactly what he wants to teach us, but he probes us to say it ourselves. It is almost as if he would prefer not to talk at all the entire class time, but he never lets lulls creep over the class and he meticulously guides the discussion in interesting and productive directions. He tries to give everyone the impetus to comment, and he has specific phrases that communicate his feelings about a given comment, but always in a way that encourages and rewards the commenter (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neat\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a very insightful comment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeat\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a mediocre comment that made sense but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t groundbreaking). I learned so much from him about analysis and writing. If a virtuoso art critic can find fundamental truths and beauty and stories in a work of art, Prof. Strebeigh can find all that and more inwriting. And he will show you how to see them. And give you suspiciously simple formulas for putting them into your own writing. He always seems kind of rushed and hugely energetic, which is fun in class, but it was hard to have a deep conversation with him because he always seemed so busy and running from place to place. He did wonders for my writing, giving really directed and detailed comments on my essays, as well as great direction for how to improve in general through class discussion of techniques. He was also very kind about it, generous in giving positive feedback and getting excited about student writing.Only potential conflict: he has a very specific style. Some complain that he creates meaning in pieces that the authors did not originally intend. If you think this is cool, you'll be fine. If this idea annoys you, be careful. He also wants very specific things in your writing, especially on specific essay assignments (for example, for one essay he requested that we use a lot of snaps, catch phrases and unexpected additions to the piece; in another, he wanted us to have returns, where ideas or objects introduced earlier in the piece showed up later in a way that deepened some idea in the essay).",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120, especially with Professor Strebeigh. I don't think I've ever learned so much in a semester.",
    "Any student who wants to improve their writing, learn to think about writing in a totally new way, and read some entertaining creative non-fiction should take English 120. The workload is completely manageable, Strebeigh is totally reasonable and consistent with his expectations and deadlines, and the payoff is great.",
    "This is a great course, especially with Professor Strebeigh. I learned things that inform the way I write and read all genres, not just essays. I took it my first semester as a freshman, and I would recommend it to someone in that situation who is looking for a small, discussion based class and who enjoys writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you will love it. If you get Professor Stebeigh, TAKE IT."
