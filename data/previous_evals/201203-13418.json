   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to a student who likes to think analytically about philosophical concepts.",
    "Yes hugely reccomend it because not only does it help your writing abilities, it also gives you new things to apply to your developing understanding of yourself.",
    "I would recommend this course or some type of English\/writing course sometime during freshman year. Even though the theme of our section (authenticity) was a little too dense and abstract for me, I enjoyed all of the readings and I think my academic writing has definitely improved over the semester. The small class environment and close relationship with the professor was also nice. However, be prepared to put in the time!",
    "If you are looking for a basic essay-writing and discussion class, this is not a bad one to take. Authenticity is an unwieldy topic, and I kind of felt that the abstraction of it hindered our discussions. However, especially for freshmen who want to get set up to write well, this is a good way to begin that.",
    "The class really surprised me in that it was very good. I came into the class not knowing what to expect; the title \"authenticity\" is a fairly broad one. The class consists of reading authors from Thoreau to Lincoln and then analyzing their authenticity (the class discussions are very fun and insightful). The class is not too reading heavy, maybe about 50 pages a week (at most, some weeks much less) so the work is very manageable. There are 4 papers that you have to write and they all, in one way or another, center around evaluating the authenticity of a certain subject. This means that the papers are more philosophically based so a definite change from most English classes. The professor is very good and helpful, gives great constructive criticism. I would definitely recommend this class, the professor will make you a better writer. And if your main concern for not taking an english class is the grading system, this class has a very fair one. If you deserve the A you'll get it",
    "It's a lot of work and the essays take a lot of time but the topic is interesting.",
    "The class takes on a journey to look at the concept of authenticity throughout American history, from its founding, to its classic literature, to today's presidential candidate debates. Visiting all these sources converges to developing our personal definition of authenticity, or what we take authenticity to mean. I would recommend this class because it interestingly sees the changes in the American society through the lens of a controversial concept of authenticity.",
    "I would recommend it because it really teaches you how to write a college paper properly.",
    "Standard intro class--4 papers, decent amount of reading. good to solidify some basic writing techniques.",
    "a lot of writing",
    "This class took a while to get used to but I attribute part of that to the transition from high school writing to college style writing. The topic of Authenticity can be very subjective at times but this made discussion and research all the more interesting. Not my favorite class but definitely one that I enjoyed in the end.",
    "Yes. helps improve your writing , though essays require a quick turn over."
