    "Critical assessment of black urban life",
    "One of the greatest takeaways concerned basic sociological method: some of the best analyses are produced from synthesizing primary source accounts and demographic data. The course really provided thought-provoking insights on black American family structure as a result of a historical evolution spanning the entire 20th century.",
    "This course equipped me with general understandings of African Americans' narrative in America, and I learned the currently held ideas of why Black people have higher rates of joblessness and single-parent households in comparison to white people. I also learned about Professor Jaynes' contrasting perspective through reading his manuscript."

    "I would recommend this course to a student who is specifically interested in African Americans' position in American society today and understanding the roots of this position. It is a very specific topic, so I would only recommend to someone who has interest in the question the course intends to answer."
