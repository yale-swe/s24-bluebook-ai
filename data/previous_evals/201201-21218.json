   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic! It brings together a good group of leaders from different organizations on campus with a fantastic professor.",
    "Depending on the interests of the student, yes. However, after taking this class I am unsure how much I believe in theories of Leadership or think there is any quantitative way to express the ability to lead.",
    "Yes. Important themes, great professor, strong seminar discussions, just be prepared to read because you want to and not because you have to.",
    "Chill class, though sometimes frustrating that you fee llike ayou aren't learning much and just having cyclical conversations about wwhat you think good leadership is.",
    "I'd recommend this course. Great professor, and good opportunities outside of class. Very interesting readings.",
    "The course was a great introduction into political leadership and bureaucratic systems. Recommended if you are interested in studying leaders though an interdisciplinary perspective.",
    "If you can get into a more rigorous seminar, I'd say take that. (Of course, a key indication of a course's rigorousness is it's competitiveness to get in, unfortunately--but think about it--if a course is more competitive, then you're learning from only the very best students, which can only help your education.)",
    "I would not recommend this class barring a shift in the syllabus from secondary sources to more primary sources. The class as it was taught this time around revolved around some analytical-historical analyses from scholars about what great leadership is. It would have been more enjoyable and illuminating if more original writings from great leaders had been assigned.",
    "Yes, it focuses on the study of leadership (particularly political and democratic in nature) from an academic lens."
