   "comments": [
    "If you have received a 4 or 5 on the AP French Lang exam, French 150 will be an appropriate level course for you. The grammar and vocabulary are not too difficult to learn if you do the work, which honestly isn't that heavy of a load. There are a few essays but the topics aren't too complex and the grading is quite fair. If you enjoy literature and films as well this class will serve you well.",
    "Studying grammar in this course was very helpful to me to improve in some areas and learn new points, as well. I don't feel that the grammar was overwhelming, though, because there were plenty of other activities to do. I would recommend this course because it was varied, fun, and a great way to improve your French!",
    "Not too bad, honestly. Grammar exercises that you should do but it's not the biggest deal if you don't have them completely done in class when you go over them (just be prepared to feel a little stupid when you can't answer the teacher). Do all of the assignments that you have to turn in fully, they do contribute to your grade. There are four essays, about two or three pages each, and the instructors (esp. Pinzka) are very helpful even if you don't have much practice writing in French. The books are all good and the movies all entertaining. You do have to memorize 20 vocab words for each test and use them in a short essay without a word bank, which is a pain, but you get used to it and it's really not that bad.",
    "In this course, we study funny, compelling and\/or thought-provoking works and, by conducting that study in French, improve our French. Since each essay must be revised after corrections are given, written French is also very much improved. I'd recommend this course if you want to improve your French in a low-stress manner -- though there is a reasonable amount of work, it comprises for the most part movies and pop-ish fiction that a lot of people use to relax anyways, just in French!",
    "Lots of absurdist texts and texts about identity, lots of bizarre movies. I recommend it. You'll learn French, and your speaking especially will improve."
