    "Professor Cammack is easily the best instructor I have ever had. She was very dedicated to the course and she probably enjoyed teaching it just as much as we did participating in it. She really encouraged class discussions by having us formulate our thoughts beforehand in an online forum and then referring to those during the class. I also appreciated the detailed background she provided for each author and the times the author lived in so that we could try to understand the text even better in its context. Something else I liked is that she was always insightful in her interventions in the discussion but she made sure to allow everyone who had something to say a fair amount of participation, even if that meant allowing us to interrupt her thoughts. You could really tell she cared about being a great instructor because she asked us to evaluate her in the middle of the semester so that she could alter her teaching style if necessary. She was always happy to receive us in her office hours whether they were for help with assignments and things about the course or about college life in general. It was also nice that she encouraged us to make connections between ancient thinkers and more modern history. I defintely recommend taking any of her classes!",
    "DS is something that is not for everybody; some people certainly enjoy it more than others. However, for anyone that has a love of reading and is interested in learning a lot and growing a lot, I would certainly recommend DS. The course is challenging at times, but overall very enjoyable.",
    "You will learn SO MUCH in this fast-paced, energetic environment. I would recommend this section for sure, because the professor is incredible. Sometimes, things can get a bit overwhelming...Don't be afraid to ask questions.",
    "Great course for those who enjoy the content area, and professor Cammack is absolutely amazing to have for the course.",
    "It's a perfect course for anyone interested in politics, a great survey of some of the most important early thinkers.",
    "This course is an intensive survey of great works of historical and political thought. It is similar to a political philosophy class, but there is more history involved. We read about 200-400 pages a week. In this section, we had paragraph responses due before each class. I would fully recommend this course to another student because I think it forms an excellent foundation for future study in the humanities.",
    "Fall H&P is a survey of Western classical antiquity's understanding of historical and political dynamics; it is the best-paced DS class in terms of the reading and the papers, probably the most important fall DS concentration, and you definitely want to take it with Prof. Cammack.",
    "I would highly recommend it."
