    "It's a fun class where you learn more in depth music. I like how we analyzed more big pieces like symphonies.",
    "Take this class! It's a fun class with lots of cool music, and all of the theory that you learn will start to make sense as you listen to example pieces. The workload is not so much, except the composition assignments can be time-consuming depending on your experience with composition. But I'm sure you'll enjoy it anyway, because it is a fun process to write your own music!",
    "Definitely try to take the course with McCreless. You'll learn tons!",
    "This is a great course for anyone who wants to gain a formal understanding of chromatic harmony and further develop their part writing and analysis skills. It will change how you listen to music. If you are a musician, I highly recommend it.",
    "MUSIC 211 was one of my favorite classes this semester. By the end I really feel that I now have the tools to analyze and compose high-level music with lots of chromaticism and cool harmonies. The daily assignments definitely help solidify the techniques we use. The choice of music is amazing and I really enjoyed just listening to great music in class. I really appreciated the opera week. Doing the schubert composition was also a great way to solidify our techniques, especially after having studied his song cycles for a while. Performing it was very enjoyable. Things that can be improved on include more exercises on some techniques so that we really understand them. For example, we didn't really do much on the hexachord. I would have liked to analyze more examples at home and maybe have a go at writing something using the hexachord etc. Some techniques need more solidifying. Also I really feel that we needed more feedback on our compositions. I didn't get much feedback for my schubert and was kind of bummed. But overall this class is great. Prof McCreless really knows his stuff. You can tell he's been teaching this for a very long time. He structures the course well and in general is a good teacher, although I feel that he should slow down a bit and maybe repeat somethings when he's teaching new material. I like how he respects students' opinion on things if it doesn't match his, because sometimes things are subjective. He's also very willing to meet up with students outside of class and I appreciated that very much.",
    "Music 211 will make you feel like a real musician. McCreless is great, I'm sure the other teachers are too. If you're frustrated by the simplicity of the 1750s and bored by I-IV-V\/V-V-I progressions, take 211!!"
