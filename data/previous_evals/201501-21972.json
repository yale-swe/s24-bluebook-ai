    "If you liked English 120, and have a lot of thoughts about the world around you, definitely take this class. This was the first year it was taught, so this might be worked out by the time it's offered again, but there is a lot of overlap with 120, so if you're trying to learn a new skill, it's probably not the best for you. If you want to continue doing what you did in 120, and do it even better, then yes you should definitely take this! Professor Shirkhani is wonderful and the class was always really fun to prepare for and attend.",
    "Yes!! I didn't take english 120 so I hadn't done any of the readings or personal writing before. Professor Shirkhani is approachable and sweet and will help you with any idea you have. The readings are really fun and so is writing your own critique",
    "Learn about the field of cultural critique, and learn to write through implication rather than through explanation. Powerful if you're interested in rhetoric, persuasion, or just good writing.",
    "This class is excellent. If you want to learn how to write well, in a subtly persuasive way, this is the class for you. The readings are all really entertaining to read. Shirkhani is a great teacher, who gives great writing tips and leads engaging discussions about the readings and the craft therein. Be prepared to work hard, but ultimately this course will make you a much better reader and writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Shirkhani is great. Make sure you do all the readings: there isn't a ton and they are all interesting, but make sure you do them. Also, take time on your drafts. You'll be happy with your end product. You kinda get out what you put it. Professor Shirkhani is always willing to help her students, so use her as a resource."
