   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it - the weekly memos are a great way to get good grades (4% each week) and the class discussions are fun and easy-going. Prof Beim is helpful, fun, approachable and an awesome person. I highly recommend it",
    "Recommended. Really good course - material is really interesting and high-level analysis of graduate papers on Political Science and trends in the courts. More statistical background could be provided to help students better understand the regressions and math behind the papers, but the class was very accessible even if you lacked a lot of knowledge in that area (which was most of the class.)There's also a lot of flexibility in papers and reading responses, so you can really write about what interests you.",
    "Great seminar: take it! You'll look at empirical research and learn to read it. Professor Beim explains concepts clearly and is helpful with papers. The workload is fair and spread out, and you'll actually do all of the reading.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in courts.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the courts on an empirical level. This is not a class about judicial decisions and their role in the political landscape. Instead you read a series of empirical research articles about many aspects of the courts to see trends in judicial behavior. It's a class where you really should do the work. The reading is usually manageable but sometimes a lot and you have to write a weekly reading response that's relatively long. However, all of the material is interesting and because everyone does it, the class discussion is engaging and the responses are graded pretty loosely. Reading the papers becomes easier as the semester goes on, and I feel like I've taken the most from this class than any class at Yale. Professor Beim is awesome, too. If you're interested in the material and are willing to actually do the work, take it! You won't regret it.",
    "This class is a great primer to the US court system, and will also give you experience reading and interpreting high-level political science papers. In addition, Professor Beim is extremely caring and nice.",
    "This is one of the best three courses I've taken at Yale (and I've taken stuff like Immigration Law). Take it if you're interested in the justice system, or considering academia for polisci\/econ. Beim is a extremely sweet and helpful, as well as good at leading seminar. The subjects explored, ranging from ethnic and sexual discrimination to Congressional restraint of courts to random things like Israeli judges' lunch breaks are very insightful, and coming from a technical background, you can even get started with a bit of your own data analysis using the papers and the authors' public data sets as a jumping-off point.",
    "A great introduction to courts in America. Fair amount of readings and assignments, interesting material. Probably don't take as your first Poli Sci course. Be prepared to learn a lot about empirical Poli Sci papers and their strengths and weaknesses. Definitely take if you're at all comfortable with that!",
    "Take it. The readings are interesting and there are legitimate class discussions each week."
