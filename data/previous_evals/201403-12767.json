   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This was great class with a light workload (only 2 presentations, weekly reading responses, and a final paper). I joined this class on a whim, and I'm so glad that I did. Most sections were really hands-on and unusual ways to examine the material we just went over in class. Even if you just take this class for a HU credit, it'll probably be the best class of your semester!",
    "One of the best gut classes out there. You look at the various media technologies throughout history and go on field trips for section. The workload is minimal- one reading response a week- and class is very enjoyable. It can get a bit theoretical at times, but on the whole I actually learned a lot from this class. Definitely take this!!",
    "Not great, not bad.",
    "This is a wonderful class that uses media as a way to talk about how we conceive of time, and handle the objects of the past. Prof. Casetti and Ahern are phenomenal, and the warmest instructors I have met at University. You get to take weekly mini-field trips and dig into the vast archives that Yale houses. We operated old printing presses, looked at Panorama paintings, and played a vintage Atari! All of this is weaved in with more theoretical texts. You come away from a great experience.",
    "Media Archeology is a course that goes through the history of media in a hands-on, discussion-friendly way. We talk about what makes a medium and how media has developed through time. There are readings for each day, that either talk about media theory or a specific medium's history. There are weekly responses, about 300-500 words, that you must write and send in, and section generally consists of small field trips where the class goes to look at media discussed that week--for example, one of the residential college's printing presses, the projection room in the Whitney Humanities Center, a camera lucida in the Center for British Art. There's also an ongoing project with a medium of your choice that you must write a paper on at the end of the semester. I would recommend it if you're interested in learning little tidbits about media and popular fads in history. The theory part of the course is a bit of a drag, but I suppose it is necessary to discuss the media more precisely.",
    "pretty much a history of media technology from the printing press through to computers. friday sections are often trips to art galleries, printing presses, film studies center, etc. Having two teachers gives it a more intimate feel.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "A fascinating look at various different forms of media. I loved this class and would highly recommend it as a fifth class if you love media studies and theory. The readings were fascinating and awesome, and the weekly section where we got to actually look at and examine the objects was really cool. Getting into Yale's collections is something that's really nice to do senior year, and this gives you a chance at that! Not to mention Mal and Prof. Casetti were enthusiastic and friendly professors who made the class so fun."
