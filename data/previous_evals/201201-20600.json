   "comments": [
    "It is a course on philosophic questions about art, including moral and political questions related to art. A wide range of topics is discussed, such as the nature of art, how art ought to be evaluated, whether and when art conveys knowledge, as wellas topics concerning the role of art in the public sphere. Each of these various topics gets a quick but incisive treatment, perhaps unlikely to sway you much in your views, but certainly likely to direct you toward pertinent questions and considerations that, once investigated further, are sure to enlighten.I would recommend this course to any student with a serious interest in art, whether as an aspiring artist or simply as one who wants to understand more about the curious subject. As I noted, the course will challenge views and encourage further inquiry, which is crucial for someone who wants to be able to take their own views on the matter seriously.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in philosophy.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student who is already interested in and somewhat aware of issues in the philosophy of art.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students because it is well organized, covers a lot of material, and the readings provide exposure to a wide variety of philosophical perspectives."
