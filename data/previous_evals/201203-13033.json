   "comments": [
    "H&P is the hardest to define of the three sections. It's a combination of history and politics, with more of an emphasis on the latter. I really enjoyed this class, but then again my two favorite subjects happen to be history and politics. I would recommend it. Some of the reading can be a little eh, but I really liked a lot of the works we read.",
    "H+P first semester is a little boring and scattered, but I'm told it gets better second semester when you reach more modern and relevant thinkers. The course is somewhere between history, myth, political and religious thought, and it's not always clear what the point of each reading or class discussion is.",
    "DS H&P Fall Semester spans works from ancient Greece (including the first extant history - that of Herodotus) through the Middle Ages, and it focuses largely on political thought\/ideas as opposed to history itself, although events and people of course play a large part in informing discussion. For me, learning about some of the major players in the history itself might have been more interesting, but it was fascinating to consider theory and be introduced to major players about whom I knew little. H&P is probably the section of DS where the books least need to be pored over, meaning that the texts themselves are not as rich as those of literature or dense as those of philosophy. As it was, some of the writers were rather difficult to get through, and with the abundance of names, it was often difficult to identify which characters were particularly important (this was particularly difficult with the Roman histories, where names are recycled generation after generation). The section is, however, a great complement to the other sections, and understanding the Politics of Aristotle helps to understand his ethical and metaphysical philosophy, while studying Plato's Republic in both Philosophy and H&P allows for increased study of the incredible work. Professor Semmel is fun and a fairly easy grader. Moreover, he is not an expert in these works of ancient history, his speciality being on British History, and so you work through the texts with less guidance and more of the onus on you to understand\/explicate the texts. This allows for a different sort of discussion, perhaps more hazy, but also more friendly and open to expressions of genuine beliefs.",
    "Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought was a thorough and enjoyable introduction to ancient and medieval political classics. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fooled by the name\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is not a history course, instead focused almost exclusively on political philosophy. The readings are very interesting, and the workload, contrary to the rumors, is still manageable. Professor Semmel was an excellent professor: funny, caring, thoughtful, and experienced. He kept the discussion going, though perhaps he let the students run things too much. This class is a great way to dive into freshman year.",
    "I did enjoy DS H&P, particularly since Professor Semmel was super funny and enjoyable to be around. We had great discussions and analyzed the works thoroughly.I would definitely suggest taking it with Semmel since he spends a lot of time with your papers and really tries to help you improve on your next papers.",
    "Professor Semmel is a great professor who is sweet, kind, and knowledgeable. His discussions tend to deviate from the topic at hand often, but these allow room for more interesting thoughts to flourish.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're very into the books we read for it",
    "First, I would definitely recommend Directed Studies. I would also definitely recommend History and Politics. While some people say that it is the weakest of the three classes, it is nevertheless extremely interesting. Some of the reading is longer, but if you do it it will be worth it when you come to class and, through the discussion, understand the parts that did not make sense. It is a great way to think and talk about the way history is written, democracy and monarchy, and a host of other things.Also, Semmel is an excellent discussion leader who runs discussions in very casual, student-driven way.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow students. I would warn them that some of the texts are very dense, but that the discussions are eye-opening and usually quite interesting.",
    "Yes, the material can be pretty interesting and we cover a lot of stuff. Sometimes the texts are a bit dry and confusing, but overall it's a good class."
