    "LING 219 was one of my favorite classes I took this year. The readings were interesting and connected really well to the methods we learned, and the final project was a lot of fun to work on since we treated it like an independent research project in the field. As a non-major, I felt a little disadvantaged in the discussions, but overall I was still able to get a lot out of the class. I would definitely recommend it to majors and non-majors alike.",
    "This was a great course, and I learned a lot. Very manageable workload, and it's exciting because you actually get to apply what you learned for the final project. The professor is very knowledgeable and helpful, and the case studies we read were interesting.",
    "This class was fairly interesting if you are very, very interested in the material. However, as someone who was only vaguely interested in the material, the class was a little too complicated and not engaging. The use of complex phylogenetic analysis softwares was overwhelming and poorly explained.",
    "I would definitely tell a fellow student to approach this course with caution. For someone who is particularly interested in computational historical linguistics and has a strong background in statistical software, I would recommend the course, but otherwise I probably would not."
