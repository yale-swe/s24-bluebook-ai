   "comments": [
    "Knowledge about health care is delivered in the US and how different policies affect funding and sustainability of various programs.",
    "I learned a lot about healthcare economics, from practical aspects like the individual insurance market, to large scale issues of the accessibility and feasibility of healthcare. It's a dynamic class that involves thinking about how underlying economic principles influence the healthcare market. There is a decent amount of just memorizing legislation and stuff though.",
    "ECON 170 equipped me with a good understanding of the general economic concepts governing the healthcare market in the United States. It also provided me the vocabulary to dive further into healthcare policy issues and to better understand how our insurance\/pharmaceutical market and care delivery works.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of the U.S. health care system, including current issues and possible solutions.",
    "Comprehensive look at healthcare economics and health policy in the United States. Pretty sure I came out of this class knowing more about how healthcare works than the Republicans in Congress currently trying to take coverage away from tens of millions and destabilize insurance markets by getting rid of the individual mandate.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and current processes of health care and health insurance in the US",
    "I learned so much about health policy in the US today, especially given the controversies surrounding Obamacare and its repeal.",
    "Highly recommend this class. You learn so much about Medicare and Medicaid that you can take into health policy discussions. Great class for Pre-meds and Econ students alike.",
    "I developed a very comprehensive understanding of the modern US healthcare system. Very insightful.",
    "taught me so much about all the things i shouldve already known - medicare, medicaid, the ACA, exchanges, physician reimbursement, etc. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Where to begin? Health Econ & Public Policy was a huge help for me to understand the foundations of how healthcare is financed and delivered in the United States. My biggest takeaways are that the most common talking points on either side of the aisle should be subject to extreme scrutiny when promising easy answers to the difficult problem of increasing costs, disparities, and middling results.",
    "This course is a great overview of the American health care system - current challenges facing our health system and how the provision of care is facilitated and financially managed.",
    "Basic knowledge of the policy-making process and details of healthcare reform",
    "I learned more about the workings of the US Healthcare system",
    "A thorough understanding of health care and policy in the US.",
    "I learned a ton about the healthcare system as a whole, which I knew very little about before this class.",
    "I am an economics major who hadn't really understood the US Healthcare 'system' with all of its idiosyncrasies until taking this course. I developed my analytical policy skills much more than my econ-specific, skills, but I think the course is better for it- I am now much more able to debate and discuss healthcare with my friends and family, which seems critical because the topic is major and very impactful.",
    "One of the most useful classes at yale.",
    "I believe that I got a very good understanding of the US healthcare system, and how policies have shaped the overall system into becoming what it is today. Even though the healthcare system is relatively expansive and would probably take more than 25 lectures to adequately cover it, I believe that Prof. Foreman does a great job of providing an overview of that system. Additionally, he was great at bringing in a wealth of guest speakers to lecture to provide outside perspectives on the real-world impacts of healthcare.",
    "In this class, I learned the intricacies of the American healthcare and health delivery system, why it is inefficient, and possible reforms to improve.",
    "General understanding of the US healthcare system",
    "Learned about health economics and public policy",
    "An overview of the US health system and some comparisons with other countries, insight into the issues facing healthcare delivery and financing in the US today.",
    "Great course about the economics of healthcare.",
    "The class provides a good introduction to healthcare topics (with a policy focus). Clearly explains Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance, the hospital system, nurses' and physicians' practices, healthcare reform efforts, etc.",
    "I learned so much about healthcare in the US. I wasn't terribly excited about this class at the beginning of the semester, but it actually ended up being really cool and I appreciate the much greater understanding I have about how our healthcare system works.",
    "This course covered the major topics in healthcare, including: hospitals, physicians, Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance. There were also many interesting guest lectures sprinkled in from people across the healthcare field.",
    "I learned all the foundations of the American healthcare system, in addition to a number of intricacies and all of the financial aspects to it.",
    "This course did a fantastic job of thoroughly educating me on something I was completely ignorant of before it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Guest speakers were very interesting people.",
    "The lectures weren't always easy to follow. The slides are sometimes disjointed and it takes a while for me to connect all the dots.",
    "This course is really fascinating and there are phenomenal guest speakers. You learn a lot about healthcare markets which is a must for premeds and also just for engaged citizens. It is very current events heavy which I found exciting (although ultimately disappointing because you realize how bad things are \/ are going to get). The tests are very detail-heavy though, and you have to know about all the minute tangents (not just what was emphasized) it can be kind of difficult to keep track of all these things.",
    "I really enjoyed the organization of this course and the breadth of information that was covered. The guest lectures were phenomenal, and I left the course with a greater appreciation for the complexity of our healthcare system as well as the different perspectives on how to begin resolving some of its biggest problems.",
    "Forman is an engaging and charismatic lecturer, and the material is interesting for anyone who wants to take an in-depth look at an often-misunderstood area of policy in the United States. Lecture slides were not helpful, though -- take good notes while Forman is talking.",
    "The class was awesome! The guest lectures were really phenomenal, and the material was very interesting.",
    "Well organized but lectures were sometimes boring. Its easy to do well if you pay attention in class and study hard for the midterm\/final. The essay was graded nicely. As previous reviewers have said, it would be much more effective if the TAs actually reviewed the material rather than just answering specific questions in their review sessions. Not helpful as it is now. Also, this is barely an economics class; as an economics major, I wouldve preferred more Econ rather than poli sci. Moreover, its expected for your final paper to have a major focus on economic principles, which just doesnt make sense considering there is literally one lecture on health care economics.",
    "It would be nice to have weekly review sections for the material.",
    "Strengths include organized lectures, engaging content, and guest lecturers. Weaknesses are a lack of resources for test prep and essay writing.",
    "FANTASTIC course. really appreciated how engaging the lectures were and the lack of busy work. some good guest lectures, some bad (particularly the venture capitalist guest speaker who talked about Google...). appreciated the flexibility with the paper. midterm was fair...final seemed a bit unfair...",
    "There's not a lot of homework, testing etc but that puts pressure on each assignment\/assessment. I think it would have been good to have a second midterm just because several people were unprepared for the level of memorization needed for the first. A second midterm would balance grades and helps students to review information before the final.",
    "While the slides could have been updated towards the end of the course, the readings remained relevant with more recent conversations among industry experts and not just academics.",
    "The course was very informative with interesting lectures. I would have appreciated a little more continuity with the Medicare lectures (they were broken up between the first and second exams \/ guest lecture) as this was the most confusing topic for me. I enjoyed the variety of guest lecturers! It was also great to have Professor Forman's perspective on the issues as a health care provider.",
    "I believe this course should be listed under PLSC because there was very very little economics involved",
    "This course was very fast paced and some of the lectures were hard to follow. Professor Forman assumed a level of knowledge that I'm not sure all the students had before coming into this class.",
    "Strength is that information is presented in a very clear presentable way. A weakness is that the grading can me very nitpicky.",
    "Strengths: Organization of the course, straightforward homework and tests, engaging lectures, interesting and self-directed final paper. Weaknesses: light on economics (which could also be a strength!), harder to practice material you've learned (maybe if they add a practice exam, or equivalent before the final?)",
    "I thought it was well taught and informative. The physician part of the lecture got boring though. I wish we had gotten feedback on our proposal of our final paper so we had feedback before we wrote it.",
    "Professor Foreman does a very good job at providing the information either though his own lectures, his TFs lectures, and through the lectures of his guest speakers. There was a lot of specific information covered, and while at times that meant that the grading seemed to nitpick at the details, I believe that it was to the benefit of the course. The one issue that I had was not even in implementation or material, but rather on the review sessions, which relied on student questions and not on what might be important for the exams. If the model was flipped such that important information could be highlighted, then that might provide a better student review.",
    "The Professor is very knowledgeable intros field and the guest lecturers are very engaging. However, the TAs should be better utilized to aid the students in their work, not just hosting four optional Q&A sessions.",
    "I really enjoyed the speakers who offered interesting perspectives",
    "This course could have an easie grading on exams and essays, too nitpicky",
    "This was a really fantastic course overall. Professor Forman's lectures are really interesting and engaging, and he seems like a genuinely kind person who wants to see his students succeed. The guest lectures were also fascinating. The main weakness I can think of was that the lecture slides were sometimes not entirely clear a reason to go to lecture, but sometimes Professor Forman would talk quickly and it was hard to clarify what certain bullets meant.",
    "Great course on the economics of healthcare. Professor Forman is immensely knowledgable (he's actually an MD from the Med School) and an engaging lecturer. Amazing guest speakers including Surgeon General Murthy and several Obama-era policymakers. You'll walk away with a demystified understanding of healthcare and health insurance in the U.S.",
    "Prof. Forman throughly explains the material making sure everyone properly understands it.",
    "In general, the class was taught very well. Professor Forman's explanations were clear, he was an engaging lecturer, and the assigned readings were interesting and helpful (I'm still looking through some of the supplemental ones that I didn't get to during the semester). The one aspect of the class I would change is the final essay: I think it might have been more useful to ask students to produce an argumentative essay rather than just a literature review. Other than that, I was very happy with the class.",
    "I think the class is very well structured and Professor Forman is a thoughtful, compelling lecturer. The class could be improved with more regular optional review sessions with the teaching fellows, as there is a lot of material covered each week, and it would be helpful to have at least one other time between the beginning of the semester and the midterm and between the midterm and final to ask questions about the material.",
    "I think this course would be greatly improved by having weekly mandatory discussion section to go over course material. I also think that more homework assignments would be very helpful.",
    "I felt like there was an uneven distribution of time spent on the various topics.",
    "Other people probably said this too, but yeah, his slides are very long and there's a lot of memorization. Also, I felt like the final exam was too focused on 1-2 lectures (including the TA lecture) and asked very specific questions about specific laws and acts when we were told it would be more about concepts (oh well.)",
    "Strengths - the material is interesting and Howie has good insights on the medical field as he is a physician himself. Weaknesses - this course truly covers a lot of content, so much that it can be overwhelming.",
    "The strengths of this course are Howie and the interesting course material, not to mention the myriad impressive guest speakers Prof. Forman brings in. The major weakness is the lack of guidance for the final given the breadth of information."

   "comments": [
    "This class can appeal to majors and non-majors alike, basically anyone with a remote interest in healthcare. Professor Forman is a leader in the field, and he really cares about everyone's learning.",
    "Yes! It's a great overview of information that everyone should learn. Plus, Professor Forman is THE BEST.",
    "Yes, this was a low-stress course that presented concepts that are extremely relevant to politics today",
    "I would recommend the class, it's interesting to learn about how our health care system works and all the areas we need to improve.",
    "I recommend the class - covers a lot of basic info that is good for anyone to know about. Howie is really passionate about the material and wants students to do well. Workload is very manageable.",
    "Yes i think this is something everyone should know about, especially premeds. And it's really fun and interesting! Good to credit-d because the tests are kind of hard though workload is overall pretty small.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course if you have any interest in better understanding the complexities of the healthcare market and how healthcare functions as a business in the United States.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone curious about the U.S. health care system.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone who wants to learn about the economic aspects of health policy (or just wants to a listen to an accomplished economist\/doctor talk about the business of healthcare) should take it.",
    "Yes the guest lectures and fascinating content were really great. Further, everyone should know about how healthcare works in the US!",
    "Yes I really learned a lot (had little to no health care policy knowledge beforehand). Not an extremely hard course.",
    "Yes, would recommend this class because it provides so much useful information.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the US healthcare system. Prof. Forman is extremely dedicated to the learning of his students. The material could have been organized better at times but I was impressed with the detail of the course. Forman also does a good job at presenting the material in a neutral way, and handles the partisan opinions of certain students well. As far as the material goes, if you attend lecture most of the time, you will have no issue with the two exams. Other than that, workload is pretty light with a few short assignments in between and a final paper. There are also some very interesting guest speakers. Fall '17 we had a past surgeon general, a HC partner from a prominent VC firm, healthcare czar under Obama, among others. Overall, I think this is a great class for both those interested in medicine and those interested in economics and Prof. Forman is truly a valuable asset to his students.",
    "Course will make you feel super depressed about U.S. healthcare but also it's a great course",
    "EVERYONE TAKE THIS COURSE. Prof. Forman is a great lecturer and this is information all US citizens (and non-citizens!) should know about how healthcare works in America.",
    "You don't have to do much \"work\" but assignments are graded very strictly so be careful! It's not a gut. There's a lot to know.",
    "If you are pre-med, pre-law, or just want to work in the healthcare field, this class is an essential first step to understanding the complexities in government and industry. If you are not able to dive into the charts and statistics, then you will probably have a hard time enjoying Health Econ & Public Policy.",
    "I would recommend this class - it is a comprehensive overview of the American health care system and is comprised of very engaging lectures. Plus the time commitment is very manageable.",
    "Yeah, for sure! If you're interested in healthcare policy, definitely take this class. Professor Forman is so knowledgeable.",
    "Unless you have a solid grasp of healthcare policies in America, are not an international student, and planning to apply to med school\/healthcare consulting, I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning more about the healthcare system in the U.S. and the economic implications of our current system. Professor Forman brings in incredible speakers who are experts in their field.",
    "The course was interesting but very complex. Hard to determine what was important to know.",
    "Yes, it's definitely been my favorite class in the major.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend to another student. Professor Forman clearly cares about his students and seems very approachable and willing to sit down with students for extra advice. I learned a ton from the course, but it's one of those classes that you get out what you put in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are an economics major, and don't really understand the US Healthcare system, complete with insurance markets, how hospitals work, how medical schools work, etc. You get a ton of both zoomed-out knowledge about the policy implications of certain kinds of healthcare reform, as well as detailed knowledge about the insurance market and the ACA and much more.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are interested in the healthcare system, whether you are going to med school or the pharma industry or the business side of things. It is also a great course to take just to be informed about the health system in the US.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, even to someone not in the Econ major, because the class is more of a policy study class rather than an economics class. I feel that I know much more about the ins and outs of the healthcare system than before I took this class, and as someone living in America who is likely to utilize health insurance, I feel that this will be useful in my life for the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who are at all interested in learning about the health econ and politics of our nation. The class clearly specifies the strengths and weaknesses of both sides of the political spectrum and proposes a way to address these concerns. Prof. Forman is literally the top of the field relating to health econ, and there's no one better to learn it from than him.",
    "Yes!! Definitely if you are interested in how healthcare works",
    "Only if you are very interested in this specific topic",
    "I'd highly recommend the course if you have any interest in health policy or are going into any health profession. You learn a lot about how the US health system works and some of the main issues it's facing things I think are really important to understand as someone looking to go into medicine, for example. Professor Forman is wonderful very funny, engaging, and open to questions. The workload is very manageable, although you do need to put work into studying for the exams.",
    "Great course on the economics of healthcare. Professor Forman is immensely knowledgable (he's actually an MD from the Med School) and an engaging lecturer. Amazing guest speakers including Surgeon General Murthy and several Obama-era policymakers. You'll walk away with a demystified understanding of healthcare and health insurance in the U.S.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. Healthcare is such an important policy issue that I'm glad I now know more about how Medicare works and how hospitals are reimbursed, etc. The topics covered are useful to know and interesting, Professor Forman is a good lecturer, and the class provides you with the opportunity to explore the subject in more depth than the lectures if you want to.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to anyone interested in the material. You gain a deep understanding of the many factors at play in the American healthcare system and how the system may be improved. Professor Forman cares so deeply about teaching, and that shows in his lectures and in the thoughtfulness with which he selects the guest lecturers. He also rolls with the punches as policy issues continue to change and develop and is always willing to discuss relevant policy changes and his opinions on their potential impact. He is not blinded by partisan affiliation and really discusses the issues at face value based on their economic impact. It is a lot of material, so it is worth considering that you will be much better off if you come to lecture, pay attention, and take good notes.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The material was consistently interesting and Professor Forman is an amazing and engaging lecturer. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who needs a Econ elective or is just interested in learning about the health care system in America (a topic that is obviously really important today).",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is a very practical survey of many topics related to the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "Yes! Do take this class (credit\/D\/fail if you want). I think it's really important to understand how our healthcare system functions and the debate around healthcare reform. I really value the knowledge I learned in this class and the guest speakers were really cool.",
    "This is more of a political science class than an economics class, although there is some econ. Be prepared to memorize lots of information with other pre-meds!",
    "Yes absolutely. Even if obeisant an Econ major or pre-med, understanding the healthcare system is something valuable to everyone."
