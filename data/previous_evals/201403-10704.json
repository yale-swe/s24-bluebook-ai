   "comments": [
    "\"It's a course about quantum and basic spectroscopy\/NMR. It's a lot of work, not because there's too much HW, but because it's hard.\" Sure, I'd recommend it. But take it when you can give it the proper amount of attention.",
    "It's a good class -- sort of an extension of basic quantum with some experimental applications. Not too much work -- weekly psets and four exams that are no more difficult than homework assignments -- and the material is fun and math-y. If you like math and pchem it's probably the best elective you'll find in this department.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 540 01 to another student as it is an excellent introduction to the quantum mechanical manipulations any physical chemist will have to address. That being said, someone with an extensive background in the material I would not recommend to take the course.",
    "Take this course only if it is relevant to your research.",
    "CHEM 540 is a good review course if you have been away from quantum mechanics for a while. It encompasses a fair amount of material necessary for physical and biophysical chemists."

   "comments": [
    "This course showed me how little I know about physical chemistry, but as far as I can tell much of it was fairly introductory info on spectroscopy. Wow. I don't know how this will end up applying to my research, but I did learn some cool concepts.",
    "I would say that this course did not significantly contribute content to what will be my dissertation\/research. However, it has provided me with a broad scope and understanding of the mathematical manipulations that I will be encountering within whichever area my dissertation is in.",
    "The course refined my understanding of quantum mechanics and was a good review of the mathematical techniques necessary for quantum chemistry."
