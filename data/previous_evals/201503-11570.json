    "Contrary to popular belief, I don't think ART 114 is too much work. I would say on average it is about 4-5 hours of work a week, which is no different from most classes. I definitely recommend it to any student, regardless of their background, and even more so if they are in STEM.",
    "Basic Drawing with Natalie was pretty much what I expected and hoped for. The work is simple - not necessarily easy - and I definitely improved a lot over the course of the semester. Some details about the class I didn't originally know: it's all black and white, not all pencil\/pen (also charcoal and a bit of brush), you're pretty much just thrown in and told to \"draw what you see\" (which is better than I would have thought.)",
    "YES. Changes the way you see things, and makes you realize that drawing isn't really that difficult, you just gotta go for it.",
    "Great class! Covers a wide range of techniques and media. I enjoyed the first, more technical half, and toward the end we did more with collage and abstract art. Definitely recommend!",
    "I would recommemd this class to another student because, even if you already know how to draw, the class will push you out of your comfort zone by making you draw a variety of subjects with a variety of media and improve your skill level in just about every aspect of art through repetition.",
    "I would definitely recommend ART 114 to another student, as long as they had the time to put into the assignments. Don't take this class looking for an easy gut, because if you don't put in the time and effort, it will be obvious to everyone. However, it is a fantastic class that will improve your drawing skills regardless of your current ability level going in to the course. Later in the semester, there are often period of time where you will have long blocks to work on a particular drawing during class, and in this time, you can bring headphones and listen to music, which is great for focus.",
    "This class is really fun! You will need to put in several hours a week for most homework assignments, but it is worth it.",
    "This class is great, but a lot of work!! I took Natalie Westbrook's section, and we did a LOT of technical stuff in the beginning. The homework assignments were pretty tedious and took a long time, but it was a nice change from psets or reading. I took the class as a non-art major, who hasn't taken any art class since elementary school, and it was really fun to get into a \"drawing zone\" and do something that was different than the usual grind. It was pretty hard and was a lot of work, so I recommend taking it pass\/fail if you want to have a little leeway with the assignments and the obligation to put in hours to complete them. We got to work with a lot of different materials (ink was my favorite) and we had a number of sessions with nude models, which I wasn't expecting, but found to be a lot of fun. I recommend it!!",
    "Very time-consuming course, but you WILL improve. I felt like the course had a very 'Karate Kid' like vibe to it, the first month was spent exclusively using the china marker which is a difficult tool.",
    "It's good for improving technical drawing skills, and it's a great way to learn to think in a new way. Its challenging, but worth it."
