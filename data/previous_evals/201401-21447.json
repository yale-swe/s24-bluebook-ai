   "comments": [
    "3 p sets, probably less than 200 unique lines of code written, no need to go to class, basically a free credit.",
    "Literally the most garbage course I've ever taken at Yale. It's unfathomable how little a professor can care about teaching this course, and that he actively encourages students to not attend. Waste of a credit, waste of my time even doing the problem sets. Specs for the PS were not incredibly clear, and were done with haste by most students. The only positive part of this class is the low workload, but even that shouldn't justify anyone taking this course.",
    "If you're looking to knock off a CS elective with minimal work, this is your chance.",
    "As other reviews have noted, a fairly straightforward course defined by 3 problem sets, none of which are gut-wrenchingly difficult like in CPSC 323. I thought it might be too gutsy to take this class without a linear algebra background, but I turned out fine. If you are looking for a course that isn't a kick in the gut because the rest of your schedule is gutted, then I have a gut feeling this might be the class for you.",
    "Lol I spent an average of 1 hr per week on this course. And I'm not even a CS major. Took it concurrently with CS 223 having only taken CS 201 before (no prior programming experience before CS 201). Extremely easy, and if you've taken Linear Algebra you might even learn something mildly interesting.",
    "Three problem sets (avg about 3-6 hours each), no exams. Can just go to office hours to find out how to do problem sets. Don't have to go to class. This class is worth as many credits as Operating Systems and may be as much as 20x less work. Class isn't very structured. No online notes are given.",
    "The professor does not teach well. There are three problem sets that take about 10 - 15 hours each. You can go to the TA to learn how to do the problem sets.",
    "The class wasn't the most useful, but I learned a lot from problem sets. Doesn't require a coding background beyond CPSC 112. Might be worth taking just for Rokhlin: perhaps the most eccentric (and brilliant) professor at Yale, which is saying something!",
    "It is fun to listen to the professor talk. I learned how to program in C, that is what I learned from it. Take it if you wish.",
    "3 psets, 100% of the grade. Put time into em and you'll do fine.",
    "3 problem sets, no final or midterm. Take it if this is the format. Problem sets are hard but manageable. You'll spend less than 10 hours on each of them.",
    "Take it if you need a gut CS course. Only 3 psets, all of which took less than 4 hours to complete. Don't have to go to lecture (in fact, Rohklin discourages it).",
    "I would definitely recommend 440 if: (1) you are one of the \"chill\" CS majors who don't want to take OS or compilers, or (2) you need a fourth\/fifth class that is a CS elective.",
    "Very chill computer class. The entire class is only three programs and if you are at all familiar with writing C code then you should do well in this class. You don't need to go to class to do the homework and most of the algorithms are explained pretty well online. Definitely go to office hours before the program is due, as the TA describes the algorithm that needs to be implemented in great detail.",
    "If you know how to code well in C coming into this class (i.e. have already taken CS323) this class is going to be almost no work. You're not expected to attend lecture and you have three psets that involve implementing well-known algorithms. If you're hurting for CS credits or just credits in general, this class is one you can take an only worry about three times a semester when the psets are due, and those will take you about 10 hours each and definitely not more than 15.",
    "Good class to take if you need\/want a CS credit.",
    "Lectures wildly swing between fascinating and incomprehensible. The homework is quite manageable and straightforward. Rokhlin tells some funny stories. He threatened to have a final exam this year, which would have been a disaster due to the aforementioned frequently incomprehensible lectures, but called it off. Most of the class doesn't attend the lectures. It's considered an easy class."
