    "I really enjoyed this course. Mark gave the best lectures and is brilliant in his field, so in future versions of this course maybe he could play a larger role. I agree with the suggestion someone made in class: it would be nice to have a debrief without the lecturer. Although speakers didn't often fit into any single \"box,\" I think it might be interesting to have pairs or trios of speaker speak on one theme. For instance we could have a pro-GM speaker followed by an anti-GM speaker...and ask them both the same questions. Or we could have them debate each other in the same class! We did hear many conflicting viewpoints, but grouping them together might help bring out the conflict. I hope this course continues to be offered. The speaker series model is especially valuable in food systems because of the diversity of opinions",
    "I decline to give comments for Professor Geballe as he was not really instructing in this class. The nature of the course meant the weekly speakers were the ones who interacted most with the course. However, I think the course gave an excellent overview of the different schools of thoughts concerning food systems today. I think as a course, it is accessible to anyone from outside the discipline, or without any science background, although more willingness to engage with the science might be helpful for further challenging the weekly speakers on their methodologies.",
    "I appreciate how many perspectives were represented in this course. I particularly enjoyed having someone come to present on indigenous food systems, since this viewpoint is often missing from many classes. I would love to see someone who does sustainable food sourcing and supply chain management present for the class next year.",
    "My responses to 1-14 are mostly for the TA for this course, who I think was primarily responsible for how it was taught (except for Q10). Not really sure how I should respond to Q1-13 since this course seemed to be co-taught by 3 people.",
    "I have no idea what Gordon's role in this course is. He does a little introductory spiel on the first day saying this course started when some students asked him to teach the Farm Bill years ago, but now it's nothing like that and we never discussed the Farm Bill, and also he like doesn't teach it at all in any way? He's just sort of there, most of the time, for no reason, doing nothing. Samara seemed to do the vast majority of the work, with some really great input from Mark as well. Gordon's role is really unclear. The course relies really heavily on lectures by featured guest speakers each week, which sounds way better in theory than it is in practice. A few were great, some were okay, some were crappy, but the main issue was that it was totally disjointed. Mark Bomford gave 3 excellent introductory lectures at the beginning that gave me inaccurately high expectations for the rest of the course. After he was done, it became a disconnected series of talks on largely unrelated topics. Students could do some leg work to find some ways to connect and integrate them, and obviously it's fine for us to do some work and not have everything spoon fed to us, but there's a middle ground where the hypothetical instructor could do some actual instruction. Part of the issue may also be that after Mark's weeks were over, all the readings were just suggestions by the speakers--who often assigned us to watch their own TED Talks, and then repeated those TED Talks in class, inexplicably. Maybe it would help if the instructors (especially Mark) selected some additional readings each week to give some context, expand on the speaker's work, and connect it to the other themes and material of the course?",
    "The class was a little disorganized. The professor also publicly voiced negative sentiment about business and was skeptical as to why business students were in the class. I found that to be very unprofessional and detracted from learning.",
    "Course structure -Too long for someone to be speaking at you, even with the break. I recommend breaking the class up into two different meetings- one class where a speaker comes to present for 30 min, then there is 30-40 min of Q&A and facilitated discussion. -The other class could be structured as a mini-brainstorming session where small groups of students brainstorm different solutions to the problem the speaker had presented at the previous class. The groups of students would come up with different ideas, evaluate them based on the readings\/speaker, and then present their mini solution to the rest of the class. This is a great way to keep students engaged in what they're learning- by challenging them to think critically about the problem and the benefits and trade offs of different solutions to the problem at hand. Course content It would be nice if the course content was structured in a more linear or meaningful way. I didn't see that there was any kind of connection between the previous speaker and the next. Maybe the topics are lumped by the kind of speaker (academic, practitioner, etc) or by geography, social\/environmental problem, etc. It would be nice to create some kind of structured flow and do a midway check point to talk about what the course has covered and what it will cover in the second half. Speakers Notwithstanding a few speakers, most of the speakers were poor either because of the quality of the content they shared, their style of presentation, or both. I got the sense that the speakers were told how long, the context of the class, and a general idea of what they were supposed to talk about. I know it's difficult to assess the quality of speakers even if they've done a TEDx talk or have amazing resumes- but I think it is critical to have a sense of their style and to coach them on what you want them to talk about and how you want them to talk. Based on my experience coaching student speakers who spoke at Social Impact Lab this year, the audience has a very short attention span so we had students talk for a few minutes, then engage the audience with a question- they kept it short, funny at times, and engaged the audience throughout. That's what keeps people interested and learning instead of on their laptops the whole time. Please consider shortening the speakers' presentations and coaching them on engaging the audience regularly. People have an attention span less than a goldfish- 8 seconds."

    "Lots of speakers, and different material",
    "I really enjoyed Mark's lectures in the beginning of the class.",
    "The diversity of speakers made me realize a lot about how limited my perspective often is, and I flipflopped a lot during the semester with regards to whose worldview I bought into.",
    "The best aspects of this course is its sheer variety, in terms of information access to varied schools of thoughts; from entrepreneurial mock-meat solutions to MNC seed projects with farmers in Africa. The course was also well-thematised and I think the finally session where we came together to discuss which speaker was the most persuasive was very helpful in consolidating ideas.",
    "-- Speakers -- Readings -- Class Discussions",
    "The diverse group of speakers that came to visit were interesting and thought provoking. I also found the final class wrap-up discussion to be a very useful ending to the course and a good way of bringing all of the ideas presented throughout the semester together.",
    "I was really satisfied with the guest speakers. I thought they did an excellent job of covering a really broad range of food system topics. I even appreciated the opportunity to listen to speakers I vehemently disagreed with. I think it's important to challenge myself in that way.",
    "Mark Bomford and Samara Brock are both really interesting people. Mark is an incredible teacher, and his three introductory lectures were absolutely wonderful. I really wish he would just teach a whole course himself. Samara didn't lecture or anything but her contributions to discussions were always thought-provoking and helpful and I hope to work with her more in the future as well.",
    "The speakers",
    "Some of the guest lecturers were great.",
    "The student presentations with food and wine at the end. The presentations were interesting and short and sweet. I like the opportunity to think critically about others' ideas and ask challenging questions. Would have been fun to get outside and do a field trip to a farm or food hub to see a local solution to a global food system problem. And makes it more fun."

    "Possibly sourcing topics and speaker ideas from students.",

    "It would be great to include a field trip for this class. For next time, it would be really cool to invite a chef to the class as well. However, for next time, it will be a lot better not to have final presentations during reading week because that is very stressful.",
    "There should have been time to discuss amongst the class what we thought of speakers - speakers just came and left and we didn't really discuss them again, and it would have been valuable to talk about them generally and about what we bought or didn't buy about their perspectives, and also to talk specifically about fit them into the values\/metrics framework that we talked about at the beginning of the semester.",
    "However, the course material had very little to do with the final assignment, and engagement with each other projects may have been limited because of that. If the final assignment had been limited to the innovations we explored in class, it might have been more effective. As well, the criteria for posting good questions on the forum was unclear, and course expectations on that part could be more clearly voiced.",
    "-- More time to discuss and debate speakers' topics and ideas as a class in real time. We spent too much time listening and not enough time talking and debating these topics -- Prompt for the final project was so silly! I still can't believe we were asked to analyze a current solution in the food systems space rather than think up our own. The latter would have required so much more creativity and thinking",
    "I think this course needs more time structured into the classes that would give students the opportunity to debrief after a speaker. Or have their own debate about the topic. I'm not sure how this could be done, since it wouldn't make sense to do this while the speaker is still in the room. And I'm not sure how it would go over if a speaker iis present for a debate on something that happened the week before. a I'm not sure if it needs to happen every week, but certainly more than one class period, it seems. One reason for this is that I think some student dont feel comfortable challenging the speaker too aggressively\/in a confrontational way. But they might feel fine saying something when the person is not in the room, for better or for worse...",
    "The disjointed randomness of the guest talks that comprise the bulk of the course; the total non-participation of Gordon, the alleged professor",
    "Having the speaker for all three hours of the class seemed to be overkill. It would have been helpful for my learning to debrief at the end of class and bring together what we learned.",
    "Many of the guest lecturers were not great.",
    "See above response. Course structure and speakers Also instead of writing a long paper at the end, I think it would be more fun if students could pursue a short-term consulting engagement or experiential learning experience with an organization and then write up a report about their learnings."

    "This class does fill a void at FES\/Yale with respect to food-related courses. I was really grateful to have a structured time each week to learn from a very broad range of views\/ideas\/projects. I was very impressed with how interdisciplinary this course was. I think it is important that the speakers were coming from very different backgrounds\/sectors\/fields. It was fascinating that they seemed to speak different languages in some ways. I appreciated that this challenged me to think about food issues in ways that I was not accustomed to.",
    "Could have provided broad frameworks to help me analyze food system problems and levers that different individuals and organizations are pulling to affect change in these different areas. In fact, the class could be structured this way: 1st half- academic speakers that talk about frameworks for thinking about food systems and the different challenges that exist within those frameworks- food sovereignty, food access, etc 2nd half- potential solutions to problems I know it's difficult to disentangle these two because they're interrelated, but it could be helpful for students to structure it in this way"
