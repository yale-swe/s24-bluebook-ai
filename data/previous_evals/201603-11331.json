    "From taking this course I was able to improve my overall understanding of music, both in terms of composition and analysis.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of music theory. I have been a singer for my entire life but never had any theory background. The material was taught in a very intuitive, natural progression, and I have used my new theory knowledge frequently in my singing!",
    "How to be a better person.",
    "A lot of skills, like the basic music theories and composition skills",
    "I was a musician coming into this class, but I still learned SO much. The main concepts you cover are reading music (very little time taken here), intervals, chords and their notation, cadences, composition, and ear training. I feel much more competent now that I have a solid understanding of all of these. This class also teaches you how to listen to music in a more thoughtful way, if you apply what you learn in class to what you hear on a daily basis."

   "comments": [
    "The course does a great job at making sure that musicians of all levels gain a strong understanding of music.",
    "Weaknesses: I feel there are big differences between what is learned between sections (some did dictation, we did not). Strengths: Definitely my favorite class of the semester - so much fun with very interactive material.",
    "Overall this class is great. It gives a great basis for theory and composition while still presenting a challenge even for someone who has take theory before. Lalli is one of the greatest professors I have ever had and really made this class.",
    "Learn a lot of skills in a short time.",
    "Two of its main strengths are the breadth of material covered and the pace the class progresses at, so you're not bored. I also think the feedback structure in the course was excellent, and the Monday quizzes especially were a great way to make sure you were understanding all the concepts. I wish the textbook had gone as far as we did conceptually, but for what it covered it was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend. Even for people with zero music background, this material is very interesting and thought provoking! It is also just a lot of fun!! Take it with Professor Lalli if possible because he is a STAR.",
    "If the student is interested in music and music theory I would totally recommend. This is a great starting point and moves at a good pace. Richard Lalli is an amazing professor and does a great job with the material. Really made the class for me.",
    "Could learn a lot of practical skills in a short time.",
    "Take this class! And DEFINITELY take it with Lalli!!!! He's one of my all-time favorite professors--a wonderful sense of humor, a gifted teacher, and an all-around lovely human being. I thought I was going to be bored, since I was a musician coming in with some basic theory knowledge, but he tailored the syllabus to teach our class some more advanced things throughout the semester. And honestly, even when we were learning the basics, Lalli makes class funny and interesting with his dry humor and tendency to go in-depth into all the concepts. Don't be afraid to speak up in class, because another huge part of the experience is being friends with the other students. Cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this class."
