    "I developed the ability to unite a wide range of texts across the modernist period and extrapolate the intimate narratives of novels and poems of the time to the world crisis at hand. I learned to marry my historic knowledge of world events with my literary observations and create cohesive, analytic arguments pertaining to these connections.",
    "I got to read a number of modernist authors I hadn't gotten the chance to read before through the lens of world systems.",
    "I have never ever had a professor, teacher, or mentor pay as much attention to my writings as Professor Cleary... not in undergrad nor graduate. He provided me with 3-4 (sometimes 5) pages of notes, and also encouraged students to meet with him to discuss their topics, research, and overall writing process. He read my papers with care and precision. Most (if not all, really) of my professors comment in the margins something like, \"Oh, good point, but needs more clarification...\" or \"This is a great idea...\" or some cheap praise that doesn't really mean anything... Students notice this. We notice when professors offer hackneyed adages bereft of meaning. Prof. Cleary does not do this; he reads... I mean truly reads... our essays, and offers constructive criticism. I've never been in a class where I have had this much attention and concern for my writing, research, and academic endeavors. He noticed my writing 'tics' (as I call them) instantly. For example, I overuse ellipses points (I mean, just look at this paragraph, it's an absolute mess)... and he pointed that out instantly (but kindly; he was always compassionate and incredibly gracious with his corrections. It was perfect). He also was able to intuit problems in my paper before they occurred. I'm just repeating myself now, but the point is he really, really cares about his students and their research\/writings. It made me care twice as much! As far as insights... I should have had a class like this in undergrad. I raced through my bachelors degree, while working 30 hours a week... and I really didn't receive the attention that I probably needed. I've never been taught how to write. I've never had that personal attention until now, really. So the fact that someone would pay that much attention to my work is really a first experience. I'm keeping his notes forever-- or at least until I've corrected my writing 'tics'! Also, I've never been taught how to read (I mean truly read) poetry... and when he read The Waste Land, it was like I could see the images in my mind. It was wonderful. One more thing-- this class taught me the complexities of transgenerational trauma, specifically post-traumatic stress, and how it affects cultural movements and that culture's imagination. Aligning nations with persons, allowing them personhood, and imagining them as corporeal beings was not something I had encountered... and Prof. Cleary's insights allowed me to question my own beliefs regarding trauma. I think, actually, this course also changed my perception of 'God'... The Christian Church has been mysteriously silent on the subject of \"Holy Saturday.\" There are, of course, prayers and liturgical readings for this Blessed Sabbath, but this holy day has been cast to the side, barely acknowledged in parish life. Why do anything on Saturday, when Easter Sunday awaits us in the morning? That pious pining for the Resurrection always bothered me. There is something contrived, grating even, about that ebullient rush into Easter Sunday. Yes, rejoicing is holy, and we should yearn for the celebration of Christs resurrection, but where is the Holy Spirit in that breathless suspension? Prof. Cleary's lectures taught me that one need not jump into joy; it is worthwhile to press into pain, and make it speak to us. Or at least that's what I got from our readings. As Oscar Wilde put it, \"Where there is sorrow, there is holy ground...\" ... and this class was truly a \"holy ground\" for me. I'm really sorry I'm babbling, but I really learned a lot from this class."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Cleary is a marvelous lecturer, and the syllabus was both comprehensive and fascinating. I can only think of strengths for this course-- it was well-conceived, well-organized, and a pleasure to consider all semester. Also, the format of the reading responses was invaluable to my understanding of the texts.",
    "My single suggestion is that reading aloud in class can be more interactive.",
    "The reading list is good, although some works did not seem necessarily to follow from others. At times it was difficult to keep up with all three elements of the course's name and find these elements in the works being read. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the reading and discussions.",
    "The course had a really excellent reading list and the introductions at the beginning of seminar were always helpful and informative. The main problem I saw with the course was that many people seemed to skip doing the reading fairly frequently. If there were more explicit accountability assignments put in place I think discussion could have been more lively. I also found The Golden Bowl to be a real drag on the first half of the semester. It was so long and so dense that I think many students could not find the motivation to finish it. The other readings were all fantastic, though.",
    "The only weakness was my own fault. I was very pressed for time this semester, and really bit off more than I could chew. I could not give this class the time and attention it deserved... and I feel horrible for that, but I learned so much, and I will carry the knowledge and insights with me for the rest of my life."

   "comments": [
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough! This class is essential for any aspiring modernist, since it considers the troubled nature of modernist writings at a pivotal time for Great Britain and America-- and to see how each author\/poet navigates these concerns is illuminating, particularly as the semester goes on and one can consider all of these texts in relation to each other. Professor Cleary is such a brilliant lecturer, and this class was the highlight of my semester.",
    "Yes. It features a fantastic syllabus and understanding of global literary and cultural modernism.",
    "Yes! While there is a lot of reading, I think that if you can keep up with it, it is worthwhile. Also, the two papers are a good way to write about something that really interests you from the course and apply secondary literature.",
    "Absolutely."
