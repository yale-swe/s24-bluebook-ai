    "A helpful overview of constitutional case law that is relevant to any major. You should take this class sometime while at Yale.",
    "Take it if you're cool with not going to class and being equally lost. The only thing that matters in this course is whether or not you wear scarves to class, have political stickers on the front of your new MacBook Pro, and drink coffee while having meetings at Blue State. That my friends is the way to get an A in this class.",
    "YES!Some people say it's overrated, and yes it has a few flaws (lectures can be unstructured at times), but this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It changes the way you think about American history as well as all sorts of current issues.The more you put in the more you get out so doing the reading is great, but you can still do really well in the class without reading (yay wikipedia).It's not worth it if you skip lecture. Seriously, it would be worth it to go to lecture every day even if you aren't taking the class at all.",
    "Not everything it's cracked up to be. Granted, Amar is a wonderful lecturer, really passionate about the Constitution and he wants you to be, as well. You'll look forward to going to lecture. The readings, though, *will* put you to sleep, I guarantee it. Furthermore, though Amar loves lecturing on grand subjects (the intent of the Framers, historical events, etc.), what the exams and T.A.s actually demand is a close, law-school style reading of the cases, which was very difficult for me. This disconnect is why I, and so many others, took the course Credit\/D, which I recommend but really shouldn't be so necessary in a course where the lectures are so good.So, overall, a mixed bag of a course, and far from the blow-your-mind experience I was promised.",
    "Take it.",
    "Con Law was great. Professor Amar I think is a consistently strong lecturer, and at times is very, very good. There is a lot of work in the class and yet we still manage to skip over bill of rights law. I enjoyed it a lot and would highly recommend it as a way to understand our country and its thought and historical tradition much better.",
    "Amar is fantastic, but make sure you want to endlessly compare the contexts of different cases. Which is what law is. Seemingly 4\/5 kids will want to be lawyers, and then the fifth (me) is thinking, ugh.",
    "It is very good if you are interested in the background of the constitution and all different types of cases. If you are willing to keep up with the reading you should take it. If you wont do the reading then you really shouldn't take this class.",
    "Take this class.",
    "Great class. There's a reason it's one of the most sought after classes at Yale",
    "Conlaw is worth the work. Akhil Amar is brilliant (and famous), and his lectures are generally very interesting. Take it because you should know about these cases - they've shaped American history and policy - and you'll feel like you've come out of the class with a lot of important knowledge. Also, Elizabeth Kelly is an awesome TA.",
    "It's Constitutional Law. You read lots of cases, mostly from the Supreme Court, but you also explore how the law has taken shape thanks to the other two branches of government's involvement. You will either love it or hate it, but Amar is genius. However, given his genius, you are almost guaranteed to not be able to keep up half the time.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take it credit\/d so you can enjoy it and not take mindless notes.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend it. You have to take it at some point during your Yale career.",
    "Survey of conlaw, covers a huge amount, some interesting, some not. A lot of reading is expected, but if you get a good set of notes from someone who has taken the class before, you should be fine.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would if you take it seriously and attend lectures. Attending lectures and just listening is enough if you have class notes which are widely available.",
    "PLSC 223 was an overview of how American Constitutional Law functions. Even if you have no interest in law, I think the class is worth taking because it makes you a better citizen - the Constitution impacts every American's daily life and therefore deserves time spent studying it. The reading load is pretty heavy (as is the book!) but worth it and you will get more out of the class if you keep up with the reading throughout the semester. If you're unsure, start it Credit\/D and then switch, because the grading isn't as harsh as everyone thinks it will be.",
    "This class is what you make of it. I took it Cr\/D. It's really hard to stay on top of all the material, but if you do, you will learn A LOT. I learned a lot, but since I took it Cr\/D, I could relax if I ended up behind. You can definitely get by Cr\/D without going to class or doing the reading, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice.",
    "definitely take it before you graduate",
    "What an incredible course. Lots of reading, do it, because it's fun. Take this course, if it's offered, make it a priority, because who knows when it'll be offered again.Also, like Intro Psych, History of Art, etc.... this is a good Credit\/D class. But if that's going to cause you to slack off on the readings, then don't do it.",
    "It really depends on what you want to get out of the course. If you have space in your schedule and you aren't sure what to take then do it but in retrospect I wouldn't take Con. Law over another course. The material is interesting and very important to learn. I found the beginning to be the most interesting, and that it began to drag on after a while.",
    "It's a good course because you leave with a good overview of Constitutional law. But, lectures get confusing, and there are a murderous amount of readings...",
    "I would recommend Con Law. It's not my thing. I took it to learn about the Constitution so I could be a better citizen, and I think it was a great opportunity. If you are like me and just want to learn more, it's doable. Just keep in mind that there are a lot of experts in the class so you don't beat yourself up. When else will you have the chance in your life to take a class with someone and respected and knowledgable as Akhil Amar?",
    "Very interesting material but an overwhelming amount of reading and the lectures are not very helpful if you didn't understand the reading. If you want to do well, you have to work hard to keep up. Akhil Amar loves to hear himself talk, and doesn't really seem to care if anyone is understanding what he says as long as he gets to say it. Overall, overrated. I took it Credit D and didn't do much of the work\/class-going, which is probably why I got so little out of it. If you're really interested in the stuff and have the time in the semester to commit to reading and studying, I'm sure it would be worth it. Otherwise, not.",
    "This is a great course to take if you're considering going to law school or are at all interested in Constitutional Law. Professor Amar is a wonderful lecturer and his lectures make the class worthwhile to take on their own. There's a lot of reading, but most of it is interesting and the exams are fair (only a midterm and final, with an optional research paper for extra credit). I would definitely recommend taking this course, especially if Professor Amar is teaching it.",
    "Take it - it's a quintessential Yale class. I'd recommend credit\/D unless you're planning on doing ALL of the reading. And there's a lot.",
    "I recommend this class. It's fantastic. Just be careful of the workload!",
    "This class is a good credit\/D\/fail class, not too much reading and work if you want to take it for a grade.",
    "Yes, and if you're interested in the material, ignore all those scaredy-cats who take it Cr\/D\/F. I'm not so sure I'd like to go to law school, I didn't do all the reading, but I enjoyed the class and excelled. You really get to let your mind wander and think about things--the laws and limits and meanings of our Constitution and the ideas of brilliant scholars--in fun and interesting ways.",
    "Awesome class. Amar is insanely smart and really open to questions and inquiries. Gives a good, in-depth examination of the Constitution and its role in modern society. A ton of reading which you should definitely do; its a difficult class that requires a lot of work to do well, but if\/when you survive, it will inform your understanding of law and society.",
    "Do it. But make sure you're not taking any other treaty\/\"legal\" courses alongside it. Take a creative writing course, for godssake.",
    "I loved this class. Definitely my favorite of the semester. People say it's very difficult, but it's really not at all. It's a lot of reading, but the two tests are quite easy, and there's only one paper. That said, it's all fascinating, and Amar is fantastic. His lectures are amazing, and he has weekly lunches to get to know students better, nullifying the main drawback of such a huge class. Every American should take this class, and I can't fathom anyone wouldn't fall in love with the stuff.",
    "Yes. Definitely. The huge red tome assignedfor this course is very informative and accessible. The TAs are all very well chosen. Professor Amar is one of the best professors at Yale, and he really does seem to care about how his students perform. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--it's one of those classes you should take before leaving Yale.",
    "One of the key Yale classes. Not a bad one to take credit-D. You will still get a lot out of the class without worrying about the heavy reading load.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It gives you a new perspective on how supreme court cases are decided and the relationship between the court and other branches of government. Professor Amar is amazing, and you shouldn't miss the opportunity to take a class on con law with him. There is a lot of reading but it is not at all unmanageable if you pace yourself, and the midterm and final are both reasonable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. A ton of reading that is almost all interesting and a look at the American political system that many just don't have. Just try to come to class prepared and take every opinion (both the ones the the cases and Amar's) with a grain of salt. You get the most out of the class when you challenge almost everything. It takes a lot of time, but it's so worth it.",
    "Con Law is fantastic, just be aware that it is a lot of work that you'll have to put in to get the most out of it. I made the mistake this semester of taking this with four other classes and I regret it - the material is facinating and the Amar's lectures are great, but it does consume a lot of time. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Great class. Must take if you want to be a truly educated citizen and aware of the momentous cases that have transformed our nation. Material is so interesting as a whole but, as with reading any case, the reading can get dull.",
    "Great course. I had very little American History background but found the course to be accessible (difficult at first though). It really gets you thinking about the difficult questions in our society. Definitely a class you cannot miss while you're at Yale.",
    "Great intro to conlaw, even if you don't have any prior background. Get Haley Nix as your TA if you can!",
    "I took this for a grade, and do not think I could have enjoyed the class otherwise. This is a class that is impossible to enjoy without putting in the effort and doing the casebook readings, if not on time then at some point. Amar's lectures will make no sense to you if you decline to do this. Other than that advice, I would say it is eminently worthwhile taking the class if you want to gain a deeper understanding of the Constitution and how it and courts' interpretations of it have shaped American history\u0097and are currently in the process of shaping our future. If your only basis for taking this class is Amar's reputation, you will regret it, not because he does not live up to the hype\u0097he definitely does\u0097but you will not appreciate the class because you will not have the motivation to put the effort into learning the material. Overall, this is an excellent class which has made me a more astute observer of my country's politics as a result of having taken it. A final note: while this is by no means as rigorous as a law school class, it does offer a great introduction to legal writing and the types of reading (e.g. 1500-page casebook!) that takes place in law school. This makes it a good opportunity to test your aptitude\/enjoyment in studying law, if you're considering it for the future.",
    "A solid course on Constitutional Law. It's a lot of reading though and the exams are pretty difficult so if you are not okay with getting a B or B+, take the class credit\/d\/fail.",
    "DO NOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING THIS CLASS. Also, do the reading. You won't regret it. If you don't finish Amar's book, read it over the summer. He's phenomenal.",
    "This is a great class! Definitely take it before you graduate! Also, if you want to take a class credit\/D, this is a great one....one midterm, optional section, 5 pg. response paper, and a final. Professor Amar is the man.",
    "It's a beginner's look at constitutional law. It really shows you the laws that underpin everything about the American legal system. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Unlike most of my peers, I was extremely disappointed with Professor Amar's teaching skills. He mumbled frequently and his drawings on the chalkboard were too light and thus unreadable. Also, he frequently cut himself off in the middle of sentences, leading most of his lectures to be incomprehensible. If I didn't have section, I would be totally lost.That being said, my section was great! It made everything totally clear. While the course was a lot of work, I loved the subject matter so it was really fun for me. Also, the exams are open book and open notes, so definitely take this class! If you do the reading, go to section, and can stand the lectures, of course...",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "You know this already - great class, show up to lecture, etc. etc. One note: If you get the Bible (the old set of notes), you really don't even NEED the book. Save yourself $174. I know this sounds absurd, but it's actually true.",
    "You can get away with doing very little work and still getting a decent grade, but do as much of the reading and stuff if you can, you'll get a lot more out of the class. Amar is a great teacher but he talks fast and thinks fast so it's easy to just let his voice wash over you...do your best to pay attention.",
    "TAKE IT. Seriously. You need to. Come on. It's Akhil Amar. You have to do it. Fine fine, take it credit d if you must. But go to lecture. Please. If you like America at all. Or the law. Or Yale.",
    "Take it if you have even the remotest interest in the topic or in American history.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Super interesting lectures and readings. There is a lot of reading, and I would recommend doing it--I know some people who got by without it, but it is really worth it to do as much as you can. You definitely do get out of this class what you put into it. Definitely take a section, it is very helpful to be able to talk in a smaller group about the cases.",
    "Really, really interesting subject material. Lots of reading. You have to love the idea of Con Law to take this class though.",
    "Interesting",
    "Required knowledge for Americans. Also, great CRDF class.",
    "Excellent class. A must for any Yale student.",
    "If you want to learn about the law or go to law school take it. If not, definitely don't because it is not easy.",
    "I took it Cr\/D and honestly thought it was a little bit overrated. A good course, but not mindblowing or anything.",
    "The most work you will EVER do for a polysci course. Seriously though, you have got to have the time to put into the work if you want to do well. If you think the reading is bad initially, just wait until after the midterm! That aside, the most worthwhile class I have ever taken at Yale. Do not graduate without at least credit\/D-ing this one.",
    "Not being offered next year, but when it's offered again, TAKE IT!!! Akhil Amar is a legend for a reason. Granted, he's extremely opinionated, and you might not agree with everything he says, but he tells you that up front and then proceeds to give you a really detailed and fascinating analysis of different parts of our founding document and the Supreme Court cases that have interpreted it over the years. He doesn't cover everything (strikingly, there's almost no Bill of Rights stuff except through all of the 14th Amendment cases we look at), but he gives really persuasive readings of the Constitution and critiques of different cases. And you really start to be able to think profoundly about the Constitution and you're asked on the exams not just to spout out cases but, based on the current jurisprudence AND ON YOUR OWN READING OF THE CONSTITUTION, how the Court should rule on a certain Issue. It's just a wonderful experience if you're at all interested in law or, more importantly, what makes our country tick. (Also, as a side-note, it would be a great class to take Credit\/D because, even though you get the most out of actually reading the casebook, you can do well and learn a lot just from listening to Amar's lectures and occasionally looking up a case online.)",
    "This was a great class, though it requires a lot of work. Scrambling to finish all the reading at the end of the course was not fun, and you'll get much more out of the class if you do the reading before lecture. That being said, Akhil Amar is a legend, and for good reason - even if you didn't do the reading he'll still blow your mind.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Akhil Amar is one of the most brilliant people in the world and the total expert on this stuff. GO TO THE LUNCHES WITH HIM. You don't need to be prepared or caught up on the reading, but you can just go and listen to a brilliant guy say interesting stuff for an hour. It's so worth it.Taking it Cr\/D was a good call since it took all the pressure off. Don't worry about the readings too much; try to get access to a good briefing of all the cases.",
    "Take. Hearing Amar lecture twice a week is worth it. And if you get a good TA, section will help you understand the larger ideas of the course very well.",
    "Fantastic course. Take it. Don't be afraid of the work load, it's really not that bad. If you take it credit\/d\/fail it's especially easy and you can just sit back and enjoy Con Law - a great experience.",
    "AMAZING. Akhil loves the subject, and that energy spreads to entire class.",
    "I would definitely recommend, but be prepared for a massive workload. The 8 hour midterm and 24 hour final will be some of the worst days of your life, but emerging from the class is a huge accomplishment.",
    "Not as legendary as you've heard. Good to take if you're thinking about going to law school.",
    "Take this class. Really interesting, not as much work as people say it is, and a great professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely considering attending law school or studying the law in any respect. This course is relatively demanding - although there is literally no weekly homework, the reading is far from light. That being said, the course is incredibly interesting, and every Yale student should take advantage of the opportunity to experience Prof. Amar's lectures.",
    "If you graduate from Yale and did not take this course, you will have missed out. Really, I do not care if you are thinking about law school or not, you should take this course.",
    "It's a lot of reading, but the lectures are amazing. Also, section is really helpful.",
    "This is the best course I have ever taken. If you are American, you need to take this course. If you are not American, you should learn about American government and then you need to take this course.",
    "This was my first political science class, and I learned a lot. Not only do I now know the major Constitutional cases, but I also learned about American history and society in the process. It's a large lecture with sections, and there is a huge study guide, but going to class was nice because you got to see Amar in all his passion and glory.",
    "This was a fantastic class that everyone with an interest in political science or law should take.",
    "Take this course! It's a good overview of the American Constitutional system, and you'll learn a ton about how the justice system works and has evolved. There's a lot of reading but split up or get old copies of the notes and you'll be fine.",
    "This is an excellent Cr\/D class. The lectures are interesting, and section is great if you get the right TA. You don't have to do all the readings (there's a lot of it) if you're taking it Cr\/D and have a really good study guide.",
    "There is a lot of reading in this course and you have to be very committed to keep up with it all. You really have to enjoy the material to be able to keep up with it. I frequently found it hard to pay attention in lecture, but that may be because I almost never did the reading and didn't really know what was going on.",
    "I recommend this class! Amar is engaging, the material is very interesting, and it gives you the chance to think like a lawyer. It's a lot of reading, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "Definitely. The Constitution is so much more important and more full of meaning than people realize. I was already a Constitution\/SCOTUS nerd before taking this course, but seriously best class I took this year.",
    "Everyone should take this course.",
    "Great class, but hard to keep up in the reading. You'll definitely get more out of it if you keep up though. Professor Amar is a great lecturer. Definitely recommend the class.",
    "You learn a lot about both the history of our current political state and the structure of the constitution. Lots of reading. Hard to stay focused for whole course. on the whole really enjoyed it though.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it though the reading load is quite heavy.",
    "If you like debate or arguments, this class is a good place to discuss them. I'd recommend it to anyone who has enough time to read the material.",
    "This is truly a must-take class. Amar is as incredible and inspiring a professor as you will ever find.",
    "Amar is a fantastic lecturer. He is engaging and thought provoking. But I think that he should really have a better syllabus. If you're taking this course, make a list of the cases that you'll have to read (rather than pages in the BLBA), that way you can just read cases and fill in the other stuff later. He really likes to skip around, so it can be very difficult to know what to read for the next class.",
    "A great class, fun to listen to, do as much or as little work as you like and you'll be fine. I wish I had had more time to do readings, since I would have gotten more out of the *brilliant* lectures.",
    "If you're lucky enough to have it offered, take it. It's something you might not be able to do ever again.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are trying to get a feel of what law school is like and if you are interested in Constitutional Law or how the constitution works in general.",
    "Very interesting, very easy credit D. All exams are open book.",
    "An awesome class that teaches you so much about this country that it seems almost like a duty to take it. My understanding of American history and law is forever greater",
    "just a warning that if you take this class credit\/d, you won't get nearly as much from it (unless you are actually dedicated and still do the reading&attend lecture)",
    "Amazing courses, but not really worth it to credit d, only take if you are willing to put the work in, and then it will be a very rewarding experience",
    "Yes. Excellent, thorough analysis of constitutional law. Excellent preparation for law school. Very fun, challenging way to do some very rigorous thinking from one of the world\u0092s top experts.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Even if you're not a PoliSci major (I'm an MCDB major), this class gives you a lot of great general knowledge that you should have just as a citizen. Amar covers a lot of history and present social issues as he teaches ConLaw, so it's a very enriching class generally even if you don't plan on being a lawyer.",
    "No, not unless the student has interest in law specifically. The course is difficult to follow at times.",
    "MUST TAKE CLASS AT YALE. You will learn SO MUCH from this class, and you'll enjoy it - Amar is one of the best lecturers ever. I LOVED this class.",
    "Highly recommend it without reservation.",
    "Take it. No questions asked. You will not regret it in the least.",
    "This class is a Yale classic, and with reason. Con Law is an interesting, intellectually stimulating, and relevant field. It is exciting to read, analyze, and synthesize important cases, both those you've heard of and those you haven't. Akhil Amar is a passionate, funny lecturer, though a little hard to follow at times. If you want to get a lot out of the class, try to do as much of the reading as possible. I (like a lot of people) took it Credit\/D\/Fail, but I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if I'd taken it for a letter grade and done more of the readings, had lunch with Professor Amar, talked more in section, and done the research paper (all of which were essentially optional). In other words, you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "great course, very good credit\/d class but really try to do the reading and keep up with lectures, otherwise it is not worth it",
    "It's con law--you have to take it. You can get by and perhaps even do quite well in the course even if you do only a fraction of the assigned reading, but you get a TON more out of the class if you put in the work. Amar has very interesting things to say about the course material, but you won't be able to appreciate the brilliance of his insights if you don't read and try to understand the material before lecture. All in all, highly recommended.",
    "It's a ton of reading. However, Akhil Amar isn't grading you- a TA is. Don't believe the hype so much that this is a terrifying, daunting class. It is very interesting. I would recommend taking the reading as a challenge, and actually doing it. Overall, I had a very enjoyable experience with the class. I really learned a lot about our country and the way our society can operate so peacefully.",
    "Definitely take this class. You will appreciate America so much more than you probably do right now. Amar is an awesome professor and is really engaging.",
    "This class is great--Akhil Amar is unbelievable, and you'll learn a lot of con law. I would say, though, that you probably shouldn't take this course unless you're genuinely interested in the legal system. The problem with must-take classes is that they carry a lot of hype; if you go in expecting too much, you might be let down.Keep in mind, in particular, that there is A LOT of reading for this class. If you do all the reading (and you should, people: you don't pay to party, and you'll learn a ton), it will take a substantial amount of time. It actually wasn't awful for the first part; I had just taken Gateway to Global Affairs, and con law was pretty comparable, if not lighter, in terms of reading load. If you've done humanities\/intense social sciences, you'll probably be fine. The main difference, I think, is that this reading is DENSE. 30 pages in the casebook takes me as long as around 100 pages of other reading (for classes). Something to remember...Overall, I'm very glad I took this class; I thoroughly enjoyed studying for the final, and I've learned a ton about constitutional law. Interestingly, though, I went into the class pretty sure I'd be a lawyer...and now I'm not so sure. I love law, to be sure, but I don't know if I want to give my life to it. But hey--maybe that alone makes it worth it. Regardless, it's a great class, and Akhil Amar is what every professor should strive to be.",
    "yes. i'm an intl student and this was an amazing way to learn about the US. take it credit d.",
    "Definitely take this class. Amar is a great lecturer and it's one of those \"must take\" Yale classes. The reading load is pretty intense, so it's also a good class to start off Credit\/D.",
    "Absolutely, even if you don't want to be a lawyer.",
    "Constitutional law is a great course that provides a fantastic opportunity for a student to learn about the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the history of the American government. Professor Amar is a fantastic lecturer, though his lectures are often somewhat scatter-brained. He can be hard to follow and he goes off on tangents; however, he also gives his own opinions and relates all of the topics we cover to current events and relevant issues. He finds a way to relate these Constitutional issues to your life in a way that helps you piece the ideas together. Be aware, though, that there is a lot of very, very dense reading. Amar does not always cover all of the reading in class, which can be very frustrating. Not all of the reading is particularly interesting, and hundreds of pages of cases and academia are devoted to things like property rights, which can become somewhat boring. The reading at the end of the semester, though still very comprehensive and time-consuming, is the most exciting. The last few weeks are devoted to rights and create an exciting way to end the semester.",
    "It's a lot of reading, but definitely worth it. It really isn't as horribly difficult as people like to say it is as long as you stay on top of it. My favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this class with Amar. He's great, and the exams are actually really fun because you are basically a judge and get to decide a fake case.",
    "Absolutely take it. It is probably the most fascinating and inspiring class I've taken at Yale, and it shouldn't be missed. That said, there is quite a bit of reading - I found I really enjoyed doing the reading but I know that wasn't true for everybody.",
    "great class, interesting material, do all the reading",
    "This class is great. I'd suggest taking it when you have time to make it the centerpiece of your schedule to really get the most out of it. Definitely take a section. You've probably heard that it's one of those take-this-before-graduating classes, and there's a reason for that. I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Take this class. Amar is an excellent lecturer and a great scholar. After this class, you'll be a better informed citizen and be able to understand the news a lot better. There is a ton of reading, especially after the midterm, but you should do it. It's interesting and worthwhile. I would recommend not to take it Credit\/D, because you'll get a lot more out of the class if you take it very seriously. The exams can be a true learning experience if you have a grasp of the material. It also might be worth it to take this class during a lighter semester, so that you can do more of the reading.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Constitutional Law. If you've never studied the Constitution before, you'll learn a lot about it that you never knew, and if you have studied it before to some extent, this class will massively expand your knowledge of the Constitution. So if you have interest in the Constitution, I would strongly recommend this class. Personally, I think knowledge of the Constitution is pretty invaluable, so I'd basically recommend the class to anyone.That said, if you decide to take this class, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, I would take it seriously (i.e. not credit\/D). If you are going to get a letter grade, you'll probably feel compelled to read most of the cases, which is essential to actually absorbing the material. Second, you should know what reading you have to do and what you can skip. The cases are the most important thing to read. I did not find Akhil Amar's book helpful (so I skipped most of that reading). But if you know the cases, you should be able to do well on the tests. Finally, Professor Amar is very political and very left. Just know that not everyone accepts his opinions and that when he expresses his left-wing views as facts (e.g. that it's obviously true that PPACA is constitutional), there are many strong legal minds out there that disagree. In other words, don't take everything he says as the incontrovertible, settled law.",
    "Every American should take this class.",
    "Con Law is great. It's a must-take class at Yale, especially if you're interested in law school.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a crash course in con law. There is a ton of reading, so be prepared for that, but at the end of the day, there are few better introductions (or reviews) of the major issues of the constitution. Akhil Amar is extremely intelligent, and while he can be polarizing, this fact should not be a reason to forgo the class.",
    "I think that the evaluations that I have seen for this course were quite generous. Amar is a good lecturer, but the subject material gets extremely dry after the first couple lectures. If you take the class, be sure to take section - it makes you keep up (at least a bit) with what's going on in the class. Midterm, final, and one 5 page paper. Midterm and final can be taken as take-home exams.",
    "Yes, this is a must take class! The work is manageable, and you learn so much. Do not graduate from Yale without taking this class!",
    "I would recommend it if you're trying to understand one preeminent constitutional law scholar's take on the subject, and are prepared to independently follow the reading\/outline. The exams require a deeper grasp of the material than Amar or your TA will provide you with, so having a strong outline or making one yourself is critical. Don't take the class if you're just going to coast along w\/ the lectures, you probably won't get much out of it.",
    "Yes, it is a great course which teaches one a lot about Constitutional Law and how our legal system works.",
    "Con. Law was a great class. The reading really picked up during the second half of the semester, but the subject-matter, Professor Amar, and the TAs were all incredible. Even if you don't have a particularly large interest in constitutional law, the class offers an incredibly interesting lens into America's history and teaches information that everyone should have at least some familiarity with (even if you're taking it Credit\/D).",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but personally, I wish I had taken the class my junior year rather than freshman year. I think I would have gained more from the class intellectually laster on in my Yale career. I took the class credit\/d, which was great because I did all the reading without having to worry about missing a case or two along the way. I got to learn the material because I wanted to, not because I felt pressured about a grade which was refreshing.",
    "Take this class! Professor Amar is an amazing lecturer and I learned so much from him. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, and not just people interesting in going to law school.",
    "This is a Yale must-take. Amar is fabulous and the material was fascinating.",
    "Con Law is a must-take class! Taking it Credit\/D was a great choice for me because I got to learn all of the material but didn't have to be so worried about reading everything (and the reading load is very heavy). I'm so happy I took Con Law and I would definitely recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Professor Amar is a truly brilliant professor. His lectures are very thorough and engaging, and makes it his mission to guide us in connecting cases not only to each other, but as they can apply in the world around us today. Yes the readings may be extremely time consuming, but it is definitely a very rewarding class to take.",
    "Take this class Credit\/D. The lectures are fantastic, but there's too much reading to stress over.",
    "Great overview of major constitutional issues.",
    "You will not do all the reading. You will learn so much. You need to take the class.",
    "Political Science 233 as taught by Akhil Amar is an amazing class that is both informative and interesting. There is a lot of reading involved, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a better grasp of U.S. law, especially if Akhil Amar is teaching it, because it was fantastic. I would also recommend considering starting the course as a Credit\/D\/Fail, and then deciding later whether or not to take it for a grade.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Amar is an incredibly engaging and passionate lecturer. All of the TAs are wonderful--I had Jud Matthews, who was absolutely superb. The material is interesting and good for anyone to know! We read iconic cases, but also develop a sense of how the law is formed in this country, and how historical events and the composition of the Court have as much to do with the decision as the facts of any individual case. The midterm and final are actually kind of fun to write; they are issue-spotter fact patterns, in which you're given a hypothetical scenario and must apply your knowledge of case law to resolve the legal issues in question. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. It's only offered every two years, so plan accordingly!",
    "Great overview of Con Law. Amar has some rather funky views, but that's not even a minus. Lectures are amazing. Also: SIGN UP FOR SECTION. Not only do you get more out of it, you _need_ it for review."
