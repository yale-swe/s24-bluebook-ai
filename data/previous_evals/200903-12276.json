    "This was an excellent class! Jessica cares a lot about her students as both people and artists. I feel like by the end of the class I was able to break from stereotypical, empty artistic gestures and start to make work that actually expressed something for me. We also did a lot of reading over the weekends, but you can skip it if you have work in other classes. The reading adds a lot to the class I think, but it is definitely possible to get by without it. We had a few one-page summaries and responses to different art styles and one 3-5 page paper. We had to make a collage or series of pages once a week to show in class.",
    "Many friends have looked at awe and jealousy and my interesting readings and collage assignments. If you are interested in art, literature, and discussion as a combined form, TAKE THIS COURSE! Do NOT be afraid because you are not an artist. I am a complete beginner, as were most of the other students. You will grow as an artist WITH the course!!",
    "Take this class! Really though it's not often that you get the chance to work on scrapbooks in class. So many people who I told about it wished they had taken it. I learned so much in this class. It opened my eyes to new ways of expression. I learned from my classmates as well, seeing their work each week. Doing the homework is alot of fun and the readings were always interesting. By the time the class was over I was left with a bulky scrapbook filled with the work I created. I definitely will be continuing on with my scrapbook!",
    "Do you see yourself as a collector? A traveler? A journalist? An illustrator? Do you desire to expand your artistic creativity with an intimate environment of 10 students or less? This class teaches the artistic skills and history behind the creation of visual biographies, covering an array of mediums including scrapbooks, films, diaries, photographies, and museum galleries. Every week we visit the BeineckeLibrary for a hands on experience to read diaries by Langston Hughes, or interpret vintage albums of Hilda Doolittle. The reading and writing is managable. The teacher is phenomenally encouraging. And by the end of the semester, you will get in the habit of raiding trash bins and searching the ground for miscellaneous treasures to stick into your own growing scrapbook. I recommend this seminar for anyone who loves creativity, especially to those who do not wish major in art but seek a wonderfully imaginative escape.",
    "Art 001 is...a spectacular explosion of personal experience, others' experiences, memory and nostalgia, captured on the malleable pages of an A4 moleskin notebook. The work is not only enjoyable, it forces you to be innovative and exposes you to a lot of art movements and the people who were involved in them. Althought this might sound like an art history class (and there are certainly some elements of that in it), our focus has been on their personal lives. Because its a course in studies in visual biography, we explored their personal notebooks, diaries, scrapbooks, letters and resonded to the work we saw.I would definately recommend it!",
    "Although students will look at a wide variety of source material, from photographs to primary sources such as date books, this is, at the end of the day, an art class. Learning to think visually can be a challenging and daunting task. Nonetheless, the challenge is rewarding, and Jessica is very supportive of any creative directions the individual student might take.I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in exploring different mediums of expression. The class asks the student to respond first emotionally, and then visually, allowing the art to become personal in a way it can't in most beginner art classes."
