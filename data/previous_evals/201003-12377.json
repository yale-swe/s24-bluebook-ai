    "This is a fairly non-stressful second semester quantum course. Not a heavy workload- we only had six problem sets, a midterm presentation, and a final exam. That said, the problem sets weren't terribly relevant to the lectures, so if you want to keep up with the material you're going to have to do it on your own. You could probably go the entire semester without knowing most of what's going on and be fine.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot, the material was interesting and the workload was not particularly high. I recommend this student to anyone who wants to learn about Quantum Mechanics, but realistically the only people who will take this course are those who are required to do so.",
    "Take it if you're intensive physics major, don't take it otherwise. This course is actually substantially less interesting than the first semester, so don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Not a fun course, became very uninterested very quickly as the teaching and material becomes simply not fun to learn.",
    "Physics 441 is an interesting class. It teaches you the important calculational techniques in Quantum Mechanics. You will learn how to approach realistic problems and models, and I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "If you're a physics major, you SHOULD take this course. It covers the ways in which one would actually use quantum mechanics to solve real physical problems. This is very important, if not one of the most important courses for an undergrad student. Must take.",
    "This class is very difficult. Take it only if you are absolutely sure you want to do an intensive B.S. in physics."
