    "This is grand strategy part two. You spend four weeks figuring out what the hell is going on in the world, and then you spend the next eight weeks coming up with solutions to the world's issues. Then, you go through a crisis simulation--probably one of the best academic experiences of my life. Work: two presentations (high stakes) and a final paper.",
    "If you greatly value your own importance, this is the course for you. If you value your education, go literally anywhere else at Yale.",
    "An iconic class at Yale. Love it or hate it, but take it.",
    "Yes - fantastic course. Take it if you can get in!",
    "Nope. Not in a million years.",
    "Great. Interdisciplinary. Intellectually fascinating. Take it.",
    "Absolutely take it. You learn a great deal you won't learn anywhere else.",
    "I would primarily recommend this course for undergraduates or for young graduate students with limited professional experience. The skills imparted in the fall semester are useful, but at a somewhat basic level. In some ways, the fall semester feels like the penance one pays for getting to take the spring semester seminar and to do the summer project.",
    "I would recommend this class. The second semester work was a lot more independent -- it really is up to you and the rest of your team how much time you want to spend working on your Marshall Briefs. The experience of crafting and delivering a Marshall Brief was the single hardest yet most rewarding academic project I've had so far. Just this experience alone is worth taking the class. But wait! There's more! Our professors are also just amazing. Incredible professors. They always provide really great feedback and are more than happy to meet with you individually to talk more in depth on any topic you are interested in. Overall, a great class, highly recommend, would do again.",
    "If you like big, tough questions, yes. If you despise groupwork, no. If you are good at speaking at length on topics you know little about, yes. If not, maybe try for something else.",
    "I would not recommend it to a graduate student."

    "Good preparation for public speaking, civil service.",
    "Changed my time at Yale -- for the better. I apply so many of the principles of GS to aspects of every day life.",
    "Gave me great opportunities for research, and more or less defined the field of Grand Strategy for me.",
    "I really got a lot out of researching and writing the final GS paper - this was something of a formative experience for me, as it turned into something of a mini-thesis and will be the basis for future research, hopefully.",
    "This course, more than any other I have taken at Yale, gave me a framework through which to think about the world."
