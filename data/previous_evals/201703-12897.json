    "A very firm base with regards to Russian society and politics pre- and post-revolution. Also an ability to engage with primary sources, and some helpful tips about how and where to find them at Yale.",
    "Detailed knowledge of how modern Russia formed. The best skill I gained was by far a writing one - Professor Antonov gave each student a writing textbook, and this proved to be (and will continue to be) valuable to me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor talked basically the whole time and there was little discussion throughout the course.",
    "Perhaps some more lively readings here and there. Some of the essays assigned us were riveting, but sometimes reading 40 dry pages about a somewhat obscure minister's slow battle with railroad reforms in provincial 1880s Russia sent me into a considerable depression. On the whole, Professor Antonov did bring the readings to life, and put them in unexpected and exciting context in class.",
    "The strengths are the fascinating literature that Professor Antonov assigns each week. I loved doing the reading. The only weakness from this fantastic course is that on the syllabus there were supposed to be twelve discussion posts, from which the lowest two were dropped, but in reality we only did ten, without any chance to make up a missed one - perhaps this syllabus change could have been explained to us during the course?"

   "comments": [
    "Unless you're really interested in Russian history, i would probably avoid this seminar. Professor has an odd teaching style and way of communicating with his students. He is not very clear and doesn't really explain what he expects from you.",
    "The workload is somewhat large -- usually around 300 pages per week, and for a class as small as 6 people, you would really need to do your readings! I would recommend this class to someone who might be interested in Russian history -- you dont have to be sure about that, or have any prior knowledge, the materials are extremely interesting and quite expansive both in terms of time period and focuses, so you will surely find something interesting from the class.",
    "Yes. Learning about the Russian Revolution is one of the most challenging things a brain can handle every possible aspect of human life was different to the life we live today. Prof. Antonov somehow gave us ways into that moment in history which I would never have found myself, from material culture, to trials and the legal system, to cookbooks. It's the perfect history course in that regard.",
    "Yes definitely! It gives you the fundamental knowledge you need to understand Russia and its culture, a country that is becoming increasingly important every day, and Professor Antonov has some incredible insights and facts. A truly great history seminar."
