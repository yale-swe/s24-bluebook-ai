    "Definitely recommend. Good environment, good department.",
    "Recommended for anyone who wants to learn Italian and is actually prepared to speak it and not English in class.",
    "Definitely take the class if you're interested in learning the language. It doesn't feel like too much work from day to day, but you'll realize how just much you've learned at the end of the semester!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If you are at all interested in learning Italian, this will teach you a lot of the language very quickly. It helps a lot to have studied a Romance language before. A lot of studying is required and the pace is pretty quick.",
    "This is a fun introductory course to Italian. The Italian department does a good job with this class. The class is fun, but you also learn a ton of italian!",
    "Italian 110 03 was a wonderful course in which you could not only learn so many words and grammatical points in a little amount of time, but you could also quickly grasp a better understanding of the Italian culture.I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to learn italian!"
