    "Amazing class. You start with looking at good musical theater songs -- what makes the lyrics, the melody and the accompaniment all work together to get the story across? Then you are given lyrics and told to put them to music. Then you're given music and told to write lyrics. Finally, it's time to write your own songs! There's a different assignment each week. This is a fantastic course. I ended up with five songs that I'm really proud of, and I'm hoping to keep composing in the future.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in Musical Theater composition. The class gives you a rare opportunity to explore composition and receive Yale credit. If you already compose on your own time, this is a golden opportunity to bring many of your ideas and works in front of professionals and other musically inclined students. I could not recommend this more.",
    "Music 214 is composition for musical theatre. It is an amazing class that allows you to explore this idiom at a very high and sophisticated level as you grow each week from the instructor's comments. The assignments were extremely interesting and challenging (for example, write a song that represents the scene from your favorite play or movie or write a comedic song that makes everyone laugh). Incredible opportunity to show off your work at the Shen concert series at the end of the semester -absolutely AMAZING class. Favorite class at Yale so far!!!!!!!!",
    "214 is a great class for anyone interested in learning about musical theatre music and how to write it. It is only an introduction to the genre, but unless you already have significant experience writing this type of music, you should take this! With Josh Rosenblum at least, it's a very fun and relaxed class and will allow you to expand your musical (and lyric-writing) boundaries and interests. Take this class!"
