    "Very accessible science credit for non-science majors.",
    "The course is a little strange. It's more of a directed reading class than anything else, but it's unclear whether the paper is supposed to be an argument or a survey of current literature, and though in both cases I learn a lot, its difficult to tell. I didn't think the weekly updates on our project were effective, though I admit I can't think of what else I would suggest. I actually think that allocating half the class to updates, and half the class to a preassigned topic would be very helpful -- kind of like the Snow reading we did in the first week.",
    "I liked how we are able to learn in-depth about a subject of our choice, through research with the great guidance of Professor Summers. The course also allow you to learn quite a bit about other biological hot topics through other students's research papers and updates."

    "Definitely take this course if you need a science credit (if you can get in). It is an easy course and if you choose an interesting topic, you will be engaged all semester.",
    "This class is just a directed reading class oriented around a final paper. No work at all in the class but you won't learn all that much either. Take if you're just trying to get through the science credit or if you have a topic you really want to engage with deeply with the whole semester.",
