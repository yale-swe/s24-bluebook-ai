    "i wouldn't recommend it because it wasn't as discussion based as I liked, but if you want a small lecture on shakespeare it works.",
    "Yes. To be honest, I took the class because I needed a pre-1800. I'd taken two other Shakespeare classes, and this seminar was the best of them. I felt like I became way more familiar with the texts, in part because Bromwich is brilliant and makes conversations around the plays have real stakes. Sometimes the seminar was scattered, but if you are interested in these plays, it's a great way to engage them.",
    "The course focuses on Shakespeare's political plays. Students are expected be able to compare across plays. Take it if you like Shakespeare or politically minded literature. Don't be afraid to speak in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The seminar is great and Bromwich makes the discussions interesting and thorough.",
    "Each week we read a different Shakespeare play, and discussed the play in the seminar. Professor Bromwich began each class with an introduction that usually focused the direction of the discussion on some kind of political theme within the play of the week- I use \"political\" quite loosely. We often ended up looking at psychological consequences of holding political power (for example Henry V's speech on ceremony) as well as nuancing the motivations behind political power. Overall, the discussions in the class were often intellectually stimulating and challenging, but Professor Bromwich's style also felt very circuitous and confusing at times. I would recommend shopping this class and making your decision whether to take it or not based on your perception of Bromwich's teaching style and how it fits with your own learning style."
