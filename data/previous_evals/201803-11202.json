    "I greatly increased my ability to read and write German, especially in regards to understanding grammar. I also became better at speaking German as the year went on, but I was never as proficient at listening or speaking compared to reading and writing.",

   "comments": [
    "The course does a good job at teaching German grammar and vocabulary. Vocabulary did become less of a focus at the end of the year, which made it more difficult to keep up, but this was largely because grammar became a larger focus due to learning new tenses. I did not like how the homework was structured, specifically when listening to the faster conversations, since the class often would cover the material in a slightly different order than the book, which means we were lacking more vocabulary than we should have in these listening sections. In class however, I think the structure worked very well.",
    "The course is immersive, which is good for us to practice speaking the language. However, there is a gap between the listening we do in class and that we do in tests, and I feel that the lecturer could have better prepared us for the listening tasks."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I think that the class was well taught, and that German as a language is not noticeably more difficult to learn.",
    "Yes- it's overall a well-structured and taught introduction to the German language. I had a couple issues with the way the textbook explains ideas but nothing one can't work through. Excellent overall experience and a good pace to learn new concepts.",
    "Yes, sure",
    "Yes because German is fun to learn!"
