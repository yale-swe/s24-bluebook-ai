   "comments": [
    "No. I would suggest they simply do the assigned readings as they would learn the same amount through them.",
    "The class is an overview of basic behavioral economics, with lectures on neuroeconomics and prospect theory. The latter half deals more with institutional design, focusing on savings, retirement, and investing. I would recommend the class to another student but would definitely caution him or her about the dry lectures that make it discouraging to go to class. The class is a midterm and a final. The final is a 24 hour takehome, which I would advise Shiller and the TAs to change the next time this class is offered, because it is inhumane by design!",
    "If you want to learn about econ in ways that are intuitive and not structured by models and formulas, I would take ECON 527. It was a different type of approach to learning about important principles of economics that aren't directly related to the typical Yale econ classes.",
    "I would recommend it for the material, but not for the caliber of the teaching.",
    "Behavioral Economics analyzes a lot of areas in macroeconomics with a focus on how psychology, sociology and other social sciences could improve our understanding of these issues. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, it was a great learning experience for me.",
    "This class is worth taking for an easy\/interesting lecture! The only work is a midterm & a take home final. Professor Shiller is awesome and well worth listening to (although he rambles). Might need a bit of econ background but not much.",
    "No econ background, and I did well on the midterm. SOM class so I felt like all older business students didn't really care.",
    "It is a big lecture with assigned readings for every class. Little is demanded of you during the semester but the midterm and final are tough. I had done the readings and I found them difficult so I can only imagine how it was for those students who had got behind.",
    "Great content, lectures can be a bit sprawling",
    "Informative course-but not academically rigourous",
    "Be prepared for lots of reading. The readings are very helpful and interesting, but there really is a lot of reading to be done.",
    "I would recommend the course for someone not familiar with behavioural economics as it is a great introduction to the field.",
    "Behavioral Economics is a walk through human flaws and biases, and their consequences for economics and institutions. It is a must for every economist - definitely recommended.",
    "Econ 527 is great for a range of students. I would recommend the course.",
    "An excellent introductory course on how different economies work.",
    "Only if you are very intrinsically motivated, does this course make sense. if you're not very interested yourself, you can get away without working and learning much.",
    "I would not recommend ECON 527. The material was the most interesting part of this course.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn the major themes in the field, good overview course.",
    "Yes, its an interesting course",
    "Yes, absolutely. Shiller is worth your time."

   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of behavioral and institutional economics has broadened by understanding of economics related issues--no question. I think behavioral should be required of every economics major. But my own research will likely not focus on behavioral, so I don't believe it'll have much to contribute there.",
    "It improved my ability to read and analyze economic papers. It also made me more critical. I was able to see how this class connected to my previous knowledge, and I finished with a broader understanding of the major economic areas.",
    "It was more of a survey course. I learned a bit about many topics, but not very much about any one topic.",
    "This course challenged many of the core assumptions made in classical economic theory and made me reconsider many notions that I had previously taken for granted.",
    "I had never taken a behavioral economics course before, but I think it is instrumental for anyone who wants to work in the government or most businesses. The combination of economics with other social sciences is very useful when attempting to determine the efficacy in implementation of a new policy or design, and I think many economists can be caught up in quantifying people rather than realizing the effects of social pressures or asymmetric information.",
    "Behavioral is the other side of economics that is on the rise.",
    "While I was familiar with some topics in behavioural economics, I did value the different perspectives and I certainly learned new things too that I can incorporate into my studies in different subjects.",
    "It didn't contribute directly but it has helped in widening my understanding of a range of topics and in providing me with a framework to analyse a number of issues. Extremely useful.",
    "I think the primary problem of the course was that since it was listed across three schools- Law, Management and Economics, it was catering towards all the three needs and I think in the process, did not manage to address the rigor required for a graduate level course on Behavioral Economics. Nevertheless, I did learn a lot and thought it was somewhat useful to get a flavor of the field.",
    "Great to see the short-comings of mainstream economics, but also nice to know that economics is capable of addressing them within the discipline by including insights from other disciplines"
