    "Like many MCDB majors, I felt like I was forced to take this class. Luckily, it is by far one of the easiest classes I have taken at Yale.The professors all do a great job providing notes of their lectures and the slides, and the bi-weekly quizzes are multiple choice and only go over the most basic concepts of the lecture.I cannot say much about this class versus mol bio since I took this one, however I can say thatif you want a really easy, super gut bio class, take this one.That being said if you are not a bio major you can still take it, it will be just as easy, just keep in mind the curve on the quizzes (out of 10 points) was usually ~8-9, so despite being easy, you DO have to know what is happening.",
    "Actually not a terrible course, but if you're an upperclassman who has taken some upper level biology before coming back to take genetics, you might find it hard to get motivated for class - it isn't aimed at you, it's aimed at the ambitious freshmen and sophomores.Quizzes aren't so hard, but I'm fairly sure the final is harder.",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations. It is an interesting topic and is applicable and important but the way it is presented is not ideal.",
    "Most likely, you'll have to take it for your major, but it's an okay class to take if you wanna get into higher level genetic analysis.",
    "A thorough introduction to macroscopic genetics (with a little molecular stuff at the end). If you're more interested in the larger scale of how genetic processes work\/diversity is generated then this is the class for you.",
    "Take it if you have to for a requirement",
    "This course is interesting. At times, information feels like it comes as a supernova... from all directions andin many little pieces (I haven't taken astronomy so I don't actually know if that's what a supernova does but yolo). Take this course if: 1) you are required to, 2) you are the sort of person who reads books backwards, not to learn to read backwards, but because it is hard, or 3) think you know everything. Actually though, this course is difficult but rewarding. Mastery of the material is not impossible, though neither are flying pigs. Quizzes can range from being easy as Taylor Swift to hard as a really hard rock. Expectations for quizzes are nonexistent. Expectations for the final are slightly moreso, but that's relative. Grading comes primarily from quizzes, the final, and participation in section. Class has interesting format where every other Tuesday, you go to section instead of class and take a quiz and read a scientific paper, so if you don't know how to read, don't take this class (get someone to speak this part aloud to you). Only real work in the class is studying for bi-weekly quizzes and reading the bi-weekly papers (and studying the lectures slides and reading the textbook, if you happen to not be taking any other classes and\/or Hermione Granger). Dellaporta is a clever but sassy guy. Acar is quiet and slow and well spoken. Castro is a fun and nice guy but due to his interesting English, taking his quiz is like trying to spell schizophrenia while drunk and only using three letters. All in all, it was an experience I had to have (it was required), and I'm not sure I'd take it again, but I think I made it out okay (I haven't gotten my grade back yet... but Dellaporta smiled at me as I left the exam room and that's a good sign). If you take this course, good luck.",
    "MCDB is an average course. It has some interesting material, but it is a run of the mill bio course with biweekly quizzes\/paper discussions. I would recommend you take mol bio instead, unless you are fascinated by genetics.",
    "I think genetics was a very good course. It exposed us to many of the ways genetics is important both to biology per se, and to society and disease. Some of the instruction was questionable in clarity, but thankfully the textbook is excellent. I thought the large-scale chromosomal changes chapter was the least interesting of the bunch, while the developmental genetics was most interesting. Dellaporta was the most clear lecturer. Acar's two lecture are sort of a blur. Garcia-Castro races through material and the slides aren't that clear, but he tries hard and gives us chocolate. The quizzes were a good way of keeping us on top of the material. They ranged wildly in difficulty, from horribly difficult and discouraging (Dellaporta's #2 and #3) to too easy (most of the latter ones). Section was stressful because for some reason our participation is worth 25% of our whole grade (as much as the final exam), and participation is based on how many comments we are able to squeeze into the conversation. How can the TA's decide who gets a 4 or a 5 out of 5? Maybe section should be 15% and the final 35%. There is not much work for this course, just section every other Tuesday where we have the quiz and paper discussion. So there actually isn't much work for this class, apart from cramming for the quizzes by reading the textbook.",
    "Pretty easy course if you ask me, you just have to put in work. The material is time-consuming, not necessarily too complicated. You'll have to go to class and really study for the final. Otherwise it's chill.",
    "Fair course. If you are a math\/logic-oriented portion, you'll really appreciate this first half of the course that works more with data. The second half of the course begins to go a bit downhill, but the professors are good and it is nice only having quizzes (multiple choice!) every other week.",
    "Take it if you have to or are really compelled by genetics. There are definitely better biology classes.",
    "A pretty straightforward class. The class wasn't very difficult, but at the end of the semester, I didn't feel like I had learned that much. I was expecting to learn a lot of new concepts in genetics in much more depth, but it was marginally more information than the content presented in an intro biology class. A little disappointing.",
    "Very typical intro biology course. The material is relatively straightforward and the biweekly quizzes keep you on top of the material. Every other Tuesday is a quiz and mandatory discussion section where you discuss a paper. The quizzes are all multiple choice, but the final is problem based so be prepared. The lectures are pretty boring and all the slides are posted. The developmental biology part at the end gets pretty confusing. There is little work on a weekly basis except the nights before the quizzes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The work you put in is really the amount you get out, so dedicate yourself to it, and you will learn so much.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who likes genetics, even if they just need a science credit-- it's not a gut class, but it's also not absurdly difficult. Also the material is interesting.",
    "I'd recommend the class if you're looking for a genetics course that is not too molecular bio heavy and focuses more on analysis.",
    "This class didn't really impress me. There's a disconnect between what's on the quizzes and what's taught in class, and I don't think the class teaches much new material. I took it because it was a requirement for my major, but I didn't really love what we learned.",
    "MCDB202 was a solid course. It taught as many topics under the umbrella of \"genetics\" as possible from population genetics to developmental genetics to the genetics of disease. Garcia-Castro's lectures were phenomenal, Stephen's lectures were jam-packed with new material, and Acar's lectures were interesting (although we only had him for 2 lectures). So you will learn a lot! There is no homework, except there are assigned papers and quizzes every other week, no midterm, and a final. The papers that the professors chose to discuss were great, as they were on lecture material and allowed us to delve deeper into these topics in a challenging environment. The only weakness I saw in this class was the fact that Stephen's sections on the final involved problem-based questions, which, while fair, were not focussed on much at all during the semester. So study the \"assigned problems\" that he gives you during the semester before the final and you should be fine!",
    "Good course for students interested in a beginner\/intermediate level biology course. The lectures are not very interesting, but reading the textbook can clarify most concepts. I did not particularly like any of the professors.",
    "The material is very interesting but the format of the class is odd. I didn't like having three different professors, since each has a very different teaching style. I did like the setup of having a discussion section every other week during lecture period to discuss a research paper.",
    "It's a fine class, not great but not terrible either. The quizzes are rough--I think most people got 6 out of 10 for a lot of the quizzes, which make up 70% of your grade. If you really want to make the most of this class, be sure you take the lab component as well! It really helped me understand the statistical elements of the course (which happens to be a lot of what we talk about--so maybe take a stats course before genetics if you can!)",
    "This was a disappointing course. It essentially was a repeat of BioAP and Biol103 with insignificantly more depth. Also, I'm generally against the idea of using multiple teachers to teach a course, especially because in shopping week, there's really no way to decipher the scope of the teaching ability of all involved faculty members, and there's little continuity or consistency between the teaching styles. All three professors relied heavily on powerpoint presentations to relate messages, rather than thoroughly (and most likely more effectively) utilize any of the blackboards to convey the points they intended to make. The best courses I have taken both in high school and at Yale (especially in science) have made mechanisms, etc. extraordinarily clear through drawings and diagrams because students are able to more easily follow the professor's train of thought. I understand that this course intends to cover lots of material (which is why powerpoints are handy), but it does so at an extreme cost to the quality of the class. This class has so much potential, but as it stands, I'm very unsatisfied with what I learned.",
    "At the beginning of the semester I thought I would prefer midterms to quizzes, but in retrospect I think that method actually made the course less stressful. Try to get into a good section, otherwise discussion may be used purely as a method of evaluation, rather than a chance to ask questions and understand the parts of the papers that you may not have initially. The study guides are fantastic when it comes to quizzes, and especially the final.",
    "This is an extremely difficult class, the hardest I have taken so far. I enjoyed it because I enjoy the material and found it interesting, but the quizzes were insanely difficult (only Dellaporta. Acar and Garcia-Castro were much easier). The final was not as difficult as I had expected. Don't take this class if you are not willing to work for your grade.",
    "As a science major, I found this class fascinating, and I would recommend the course. Sometimes the lectures would review very basic concepts, but other lectures covered entirely new and applicable information. I liked the structure of this course - each of the seven modules consists of three lectures and then a section with a quiz and a paper discussion. There are three different teachers of the course, and each has his strengths and weaknesses, but it varies the course in a nice and refreshing way. The only work you'll really have over the course of the year is studying for quizzes and reading the papers, but I also found that it required a fair amount of studying right before the final in order to ensure that you thoroughly knew all of the material.",
    "Genetics is not necessarily an easy class, but it's certainly manageable if you've taken other biology lectures at Yale. The topics range from simple to interesting to confusing. It covers basic mendelian genetics, chromosomes, population genetics, DNA repair, and developmental genetics (surprisingly not much on mitosis, meiosis or DNA replication!) Quizzes and final are fine if you review the lecture material. Textbook is helpful but not necessary.",
    "This is a great class, full of really interesting material. Prof Dellaporta especially is phenomenal. People either like or hate thebiweekly quiz format, which end up being worth 50% of your grade. Overall, fair assessments and great material.",
    "A good biology class. Take it with the lab to get the most out of it. It was also less stressful and more interesting than MolBio.",
    "Take it if you have to for MCDB and don't want to take Molecular Biology. It's not the worst or best bio class I've ever taken. If you want a good intro to genetics, take the upper level Basic Genetic Analysis (MCDB\/MBB 425) instead.",
    "An okay class, the main reason why I took it was to get MCDB prereqs out of the way, as cell bio and mole bio are at the same time in the Spring semester. It could be much better taught, as the material should be fascinating, but somehow I felt a bit dissatisfied. I think it has to do with the pace, or the lack of psets, but I feel like I didn't learn as much as I would have liked. An okay class, take it if you need it.",
    "Take it if you have to take MCDB class",
    "MCDB 202 is a very engaging course that requiresvery careful study in order to understand the concepts discussed. Reading both the lecture notes and the book material is vital to developing a full understanding of the genetics material, and practicing the problems provided in the book is essential to understanding how these concepts are applied.",
    "good class, mixture of sections and lectures were helpful and material's basic foundations as well as applications in laboratory work were understood.",
    "A biology course that may be a bit different from what you're expecting. The first part emphasizes problem solving, while the second and third parts are about mutation and development, respectively. It's nice to get away from the rote memorization of biology courses. I'd recommend it - it's not mind blowing, but a good course nonetheless. Be sure to read the textbook.",
    "Overall a good course. Structured into 7 modules, each focusing on a different aspect of genetics. The lectures go over many genetics topics, but after taking MB&B301, I felt that a lot of the material was already familiar and repetitive (and the DNA mutation and repair module was nowhere as in depth as in 301). The quizzes were every other week, and weren't that bad. The most interesting part was probably reading the papers for a mini paper review after each quiz. A pretty typical bio class in my opinion.",
    "Quizzes are a lot of work lectures are boring",
    "I didn't feel very passionate about this class one way or the other. The first few Dellaporta quizzes are pretty difficult but then the quizzes get easier once the other lecturers take over. The final wasn't too bad since the average was around an 80.",
    "Good class that doesn't deserve the bad rep it has from reviews written before the class was restructured.",
    "Nice MCDB core class. Interesting material (though I found that the modules got more interesting as the class went on), not too hard. Biweekly quizzes were a nice alternative to quizzes. I liked section a lot, in which you discuss primary research papers.",
    "This was a pretty decent class. The amount of information you learn is not overwhelming and the class follows the texbook pretty closely, so it is easy to catch up when you fall behind or really brush up on topics. The genetics book is also not so dense, so it's not too bad. Overall it's a requirement for most so you have no choice. I suggest doing the practice problems before the quizzes using a solution manual (he uploads that to classes so you don't have to buy it) and reading the textbook if you have time. That should prepare you well enough for everything.",
    "Has interesting material, but Dellaporta and Garcia-Castro aren't that coherent. Murat Acar is awesome though!",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class, because genetics is a pretty important part of MCDB, and this class is well organized and well taught. Do your best to attend lectures, study for the quizzes, and read the papers for section, in order to get the full effect of the class (sounds obvious but it's worth saying). The professors are great too, so feel free to ask questions.",
    "A good overview of the math involved and genetics, repair mechanisms, and early developmental processes. Dellaporta teaches the bulk of the class, followed by Acar then Garcia-Castro. Dellaporta's modules were much harder then the rest. If you do well on the first few quizzes, then you're good to go.",
    "I liked the quizzes - I thought they were helpful in that they were adequately spaced out and kept us on our toes. The lectures can get dry, but the topics covered are interesting. The book is very well written - I definitely recommend its use",
    "Genetics is a fascinating topic and a very relevant elective course, but it was poorly designed and executed. Although the three-week quiz rotation system was convenient in keeping us on pace, the lectures were mostly irrelevant or drawn-out. It was hard to figure out which portions of the material would be assessed, and the final excluded large portions of the first half of the semester. Out of the three lecturers, Prof. Acar seemed most invested in helping the students succeed and understand by keeping a carefully organized lecture.As an MB&B major, I would recommend taking another department elective or a humanities course in the fall. You will be more frustrated than enlightened coming out of this course.",
    "A fun course. There are actually 3 professors; if the course doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change, just know that Dellaporta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quizzes are the hardest, the others are pretty easy. A lot of this material was covered in BIOL 103, like genetics of dev bio. The lab isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really necessary, but it will really help you in understanding how to do some analysis that will show up on the final and understand when professors discuss fly experiments.",
    "MCDB 202 is an interesting course to learn about genetics and analysis. It goes more in depth than Biol 103, and I would recommend it.",
    "Although it is very interesting, there is a lot of material to learn and start studying early!!",
    "This was a very challenging class! The subjects covered were very interesting to me. However, I would not recommend taking this class without taking statistics first. It is not a prerequisite for this class, but it should be! The professors assumed a certain knowledge base of statistics in the class, which I don't know how you would have without having taken intro statistics. Also the quizzes were too hard!! The average was usually a 6\/10...that was considered a good grade. There is just no need for that!",
    "Although I've heard that this class was not well taught in the past, I enjoyed this class. However, the lectures may get a bit tedious. If you want to get good grades on quizzes, I suggest you read the textbook instead of taking meticulous notes during lecture.",
    "Overall, a very good course. They've updated it to cover less intro material, since there are now modules, but the pace of the class was still good. Dellaporta and Castro both use powerpoints during their parts, and speak fairly quickly, so it helps to either be a fast note-taker, or to just take notes on the powerpoint slides. Acar mostly lectures, but he goes slow enough and stops frequently to ask if there are any questions. No p-sets. There is assigned reading, which helps with the every other week quizzes, but the quizzes are pretty simple as long as you review the powerpoints and your notes. You'll also be responsible for reading a paper with each quiz, and though they're not extremely interesting, they're mostly easy to read.",
    "Good class. I hear it's much better than the alternative Mol Bio class (which I never took.) The fortnightly quizzes really kept me on track with the stuff. It's a great structure for a class.You'll have to spend a lot of hours reading the chapter before each quiz to do well (especially Dellaporta's quizzes, which are insanely hard because he somehow thinks you know as much as he does about genetics). But the other two profs had quizzes that were pretty easy to navigate. The problem sets are useful for the final exam only, not the quizzes. Take thisclass, I enjoyed it!",
    "Genetics gets a bad rep, but it actually was not bad at all! I actually enjoyed it! (shocker, I know). Genetics has a new set up, so every other Tuesday, instead of going to lecture, you go to a discussion section. At the beginning you take a multiple choice quiz (10 questions) and then for the rest of the time you discuss a journal article . There is a final at the end. This is actually an awesome set up, because you only have to study every other week, and it's very manageable - way more than other bio classes I've taken. Also the professors are great! Super dynamic and VERY willing and excited to meet with you and answer questions. It's kind of adorable. Maybe genetics wasn't a good in the past, which gave it a bad reputation, but genetics was great this semester. Very clear expectations and interesting material. Take it with a friend, study together before the quizzes, you'll be fine.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "It's a good class. Make sure to keep up with the biweekly quizzes and youll do fine. Though it's not strictly necessary, the textbook is actually very helpful and got me through the course with pretty good scores."
