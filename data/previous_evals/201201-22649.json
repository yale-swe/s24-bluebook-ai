    "You probably have to take this but if you take it with Juliana it will be so much more wonderful than just a necessity. Seriously take it with her, she is so caring and so kind and really a fantastic teacher. Even if you have to get up at 8:20 it will be worth it to have her. Also as a warning this is much more work than 110, but then again that class was almost no work.",
    "120 is a lot more work than 110, so that is something to be prepared for, but because of that you learn a lot more. Take it with Juliana if you can - she will teach you so much and genuinely cares deeply for all her students.",
    "Take it if you need to. A lot of work. Be ready to work hard and get your writing heavily corrected. The graders are really tough.",
    "Spanish 120 was a really solid course that I would highly recommend if you plan to continue learning Spanish."
