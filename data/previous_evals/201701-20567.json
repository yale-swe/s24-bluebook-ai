    "This class provided a great breadth of knowledge on contemporary issues in energy policy, from solar to wind. It was great for getting a basic understanding for the issues. That said, a little more economic theory would have been interesting.",

    "this class was mind-numbingly boring. don't bother doing the reading because it is RIDICULOUSLY long and he doesn't even ask about it -- this is not a seminar, this is a lecture. staying awake for 2 hours at 9:25 was truly a challenge.",
    "Strengths : very well taught, very relevant, incredibly synthesized and interrelated material. Cons: not much student engagement (although most students view that as a pro)",
    "This class covers a wide range of topics, so it inevitably lacks depth in each topic",
    "The course could be improved by instituting more detailed feedback mechanisms.",
    "Overall I thought this class was great! One comment- I wish it was structured more like a seminar and had more in class discussions, rather than just lecture and Q&A"

    "not my favorite course. it's a lecture posing as a seminar, but it is so mind-numbingly boring that i really don't think i could recommend that anyone sit through this. the readings are incredibly dense and long and just don't do them, it isn't worth it.",
    "Incredible accomplished person in his field taking time to teach people. If you get over the fact that it is at 9am, you will end learning a lot from this professor.",
    "Highly highly recommend this class! Professor kessides provides an extremely well balanced analysis that is a rarity at Yale",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend the course to any studen t interested in energy.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in energy policy definitely take this class!",
    "This is a great survey class if you want to know more about the topic of different types of energies, but ultimately it's just a lecture and there is little engagement in the course. If you are truly committed to the readings, you'll likely learn a lot, but otherwise Professor Kessides is pretty hands off. I didn't believe that in previous course evaluations, but it's very true. Don't expect too much instruction or feedback from this course.",
    "yes, its great if you're in the energy studies program. I thought there was a lot of relevant info.",
    "Kessides is an expert on all things energy. If you pay attention, you'll learn a lot. But, given that it is entirely lecture-based, it is hard to pay attention and not goof off."
