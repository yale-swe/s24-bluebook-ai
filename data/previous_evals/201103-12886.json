   "comments": [
    "Yes. Make sure to put in the efforts and time so that you really make huge progress after even just one semester of Japanese.",
    "Japanese 110 is a great course that gives you basic and very useful knowledge about Japanese language. After this semester, if I were to go to Japan, I feel like I could navigate around the city. I would recommend this to other students because it gives you very usable knowledge that you can use immediately in Japan versus just learning random things about the language. Everything you learn is very crucial to navigating daily Japanese life and really allows you to be independent in Japan if you were to go after just one year.",
    "Great class, great structure\/organization, and had a lot of fun.Teachers really do a lot to keep students engaged.Workload was manageable, but still presented enough challenge to keep myself entertained.Recommend it to anyone interested in Japan.",
    "Japanese 110 goes very quickly and involves much work, but the amount of Japanese learned is astonishing. Assuming you keep up with the material, the classes are very fun.",
    "i would recommend it warning that it has a heavy work load and emphasis on memorization but was a very rewarding experience",
    "Japanese 110 was by far my favorite class this semester. I came into the course expecting a difficult course and a class that would kickstart my learning of Japanese. I got so much more than that. I've fallen in love with the language and Japanese culture. Therefore, I definitely recommend it for any student willing to put in the time and effort into starting Japanese.",
    "OF COURSE.",
    "I would recommend it as long as you are disciplined and confident in the reasons that you are taking the course.",
    "Japanese 110 is an intensive introduction to Japanese. The instructors clearly work hard both to maximise the achievement in the language and to make it fun. I would recommend it for any student interested in putting in a lot of time in the language, as the work-load can be very large."
