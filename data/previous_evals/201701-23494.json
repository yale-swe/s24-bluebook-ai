    "Various writing forms and travel lit styles",
    "I learned about how to analyze historical occurrences from various underrepresented perspectives and apply this understanding to my personal role in current situations.",
    "I learned how different ethnicities and people of different circumstances travel. The idea of mobility and tourism were constant themes. I also gained insights to the perspectives of Native people that white people had.",
    "This course was a great survey of important travel literature in the history of the Americas. I read books I wouldn't have otherwise read and learned to analyze them from a literary and historical perspective, simultaneously. This course really changed the way I think about travel and tourism.",
    "I learned so much about colonialism, post-colonial studies, and tourism and travel in the Caribbean, especially. I learned to connect colonialism with tourism, and to find historic power dynamics still at play in various places through the literature we read. Very enlightening and thought-provoking. I will be a better traveler because of this class.",
    "Taught me to see narratives of other ethnic or cultural groups from multiple perspectives."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the readings and assignments.",
    "The professor did a great job of giving historical context and facilitating discussion. The assignments and papers were unique and not entirely boring. The readings have multiple perspectives that helped tie themes together.",
    "I loved how each week covered a different topic, and I found almost all readings to be very engaging. I loved our in-class discussions, led by students who prepared questions. I felt like sometimes discussion would lose steam a little towards the end of class, however, so maybe it would be better if two or three students had to come up with questions for each reading as opposed to just one.",
    "Strengths: the reading list (from Columbus to slave narratives to Kerouac to Kincaid to Gay), the travel document project, Professor Ramrez's classroom insights and writing feedback, getting to go into the basement of the Beinecke and page through Humboldt's original books (among many others), Weaknesses: class discussion often felt half-hearted, there was only one serious essay assignment, far fewer moments of epiphany than in comparable seminars",
    "I think that this course had a very good structure. Each week there was a theme that tied 2-5 pieces of literature together. In class, we would usually start off with a 2 minute ungraded writing response. Professor Ramirez would then give a small lecture. The rest of the class would be devoted to discussion.",
    "The readings and films for this course were fantastic. I really enjoyed the travel document assignment. Some of our discussions could get slow at times. More pointed discussion questions might be helpful.",
    "No significant weaknesses, the class was strong and allowed each student to voice their thoughts whatever they may have been"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in reading about exploration and migration and thinking critically about these narratives. Also, being interested in creative writing helps.",
    "I highly recommend this course because it shows the evils behind colonialism, tourism, migration, and white mobility.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody with an interest in literature or history or creative writing (because of the tumblr project). It really broadens your perspective and anybody would benefit from this course.",
    "Although the readings were provocative and Professor Ramrez a capable leader, class discussions were usually lackluster. This may have just been due to the particular make-up of this iteration's students, but conversations rarely got beyond \"I thought it was interesting that...\" I was looking for something more than easy WR credit, which is what ER&M 017, at its worst, ended up being. Still, I enjoyed encountering many of the class's themes (pirate hydrarchies, slave narratives, drug-stained self-obsessed men, etc.) and appreciated that the reading list straddled fiction, autobiographical travel writing, and essays. Professor Ramrez assigned one ~creative~ travel document project, which required that we compose our own travel narrative during Spring Break. The project left room for a lot of creative approaches, and I really learned a lot from the direction I went. I come away from the class with a reconstructed view of the \"tourist\"--a role I have occupied in problematic ways throughout my life--and know that I will think of it as I travel throughout my life.",
    "Please take this course especially with Professor Ramirez! It is actually an amazing class with insightful readings (occasionally, too long) and creative class assignments and class activities! Professor Ramirez is like an amazing teacher who made this class bomb af. So funny, so chill, and so smart. Take this course and you will love it even if you are hesitant about it like I was!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys reading and gaining new perspective on the world and your place in it.",
    "Yes, it forces students to think in certain ways they have not in the past and exposes them to literature they otherwise may not have had the chance to read."
