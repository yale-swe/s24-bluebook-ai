   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class, the material is bland and unrelated to real-world problems. The midterms were frustrating because they did not seem to go over class topics and were unfairly graded. I really did not enjoy this class and regret taking it.",
    "Take it if you love BSing work, but don't expect it to be a gut.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students because it's not only interesting but it's applicable to the future of business and environmental standards.",
    "I would recommend it to another class However, realize that the class is about natural resources, and you do not learn much actually \"economics\" at all. I found the lectures to be very interesting.",
    "Simple class with not too complicated a curriculum. Tricky tests. Something you know nothing about, but should.",
    "Econ 330 is an extension of microeconomic principles to the management of pollution, nonrenewable resources, and renewable resources. It served its purpose as a direct application of micro, and the workload was manageable. Not particularly exciting, however.",
    "Yes take this if your looking for a quality QR credit",
    "Yes",
    "take this class. not that hard, and you won't learn any new econ, but fun",
    "If you have any interest in environmental uses and services, or want to take a class with a relatively easy yet interesting workload (as long as you pay attention in lecture) that teaches some good application of economic theory to the real world, I would strongly recommend this class. I personally thought it was great.",
    "Probably not, it's a fairly big waste of time and exams can be annoying... sometimes there were irritatingly specific questions on the exams, and it wasn't like you could just have studied more and done better cause there wasn't that much material to study from. but if someone were wanting an easy b\/b+ and a qr i would recommend it because no matter how much you try you cannot possibly spend more than an hour a week on this class and you probably did the math in 4th grade.i took this because its supposed to be easy but I wish i had taken an actual class...",
    "Analysis of natural resource problems using the very basics of microeconomics. Fascinating subject matter, light workload, and no surprises on exams. If anything, I wish this class had gone into greater depth or had covered more topics. Very",
    "If you are interested in learning about the environment in terms of facts as opposed to an emotion-based argument, then definitely take it. It was a good class and not tons of work (and generally really easy work) but also not really the most exciting subject in the world.",
    "lame-o",
    "Do not take this class. You may think that you like the environment or economics, but however great your love for these issues is, the pain and suffering of this class is not worth it.1) This list is more organized than the lectures, which is to say the lectures are not organized at all. The first ten lectures could have been condensed into two. On the bright say, Mendelsohn's disorganization means that he says the most random things, which does make the class more enjoyable--did you know that the U.S. sends all of our recycled cardboard to China?2) Mendelsohn loves typos. He may have actually meant to do some of the mistakes (like giving us decimals on our midterm but not allowing calculators), but some of the mistakes are definitely just typos. This wouldn't be too bad, but Mendelsohn reuses problems. He gave these exact problems with these exact typos last year but did not fix them for this year. The only explanation is that he actually likes typos.3) Even when he gets all the words how he meant them, Mendelsohn can't write a question. His problem set and exam questions make no sense. Deciphering his questions is a more important skill for this class than learning the material. As our TA told us, answering a question correctly is not enough--it has to be the obscure answer Mendelsohn was fishing for with his incoherent question.Taking this class will make you feel like a polar bear drowning in the Arctic because of global warming or a child with asthma unable to breath because of emissions. Unfortunately, this class will give you no better idea of how to fix these problems.",
    "A course that explains the economics behind pollution and resource use. You'll also learn about major issues like climate change and non-renewables. Would definitely recommend. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class even if you're not an econ major. Not too difficult, and will give you some novel ways to think.",
    "Gutty? I guess. Worth it? Not a chance. So it's super low work and, if you memorize all your notes (not too hard), you can do pretty well on the midterms. But the questions are worded hard, Professor Mendelsohn doesn't even care enough to make the numbers on the test work out, and you'll often find yourself wondering if what he's talking about is even TRUE. No textbook: take another class in which you're sure you're learning something useful.",
    "Pretty good class. Not a gut, however. Lectures are a must because if you miss the material, there's no where else you can find it. I would recommend it because of its interesting material",
    "Take it to relearn some micro, some cool ideas about environmental economics",
    "Not too hard, but pay attention in section! It is how I did all my learning! The tests are not hard, but poorly worded so be warned.",
    "Take it if you are an env studies major, econ major, or poli sci major. The class is applicable to many fields of studies and combines many perspectives. Great teacher, been doing it for years. He knows what he's doing. Workload is Psets a week, not too bad.",
    "Economics 330 was one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale because the professor is incredibly disorganized. If you think it is ridiculous that his problem sets are riddled with mistakes, you will think it is absolutely ludicrous that his exams are full of errors and typos. His lectures bounce all over the place. He also spelled \"McKinsey\" as \"MacKenzie\" during one of our lectures. It is really sad that this class is no good because the subject could be really interesting if the professor bothered to put any effort into the class. The only saving grace is a TA who cares a lot about the subject and will help you outside of class to decipher the questions the professor writes.",
    "Comparatively easier economics course. Readings don't have to be read and material is not that intensive.",
    "It is a good course if you are interested in environmental concerns. The teacher is interesting, although sometimes it is hard to understand his notes on the board\/sometimes he hardly puts any up. Very easy course in terms of workload, but not necessarily in terms of getting a good grade. It would help if the course had a more central text to fall back on. It is interesting how the math and theoretical sidesof the course hardly relate and hardly help you on the other part. The problem sets every week are ridiculously easy.",
    "Take this if you are interested in environmental policy. i found that it was a bit too easy and a bit too unstructured.",
    "Good class - not that tough. Grading somewhat arbitrary.",
    "You learn a lot about the economics behind natural resources and pollution, stuff you won't normally hear about in most discussions. This class definitely opened my eyes to how to deal with pollution, climate change, expendable resources etc in the real world.Main weakness of this course is the exams. They can be so fickle and tricky sometimes, that even if you know the material well, you can still end up doing mediocre.",
    "This is one of the more interesting Econ classes I have taken so far. The workload is light- weekly pset, two midterms, and a final. The exams are not that bad, but be careful because the curve can be tough.",
    "Good Econ class for non-Econ majors. The lectures are engaging and the psets are manageable. However, the final will catch you off guard. More math than expected. Readings optional.",
    "It's a good econ class. Also it's not too much work. I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes. It is one of the very few courses in the Economics department that includes a decent amount of policy.",
    "Interesting material and comparatively little work for an economics major. Wouldn't strongly recommend, but not a bad class to take.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend the course. I think I would because the subject matter is very interesting and well-lectured but taking an economics course without many relevant reference materials is really quite difficult. I am however, I should note, a political science major.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Lectures are boring and repetitive. Mendelsohn seems to be full of himself. You are expected to regurgitate answers on the exams, and any deviation from their cookie-cutter answers, even if more insightful, will be penalized by TA's who don't know what they're talking about.",
    "Economics 330 is an interesting, manageable intersection of basic microeconomics and environmental issues. It was a worthwhile QR. I recommend the course.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in management of natural resources from an economical perspective. If you are an econ major, sure - if you want to learn more about where we're heading energy-wise it's a good start.",
    "Its a good overview of problems in the world of natural resources and how to manage them optimally.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it, but be ready for the curve.",
    "This class gives a good overview of pollution, renewable, and nonrenewable resources. The workload was really manageable and problem sets would not take long. The material is very straightforward if you have some background in energy or natural resources. As an engineer, it was interesting to see the economic perspective of concepts, which I had only seen from a scientific\/environmental perspective. The material isn't hard and you only need intro micro (and by this I mean the very basics of it). Exams are not hard at all, but the problems can be a bit tricky sometimes. Overall, this is a good class, so take it!",
    "The math you do is not that hard at all on the problem sets. But somehow the professor was able to take these easy weekly problem sets and change them on the test and make them incredible confusing. Be prepared for something you've never seen before on the test. A lot of trick questions on all of his tests, and they don't grade very easily.",
    "I found the subject matter very interesting; I rarely did the reading because it was difficult to distill out the important bits of it, and section did that for me, but lecture was engaging, and it was cool to be at a cross-section of so many different types; FES students fulfilling requirements, Econ majors looking for an easy class, etc. The fact that it was both interesting and very little work made it great. If Namrata's TAing, go with her.",
    "Best lecture course int he economics department.Take it.If you are not an economics major, this class will be more difficult for you. It's ECON 330 - that shouldn't be a surprise. But if you have taken intro or intermediate micro, the quantitative stuff will be a breeze.The actual topics are really interesting and the professor is terrific.",
    "This class has basically no work--but it's not an easy A. The problem sets are much easier than the tests. The scant reading is completely unnecessary to do. I wouldn't take this just for a QR. If you are an econ major, it will probably be a breeze, but otherwise without a textbook, any really relevant readings, or coherent lectures, it can be frustrating. The subject matter is interesting, but I feel like I didn't really learn that much in the end. Also, Mendelsohn is the only prof. I've had at Yale who just didn't seem to care about his students. The whole course seemed thrown together without much thought."
