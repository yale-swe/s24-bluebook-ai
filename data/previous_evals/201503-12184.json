   "comments": [
    "Not bad. Take it as a writing credit. There is actually not that much writing for being a WR. You can sometimes drown in the details of the readings and they become boring very quickly.",
    "Take it. This is material that anyone living in America should absolutely know.",
    "Strongly recommend this course. It'll fundamentally change your view on American history, and historiography more broadly. Professor Blackhawk is a real gem that Yale is incredibly fortunate to have. Lecture can be dry at times, but if you do the readings (which are amazing and make the class absolutely unmissable) you'll get a lot out of lecture and the course more broadly. A definite take for anyone interested in expanding their worldviews in large and unexpected ways.",
    "Manageable amount of work and definitely worth the class for a WR credit.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone who needs a writing credit and\/or is interested in Native American culture.",
    "This is a really interesting, well-taught course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Even if you're not a history major, this class is a must because it teaches you about a history that you'd never otherwise learn in any other history class. It's also cool because it teaches you about contemporary Indian affairs, which was fascinating. Great lecture, great readings, great section. Take it!",
    "American Indian History taught me vital information about the background of American Indians, something that I never learned in high school but something that I would never trade back. Professor Blackhawk is a fantastic person, though I could see his lecture style being somewhat polarizing - I would shop the course if you're interested to see if it suits you. The coursework is very manageable, and although the reading is not necessarily required to do well in the course, I got a lot out of doing it and would 100% recommend completing it as well. Everyone should be take this course, simply because American Indian history is a topic that so few are familiar with but that everyone should know!",
    "This was a great class and I would definitely recommend it. The workload was manageable, especially for a WR credit (a 2-3pg essay with two drafts, a 4-5p book review, midterm and 5-7p final paper) and the material was really interesting too!",
    "Take it to fulfill the Early Americas requirement for AmStud!",
    "Wish this class was a bit more interesting. I found it difficult to pay attention in lectures and wished the material was a bit more substantial. At times, I felt it was very euro-centric. After the midterm, it was really hard to motivate myself to go to lectures. However, the books are awesome and having to go to Indian Film Festival really helped fill out this class for me. Prof. Blackhawk is a great guy and very excited about what's he's teaching!",
    "Great course for a solid foundation in Native American history. We covered past and present issues. Much emphasis on the early days.",
    "I would recommend this class because this is information that has to be passed on. It is part of resisting imperialism to know the stories of indigenous peoples. I am not Native. I am grateful for having had the chance to learn about the unknown past of American history.",
    "American Indian History was a very new subject for me, and I enjoyed the class. It traced a side of history that I had no background in, and I certainly learned a lot. Also, it qualifies as a writing credit, which is helpful.",
    "Good class with really interesting, important material. Presents a new perspective on American history that you probably have never learned before, but it's probably more accurate. Lecture could get a little dry and somewhat confusing at times, but the readings were really good and the ideas you leave with make it worth taking. I took it as a non-WR credit, which was 3 short papers (none longer than 5 pages), one midterm. Good class overall that I would take again.",
    "Really good class about American Indians and a huge chunk of American history that's not normally taught, but the professor is not the most interesting to listen to.",
    "Good course. Took it for the WR distro, but ended up enjoying it quite a bit.",
    "I would recommend. You will learn a lot of stuff and be well-prepared for the other classes Professor Blackhawk teaches (which you should also take).",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this class!",
    "This class could have been better. I don't want people to just take it because it was easy (and trust me, it was VERY easy) because the material really is important. So I hope you take this wanting to know the material and not just because it's a gut. I'm assuming they will work on the organization of the course- I don't think they expected so many students to take it this year- and it will be better moving forward.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the subject or American history in general.",
    "Solid gut that is what you make of it. Three papers and a midterm that you're basically given the questions to - all for a WR credit. Who could complain?",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone. It is a fairly light workload WR credit, but also dives into very interesting material that students otherwise do not have much exposure to. I definitely came out with a much more comprehensive understanding of American Indian history, especially of the past ~150 years that is not often looked at in other courses.",
    "Definitely take this class! Anyone interested in history should understand this perspective. It is an amazing opportunity to learn from Professor Blackhawk who is so distinguished in this field. I will definitely think about American history differently now. Also the work load and readings are manageable.",
    "I think this is a relatively fun and easy class that covers an interesting history you won't find in a typical American studies class. It was also a very easy writing credit with lots of help, though at times the writing assignments were confusing, my TA was great about clarifying them in section. There was only like 3 papers all about 5 pages and an easy midterm.",
    "Definitely an important class to take. It's really cool to be exposed to a historian like Professor Blackhawk, but be advised that his lecture style leaves something go be desired. Covers a variety of tribes' cultures and histories, especially in regard to interactions with white Americans. History you often probably wouldn't be taught otherwise.Timeline of the class ranges from pre contact (briefly) through to contemporary lifestyle and issues (including a case before SCOTUS). Definitely got progressively more interesting as we started looking at 20th century legislation, etc. Lynsey is an awesome TF! There was a writing optional section that didn't seem too strenuous.",
    "A great course with really important information and history to be learned. Lectures could feel a bit scattered at times though and it took a while before I got used to the lecture style and could take effective notes. Otherwise, the course and course material was presented well. The workload is definitely manageable and even if you have little background in American Indian History you'll be able to keep up and be interested in the material.",
    "ER&M 187 provides a basic overview of American history from a Native American perspective. The role that Native Americans played in the Columbian exchange, the American wars, and the very birth of this country are explored. These ideas are so often skipped over in high school and are so important to understanding the true history of our nation's heritage. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American history or who is even a little interested in Native American culture.",
    "I totally would recommend it to another student. It is a general survey course about an aspect of American history that is often overlooked. I would just say that the lectures can be a bit boring due to how quiet the professor is.",
    "Take it! You will learn a new side of history that you most likely have not been taught\/taught well in the past. The workload is also very manageable. Also, if Lynsey is TA'ing get into her section!!!",
    "Absolutely would recommend, though I wonder who will be taking it over following Blackhawk's departure.",
    "YES. Every Yalie should take this course."
