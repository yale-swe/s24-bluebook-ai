    "I absolutely loved this course. It was engaging, interesting, and on a topic I had never encountered before. Not too much work at all, but the work was graded fairly and we had opportunity to meet with him and correct it before we submitted a final draft",
    "AFST 440 is a interesting class that showed how Africa's economy was affected in the past. I would definitely recommend this class because of Professor Hino's interesting lectures.",
    "Meets once a week, one long paper, presentation, and final. A great class to give you a varied perspective on African economy, definitely recommend it whether major or not.",
    "F you want to learn more about the economic history of African countries then I wild definitely recommend this class.",
    "Summary: Most students, particularly non-Africans, relate with Africa from a distance. This class however bridges that gap by providing an insider-perspective into the workings of African economies: the issues that drove stagnation in the 1980's and the variables responsible for the current and projected growth narratives. Furthermore, it provides the student with an academic lens through which she can interact with the continent."
