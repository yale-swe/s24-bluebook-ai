    "Speaking with partners is certainly a strength. The class should encourage more open ended conversation though, and make sure that people switch partners sometimes.",
    "The class was very organized and structure. I felt that it was an adequate intermediate class, and I felt that my Spanish improved. The grading was a little nitpicky, particularly for the redacciones (as in we would get points taken off for using a pronoun when the professor thought that the pronoun was optional). The class could have been improved with more opportunities for free-form discussion, rather than a q\/a, structured practice.",
