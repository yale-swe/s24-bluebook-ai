    "I expected to push my understanding of complex form-making tonew levels, which I did. I would have liked to have engaged more specifically with the theme of the Modernist house; of course we were free to do so, but I think the studio would have been richer if Hernan had pushed us more himself. Even spending 3-4 days at the beginning of the semester drawing house plans of Wright, Neutra, Corb, or Mies would have dramatically influenced our thinking and given us a better reference for scale, poche, volume etc. However, I did appreciate the push to design a house from cells - cells which must be smaller than a room but larger than a brick. This immediately implies CNC-panelization at a size and cost which are reasonable. Also, it encourages students to move past the now dated type of pre-fab plug-in units, which are simply weird blobs surfaced the same inside as outside with a flat floor inserted.",
    "The studio was amazing. I really didn't know what to expect, but my experience was completely positive. Hernan and Erick worked tirelessly to make sure we had all the resources, tools and techniques we needed to realize our projects. Both were constantly available either in person, email, skype or by phone.",
    "My expectations of the studio are not high: quite aesthetics\/software oriented, maybe not too much focus on architectural precision or drawings. The Studio is beyond my expectations. Hernan's active encouragement on our engaging of gravity, structure and interior architectural quality of a house impressed me. He expanded my understanding of drawings in general, particularly drawings of irregular spaces. Also, his way of using animation to develop and represent a project is a valuable input.",
    "This was an incredible studio, and they type I had expected to take at graduate school."

    "Everything worked smoothly, with the exception of the renderfarm becoming backlogged during the several days before final review. Part of it may have been students batch rendering on lab machines. Also, animations may have been submitted and distributed poorly; no one is sure of the exact relationship and hierarchy of renderboxes and slaves. To alleviate rendering overloads, I recommend the school reinstate the incorporation of 4th-7th floor student machines into the renderfarm system. It seems like this would significantly increase output capability.",
    "No. The mills were consistently broken all semester and the robot was spotty at best. The 3d printers were constantly backed up due to many core studios 3d printing, thus screwing those of us in advanced studio. I strongly recommend instituting some kind of priority queue for advanced studios, especially when a number of 2nd years were using the 3d printers to print custom scale figures and other frivolous crap thus preventing advanced studios from printing.Also, the computer equipment is pathetically outdated. The machines at our desks can barely run Maya and Mudbox and any kind of advanced renderings or animations crash the machines almost instantly. Even the \"renderfarm\" is junk; there isn't enough RAM on the slave machines to handle large scenes which often leads to crashes and aborted jobs.I actually went and bought my own machine because of the dismal state of the schools equipment, and it was one of the smartest things I've done in a while. In fact, my one computer is actually faster thna the entire render farm, which either means I bought an insane super computer (which I did not) or that the school's equipment is pathetically outdated.This situation needs to be remedied ASAP is the school wants to remain competitive.",
    "They are generally speaking adequate. However, for the final presentation the 3d-printers of school is receiving more than normal amount of jobs(even more than final weeks of other semesters) and I think advanced studios should have some priorities on that. Some of us have to out-source the physical models and it cost as much as 1,000 dollars. I believe many other models printed can be easily finished with laser-cutters and other school fabrication facilities. Models of our studio can be done only on 3d printers and none of other machines will work. I hope in the future the DM office should have a evaluation process of the print jobs and advanced studios should have some(I'm not suggesting a lot) priorities over other studios.",
    "The only resource that seems underutilised in the school of architecture, is the render farm. Although it is monitored for servicing, it is not policed which means that a single image may render for 36 hours during the final review week. This means that no one else can use the render farm during this time. If there were some rules or time thresholds put in place for the length of time an image should render for, this would improve the facility drastically."

   "comments": [
    "Early semester tutorials with Erick were very helpful in gaining software proficiency. Great jury selections. Extremely well-coordinate d and fruitful trip - I got a strong sense of what it means to design in L.A. and how architects have engaged landscape and technology to do so. Visits with interface and animation designers were amazing.",
    "This studio was amazing. If we can get hernan back, we absolutely should. The most amazing studio I've ever experienced. Period.",
    "The most valuable part will be desk-crits and the least being class discussion. The desk-crits are straight-to the point, very concise and always helpful. I comprehend the professor's point very clearly, and no time is wasted for either of us. It is my favorite type of desk-crits. For class discussions, I think because of the nature of the studio and the variety of students' work, sometimes it's hard to relate one's work to another's. I don't think it's anyone's fault, it's just harder to compare the work if their focus is drastically different. We had plenty of interesting and inspiring conversations but I think currently we(as a discipline and profession) are still a vocabulary for the subject of studio.",
    "The most valuable aspects were the lessons in acquisition of skills and perhaps, the desk-crits which were more informal and direct than the pinups. The least valuable were the pinups as I felt the criticisms of other students' work were not explained with enough clarity."
