   "comments": [
    "Broad overview of how children develop physically, emotionally, and cognitively. Practicum lets you see the theory in practice.",
    "Great class! The observations of the kids are so rewarding, and the lectures are very interesting as well! Definitely take this if you like working with kids!",
    "Absolutely, it's not a lot of work, and if you like kids and are at all interested in child development, this is a class that you really have to take.",
    "i recommend this class for students who are interested in learning more about children and why children do the things they do",
    "I would recommend it for any student in the Teacher Preparation Early Childhood track. Just be aware that the class you choose to observe (2 year olds, 3 year olds, kindergarten, or more) is something you're interested in because you'll probably end up writing your final paper on that age group.",
    "It's a great course if you really like kids. The best part about it is the observations, so you have to really want to spend time with young children. The workload is manageable and it's a really valuable, interesting course. It's also a nice change to be able to go and actually experience what you're discussing in class.",
    "It is a fun class, you learn about cute things little kids do, and then go to preschool and see for yourself. The policy side of the course is really interesting. Great 5th class, despite being a seminar. Very mellow",
    "This class gives a good overview of the main issues surrounding early child development. Much of the course consists of guest lecturers who are experts in their specific fields of child development. I would definitely recommend this course for another student. The observations at the daycare center are very informative and rewarding.",
    "This course has two well-integrated components. The first is a once-a-week seminar, usually featuring a guest specialist. All of the seminars are well planned and the guests are always engaging and tailor their presentations to the class's interests. The instructors are great at coordinating readings and seminars and are very committed to the students, which is wonderful. The second portion is a once-a-week observation in a day care. Although the day care facilities are wonderful, and it is great to see the principles in action,this was a large commitment, and I did not feel I was gaining as much from the placement by the end of the semester. Each week after seminar, the students at each day care get together with the day care director to discuss their experiences and to further discuss questions from seminar. This was a great time to talk about policy and day care facilities with the director. The final paper was a great opportunity to explore an area of interest in-depth.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Spending time at the daycare truly became the highlight of every week.",
    "Yes! Fun, enjoyable and learn a lot.",
    "Yes absolutely simply because observing 3 and 4 year olds heightens your overall experience at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it, if you are prepared to go to your observation place once a week for three hours. It seems like a long time, but it flew by. Not too much work, interesting stuff, awesome to get out of the classroom and into real field study. Understanding the way children develop and think is important for everybody to know, and this class really changed a lot of my perspectives on it.",
    "easy journal entries once a week and you get to hang out with little kids, its perfect",
    "Yes, it is very cool to investigate what it is to be a child, to learn from the way in which they live.",
    "I loved this class because I got to go to Calvin Hill Daycare once a week. The lectures were a bit monotonous and tough to get through. Reading was easy to understand and to the point. The journals are not that tough if you put sometime into them. The Walter Gilliam lecture is the best, he is dynamite. The final paper is not that bad either. Overall I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, it was a great course. I learned a lot and I had a lot of fun. The guest lecturers are great. My only advice is to put extra effort in too your journal entries because they are tougher graders than you might expect.",
    "Absolutely - it's very interesting, not a lot of work or commitment, and very fun. Observations were always the highlight of my week"
