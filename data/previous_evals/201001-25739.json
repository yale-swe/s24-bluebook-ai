    "I think the word on the street is that MATH 120 is supposed to be very hard, but if you do the basics--go to lecture, do the homework--you should be fine. Also, TAKE THE CLASS WITH SUBHOJOY. Really!",
    "This is a tough course, the material is challenging conceptually. You have to stay on top of the work and make sure not to fall behind, especially as the material gets more difficult towards the end of the semester. That said, I'm very glad I took it, and it's very rewarding to feel that you've figured out hard concepts. Also, make sure that you get a good TA for your section. I shopped around until I found a TA that I really liked and who taught well, and that made a HUGE difference. Most of the pre-meds flock to Michael Frame's class, but you can find really good TAs at other times and be in a smaller section too, which is nice.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. If you're premed, don't bother with it unless you're really interested in multivariable. Otherwise, it might unnecessarily cause stress and be detrimental for your GPA.",
    "Math 120 is a good course to take if you did well in BC Calc senior year, but it is not easy. The problem sets are fairly time-consuming, and the questions asked often do not accurately reflect the kinds of questions that are asked on the midterms and final. Because of the way the grade is calculated (20% per midterm, 50% final, and 10% hw) there is quite a lot of pressure when taking exams. You need to spend a lot of time studying. Professor Gupta really devoted himself to his students, and made sure to make himself available for plenty of hours each week and especially before each exam.",
    "This class was very interesting in that it gives a perspective on math after basic calculus from high school. Understanding calculations in three dimensions is oftentimes hard, but manageable if you study hard. The final is also difficult, but manageable if you study. Midterms are easy, and frustrating because stupid mistakes may often get you the average grade.",
    "It's a lot of parametrization background: lines, planes, 3-d surfaces. Essentially, the important part of the course is Green's Theorem, Stoke's Theorem, and Divergence Theorem. If you're interested in math or need 120 for your major, definitely take it. Otherwise, it's hard and stressful and probably not worth it.",
    "I very much enjoyed Math 120 and would recommend it to another student. I've heard the course depends quite a bit on the teacher, but Subhojoy Gupta was a very good teacher. This site was also helpful at times: http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/OcwWeb\/Mathematics\/18-02Fall-2007\/VideoLectures\/"
