   "comments": [
    "English 114 is a intensive writing course that focuses on the subtleties of keywords; the course emphasizes students' ability to write coherently and logically. I would strongly recommend this course for students who seek to improve their writing and better understand culture, society, and language.",
    "I would recommend it to another student - especially freshmen like me who are good writers but do not think they are fully apt for college level writing just yet. You WILL improve. The only problem is if you get a topic that you don't find enjoyable...then it can be brutal.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class! There were some kinks in the presentation of material this year, but it sounds like Professor Thomas wants to work them out. We got to read and write about a variety of topics, and we also were encouraged to think more closely about how we use \"keywords\" -- words like culture, terror, and truth.",
    "It gives you a foundation to produce quality writing throughout your college career. It's a worthwhile class.",
    "English 114 08 consists of a lot of reading and writing. You are asked to read two lengthy and dense academic articles per week and respond to them. In class you discuss the pros and cons of the articles you read, and what you can learn for them for your writing. Additionally, you write 4 papers in the class. The first two are around 3-4 pages in length, and the third paper is an 8-9 page research paper. The third paper is definitely the most challenging. The fourth paper is simple and more informal than the previous three, and is based off of your third paper.",
    "A lot of writing. This course improves your writing and your analytical reading. The readings are very dull though. I would only recommend this course if you want to write 4 essays and a lot of reading responses"
