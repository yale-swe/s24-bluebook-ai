    "This is a GREAT class. Fantastic syllabus, fantastic professor, and a really engaging topic. Be prepared to have your views on all matters justice-related challenged and changed.",
    "This is a quite remarkable course. Anyone looking for a truly challenging, strongly theoretically grounded WGSS course should take this class. The readings, though difficult (yes, there is a LOT of Rawls on the syllabus) is excellent, and Professor Fischel has really wonderful insight into it. There's a lot of reading, one presentation with a partner, a short (2 pg) reading response, and a long final paper with a volunteer component. In short: not a class for the faint of heart, but if you're committed to really learning then this is the class for you. A+.",
    "If you're interested in the ethical and political ins-and-outs of social justice and human rights, take this course. There is a significant amount of reading, but aside from coming to class every week prepared for the conversation (and Joe is a very good discussion leader), there aren't many assignments. This means that there's little busy work, but the assignments that you do - including a cool volunteer project and a 15-20 page paper regarding it - are meaningful and require you to engage really deeply with the material and discussions. Everyone also does presentations in pairs to link the theory to real-life issues.",
    "This had a lot of potential as a course, but was a fairly frustrating experience. Professor Fischel is awesome but is still coming into his own as a discussion leader\/had some difficulty figuring out how to make the two-hour seminar the most productive. I felt like there wasn't really enough direction on all of the assignments, and like the class presentations felt so superfluous in a seminar when we had a difficult enough of a time getting through the material. I would recommend taking this class if it were revamped to focus on undergraduates more, and for students who are willing to sit through a fairly frustrating seminar for the chance to meet Fischel (who is great one-on-one) and read some pretty great articles and books.",
    "Very interesting readings, definitely take it if you are interested in political theory an\/or sexuality studies. You're not going to get this kind of recognition theorizing in the political science department so its a rather unique course offering. The final social-justice volunteering project is also really innovative and for that reason alone I would highly recommend the class. Just watch out for annoying WGSS majors who don't know when to shut up."
