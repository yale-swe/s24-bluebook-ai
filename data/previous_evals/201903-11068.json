    "This course provided a foundational but also extensive overview of foreign information operations in the United States, as well as the basic aspects of American society that has facilitated the rise and effectiveness of this type of warfare.",
    "A great history of Russian active measures",
    "To analyze the media, the latest knowledge about information warfare in the US, and to write a policy paper.",
    "A keen and practical understanding of the media landscape today and Russian propaganda within American news streams.",
    "Knowledge and insights: the Russian government's role in the 2016 election; the ways in which information can be weaponized; the polarization of the U.S.; the impact of social media on communications and news media. Skills: writing and design of policy solutions.",
    "Developed an understanding of Russian disinformation strategies an options to counter it."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very logically organized, and the readings were helpful and relevant. I wish the course to elaborated more on the legal aspects of foreign cyber operations, as well as Russian\/Soviet foreign policy and the motivations behind their strategies, and I also think it may be more productive if discussion proceeded with a more critical and analytical attitude towards the readings, dissecting each reading rather than accepting each of the arguments as given. Also, this is totally out of the professor's control, but the seminar room in which the class was located was cramped, either extremely warm or chilly, and felt low on oxygen.",
    "This class was well designed to understand what's going on in the real world about information warfare. Among all assignments, 'Media Bubble Analysis' which required us to analyze the media outlets and their products given their positions was very unique and interesting. The one thing I was disappointed was that we did not talk much about Russia although this course bore its name. The focus was only on the US and the latter half of this course was like sociology focused on America. Since this class was designed for Jackson Institute, I believe a broader perspective would be appreciated.",
    "Incredible course. Practical, well-rounded, and wonderfully organized.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating selection of readings and materials, the relevance of the course and the insights provided by Professor Asha Rangappa. Weaknesses: the in-class discussion would sometimes get out of track; too U.S. centric and lacking a critical position towards U.S. actions. I also would have liked to spend more time addressing events and policy solutions that were being discussed in the news and specialized media at the same time as the class unfolded.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, regarding history or the current state of global affairs, especially regarding US-Russian relations, this course was great.",
    "For those who are specifically interested in information warfare in American society, I would recommend this course. But for those who are interested in Russian or global perspective, this one might leave much to be desired.",
    "Definitely! Asha is a rare and incredible professor and the topic is so relevant.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, and not only to students interested in Russia but in general to students that want to understand polarization and the impact of social media and information technologies in society."
