    "Take it if you're into art and want a rigorous approach to theory. You do look at art slides in the class too.",
    "I would only take this if you have some background in philosophy. Otherwise the teacher is interesting and the readings well chosen. The teacher is also helpful if you come to her for help on essays.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, and would absolutely recommend it. The texts are fascinating, the professor knowledgeable, and the assignments are fun and manageable."
