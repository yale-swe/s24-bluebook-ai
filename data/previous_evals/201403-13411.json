    "Take it if you want to learn. You get out what you put in so don't go into it halfhearted expecting to become Van Gogh in a semester",
    "Summary: Lots of work, especially for non-artists\/beginners, but rewarding if one puts a great deal of effort and focus into it. Also, be prepared to face many critiques from both peers and Professor Villalongo. He is very much a \"tough love\" kind of professor whose silence will sometimes mean better things than his words. I would recommend this course to another student, as I think both beginners and experienced artists alike can walk away from it with much stronger skills--just don't necessarily expect these skills to come easily.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to truly learn how to draw and put the work in. This class is not a gut. You will have lots of homework but if you enjoy it you come to not view it was work but as an escape and a medium to express yourself.",
    "I would recommend it-- it really changes how you see the world. For people who aren't confident, perhaps use credit d fail, but it really is worth taking the course before graduation. That being said, be prepared to do a TON of drawing (I know this should seem obvious, but the amount of work was even greater than I had expected).",
    "Basic Drawing is a class that is as good as you are willing to make it. I took it Credit D, which was often conflicting because it gave me little incentive to spend hour after hour on a quality drawing--so be prepared to put in serious time if you do want to learn something. From what I've heard, Will's class is a lot more laid back than the others, but it also puts you at risk of pushing yourself a lot less. In class still-lives get very repetitive and vary very little, homework assignments are also fairly basic. The trade-off to the class's laid-back vibe is that other than yourself, no one will seem to be very invested in the work you produce.",
    "Make no mistake - this class is a lot of work. Villalongo is one of the more reasonable professors, however. He states at the beginning of the course that you should expect 8 hours of homework each week (twice as much homework time as class time). He focuses mainly on still lifes, which can get a little tedious by the end of the semester unless you go out of your way to choose interesting subject matter. Overall, though, really good course and good professor. I am a LOT better at drawing than I was at the beginning of the semester."
