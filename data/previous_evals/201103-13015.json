    "Italian Food and Literature was fantastic. If you're looking for a humanities credit... this is it. The reading isn't overwhelming and it goes by quickly. A lot of the texts are really awesome, and not difficult to get into. Normally, I hate doing any type of readings, but these were great. The one day a week class period goes by quicker than expected and we got to eat food in class on occasion. Take it!",
    "Definitely take this class. The texts are great, and you think about food in an entirely different way.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian Food and Literature! If you have the chance to take it, you definitely should. I has been my favorite class at Yale so far. All of the texts are great and very enjoyable (this is coming from someone who doesn't normally enjoy a lot of literature texts). The workload was very manageable, and I often enjoyed doing the readings, especially when you get to Calvino. The papers are very flexible because you can write about anything concerning the texts or films. Overall, take this class. You definitely won't regret it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Food proves to be a fascinating and far reaching lens through which to examine 650 years of italian history and literature. I wouldn't want anything about the selection and arrangement of the texts changed as the course has superb flow. Conversations in Sicily and Big Night were among my favorites.",
    "Take it as a fifth class or if you find reading and thinking about food fun. You draw some interesting connections between works but discussion in class can get kind of dull. Professor Sodi is really nice but the class can get kind of boring at times. The workload isn't too bad though.",
    "We learned about Italian culture and italian food culture through famous italian literary works.",
    "Professor Sodi is incredibly nice and helpful, but I rarely felt challenged or intrigued by the class. Some readings were cool, others were not so great. We got to eat in class a lot which was awesome! It would be a good easy 5th class or an easy seminar.",
    "Take it, if you can get in! The readings are a great survey of Italian lit, and Prof. Sodi is wonderful. Even the assignments are fun: for my final project, I cooked and ate Italian soup. Hard to beat that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you like food and like reading, you will love it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you want to read a variety of major works of Italian literature from an angle you would probably never otherwise. The discussion is good and focused, the workload is manageable, Professor Sodi is wonderful, and the class is most importantly, very enjoyable.",
    "It's a great overview of important Italian literature. Sometimes it seems a little random to go from a really well known work to a seemingly obscure cookbook, but she hits major points in Italian literature and manages to relate them to food. During the more literature type sections, it ended up not being as focused on food as one would think -- it's definitely still a literature-analysis perspective on the pieces, films, etc. that are studied. But it's a fun way to approach different pieces --through the lens of food--and she gives you liberty in how to approach it without being too lax.",
    "A gem of a class. Meets once a week, minimal reading, complete freedom with essay topics. Professor Sodi is sweet and helpful. Not incredibly substantial, but easy and enjoyable. BUT due to its popularity it's super difficult to get in."
