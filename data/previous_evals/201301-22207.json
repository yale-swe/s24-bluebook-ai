    "Are you really reading this? Why do you need to read evals to know that this is an AWESOME class. Dan Egan is a great professor - really interesting and understanding. Plus, the content is really enjoyable. Who doesn't want to nerd out and talk about Sondheim constantly?",
    "Sondheim Sondheim Sondheim, if you know and love your musical theater, there is NO reason not to take it.",
    "The course was fantastic. The readings were engaging, the class filled the whole allotted time without getting boring or repetitive, and the field trip to meet Sondheim and see Passion (probably a different Sondheim show for future classes) a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Be prepared to be humbled by an amazing, diverse set of insights and reactions from your peers. Enjoy a thorough, meaningful summary of some amazing theater\u00e2\u0080\u0094and get to meet Sondheim!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Do it. Do it if you are a theater person. Do it if you are not a theater person (I'm not). Just take it. You'll develop a greater appreciation for the theater in general and for Sondheim in particular. Professor Egan will help you along the way if you've never written papers like this before. You'll walk around Yale with the most beautiful, interesting, thought-provoking music in your mind. You'll think about theater in an entirely different manner. Please, just take this class.",
    "If you like musical theater take this course! I went in, only knowing a few Sondheim shows, and being quite skeptical of people's obsession with the man. Taking this course helped me learn to appreciate and indeed enjoy a lot of his shows, so I'm glad to do it. THere's not too much work; only 3 papers. The rest of the class is just listening to shows, doing a few readings, and getting to go to NYC to see a show! Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale. Dan Egan is definitely one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Such a great person and a phenomenal teacher.",
    "YES YOU NEED TO TAKE IT. It is a complete joy.",
    "Good class. Be warned: if you go in not knowing much about musicals but simply thinking, \"oh, Sondheim's music is pretty! I should take this,\" you will learn more than you bargained for about theater.",
    "MUSI 337 is a comprehensive introduction to the works and overarching themes of the musical theater canon of Stephen Sondheim, providing both specific case studies and general trends of the art form over the second half of the twentieth century. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student, whether interested in musical theater, in which case it's a must, or simply interested in contemporary art and theater, in which case it's an important example of a leading writer and artist of our times.",
    "This is a bit of work, but the payoff is amazing. Meeting Sondheim was absolutely fantastic, but the entire class was hugely entertaining and interesting."
