    "A very comprehensive course of chinese. Speaking skills definitely improve and you learn SO MUCH. Complex sentence structures become second nature.",
    "I thought this course was challenging but very worthwhile. It helped me improve my vocabulary, speaking, listening and writing abilities. For me, this class was a tough transition from high school, but I think it was worth the time and the effort.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course - it's taught really well and it's really fun. Be warned that there is a LOT of memorization involved, and you will be spending hours doing homework and studying for this class. It's definitely worth it though.",
    "CHNS 130 is a great language course. I felt like I learned a lot, and it was an enjoyable experience. I would recommend it to others.",
    "CHNS 130 is a great class for people to continue studying Chinese. It is a tough class however, (depending on the Chinese background of the student) and each student is expected to do a lot of work. Though it's a hard class, the professors are always willing to help struggling students and the gains from Chinese 130 a certainly noticeable.",
    "This is a great continuation of Mandarin Chinese classes at Yale. The daily assignments and weekly tutorial meetings really help you practice all aspects (reading, speaking, writing, listening) of the language. You will have to memorize many more characters compared to the previous two levels. Classes still meet every day. The tools are there if you want a consistent way to learn this interesting language. I would definitely recommend this class. To add, I recommend you seek your own supplementary ways of learning, such as: movies, friends who speak the language, and tutoring."
