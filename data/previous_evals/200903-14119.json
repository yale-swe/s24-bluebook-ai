    "I felt Prof. Mendelsohn assumed we knew way more about calculus than many of us actually did. He seemed unable to put forth concise, easy to understand examples without a lot of math. In the future, please provide a warning of the math requirements for this class so people like me can avoid it.",
    "I thought Professor Kotchen at times overcomplicated his explanations of economic theories.",
    "Both the professors were great - there was a certain moment of confusion at the point when prof. Mendelsohn started teaching - his methods were quite different prof. Kotchen's and it took me a few classes to adapt. Prof. Mendelsohn's portion relied two heavily on formulas - his descriptions of different subjects were way more useful than the formulas. Prof. Mendelsohn's diagrams could have been clearer.",
    "I generally enjoyed this class very much; I thought Matt Kotchen was an incredible professor very straight-forward and an excellent presenter of material (all of which was completely new to me). The teaching styles of Kotchen and Mendelsohn are quite different, and switching through mid-way was a difficult adjustment. Although it took a few weeks, I came to enjoy Mendelsohn's blunt and sometimes controversial approach to natural resource economics--I thought his lessons were important for the class to hear.I enjoyed the readings from the first half of the semester more than the second--I liked the more policy orientated papers and thought they were incredibly relevant and interesting. I didn't do the readings in the second half as much because they tended to be riddled with calculus equations that I didn't understand.",
    "It would have been more helpful to have more textbook readings similar to the first 5 or so chapters on basic environmental economics that were provided at the beginning of the semester. I enjoyed having the two perspectives of different professors, although I felt they could have communicated more thoroughly about what information the other had presented. The TA was fairly helpful, but was more theoretical and abstract than necessary.",
    "1).Some of the readings in the second half of the class contained alot of calculus based concepts and therefore were very difficult to understand.2).The score given in question 2 reflects how well I think both of the professors together did at explaining the info. The first half of the course was taught by Kotchen and the second half was taught by Mendelsohn, and they have to very different teaching styles. And therefore it was an adjustment to understand what they wanted you to get. Kotchen is very technical and graph oriented; while Mendelsohn is more big picture and alot of his concepts can be explained in words.7).Part A- Again, this is an average of how well I thought the two teachers did together. I had an easier time with understanding many of the concepts that Mendelsohn presented than Kotchen.Part C-I had the most interaction with Shannon and this score is a reflection of that. She was very good at explaining the concpets. Additionally, a few times she took her personal time (outside of sectional hours and office hours) to answer questions that I had. I am very appreciative of her dedication.",
    "2. Prof. Kotchen did a good job making the material easier for students with no background in resource economics to grasp. However, I did feel like he might have been oversimplifying some of the concepts. I had a much harder time with Prof. Mendelsohn. I realize that he is very intelligent and is an excellent economist, but he needs to spend more time clearly illustrating the course concepts he is trying to convey. I would suggest an outline so that he can write the equations properly the first time. It is very difficult when we cannot read his handwriting and have to decipher an equation that has to be changed later because it was written incorrectly.3. The assignments were very useful. However, it makes it much harder if we have no idea how to do the assignments without going to the TA's. Some of the questions (esp. for Prof. Kotchen's assignments) need to be reworked so that we know what is being asked of us. Prof. Mendelsohn's assignments were very clear and succinct.5. Prof. Kotchen was great with student questions and comments. Sometimes Prof. Mendelsohn seemed to imply that the questioner was being stupid. I think this might be because he was trained as a more traditional economist who was teaching a class filled with extremely ecologically-sensitive students. Dismissing the moral argument for environmental protection because it doesn't make economic sense won't work well in a class like that, and he won't be able to reach those students. Having a moral argument for environmental protection is great, but many economists and other members of society won't see it that way. Perhaps rephrasing the economic view so that students who support the moral argument can see the need to compromise would be a better strategy.7a. Kotchen: 2; Mendelsohn: 37c. Shannon Siart gets a 5; Jeff Chow was worthless and dismissive. Jeff kept going back to deriving calculus equations when trying to help us, and no one knows calculus. Hewas short in emails and in review sessions, and we generally learned to avoid him if we wanted any help. He shouldn't even go to classes if he's just going to surf on Facebook the whole time and not pay any attention whatsoever. If we need help in the class, it's more effective for us to have someone (like Shannon) who was paying attention and knows what parts of lecture might be confusing, especially in relation to confusing homework questions.",
    "This is a very important and relevant course especially with the current debate the world over about global warming. It is my understanding that this course is a fusion of the former Economics of the Natural Resources and Economics of Pollution. Students therefore have a lot to cover within a relatively short period. Secondly there were two lecturers teaching the pollution part and the global warming and natural resources portions. These were wonderful and brilliant lectures with very different teaching styles and views and this was not very helpful since the two parts of the course are closely related with one having to draw ideas from both sides. Overall it was a great experience and I dare say the most relevant course I took over the fall semester.",
    "I really like Kotchen...he was an enthusiastic lecturer, able to clearly explain material and relate it to broader concepts.",
    "In response to question 7: Having two instructors was not handled well. Prof Kotchen's last lecture was terrific. However, Prof Mendelsohn's lectures were rambling, ideological, and filled with inaccuracies passed off as fact (i.e. \"the biggest share of the US budget goes towards welfare\"). Mendelsohn's offensive defense of mountain-top removal was another unwelcome ideological imposition. At FES, I would expect an environmental\/natural resource economics class to help me understand alternatives to the mainstream economic analysis which has had such disastrous results when applied to the biosphere. Nothing of the kind was provided here.The course was very sloppily run. One example: For the final exam, Mendelsohn expected us to know how to solve a problem that he had provided to his undergrad economics class for a midterm. However, this problem (which occupied a large portion of the final) had not appeared on any of our problem sets. So, I had not studied it. We were told to study our problemsets closely as models for the final. If I'd known that our final would rely on a Yale College midterm, I might have taken the undergrad class instead.Also, often, Mendelsohn and Kotchen seemed not to communicate at all. One prof used terminology as if assuming the other prof had taught it to us, which was not the case. Kotchen told us he would write part of the final but Mendelsohn told us he would not. These confusions seemed unnecessary and unprofessional. Mendelsohn's own chalk work was internally inconsistent and confusingly non-standard, even given the person-to-person variations in economic notation. A textbook might have permitted self-study, but none was provided. Kotchen's readings were helpful at first, but Mendelsohn's attitude seemed to be that students would learn economics simplyby being in his presence and hearing his opinions on matters he is not even remotely qualified to speak about, such as climate science.",
    "There were two professors for this course. I would give Professor Kotchen an excellent rating and Professor Mendelsohn an average rating.",
    "BEcause the course had two instructors it is difficult to evaluate them as one since they had very different teaching styles. Kotchen was much more clear and thorough in his explanations. Sometimes it was difficult to understand what Mendelson taught because he did not provide a conceptual framework that made it always easy to follow. Also, I felt that his explanation of many issues were simplistic and he did not show arguments for and against the policy tools that he explained.",
    "Co-taught by Mendelsohn and Kotchen.Kotchen was very organized and clear in his explanations. Mendelsohn clearly knows his stuff, but focused a little too much on calculus equations instead of the overall concepts. Although everyone should have calculus background, it was a little challenging to all of sudden go into applied calculus. Luckily, Mendelsohn focused on the big picture concepts during the final.",
    "7: We had 2 instructors. Matt Kotchen was dynamic and precise and fast paced and fun.Rob Mendelsohn was fun, interesting, fast paced, but a little careless about labeling graphs and writing legibly, and threw too much calculus on the board by way of illustrating points that we didn't need calculus to understand.",
    "Kotchen taught the first half and was crystal clear and taught well. Mendelsohn was less so, although he had interesting things to say.",
    "The course was taught by two professors with very different styles. Matt Kotchen was enthusiastic and clear in his delivery. I found Prof. Mendelsohn to be rather dictatorial and fuzzy in his delivery. This made it VERY hard to follow him at times. It was also apparent that the two professors had little communication about their respective halves of the course. This was frustrating. I would recommend classes with Kotchen but not Mendelsohn to future students.",
    "Question 2. Kotchen's explanations were excellent. Mendelsohn explanations were fuzzy and without apparent structure.Question 7. Kotchen overall rating - excellent. Mendelsohn overall rating - average.",
    "(1) I gave up on the readings early on in the course. They didn't seem to be useful, and some were so dense that they would have taken me days to get through them, and it wouldn't have benefited me in the class. When asked to post more chapters from an introductory econ textbook, Kotchen did, and I found these to be the most useful readings of all. He glossed over introductory concepts way too fast for anyone without an econ background to understand, so these readings should definitely be included (made available for optional reading).(2) The pace of the class (especially under Kotchen) was much too fast for me. I got lost in class all the time. I didn't think either professor was especially good at teaching the concepts, though their methods were very different.(5) Both professors answered (and encouraged students to ask) questions in class, but it seemed superficial and dismissive a lot of the time.(6) If there really are no required prerequisites, the class needs to be slowed down in the beginning to make sure students understand the basics. The pace was much too fast.(7) The TA situation for this class was abysmal. The TA's would teach conflicting material and post solutions that they did not both agree upon. Several times, one TA would grade an assignment and would take off points for students who answered questions the way the other TA taught them. Jeff seemed to more reliably understand the material, but he was unable to teach TA sessions without using calculus and performing proofs (which I found unhelpful because I have an aversion to calculus and it's not a prerequisite for this course). This continued despite my pleading that he not use calculus in his explanations. I stopped going to Shannon's sessions because the material she taught turned out to be wrong on a couple occasions.",
    "Qu 1-3: I found the terminology to be inconsistent, which sometimes made it difficult to reference the reading material for insight on completing assignments. With few exercises to practice concepts, I would learn from my errors\/problem set solutions in understanding what the professor meant to accomplish. The number of assignments was adequate, but optional practice material would be helpful.",
    "Re. Q#2, there are two profs. for this course, Mendelsohn and Kotchen. Both are excellent instructors, though it is worth noting that Mendelsohn could be more clear in his instruction, particularly in his use of the whiteboard, which is occasionally difficult to read.",
    "The class was excellent. However, the pace of the class was quite fast particularly for me, an international student. I sometimes stuggled to catch with the class and work in TA session. The TA's were excellent.",
    "It's hard to answer the above questions well, since the course was team-taught. However, I personally think the material was incredibly valuable, no matter who taught it.",
    "This depends a lot on personal preference, but Prof. Mendelsohn's section was more interesting and more closely related to my interests than Prof. Kotchen's (which was definitely important as well). I really liked Mendelsohn's focus on the big picture - REALLY!!!! Please don't let disgruntled students tell you otherwise. Seeing the big picture is an important skill.About the TAs, Shannon was invariably friendly, encouraging, helpful, and patient, and while Jeffrey was encouraging and helpful, he was not very patient, adn less understanding. He often seemed at a loss to explain basic mathematical or economical concepts - which is sort of key for an intro-level class. But he tried."

    "The professors need to have an outline going into each lecture with all the equations\/graphs drawn exactly as they should be so that they can be duplicated on the board.

    "See above.",

    "1. The syllabus is hard to decipher with respect to the weekly readings, meaning that on any given week it is difficult to determine the relevant readings. Syllabus should be revised to list the readings by week rather than by subject (or alternately the readings could be listed in the lecture schedule rather than separately in a different section).2. Mendelsohn's lectures were often hard to follow simply because his use of the whiteboard was confusing. If his whiteboard notes were more legible and more consistent (how he represents variables, etc.), there would have been less confusion.",
    "More continuity between the two instructors! Prof. Mendelsohn used different terminology and different notation from Prof. Kotchen, and presented formulas in a different way on the final exam than he did in class. Not okay when the material is new to people!Prof. Mendelsohn could improve his delivery of material in the following way: When presenting a formula, slow down, write the letters clearly, explain the new symbols we haven't seen before, and if there's a graph, take the time to draw it slowly so it makes some sense in our notes.And when changing a formula, please re-write the whole thing! Students need to be able to see the change in their notes later from one to the next, and even if we didn't need to, we do not have whiteboards where we can erase one thing and change it to something else--we have paper and pen and need a few seconds to write down the whole new formula before you start explaining it and move on to the next topic. This is especially true for students whose first language is not English.The assignments in the second half of the course and the practice exam for the final contained typos that suggested that the professor did not read them after he wrote them out. Minor errors in wording or in a formula can be very confusing to a student, especially those whose first language is not English.",

Sometimes their answers were inconsistent though.Jeff was generally quite helpful but sometimes seemed more interested in showing how well he understands calculus than in explaining concepts. Could be impatient when students did not understand quickly enough.",
    "They are VERY helpful and ready to answer questions.",
    "I visited TA session to prepare my homework and prepare for exams and found them most helpful.",
    "The TA were available throughout the week and i could go to them with a question without hesitation. I attended Jeffery's TA session frequently.",
    "Great. I pretty much exclusively worked with Shannon, and she was terrific--clear, patient, and thorough."

    "I think economics is an integral part of learning about how to address environmental problems",
    "It's necessary for me to learn that because it contains so much basic theory of environmental economics. Although I took this course back in my college, this lecture is quite advanced and taught me many quantitive methods. Also, I got the concept of how to see environmental issue in an economic way.",
    "I am an MEM student, so this course fit one of my bins; however, the information I received in this class is invaluable, and I'm really glad I took it.",
    "It's not exactly related to my overall course of study, but I think it informs it really well, and I've always wanted to understand economics better",
    "When i first pick this class, i didn't think if it will turn to be very helpful. I took environmental economics in my final year at undergraduate but it wasn't valuable compared to this course. The material were so helpfull espicially when learned how to link different factors on the use of natural resources with economics.",
    "I audited this course as I already have some background in environmental economics but wanted a refresher. That being said, only the first half of the course represented repeat material, with the latter half being completely new.",
    "I was a resource economics minor in undergrad. I had a much easier time with this course than many other students. I am interested in the economic valuation of strategies for reducing western grazing lease litigation, so it fits pretty well.",
    "Great survey course in climate\/resource economics. This course will help you with many other great classes at FES.",
    "This course was great for me, because of it's usefulness. Understanding economics is very important to conservation.",
    "THe course allows me to better understand environmental policies and it exposed me to a way of doing policy analysis.",
    "Economics is critical for making decisions about the environment. This help me refine those skills.",
    "I understand why econ is a requirement for MEM students, I just wish that there was a larger set of econ courses to choose from.",
    "This is an important class for all first year students to take, regardless of your concentration. I am not sure how this fits into my course of study, but the subjects covered will allow me to speak knowledgeably on a variety of important issues surrounding natural resource management.",
    "This was a bin 4 requirement for an MEM.",
    "I probably won't be taking advanced Econ courses, but I'm glad I took this, as it shed light on every other course I took during the semester, and probably for the rest of my time at FES.",
    "I think it's essential. My adviser recommended that I take it, and I find economics fascinating, and am happy to have the tool at my disposal as I research policy and management matters."
