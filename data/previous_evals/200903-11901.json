   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone and all interested in Arabic, however, beware that it is an incredible time commitment. There is lots of vocabulary and grammar to be memorized each night, as well as written assignments to be turned in every day, and quizzes every Friday. The work is always germane though and greatly helps to reinforce everything you learn in class. You will finish the semester feeling satisfied with what you have learned and wanting to learn more.",
    "If you have any inclination to take Arabic, take this course here, at Yale -- you'll have an amazing foundation and, I think, a good time. The course work is a bit much at times (you really do need to spend between 1.5 and 2 hours every night on homework) but you come away feeling like you have a real grasp on the basics of Arabic. And you also avoid relying on the textbook too much, with fun in class work and readings from children's book translated into Arabic.",
    "Arabic 110 01 is an enjoyable but rigorous course. I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in learning a new and exciting language. The pace is fast, but it's amazing how much material we covered in the course. You won't be disappointed if you're looking for a course that will challenge you.",
    "Arabic is tough. It's a lot of work, it's confusing, you'll get lost and feel overwhelmed, but, at the end of the day you'll realize that you are actually learning the language really well.",
    "Take it. It's hard, but it's a beautiful language and definitely worth your time.",
    "It's a lot of work. I won't deny that. But at the same time, it is extremely rewarding when you put forth the effort needed and reap the benefits from doing so.",
    "I would say that Arabic 110 01 is a strong course that will quickly introduce you to the basics of Arabic. I am impressed with what I have learned so far; we know a fair amount of grammar and basic vocabulary, and are able to read fairly well.",
    "The 2 hours of studying is a must, and for someone slow like me it was more like 3-4 hours. It is still fun.",
    "This class is a really great introduction, but be prepared to work. It helps if you've taken some Arabic before, but that's not necessary. Arabic is a great language if you enjoy bizarre grammar and think you'd like writing in another alphabet.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, with Ghassan.",
    "Arabic 110 is an intensive course but I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Really, really great - but a lot of work. Don't go in expecting it to be a cakewalk, but if you're willing to put in the effort, it can be really enjoyable.",
    "If you want to know Arabic, then take it. Its a good introduction to formal arabic. Remember that taking this course will not really prepare you for travelling to the arab world and speaking with people there, as you are learning MSA. But I guess its a necessary stepping stone along the way.It's a lot of work but never really hard or overwhelming, just constant amounts of work.Also be prepared for quizzes on Friday- that gets pretty annoying.",
    "I would not recommend studying Arabic at Yale. The textbook is really, really bad as far as structure goes. The professors do supplement it with additional material, but this just means that resources are decentralized, which is confusing when you're trying to study. Many other languages at Yale are taught in much more productive ways. Unless you're really, really convinced that you HAVE to learn Arabic, consider another course.",
    "It's Arabic for those who have no knowledge of Arabic. You start with the writing and pronunciation of the alphabet and move on to full words. It is intensive with daily homework, but you learn a lot, as you should for 1.5 credits for the semester.",
    "Once the year starts off, the class gets into a pretty consistent weekly routine with new vocabulary introduced over the weekend and a quiz on that vocabulary and a new grammar concept every Friday. Yes, I would recommend Arabic 110 to another student because you really learn a lot and Arabic is a very interesting language. However, I would hope that the frustrating inconsistencies within the department are cleared up first.",
    "I very much recommend it. I learned a lot, and fell well equipped to continue studying Arabic. It is a different amount of work for different people-- it really all depends on how well things click with you. A fun, productive class.",
    "Arabic 110 was an excellent introduction to the language, and the Professors do a wonderful job of it. Absolutely students should take it.",
    "This was a great course! It is very time-consuming, and it is especially difficult in the first month when you are expected to learn a lot of material very quickly. After you get into the flow of things, it is easier. Definitely for anyone who wants to learn Arabic.",
    "Arabic 110 is a challenging, but fulfilling language course. I'm sure all L1 language classes are difficult, but know that if you've never been exposed to Arabic at all before, it is definitely a good deal of work. However, my teacher, Prof. al-Ani was incredibly nice, patient and helpful. The students become very close because it is a class that requires time and practice. I went into the class having no knowledge of the Arabic language andcome out loving it. While Arabic is not the quickest language to learn, it is definitely a fun and satisfying class in a language that is worth persuing.",
    "If you're willing to put in an hour a night, class is enjoyable and you never feel burdened. It's a big commitment but you do learn a lot. I would recommend this strongly if you're interested at all. I had Shady, and he was amazing. He made class extremely fun and had a great sense of humor, but we still learned a lot.",
    "Arabic is really hard, but awesome. If you're willing to put the work in, it will be fantastic and really rewarding.",
    "Rigorous course. (more so than in years past). Take if you are serious about learning the language. Arabic isn't easy!",
    "If you're willing to put the time into Arabic and interested in it, definitely take it! It does take up a significant amount of time, though, so be warned.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student who was passionate about learning the language because it requires a lot of work and commitment.",
    "If you're interested in Arabic, take it. The program is excellent. I've never enjoyed a language so much. It requires a lot of time, about 2 hours a day, sometimes more, but if you put in the time, you'll love it.",
    "I think it was a great class with a heavy focus on grammar. It was challenging, but the goals set for us were always achievable.",
    "So hard!",
    "Arabic 110 is intense, but you definitely feel that you've come along way by the time it ends. It can be annoying that more than half the people in the class already understand Arabic to some degree, but if you're resourceful these people are also a great source of information. I would definitely recommend Arabic 110, it's a beautiful language and a great choice for someone seeking to move on from that high school language class that made them sick. I feel a hundred times more intelligent simply by being able to read and write in Arabic characters. Do it.",
    "Arabic 110 is great! By the end of the semester, you'll be amazed by how for you have come.",
    "Only take Arabic if you are ready to really devote yourself to it. It takes a ton of time and it's very difficult to memorize the vocab and grammar concepts, since they aren't related to the english at all. The schedule is also pretty rough: there's homework every night, even the night after a test, a quiz every week once you get out of the first book, and tests at the most random and inconvenient times. So if you are going to take it, be sure to really commit. Also, scope out the teachers to see which is the best for you, since there is a wide variation.",
    "Yes, take it there is nothing like the joy of writing your first arabic sentence or reading a page of arabic script, quite a fulfilling experience, worth all the effort you'll have to put into it.",
    "Arabic 110 is designed to give the student a basic understanding of beginning Arabic grammar and vocabulary, from verb conjugations (which are taught very well) to cases, word order, noun-adjective agreement, and so forth. I would definitely recommend it for any with an interest in the language!",
    "Definitely. Arabic is the best language course I've ever taken. I've already learned more in a semester than I learned in 2 years of French. At least. It's completely incredible.",
    "Yes definitely; an interesting way to learn a beautiful language.",
    "Arabic 110 is a great introduction to the language, and having come out of first semester I'm even surprised by how much we've covered thus far. The class provides a constant workload that can seem bothersome, but that I felt was necessary if you really want to learn the language. I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone earnestly interested in learning arabic, however this is not the language I would take to grab a language requirement.",
    "Arabic 110 is a beginning Arabic course. It is a fun language unlike any others you have taken at Yale. There is a lot of work but in general it is rewarding. I really enjoyed Arabic 110 and I would reccommend it to anyone because I believe Arabic is a valuable language to know and I can't imagine a better way to learn it.",
    "Arabic is extremely intensive and requires a lot of work. Take it if you're interested in the language, not just for the heck of it. But it was absolutely great!",
    "If you are interested in learning a language that is practical and useful in today's world, take Arabic 110. Ghassan is the best instructor I've had at Yale, he cares for your progress and will help you through it all. Be warned, it is a lot of work. I didn't imagine how much time I'd spend with it every day (about 2 hours), but I feel that just after a semester, I've learned so much. Great language, and a great department here at Yale.",
    "If you know you are interested in taking Arabic, take this class! If you're hesitant, really think about how badly you want to do this class, because it's no walk in the park. The first 2 or 3 weeks are very tough, while you learn the alphabet and such, but after that it gets easier and is very enjoyable!",
    "Grammar and sentence structure aren't that complicated, but a lot of the class is straight memorization. It requires a lot of study to fully grasp it. Don't take this course unless you have a real interest and Arabic and are willing to put in the time.",
    "definitely",
    "I strongly recommend this class. The language is fascinating, and the teaching - at least from the two teachers who taught me - is superb. The class moves quickly (expect 2hrs of homework a night at least), but it is certainly manageable, and the teachers work hard to make sure that students don't fall behind. It can sometimes be easy to feel lost, but the availability of teachers, TAs and helpful undergrads means that getting on track is never too difficult."
