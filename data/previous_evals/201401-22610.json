    "I would not recommend this course",
    "This course explains the principles of population genetics and ancestry, as well as risk prediction (with respect to disease) and modeling genetic effects on multiple levels (e.g., SNPs, genes, gene networks, etc.) It requires a background in both statistics and medical genetics (i.e., familiarity with using genetics to predict phenotypes and\/or disease, but not necessarily cell biology). I would recommend it to students interested in employing statistical genetic methods in their own work, but probably not to students with general interest in this field."
