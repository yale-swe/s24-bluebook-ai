    "I learned a TON from this course. I left with a newfound appreciation and passion for cinema, as well as a desire to continue in film studies. The class focuses both on the technical aspects of film-making and plot, which was a great combination. My Spanish also improved a lot because I was constantly hearing new accents in the movies.",
    "Learned so much about Spanish film but I was not the most proficient Spanish speaker so I definitely struggled in the class more than other students. Take this if you really feel comfortable with your Spanish, but also Matgherita is so nice that it really wasn't that bad I think I did ok in the class I was just taking it Credit D so I was also slacking",
    "basic foundations of spanish film",
    "This course offered histories of Latin American cinema that are too often overlooked in discussions of Western film and film in general. I was able to both sharpen my eye for analyzing films as films and refine my Spanish-speaking abilities in the class.",
    "This course taught me nothing about how to look more closely and analyze movies. Instead, it taught me a very very superficial history of Latin American film making. In theory, the many many written assignments would have been great opportunities to improve my skills, but since we never got feedback since the professor was always so behind, these became tesiuoua tasks that did not help me become a better Spanish speaker or writer.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Latin American film and the history of South and Central America in general. It also increased my understanding of Spanish.",
    "general knowledge of the spanish language and also general film knowledge",
    "Great insight into Latin American film, culture, and history.",
    "The class went through the history of Spanish film and examined film through a cinematographic lens.",
    "Exposure to different Latin American cultures, knowledge of film practices"

   "comments": [
    "The only weakness would be that it could be good to have more discussion in class. With that said, I really enjoyed hear Profesora Tortora speak.",
    "Super nice instructor You should use more power points so I can hear the names of the significant historical figures more clearly. I liked when we did more group work and takes about the movies in groups first so then I could talk more in class later",
    "The visits from the filmmakers were amazing. It was one of my favorite parts of the class.",
    "a ton of screenings at night that took up time",
    "The main strength of the course was how it encouraged us to attend screenings of contemporary Latin American films and engage in conversation with their creators. The main weakness was that many times class discussions turned into lectures (although I think this was really more the fault of the students than the professor).",
    "It was great because it was an interesting way to practice Spanish and I learned a lot of history I had no idea about. We didn't talk very much in class so I did not get a chance to practice.",
    "there are way too many movies, but overall it is a great course introduction into spanish cinema",
    "Everything was amazing except I wish there were more opportunities to have more discussions and talk.",
    "The course was interesting and Professor Tortora was really sweet\/ dedicated, but there were not many opportunities for engagement. Most of the class was her describing films and we were just sitting taking notes. Film is much more interesting when it can be discussed.",
    "Lots of opportunities to speak with actual directors. More conversation in class, or a smaller class size, might be helpful."

    "Absolutely. If you get to L5 Spanish and don't take this course, you are making a big mistake.",

    "It's a lot of work but Professora Tortora is amazing and I love her energy and spirit, she makes it better.",
    "absolutely",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a student, although only one who actually wants to learn about film (and not one who simply wants to fulfill an L5 credit).",
    "I would not recommend this course with Professor Tortora.",
    "Yes! It was a great way to learn Spanish with an interesting subject and you get to meet real film makers.",
    "i think this course is a bit harder than it presents. the screenings and multiple films a week take up a lot of time.",
    "Absolutely, it is a very special class.",
    "The class is good for an L5 spanish course. I don't think that the gap between L4 and L5 in the Spanish department is particularly well handled by any of the L5 classes. Unless you want to study grammar intensively, the other L5 classes assume some degree of fluency. Spending more time actually developing language skills would be good. I would recommend this class, but also give the caveat that it will not necessarily improve your Spanish speaking abilities. You listen a lot, so comprehension becomes somewhat better.",
