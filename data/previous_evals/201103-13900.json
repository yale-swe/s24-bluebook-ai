    "I would highly recommend Topics in African Studies to any student interested in Africa, and interested in challenging their notions of what goes on on that continent.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for an introduction to a lot of worthwhile topics related to Africa. Doesn't matter if you're an Africanist or someone looking to get their feet wet -- this is a good course with a lot of valuable subject matter.On the other hand, the projects are all entirely open, so if you need a lot of guidance with your work, this isn't the class for you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student, especially Africanists. I would not recommend it, however, to someone who wants some kind of \"crash course\" on Africa. What was wonderful about this class was that everyone had experiences and knowledge in different parts of the continent already.",
    "I would surely recommend this course to another student. This class may be the only time a student can be adequately introduced to the various disciplines, topics (and even issues) within the study of Africa."
