   "comments": [
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class. Whether as student is particularly interested in urban studies or not, this is one of the few classes I've taken that features consistently generative discussions.",
    "AMST 789 01 was a reading course that presented great exposure to the big names and ideas in the historical development of urban social theory and important current works within the field. Students each took a week to introduce and discuss the authors and the final project was flexible enough to be geared toward larger projects in which the student was immersed. I would highly recommend the class feeling like it opened up an useful area of social theory applicable to my broader work, which I had not previously explored in such depth.",
    "Absolutely, yes. This course would be relevant to a wide array of students, in all of the interdisciplinarity inherent to studying cities.",
    "I would definitely recommend Social Theory of Cities to another student. The course clarifies broad themes in Urban History and should be taken by anyone who lives in cities and wonders how particular processes influence their construction and composition.",
    "I would absolutely recommend AMST 789, I think it should be a required course."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered me useful theoretical frameworks that have already impacted my work. These frameworks provide a voice not often heard within my field, but one that can be rich source of interdisciplinary conversation. I feel my scholarship will be deeper because of this interaction.",
    "What I learned in this course will be vastly helpful as I go forward to work on dissertation research. So grateful to have had the opportunity to take it.",
    "Again, this course exposed me to several themes in Urban History and the final assignment, an annotated comprehensive exam list, serves as the basis of my Urban History comprehensive exam list. The final assignment was also useful because it perfectly matched up with my dissertation topic, as all of the books on my list will inform the historiography of my dissertation.",
    "This course was very helpful to my own work. Not only did I enjoy all of the readings assigned, but with the reading responses and class discussion I know that these works will influence my writing style and content moving forward."
