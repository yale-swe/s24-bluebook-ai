    "MCDB 310 is an intensive and fast-paced introduction to human physiology. It is by no means an easy course, but it is one of the best taught and most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It requires significant time and effort, but it is well worth it.",
    "Take it. Very fulfilling, but keep up.",
    "A pretty great class. This surprised me a little. The lectures are really good Saltzman is a boss and then you have some guest lectures that ranged from great (Aronson) to meh (Holt, Zenisek). Its tremendously interesting stuff presumably youre here because youre premed in which case hopefully youre interested or else you might wanna rethink that career plan. The exams are very fair and not as hard as I thought they would be. Now to the downsides: the weekly assignments are really tedious. The way theyre graded, you can get full credit just by going to section, but the result of that is making section effectively mandatory. And section is tedious too. I loved my TA but at the end of the day I just dont agree philosophically with mandatory section because some people just learn better on their own. If I could change the class Id make the quizzes optional and section optional and just have all of the grade come down to the exams, but whatever. Again, the lectures were good and very interesting. Also the textbook was pretty great I think most people dont read it because it goes into way too much detail, but if you just read judiciously it can be really helpful and it has some incredibly great figures. The only other downside is that the rest of the class is your typical upperclassmen Asian tryhard premeds, so good luck getting ahead of the pack. But Id still recommend taking it because the lectures are just so interesting. I took the MCAT before taking this which was a mistake because a lot of this is necessary material, so theres another plus. Id give this class an A- : if it seems interesting, go for it.",
    "Goes through all the major organ systems in the body in rather deep detail, very interesting course.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale, but prepare to work! There is a lot of material and a ton of detail you have to know. But it's not just straight up memorization, this is one of those few classes where things make sense if you understand the concepts, and you can reason your way through test questions. The body is a fascinating thing, and this is definitely the course to take if you're thinking of medical school or the MCAT.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class because it is fascinating, however I would recommend it be taken Credit\/D because the information required to know is a bit ridiculous.",
    "Solid class in physiology! Gives a good conceptual understanding, and in general strikes a good balance in terms of the amount of detail that we are asked to remember. Professor Aronson especially was amazing in terms of giving us an intuitive understanding of why cells, tissues and organs are designed the way they are. Definitely recommend.",
    "I really love physiology, even though my science course grades in general aren't too great. I don't expect to be doing too hot in this class. However, it was a lot of fun and the professors who teach are great. Just go to section every week and take the weekly quizzes seriously (in preparation for finals.) People will tell you the Costanzo book is a good alternative to the Boulpaep textbook - couldn't disagree more. For most summaries\/pathways I'm sure Costanzo is great but a bulk of your understanding of basic mechanisms in each organ system can be gleaned from Boulpaep. Study and treat every lecture equally-you honestly don't know what might come on the midterms or final exams. It's never what you think was emphasized the most. Stay on top of work in the class.",
    "The average is curved to an A in the class, which is really great and takes a lot of stress off learning the material. if you score below average, you will probably get an A-. Saltzman grades very generously, and this is why this class is filled with premeds (Not in a bad way). You will learn a lot in this course and get an A, so why not do it? Many of the people on these comments may comment on how it is hard to get good grades, but it is NOT true! Do not listen to these people! They are trying to guard and hide a well kept secret! Please do yourself a favor and take this course!",
    "BENG 350 should be taken with a light workload so that enough time can be devoted to it. You should really utilize the book and keep up with the class so you don't find yourself trying to learn multiple organ systems the day before the exam. A lot of information is conveyed, and you may find yourself struggling to keep up. Regardless, I think this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, although also arguably the hardest.",
    "Physiological \"Systems\" is a basic introductory-level course in physiology that surveys all of the systems -- basic cell, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, sensory\/vestibular, endocrine, nervous system\/neuro, GI, and reproductive. Given the incredible breadth of material, you are essentially only expected to understand the most basic principles in each system (much less detailed level than a medical school course in physiology, for reference). The homework basically consists of weekly problem sets (\"quizzes\") that are opened on the weekend and due the following Monday, for 20% of the grade, with the remaining 40% for two midterms and 40% for the final. The course as a result is not intense from week to week, but instead self studying and review of (key) material is critical.",
    "BENG 350 was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale (maybe the best). It was well taught and I loved coming to class every day. The material was super interesting and the professors were good overall. The midterms and final were challenging but fair. The quizzes were super helpful. The only weaknesses of the course were that a couple of the professors sped through complicated important material, which sometimes made it difficult to follow. Definitely take this class if you are premed, MCDB, MBB, BME, or interested in the human body. Get Constanzo and BB if you can because reading from both is helpful.",
    "Honestly no, or if you do take it, make sure it's a light semester for you. The class requires a lot of hours just to learn\/memorize information so the material is really interesting, but incredibly time consuming.",
    "Hard clas. Take it only if you need to.",
    "This is a really challenging course, but you will learn so much. If you want to do well, be prepared to work for it. That being said, it is definitely worth it and you will leave this course with a much better understanding of how the human body works. This course was the best-taught and most useful science course I have taken at Yale. I would strongly recommend it; the lecturers are fantastic and the material they cover is so interesting! I would not recommend doing all of the reading before each class. It has too much detail and is very dense. I would recommend skimming it or at least trying to read the titles and figures to have some understanding of what is going on. Also, try not to fall behind otherwise you will pay when exams come around. Exams take a lot of effort if you want to do well. Start studying very early because there is so much material to get through. Also, use the quizzes as practice for the short-answer questions -- they're actually pretty useful for this. The exams are pretty fair (multiple choice, T\/F, and short answer) and the questions are usually clear. If you can, get into Alex's section (or at least go to his office hours). He's such an incredible TA!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student! Even if this class isn't required for your major, you should take this class if you're interested in medicine or biology or just want to know more about how the human body works in general. You don't have to learn super detailed things (e.g., specific molecules and pathways) or memorize a ton of anatomical terms. This class is more about how different organ systems work together and thinking critically about how to apply knowledge learned in class to different situations (e.g. what happens if you have a blood clot in a vein or something goes wrong with some enzyme). Not too much work either!",
    "Take it!",
    "Physio is by far the best MCDB class at Yale, but is definitely a good amount of work! You will come away with an amazing amount of coherent knowledge though, so if you're interested and willing to work, it will be totally worth it.",
    "It takes a lot of time to learn everything, but a great class!",
    "Alright so you're probably taking this class if you're BME or premed or something, but anyone who's interested in biology and anatomy\/the human body should seriously consider taking this course. It covers the major systems of the body-- endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, reproductive, nervous-- along with some membrane physiology and electrophysiology. There are a series of guest lecturer that teach a certain number of classes in their field of specialty, which is really nice because you're learning from the best and it keeps things interesting. It is, however, a lot of memorization. Start studying early for the midterms\/final. Understand big picture material. There's probably too much detail in the textbook to keep track of it all with everyone else you have going on so I'd recommend the following. Download the lecture slides before class and go through them, taking notes. Then, go through the book and take notes only on the material covered in the slides (focus on things where the book gives you more useful info or provides more context, or where it's hard to tell what the lecture slides are trying to say). Then, in class you can simply modify these notes, adding or taking out small bits if need be.",
    "This is a great course. It will require a lot of reading, and studying, and if you don't keep up, the tests are going to be very difficult. However, it isn't that hard to keep up with: try to do the readings before lecture (and when you reach the inevitable point in the textbook where it becomes too difficult to understand, you can just stop and wait for lecture to clarify the level of detail necessary), and review\/finish them over the weekend while doing the quiz (which is untimed and in place of homework). I felt like I learned a lot from this course, and I would recommend it. It's probably really helpful for premeds, and required for BME--so if you're either of those, or maybe a bio major, take it.",
    "A lot of memorization. Just be warned that you will have to memorize a ton of info, and lectures and slides aren't always very clear. Lectures aren't particularly exciting and depending on the lecturer can be a whirlwind of facts or kind of dull and monotone (Dr. Around on is really good though). If you really like to memorize things take this class.",
    "This course, although a lot of work, is very rewarding, especially for those who will go on to use the material in medical or graduate school. This class definitely requires your time and effort but it is by no means impossible if you keep up with the material and start preparing for exams early.",
    "I would recommend this class. It can be tough at times, but it really forces you to learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend Physiological Systems to anyone who is interested in health or the body at all. The course was a lot of work, but I learned so much in just a semester. I now feel like I have a strong working knowledge of the body and of how everything fits together. It also made me excited to learn more, and reaffirmed my interest in health.",
    "Physiological Systems is a ton of work, so even if you think you have a good idea of the body I would still make sure you understand that it's a lot of work. That being said, I felt that I came out with an incredibly thorough understanding of the body, which I'd never had the opportunity to learn about. This class is dictated by the amount of work you put in; I put in a ton of time into the first midterm and did well, not enough time into the second and did poorly, and (hopefully) enough time into the final! Don't start cramming on the last day of finals, and make sure that you give the proper key terms in the short answers on the exams!",
    "I can say with certainty that this is one of the best science courses at Yale. The material is fascinating, as you get to learn about what the sensation of tasting salt actually is, how your kidney is basically the reason that we can stay alive everyday, and how we're actually just bags of electrically charged fluids. The human body is so interesting, I think it is in every human's interest to take this course and learn about the body that we all survive in. The professors are great, Saltzman directs the course very well, and the TAs are some of the best that I've seen at Yale. Grading is not too bad, as I think most people in the class stay focused on how fascinating all the material is. Take this course!",
    "Physiology is a great class that anyone who's interested in the human body should take. You learn and incredible amount of material in one semester and start to realize how much more there is to learn. That being said, there is a lot of material to learn. The hardest part of this class wasn't the workload, but rather, remembering the details from so many organ systems. The workload itself is just weekly quizzes and readings (if you choose to do those), two midterms and a final. Dr. Saltzman describes this as a med school level course and I would say I believe him in hindsight. However, it was definitely my favorite class of the semester and I would take it again. Also, if they run anatomy lab during reading week again, that is a must-attend opportunity that was truly amazing.",
    "An excellent, well-taught, and deeply fascinating course! The workload isn't too bad as long as you have a decent background in biology - we had weekly readings, weekly open-note quizzes, weekly discussion sections, two midterms, and a final. The weekly readings are overwhelming, but completely unnecessary except for on the open-note quizzes. I would discourage buying the 'Medical Physiology' textbook at all. I thought that lecture slides supplemented with the Constanzo Physiology book (available in PDF format around the web) was more than enough to help me excel in the class. The quizzes are open-note and took me about 1-2 hours (since I was reviewing the week's lecture material at the same time). However, you will receive full marks if you score >50% and attend that week's discussion section. The midterm grade distributions were a bit intense, simply by nature of the strong science background of the students enrolled in the class (BENG, MBB, MCDB, EEB). I came into the class after having studied for and taken the MCAT at the end of the summer, and I found much of the course material to be review for me. Therefore in reverse, I believe this course would be an absolutely fantastic choice for anyone planning to take the MCAT.",
    "Lots of work in terms of readings, but super interesting. Probably only to be taken if Pre-Med or BME major.",
    "A lot of people will warn you and say there is a lot of reading from the infamous textbook B&B. However, I will tell you right now that what is necessary to know for the examinations can be garnered from the slides, the internet and Costanza. I read every assigned reading at the beginning of the semester. I soon realized it was unsustainable and that reading lecture slides 99.999% good enough to answer the weekly quiz questions or prepare for the exams. Overall, the course is well taught with many specialized professors coming in to teach specific organ systems. The highlight of the semester was at the end when we were fortunate enough to see dissected cadavers in the anatomy lab. Word of warning: midterms are not bad at all (just usually don't have enough time), the final even though it seems like it is going to be focused a lot on the last third of the material was truly cumulative. There was stuff tested on there that we learned in September, so if you want to do well prepare.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Beware- Physio is a ton of work but you will learn so much!",
    "I would recommend MCDB 310",
    "The book is bigger than most babies, and you will read about 20-30 pages per class, on average. It will take up a lot of your time, but at the end you will look at the human body and realize you understand most of it.",
    "If you have ever wondered how your body works, take this class. It is a fascinating exploration of many of the body's organ systems. Make no mistake, this class is a mountain of material to learn, but at many points you may find yourself saying \"thank you\" to your body as you learn some of the truly amazing ways it works to keep you alive and functioning. If you aren't ready to work hard, skip this class.",
    "This is a great class. You learn a huge amount from very passionate lecturers. The format (weekly quizzes and 2 midterms) helps you not fall behind, which is of utmost importance in this course. A lot of people say this is a lot of work I did not find this to be the case, partly because I only did the reading if I was confused. You only have to know the material in the lectures the reading goes much more in depth than what is expected in the course and can sometimes leave you feeling more confused than enlightened.",
    "Yes! even though I am sure that this material will be covered in medical school, to get the chance to learn about physiology directly in a course was still very enlightening, and the material is presented well for the most part. Although the quantity of material can get overwhelming towards the end of the class, the workload is manageable enough.",
    "It was really interesting and because I like the subject a lot, it felt like it was worth it. I wish I had figured out how to study for the course earlier, though, and be prepared to be overwhelmed by information.",
    "Definitely one of the hardest classes you'll ever take. If you're not BME, maybe think about taking it Cr\/D because it is really interesting but the stress of learning every single detail for the exams isn't worth it. It's also curved to a B\/B+ and you're competing with the BME kids who have to take it, so maybe just say no.",
    "Yes, you learn so, so much. Take it if your pre med or at all fascinated by the human body. So interesting. A lot of work especially around exam time, but manageable and you gain ALOT.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's brutally hard, but will change your Yale experience if you are premed and at all on the fence. It's by far my favorite class I've taken at Yale, and the one I learned the most in. The class is curved to a B, so it's not super generous with grading, but it's well worth it. The TAs are great, the professors are passionate about what they are teaching (as each professor teaches about organ systems they are experts on), and it is very well organized. Study your ass off for exams though, because they are very difficult, and do not take this class with many other STEM classes with finals if possible, as you need lots of time to study for physio.",
    "Really great and interesting class. It's a lot of work and the exams are tough, but you'll come away having learned so much. Most of the class is full of premeds, so you'll most likely be learning the material in more depth later on, but it was a fantastic introduction that was helpful in knowing that medicine is the right field for me.",
    "This course is very work intensive, but well worth the time and effort. The professors and TA's really are passionate about their work and helping the students understand the material. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in biology, even as a credit\/d option.",
    "This class is the best class I have taken at Yale. I left almost every lecture amazed with what I had just learned, and I finished the course with a truly huge amount of knowledge, unlike other courses where you forget things after the exam. Yes, it is a challenging class and you cannot afford to get behind in it, but you will want to study for this class and you will want to sit down and read the textbook. If you have any interest in how the human body works, you absolutely must take this class.",
    "Take physiology! It's a supremely fascinating class, taught brilliantly by a great teaching staff. Make sure you go to lectures, because a lot is covered per lecture. There are weekly quizzes, which are open-book. Read Costanzo instead of B&B, but B&B is useful for the quizzes. There is a copy of B&B on Yale Orbis.",
    "This course is really interesting! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine. It covers a lot of material, so make sure you keep up with the reading and lectures.",
    "Obviously take it if it's required for your major\/premed. Very interesting material but a lot in quantity so only take if required or you're very committed to learning about human physio. Only class I've taken at Yale where section was useful. I looked forward to section every week and learned so much. Try to get Alex as a TA if you can. Make sure to study the material presented after the second midterm up to the final as you're learning it because it's hard to learn this material AND study for the final at the same time. Grade is basically only the two midterms and the final because if you take the weekly quiz and get more than a 50% and then go to section they bump you up to a 100%."
