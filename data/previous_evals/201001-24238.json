    "This is a course in independent research. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "This is the spring term course offering for biomedical engineering majors interested in doing research for credit; it corresponds to BENG 471 in the fall. For seniors, this is the class for the senior project.The senior project is a requirement, while research for credit before then is not. However, I would recommend it for students as a way to get lab exposure.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. Do a favor for yourself and make sure that you're in a good lab situation. In my experience this means the ability to work closely with a grad student (preferably on a topic that relates to his or her research). The advisor should serve as a mentor that guides the project, not a day-to-day person to ask for help. (I worked directly with my advisor on a project. It was rewarding in many ways but was also stressful and I would not recommend the experience to others.)",
    "It's required, but I wish I did more than one semester of research.",
    "For sure!! Try to get into Kyriakides Lab!! It is truly amazing..great dynamic, wide exposure to research techniques.",
    "recommended - get involved!",
    "yes its mandatory",
    "You have to take is so I reccommend it. It really depends what you want to get out of it.",
    "Senior Project class. Your enjoyment level, work level and experience is totally dependent on your PI and your project."
