He did a great job of explaining how lab processes worked and took the time to arrange visits to the isolab while we processed our specimens, which I appreciated and found very interesting. At times there seemed to be a lack of communication between the TAs and the professors overall.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Maynard \u00a0Dan was a wonderful TA! Super engaged, really helpful, and always willing to go out of his way to make sure we understood the material and had the assistance we needed to complete assignments. I'd say he was hands-down the best TA I've had for any of my courses this semester.",

    "- great to have 3 different experts for understanding ecosystems & landscapes in one class which lead to interesting discussions and exploring different topics with the the leading experts in the field. (instructors) - work load is a lot but worth it! (class general evaluation) - Sometimes topics were discussed rather fast (every topic in one single lecture) which was challenging if students don't have prior environmental science knowledge however, this leads to being able to cover a very broad and complete span of topics. (class general evaluation)",
    "Great course.",
    "15- very relevant to people interested in industrial ecology! Should be advertised that way since it is definitely valuable to people outside of ecology\/conservation fields.",
    "Response for 14\/15: This was my favorite course this semester. I gained a lot from taking it, particularly in terms of systems thinking and coming to terms with the complexities of a system. For the teaching fellow question: I did not have either of the teaching fellows in the drop down, but I had to choose one to submit the evaluation. My teaching fellow was Rub Buchkowski.",
    "I think that the professors individually were effective, and each had their strengths and weaknesses that complemented one another well. However, my biggest critique of the class was that it needed greater cohesion from the outset. There were many moving parts (lectures, problem sets, a textbook, articles, forum discussions, comments, lab work, field trip, group presentations, 3 professors and 3 TAs) and sometimes it felt a little chaotic. It was not always evident how the pieces built on one another or what the major takeaways should be. For a foundations class, I think the professors tended to overestimate the level of knowledge of the subject matter that the class came in with, and this was frustrating for many students. The class also seemed very frontloaded with the workload tapering off towards the end of the semester rather than being spread out more evenly. That being said, I'm really happy I took the course and I do feel like it all came together at the end (I just would have liked to have had a better idea of where we were headed from the beginning).",
    "I struggled at first in this course because I didn't have a background in ecology, but through perseverance and continually working on the assigmnents I was able to comprehend a lot more. I appreciated how this course was designed in terms of assignments and lectures. The professors clearly wanted us to have fun while learning - I am very happy I took this course.",
    "Question 15: I think that the course provide important understanding of ecological concepts and also provoke traditional ways of thinking about ecosystem concepts. The field component also helped us understand the challenges in evidence-based science and understanding the limitations."

    "- very diverse which I appreciated a lot: fieldtrips, lab experience, class work, exercises, final project - I learned a lot and enjoyed the course a lot! - very good course to understand the system approach and think beyond the traditional thinking on all levels. - cutting edge topics which we were able to explore together - high quality course - critical thinking is demanded for topics that seem familiar to us (what is sustainability, how does the human fit in an ecosystem, etc. ) - this is very challenging and very enriching!",
    "I really appreciated the style of these three professors working together. I liked that it was hands-on, involving lab work and field time. We delved deeply into the topics from the readings and the professors challenged me to think critically about the material.",
    "The complementary nature of the field\/labs, lectures and readings. They reinforced each other. It also reinforced what I was learning in the physical sciences foundation, which was so helpful!",
    "Doing the field research was a big benefit as I have never done that sort of natural science research before. I liked the in class student discussions.",
    "It was a very interdisciplinary course.",
    "The lab\/field section was great. Also, my group for Marsh was stellar - all working together efficiently.",
    "Field trips are a valuable portion of this course, especially for students who will go on to NOT be researchers. Having this first hand experience will provide a basic background and understanding of the field techniques that go into create the science used in making management decisions. The in class student \"forums\" were excellent. I would encourage more of this in the future, perhaps with a bit more guidance from the instructors. Being able to debate and discuss ideas helps to guide students toward natural intellectual epiphany on previously unfamiliar topics.",
    "The last third of the class provided a wonderful synthesis of the class material and raised ethical and moral questions related to it. Wish there were more of these types of discussions in other classes.",
    "The field visits and subsequent lab work enabled us to collect our own data, analyze it and gain a deeper understanding of ecosystem processes. We also learned to question existing ecosystem models that exclude humans, and think about managing complex adaptive systems. The professors care deeply about what they do and they communicate that effectively to us. I enjoyed the debates we had in class and the exchanges we had with our professors. This class was well-thought out and balanced independent work with group work very well. It gave us an experience of crafting a land management plan as a team.",

    "- suggest basic preparation material for people without background in environmental science for the class.",
    "The work load could be dispersed more evenly. It might be useful to have smaller groups for group projects and field work- putting together a cohesive presentation and paper with 10+ paper is pretty difficult. Mark moves a bit too quickly, and talks a bit too fast, when presenting new material in lectures.",

    "More marsh trips!",
    "For lab\/ field trip work, more of an organized introduction to how the particular ecosystems function would have been very beneficial. Our professors and teaching fellows likely have a wealth of knowledge about each ecosystem, and I feel like I missed out on that in the course.",
    "I though the course was generally well run.",
    "I think a stronger correlation of field and lab experiments to concepts learned in the class. I was not always aware of the connection between the two components of the class.",

    "I think there could have been more overlap between the lecture and lab. I felt at times that they were almost 2 separate classes. One way would be to have the TAs more involved in both the lectures and the lab. We were told that the TAs were hired only to help with the lab section and not the course material and problem sets, which made the course feel disjointed. It would have been very helpful to have the TAs do review sessions for the problem sets.",

    "Disadvantage: My group was too big (10 people) so coordinating was hard. This meant that we didn't have to do everything, which was good, but we didn't learn as much as we could. Advantages: Had to do less work, so could focus on it. We never could have done the management plan on our own. You could learn from other people in your group.",

It also becomes easy for people to free-ride and for others to dominate assignments, perhaps infringing on the learning objectives of others in the process. That said, our group work very well together and I think that we were all proud of our final product and improved understanding of the ecosystems we studied.",
    "Due to field trips in other courses, some team members did more work than other team members. We tried to even it out during the analysis portion of the lab work, but this was difficult since team members that were most often present best understood the data to be analyzed.",

Again, revising actively the material throughout the semester helps to understand the concepts and get familiar with new them.",
    "Take it! Prepare for a few EARLY morning field trips, but they're fun and they taper off as the semester goes on.",
    "Take it! It puts all the pieces together.",
    "Do the readings, they really help back up the professors and give good examples and tie everything together. You get as much out of this course as you put in, so make the effort.",
    "A lot of group activities may be fun but tricky in terms of allocating your time",
    "Take it!",
    "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!. Do the readings, engage in the classroom, and dive-in to the field trips. (Plus, all the coffee you can drink on Friday mornings...what's not to like. )",
    "While the readings aren't necessary to succeed in the course, they provide a much deeper understanding of the course material.",
    "Take it. It is a great learning experience.",
    "This course is a lot of work but very worthwhile. I found it very informative and I think I will carry what I learned from it into my future career.",
    "Take it and be patient. The work you put in will payoff in spades towards the end of the semester.",
    "This is a great course to take for its exposure and the opportunity to work at the field.",
    "Participate in all field trips."
