   "comments": [
    "Take this kind of course if you're prepared to put in a solid 6-8 hours every week working on difficult, but interesting, Sanskrit. Do not expect this to be a course you can blow off or do the work for at the last minute: you get as much from this course as you put into it.",
    "The course explores the discourse of power as represented in inscriptions, but also as in Sanskrit literature more broadly. There is a helpful emphasis on reviewing first-year grammar which is easy to forget. I'd recommend it to everyone.",
    "Sanskrit 550 01 provided the rare opportunity to study inscriptions with a professor who not only had a rich knowledge of the materials but also had the teaching experience to guide students through challenging Sanskrit texts. This course also included study of a literary text that perfectly complimented the epigraphy explored throughout the semester. Any student with at least two years of Sanskrit training will greatly benefit from studying these materials with Professor Wentworth."

   "comments": [
    "The course allowed me to think more critically about representations of royalty and power in the Indic world. This discourse bleeds into so much of what we work with, even outside the somewhat narrow realm of inscriptions. Understanding this discourse will help me explore other issues in the field of religious studies.",
    "This course not only developed my ability to read and translate Sanskrit texts, but it also exposed me to a close study of the political articulations of first-millennium South Asia. Thus it was incredibly helpful for me in my Sanskrit training as well as in my broader understanding of South Asian political visions. Both of these efforts have prepared me well to approach my own research projects involving Sanskrit and\/or questions of the language of power in South Asia."
