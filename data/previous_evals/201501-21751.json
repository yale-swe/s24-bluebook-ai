    "Junior Seminar was a fantastic course that gives you the opportunity to read critical works in cognitive science and discuss them with your peers. Every week there is a different theme, often focusing on connecting two unrelated topics within cognitive science (e.g., consciousness and artificial intelligence, music and emotion, evolution and misbelief). The papers are challenging and take quite a bit of time every week to read and understand, but I definitely feel like I left this class better equipped to dig into difficult papers. Workload consists of weekly reading responses, leading discussion, and a final paper that can serve as a launching point for your senior thesis.",
    "The Junior Seminar asks its students to complete around 50 pages of reading per week, write a short reading response, and submit a final paper on a topic of choice. The topics covered are very broad, interesting, and fundamentally interdisciplinary. This is the perfect course to consolidate and integrate one's CogSci education. Consider the discussion around a table where a debate about consciousness, language and mind, or modularity is entirely inclusive of philosophers, linguists, computer scientists, and psychologists alike.",
    "Although CGSC390 is technically optional, you should take it if it fits in your schedule. It counts for the Cog Sci depth requirement (unreal if, like me, your depth requirement suggestions have been continually shot down by Knobe), and gives you an unparalleled appreciation for Yale's department and the other Cog Sci majors. Grading is fair\/easy, work is very manageable as long as you set aside enough time to do the readings, and discussion is actually fun\/self-guided for the most part. The seminar might look long, but the time really flies. I'd take it again if I could.",
    "The Cognitive Science Junior Seminar is a valuable in-depth introduction to the field of Cognitive Science, tailored toward those with the basic understanding of the field that a junior class has. I thought the class really built on topics I've encountered in intro Cognitive Science as welll as my more in depth courses, and encouraged us to challenge ideas within the field that I didn't even know were up for being challenged. It's a class that really seems to depend on the professor though. With Kate, it was great.",
    "if you are a cog sci major, you really REALLY should take this course. It's interesting and a lot of fun",
    "An awesome class. As a cognitive science major this is a must-do, as it gives a fairly in-depth overview of the main questions in cognitive science. Work-wise, there are weekly reading responses and a final paper.",
    "This class is a great way to talk more about cog sci with people who have some understanding of cog sci topics. I felt like I really reaffirmed my interest in the field as a whole by taking this class, when it is easy to get bogged down in whatever your focus is.",
    "This class is great for exploring a wide range of topics and ideas related to cognitive science, and of their connections with each other. Kate is awesome, she's fun and makes class interesting, and encourages discussion in a way that allows it to develop naturally with the classes thoughts and interests while still managing to hit all the points she wants to highlight. The workload is very manageable, and the topics are (for the most part) both interesting and relevant."
