   "comments": [
    "A fantastic class. If city politics is your interest, it is a must-take. Professor Horan is certainly demanding - you have to do the reading and engage in the class - but it is well worth it if it is your interest.",
    "If you are interested in city politics, yes!",
    "This was a great course. Professor Horan is an amazing seminar leader and a wonderful person, and the topics and readings are fascinating. The discussions were some of the most stimulating of a class I've taken at Yale.",
    "A series of case studies illustrating trends in urban politics through the lens of New York, LA and Chicago. Go for it.",
    "Good class with engaging discussions. Professor Horan knows a lot about urban politics and expects a lot from students. 2 page reading responses per week got to be a bit difficult but the readings are interesting for the most part. Some of the articles were a bit repetitive and made obvious\/circular arguments. Instead of analyzing and critiquing the points made in scholarly work, the class was more about putting the material in context and judging arguments on the basis of empirical evidence in the real world.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you have a strong interest in urban politics. It's not the most accessible for any political science major looking for a seminar, but if this is your shtick it's really interesting and gets into a lot of issues of class, race, and space that are great to explore."
