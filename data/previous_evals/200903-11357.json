    "Yes. SOCY is a relatively small major, so you can really bond with the other people in the colloquium and they provide very helpful feedback for your own work.",
    "One of the reasons its fun to be a Sociology major. We had a meal with Sociology majors every other weak and talked about our projects. Do the year-long. Also, respect deadlines. I always appreciate the department's flexibility, but make sure you're being honest with yourself and getting work done."
