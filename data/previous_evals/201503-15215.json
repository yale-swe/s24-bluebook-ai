   "comments": [
    "Solid continuation of high school (IB SL) french classes. F130 is straightforward - you read several books (and then do one movie) and each work is associated with a set amount of exercises in a course packet that you do alongside reading. Books are pretty good - L'tranger is a highlight. The class can get pretty dull but your French does improve a lot even if you don't necessarily put a ton of effort in. Tests are pretty simple and studying was very straightforward - the vocab, oral exercises, etc. are ripped straight from the course packet.",
    "It is good in learning and reviewing material. I would recommend it for further french study.",
    "Would recommend! If you liked French in Action for L1 and L2, you'll love L3 as it was also designed by Capretz (le dieu!). One of the highlights is reading the stranger by Camus in its original form. Worth taking the course just for that. Also, I think the MMPs (an instructional video series that accompanies a movie you watch at the end of the course) are well done and really help one get the most out of the movie. Workload: nightly and time consumptive, but easy and as such a nice break for when real class work made my head hurt.",
    "I would summarize the class as getting more in depth into French grammar while also beginning to explore French literature and film. I would recommend the class. The books and films were interesting and I felt like the class really improved my speaking and listening.",
    "I would certainly recommend Fren 130 08 to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a continuation of french grammar learning and an introduction to french novels. We read three books and analyzed them as well as two films, in addition to grammar points that were both reviewed and taught. This course truly improved my french, and allowed me to especially ameliorate my speaking, since you are always expected to speak in class and take part in discussions.",
    "FREN 130 08 is perfect for students with an intermediate level knowledge of French who are looking to improve their basic French skills in order to become more conversant. It is essential for anyone looking to improve their French skills.",
