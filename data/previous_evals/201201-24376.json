    "This class provides some great insight into the British Empire and how it contributed to modernity. Professor Vaughn provides a great seminar environment and is very helpful when it comes to writing the research paper. If I could, I would take this class again.",
    "Fantastic!!! My favorite class I've taken at Yale. Vaughn was my best teacher at Yale. Classes sometimes ran over, but I would never notice. Vaughn's insights are fascinating and he presents very salient interpretations of history. He will give you updates on how you're doing with your paper as well as helpful feedback every step of the way. In his comments on my rough draft were extremely impressive, as he had really invested in my paper. Vaughn cares about every student and has the skills to really help them. I'm incredibly grateful. This class is highly recommended.",
    "This course is tremendous. Vaughn is one of the best young professors that I've encountered - articulate, incredibly knowledgeable, and always approachable. Workload is heavy but worthwhile. Very strongly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are extremely interested in theories of modernity and the British Empire. However, Prof. Vaughn can be extremely disorganized, which means you won't get as much out of this class as you might out of a class on the same topic with a different professor. However, Prof. Vaughn is very helpful on the 20-25 final paper, and if you're interested in your research topic, you can get a lot of out of that process."
