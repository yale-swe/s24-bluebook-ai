    "Roots of Modernity was something like a DS for the modern period, 1870 to 1915. What this means is that you will get a lot of reading on highly varied topics. It was not uncommon to read a novel one week, a sociological essay the next, a treatise on linguistics the following, and then a series of poems. It was definitely a challenge to readjust to new and different authors and genres almost every class, even if the readings were organized by topic. I do not say this as a complaint, but as insight into what modernity is like. You certainly begin to see how the common ideas and themes are found in different disciplines, and they ultimately become inseparable. The class was admittedly a little bit anti-climactic, because there was no central unity in terms of ideas and authors. It did in fact seem like each lecture could stand on its own as an independent lecture on that topic, rather than as part of a unified whole of a semester's worth of class. Again, I don't say this as a complaint; I think that is the nature of trying to study a time period like this. There was a little bit less of a narrative or continuity than in something like Directed Studies. Nevertheless, modern history is a tangled mess, and that is one of the consequences of attempting to study it. If you are up for an honest look at a wide range of texts and ideas of modernity, then take this. The readings were always from good to excellent, and although the lectures sometimes fell flat, there is certainly a lot to harvest here for the sincere and curious student.",
    "A broad survey lecture on Modernity. The reading is a bit intense, but it's EXCELLENT. Beware of two things: 1. WHC 208 is NOT an appropriate place to conduct a class. Poorly lit and no desks for writing on. 2. if you're like me and struggle to make it to a 9AM class, you might want to reconsider. Professor Bloch gets very grumpy about tardiness and passes around an attendance sheet and generally just scowls at you if you walk in late.",
    "Well... it was a great reading list and not a lot of work. I was a little disappointed, I'm notgoing to lie. Perhaps it will be better next time it is offered (if it is, which I'm not sure will happen),",
    "No, absolutely not. I did not learn much and there were high expectations of the students but the professors did not do a good job of teaching it",
    "No, this class really needs to edit its reading list, either read fewer works or less of them. It also should be a seminar, as was originally intended, or at least have an organized participation medium. Without these changes, it would be difficult to get much from this class besides a lot of reading.",
    "This course was terrible. Don't be deceived by the reading list--the reading is difficult and the teachers do not explain it or fit it into the theme of the course. Even for me, as a humanities major, it was the worst course I've taken at Yale. Professor Campe simply cannot teach. If Professor Bloch is teaching it alone, and makes the course fit together better as a whole, then it might be worth taking.It was taught as a lecture course, each professor teaching in his own field (Campe German and Bloch French), and none of the material ever connected or was used to to illustrate larger themes of modernity. Moreover, the class was so fast-paced that we couldn't even get a good sense of each text individually. Even though they were great works that I've always wanted to read, I left even more confused about these texts and why they are important.",
    "Yes! There is a lot of reading, but even if you only read those who call out to you, it will deepen your knowledge so much",
    "Incoherent and banal.",
    "Roots of Modernity goes extremely fast and hardly does any of the texts justice. It is like DS, but without the structure of chronology. I have to say I liked it, overall, because many of the texts are important ones for an educated person to have been read in their lifetime.Great course overall, also not that much work. Beware of Howard Bloch's teaching methods though: He has an attendance sheet and when people start missing lectures (They are at 9am in WHC, for Christ's sakes!!), he sends out guilt-trip e-mails. He also interrupts his lecture to call you out in front of the class when you are five minutes late. So all in all, not a pleasant feel in that class.Don't let that fool you about Campe though: His long-winded and complicated sentences and pronunciation may make it a bit tough to follow him, but the points he makes are pure genius.",
    "Literature, in its first conception, is a class with a great syllabus but a not so great lecture. I truly did learn through the reading, and the writing process for papers, but I wish the class had been a seminar.",
    "The syllabus seems great, but unless it is significantly reworked as a lecture or offered as a seminar, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless it undergoes a few fundamental changes, most notably:1. Seminar discussion, not lecture2. Much less reading",
    "If they keep this class a lecture, don't take it. The works we read (which are all AMAZING, and some I never would have discovered on my own) NEED a section in which to discuss them. We were cheated. The problem with this lecture format is also that you don't have to do the reading, which is really a pity. I enjoyed both papers - I followed the interdisciplinary approach to combining art, music, literature, and philosophy that we took in class and found them to be both different from anything else I'd ever written and also very enlightening. Bloch is great, Campe is usually great... but you'll have to make the effort to talk to them on your own. It's worth it, though.",
    "Overall I found the class a bit brutal (9 am with registration), which is a pity as the topic is such a draw. If you're an early morning person, with the time to devote to the reading, then it might be worth it.",
    "It is an overview of modern literature-- specifically French and German modern literature. I would recommend it because the lectures are very interesting and the material is great.",
    "It was a good experiment. Unless they make the syllabus more manageable, don't be lured in by the great texts. Find another course offered by Bloch or Campe, because they're great, but the reading list is just unsustainable.",
    "Take a look at the syllabus. It's phenomenal. If that reading list peaks your interest, then you shouldn't hesitate to take this class. I'm a night-owl, and the class was offered only at 9am. Waking up early was tough, but this class made it worth it.The professors are great. Their lectures really illuminate the texts, and the optional section was a great arena for further discussion. The professors have a fantastic dynamic, and they really make themselves available to meet with students.There's a ton of reading (but more for Tuesdays than Thursdays), two papers which are long but notintimidating, no final, and an optional section. Take this class. I'm a better person for it.",
    "DO NOT take this class. The professors seem to believe that intellectual history means a wiki bio of the author, and then covering some v. general themes. I don't think I learned anything at all.",
    "worst course I've taken at yale. No more needs to be said.",
    "This course really gets you reading every text essential in modernity. Sadly, lectures are wikipedia format (though it should be a seminar).",
    "The reading list is excellent but do not take this class unless they offer it in seminar form. Even then, be wary. Find a different modernism class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! But, beware of the abyss you will likely enter for a little while."
