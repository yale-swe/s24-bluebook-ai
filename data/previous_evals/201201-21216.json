    "Excellent reading list, terrible class. Very poorly organized. Discussions were unfocused, and we were consistently weeks behind in the syllabus.",
    "This class is fundamentally a book club. Take it if you feel that the folks in it are going to be intellectual and bring out interesting things in the books when discussing them in class. We had a pretty good time and managed to cover most of the books, in addition to learning a lot about the history of various publications.",
    "the pros: it's not a lot of work, half an hour of every class is dedicated to listening to a student present a paper, and the reading list is great.the cons: i did not come out of this class feeling like i learned any substantial amount of material, or that i have a cohesive set of information about political journalism or its history.every class devolved into a random discussion, and professor stoehr expected us to know way more about styles of journalism coming into the class, even though there were no prerequisites.it could be a better class in the future - since this was the first year it was taught - but based on this year, i wouldn't recommend this class if you're looking to learn about political journalism.",
    "I would not. I dreaded coming to this course, but I'm sure a lot of my distaste for the course came from the class dynamic so perhaps with a different group it would be better. I just felt that class discussions either went in a circle or they beat a dead horse.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is even mildly interested in media and journalism, or politics in generally. The readings are long but present great topics for discussion and debate.",
    "I wouldn't. Just read the books on your own time. If you do wanna take it, definitely take it as a fifth class.",
    "It depends. If you're very interested in political journalism, take it - the readings are worthwhile, and you'll get a lot out of them. There wasn't as much feedback from the professor as in my view there should have been.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with several caveats. The reading list is great, and in general, the discussions were interesting and fruitful. However, this course seemed less of a seminar and more of a glorified reading group. And if you are looking for feedback on work, Professor Stoehr is not exceptionally forthcoming--despite minimal written assignments, the feedback he provided us was extremely brief, delayed, and for many students, non-existent. This being said, I always looked forward to coming to class, and not only was I exposed to important journalism from the 20th century that everyone should be aware of, but I also gained insights into the purpose and nature of the craft of journalism itself."
