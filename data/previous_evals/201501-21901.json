    "Take this class with Professor Horner to get a great introduction to game theory and the mathematics that goes on behind it. The course material was fascinating and well-organized, with the first quarter of the course on what a Nash equilibrium was, the next quarter on refinements and the second half of the class on applications. The pace of the class was punishing though, but what helped was that Professor Horner was really clear in his explanations, and that he uploaded his lecture notes prior to each class. Problem sets in this class are unlike problem sets in other economics classes, and they take upward of 10 hours each time. Professor Horner's teaching philosophy is that a student only learns his true potential when he is taken to a point beyond that -- and the problem sets are designed to do so. Most of the problems are extensions of course materials, and require that a student firmly grasp the course material first before using some creativity to solve the problems.",
    "Brilliant, challenging course",
    "First off, this is a very hard class. (It's probably up there with Math 230 and the like.) Psets are quite long and difficult, and lectures can be a whirlwind. If you're a Math & Econ major, you know why you're here. If you're not, think twice before signing up. With that said, it's a good class. Hrner (and don't forget the umlaut) is a solid lecturer and the material is very interesting (and there's a lot of it). Unfortunately, game theory gets very messy very quickly, even with relatively simple examples. If you're a mathematical purist who likes working with the cleanest, barest problems, you might find a lot of the work tedious and even ugly. But that's the nature of game theory, and it's a very useful subject--so if you're thinking of going into economics, better buckle up!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the rigorous study of economics and game theory (there are many less rigorous ways to do it). (This is spoken as a non-econ major) Definitely a challenge; reputed as the \"toughest (undergraduate) economics course\" for a reason. That said, Horner is a fantastic teacher with a sharp sense of humor. Lectures are well-organized and the notes are very well-written. If you're serious about economics or economics grad school, this is the course for you.",
    "ECON 351 is probably the most serious introduction to game theory that one can take as an undergraduate. Period. Because of this class, I went from knowing basically nothing about the subject to being in a position in which I would want to take a graduate-level course to further my knowledge. Professor Hrner is a genius, a mathematician at heart, and a masterful lecturer who sincerely cares about his students. As a student who likes his math, Ive found this to be my favorite econ course at Yale. I would most certainly recommend this course for those who really want to learn the subject. But be warned: problem sets are challenging, and the exams are not for the feint of heart.",
    "This is a very very hard course. If you're not in the major and taking it for fun, beware.",
    "This is one of the more difficult courses that I have taken at Yale so far. The workload is fairly heavy, as the weekly problem sets for this course take a long time to work through. The lectures are very clear, however the material is presented at a very fast pace, so you will need to review the material in order to figure out what happened in class sometimes. Both Professor Horner and the teaching fellow were excellent in addressing any questions that we might have had. Overall, it was an excellent course.",
    "Take it if you expect a good challenge. It seems the professor looks favorably on students who don't take it for their major."
