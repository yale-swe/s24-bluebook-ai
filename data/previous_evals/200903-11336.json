    "Fast-moving introductory language course. It will be easier for you if you already know a Romance language.",
    "-I would recommend L1\/L2 if you have learned another Romance language before just so that you are familiar with the grammar conceptually. You must be very self-motivated and willing to put in the time for this class. You must be willing to make every 8:30 AM class.-Spanish 125 is fantastic because it feels like a pseudo-immersion program and by the end, you are on par with students who have taken many years of Spanish in high school.",
    "If Professor Cifuentes is teaching this course, take it. I couldn't recommend it more highly. Although the nightly courseload is hard, and it's early in the morning, you'll get so much out of this. It occupies a much more important part of your mind than I feel like regular spanish would have, and the intensity of the workonly breeds solidarity among the students.",
    "THIS CLASS IS THE BOMBBBB!!!!! PROF. CIFUENTES WAS BY THE FAR THE BEST LANGUAGE TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD OR THAT I CAN REASONABLE EXPECT TO EVER HAVE. SHE IS PHENOMENAL, AND CREATES A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT UNLIKE ANY I HAVE SEEN.i thought it was gonna be horrible, the fact that it started at 8:30, all the work. turns out this was the best foreign language related decision i've ever made. not that hard, and what's more: the kids want to be there! we had the most fun class ever!!! everyone got to know each other really well, we had these momentous arguments in spanish, we had a pizza party at the end of the semester. this class rocks, period.listen, i went to the other spanish classes. the kids were already falling asleep on the first day. you wanna learn spanish, do it here.closest you get to an immersion environment this side of the rio grande.(hmm... that's not really true)do your flashcards on the treadmill. total multi-tasking.a friend of mine told me to take the intensive instead of the regular. so grateful.i'm convinced this was less work, more fun, and more educational than doing it in two semesters. by far.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to complete two hours of homework nightly and attend two hours of class daily.",
    "This class is a speedy introduction to Spanish - I would recommend it to a student that is willing to take the work seriously.",
    "A really great way to be immersed in Spanish and learn all the basics. I would absolutely recommend it to another student who is committed to the task of learning Spanish quickly.",
    "I would recommend it if you are willing to put in all the time. If you devote yourself to the class and if the other students in the class are enthusiastic then it is worth it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if your objective is to learn Spanish quickly and thoroughly. This class is quite a bit of work. You learn up to three or four sets of vocab a week, about a new verb tense a week, and have quizzes\/tests\/compositions usually once every two weeks. That said, if you go into the class aware of the work required, then its not too bad. Getting up early for this class (ours was at 8:30am) also was not as big a problem as I anticipated because you have to do this everyday of the week and get used to it pretty quickly. I did around 2-3 hours of homework a night.The hardest part of the class was in the middle of the semester, when we had two or three things due (compositions, quizzes, exams) every week. But the good thing is that none of my other classes had midterms or projects dueduring this time, so it was easy to balance. In addition, near the end of the semester, you do oral presentations which means if you finish yours early, you don't have homework for about two weeks during everyone else's presentation. This was extremely helpful, as most other classes have projects due during this time.You also get pretty close to your classmates. I have never laughed in a classroom as much as in this one. Because it is intensive, everyone here wants to learn Spanish for its own sake, and that brings a level of maturity and motivation that can be lacking in the other nonintensive intro Spanish. We had some actual conversations, and debates got heated. This was marvelous, as engaging discussion is often absent from intro language classes."
