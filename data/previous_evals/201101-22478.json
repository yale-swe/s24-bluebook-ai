   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of reading, but it's almost all extremely interesting. The reading responses can be a bit of work, but I learned so much from doing them, and really improved my writing skills. This course is fascinating and (if you take it seriously) will make you a better student regardless of your major. Take it! I'm a Music major and this is still one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. It was a lot of work but the material is interesting enough that you don't really mind doing it. The class explored both the scientific and social effects of the diseases which gave them better grounding, in my opinion.",
    "Wonderful course, basically as described. Covers almost every major epidemic which impacts the Western developed world, with historical and cultural context. If you are a HSHM student, this should be a must-take, and Professor Snowden makes it a truly interesting course. If you are nota HSHM student, it will take you a bit to adjust to the style of reading\/reading responses, but the course is worth it.",
    "A history of plagues in Western Europe that really walks you through how each of these diseases is unique and how they affected society in fascinating ways. A really interesting, quirky class that does have some really serious core issues it isn't afraid to explore. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone even remote interested in plagues!",
    "I would definitely take this class. The lectures are great, and the books are pretty good. The reading responses don't take that long and are good preparation for the final. It's a fair amount of work because it's a book a week, but it's totally worth it. He's on the online courses for Yale because he's so good. Take this class!",
    "Definitely take it. If you're not sure, take it Credit\/d... but it's one of those classes you have to take before you graduate. If you're more of a science person than a humanities person, it's the perfect class for you. It will add a different kind of depth to your medical knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a significant amount of reading, but you can definitely get by with skimming most of them.",
    "The comprehensiveness of this course makes it useful to a wide variety of students. The science and premed students get their dose of physiological effects of disease, psychology majors can analyze the emotional and behavioral responses to disease, history majors get an analysis of the historical importance of disease in the timeline of humanity, and all other majors get a comprehensive course that whose topics provide insight into the methods modern society uses to deal with outbreaks of disease. You read one book per week, which can be a challenge--but most of the books are good enough that you can read them as a \"break\" from other homework. There are weekly 500 word reading responses, which can become a pain if your TA treats them like tiny research papers, but they can also be fun because the questions are really elemental. The midterm was a take home, closed book\/notes, timed essayand the final had IDs and essays.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it. Morbid but enjoyable.",
    "I would say the course was good but not great. Very much an overview of all the diseases and themes were quite repetitive. I wouldn't want to take it again and am ambivalent about whether or not to recommend it. There's tons of reading and because of the scrutiny of my TA, I felt like I had to read it all. Grading was tough.Professor Snowden and my TA, Con, made the course though. If you take the course, make an effort to get to know these amazing people.",
    "This is a great class -- unlike a lot of other professors at Yale, Snowden is a very good lecturer who does not simply read off the slides. That said, it is also difficult to skip a lecture unless you have a friend in the class, since you can't just rely on slides to know the material.Interesting material, fair grading (work load is mostly manageable, although reading a book a week can be tough). (take home midterm, 7 page paper on an outside book, final)",
    "It is a great overview of some of the most important Epidemics in Western History, and is also a great new perspective on this period of history. It is actually more thorough than most survey courses, and really feels more like an in depth study of the influence and importance of Epidemics. It's a wonderful class, something I would recommend to any student of History at Yale! It offers such a great new perspective on a lot of the history that I've already learned. Amazing!!",
    "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful--best class I've taken at Yale. TAKE THIS CLASS. You will look forward to the lectures and reading every week, I promise!",
    "I enjoyed the readings from this class, although I found that I learned more from researching and writing the final paper. The final paper assignment is very broad and allows for one to explore virtually any aspect of any epidemic disease.",
    "It's an interesting topic and Professor Snowden knows a LOT about it. Lectures are well organized but sometimes a bit dry. I also found the second half of the course to be a bit repetitive--after a while all of the diseases kind of blend together and the readings sound the same.",
    "This class is really good in connecting medicine with society. It explains history from the lens of medicine and it is really worthwhile.",
    "I was looking for an easy humanities class, but this was not it. Try looking for other classes if you want an easy class.",
    "The material is interesting, but there is a lot of reading.",
    "I enjoyed Epidemics and Society very much - the lectures are great, the material interesting, and most of the reading fun. For anyone interested in the last few centuries of European and American history, or in the ways technology and medicine have influenced and been influenced by it, I recommend the course strongly. It truly requires no background knowledge, which can be frustrating but also nice.",
    "Yes. For someone who has any interest at all in learning more about how epidemic diseases have shaped medicine and modern culture, take this class.",
    "Take the class! Snowden is a great professor and makes everything interesting (although I took it just because I think epidemics are cool, so may be biased). You basically have to read a book a week, but they're almost all worth reading anyway -- and you won't hear about them any other way.",
    "This course covers a wide range of diseases, from the Black Plague to SARS and AIDS. It doesn't only discuss the diseases, however, but how they affected the community and the public health measures taken to combat them. There is a bit of a heavy workload (a book and a reading response due every week), but if you are able to handle it, it is worth it.",
    "A great class for people interested in the historical side of how epidemics affected society.",
    "This course reviews a number of epidemics throughout modern Western history, starting from the bubonic plague in the 17th century and continuing through modern epidemics such as AIDS and near-epidemics like SARS. Throughout the course, Professor Snowden will emphasize the effects of epidemics on political, economic, social, and cultural changes in the Western world. Ifyou decide to take this course, be ready for a lot of reading. There is one book to read each week, and many of the books go slowly, especially if you are not used to the writing styles of history scholars. Since there are reading responses each week and both the midterm and the final draw from the readings, you can\u0092t skip them without significantly consequences. There\u0092s also one paper which is relatively short, but can still take a long time to write since it involves close reading of an additional book. However, Professor Snowden is an excellent instructor who clearly enjoys teaching undergraduates. Therefore, whether you come from a background of science or the humanities, this course will broaden your view of the role of diseases in society. Especially in Italy. Professor Snowden really likes Italy."
