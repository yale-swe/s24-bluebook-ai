   "comments": [
    "An amazing and thorough study in international queer theory and politics. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in LGBTQ+ activism this class gives an amazing foundation in both the theoretical history of sexuality and colonialism, and also the practical study of activist history and administration. Prof Reid himself has extensive career experience as a high-profile activist, and brought in guest speakers, and even took us on a trip to the U.N. headquarters in New York to watch a panel discussion on International Human Rights Day. Definitely a must take; it's honestly worth the gruelling two-hour seminar slot at 9am. Plan the rest of your semester around this to make it bearable; you won't regret it.",
    "This class teaches you to question the everyday terms and gender we have in the US for gender and sexuality to see that these terms do not apply simply on a transnational level. It gives you a more nuanced understanding of homosexuality and western influences on transnational homosexual identities.",
    "THIS CLASS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. I found lots of the readings applied to other types of discrimination as well as homophobia, and our discussions about intersectionality towards the end of the class were particularly valuable. It has a real international focus, and professor Reid is fantastic. I hadn't realised he is the Director of the LGBT division of Human Rights Watch, until probably the third class! We are so lucky that he took the time to teach us every week. We even ended up getting to go to the UN on Human Rights Day. (Thank you Professor Reid!)",
    "Wonderful course for gaining the transnational perspective that is lacking in other classes. The readings were usually compelling and stimulating (though they sometimes blurred together from week to week), and the class atmosphere was easy-going and conducive to discussion. This course is great for majors and non-majors alike."
