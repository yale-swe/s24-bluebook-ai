    "Designing a software solution.",
    "I learned the lifecycle of planning then writing specification documents and grant proposals about medical software.",
    "Designing a product.",
    "I learned how to write the systems requirement document, software specifications, validation plans, and other formal documents of the medical software design process while working on a real-life problem.",
    "more information about how to develop medical software and how difficult and long of a process it is",
    "learned about software design, planning, validation, and presenting of designs. not too much implementation or building of product because it was only a semester long, but the class makes you think a lot about important concepts in software design.",
    "I definitely gained a better sense of the software design workflow for a medical device\/application. Lots of writing documents that you'd need to write if you were a company trying to make medical devices.",
    "I learned about the medical software design process, from writing the proposal to validation to software\/system specifications. I learned how to design software to solve a specific medical need, an area that I became familiar with throughout the semester.",
    "Learned a lot about developing a software and the long process necessary to meet FDA requirements"

   "comments": [
    "Hands-on group work was enagaging.",
    "Professor XP is an effective lecturer who strove to promote collaboration through group papers and presentations. The medical software groups were also a nice way of helping us gain experience speaking to healthcare professionals albeit the process sometimes took more time and detail than needed.",
    "More time working on the project, less time spent on the documents.",
    "I like the feedback we receive to improve our work.",
    "I understand that the focus is on document writing and not necessarily coding, but I wouldve enjoyed more time spent on building the project. Also, at the end of the semester, putting together the proposal felt really rushed - although we had the material we needed throughout the semester, reorganizing them into the proposal didnt reallt walk us through how to write a proper SBIR proposal.",
    "Strengths - freedom to navigate your topic how you like, freedom to program in whatever language you prefer Weaknesses - there are a couple technical documents your group has to write before you even work on your software, leaving not much time to develop the software",
    "it was a very education class, and was not too stressful. it could be improved it we could start working on projects earlier!",
    "The first half of the course was writing documents; the second half was working on the individual projects via coding etc. I think it would've been possible to get through the first half a lot faster and get started on coding earlier because it felt like there wasn't as much time doing that.",
    "There could be more of a push to start writing software earlier in the semester, or a balance of writing software and writing plans.",
    "This class was really good. XP was a great teacher and really flexible. Mentors were dedicated. Definitely take this class if you can get in. Its a science credit that is actually relevant and useful if you are in CS or something like it."

    "Great SC credit for CS majors.",
    "Yes, because it is low-stress and engaging.",
    "Yes, this is a light yet insightful science credit for CS majors.",
    "Only if you REALLY want to take an easy project-based class",
    "Great course!",
    "Yes I would recommend - if you want a course with more freedom and that isn't so structured like most courses, this is the one",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a BME credit that's related to tech and entrepreneurship, and you want a chill credit.",
    "This is a really chill, interesting elective course. I'd recommend it if you're curious about how software design works, i.e. the workflow of the entire process and all the requisite documentation. I wouldn't recommend it if you're interested in seriously developing medical software, as while this is the focus of the second half of the course, there isn't very much time to actually do software development. I.e. if you want a class that teaches you and tests you on making applications, this isn't the class for you (it isn't rigorous enough tbh).",
    "Yes, if you're interested in building an application to solving a medical need.",
    "Yes! XP is awesome, the material is relevant\/useful, and the workload is manageable."
