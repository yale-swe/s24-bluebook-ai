    "This was a short one-day workshop at the Yale-Myers forest. It gave participants experience applying forest measurement and data analysis concepts. It was well-taught, but more time could have been spent in the field and on post-measurement data analysis than on the introductory material (which took up most of the day). The post-workshop gathering to talk about data analysis never materialized, which was unfortunate.",
    "This is an important subject for M.F. students the school doesn't do a very good job of providing. Cramming it into a one day workshop is insufficient.",
    "Dr. Gregoire did most of the teaching. His explanations were alright, though the course was not structured particularly well. It felt like doing MODs over again, and the out of class assignment did not include the necessary explanation (for example, the volumetric equations given in class and in the notes did not work for the required assignment)."

    "The conceptual background was almost too in-depth, but lacking where the career skills are needed in the actual mensuration and calculation process",
    "Smaller class size is better - more coaching in field was required but not always available. Perhaps more TAs can help in this.",
    "A debrief for the project work",
    "The teaching was terrible. This course needs someone well versed in both field and modern computer-based forest sampling. The entire thing was about 30 years out of date and would be a joke at any other forestry school.",
    "This could be improved by doing different exercises. We essentially repeated what we did in MODS and I would have liked to be a bit more challenged or learn something different.",
    "the assignment came out of nowhere and was very confusing",
    "A follow up field class would be a nice addition. (one Saturday, for example)",
    "More time could have been spent in the field than in the classroom. It would also have been helpful to reconvene after the workshop and after the independent data analysis in order to share results. This was supposed to be part of the workshop, but it never materialized.",
    "The lecture was a bit long and slow. More field practice would also be beneficial.",
    "We never met up after submitting our group work to discuss results. It should be longer and more in depth--less lecture time and more field time.",
    "Better management of group work and responsibilities, as some group members had dissimilar schedules and resulted in coordination being difficult.",
    "The actual field work needs to correspond better to the assignment. Also, group projects can be frustrating because one person can end up doing everything. In my group, everyone procrastinated, so I ended up doing all the quantitative work (most of the assignment) while another person did the writeup. Two people did very little beyond data entry outside of the workshop. Creating an assignment where the workload could be more evenly split up to avoid this would be a good idea."

    "This class was a complement to another course, Management Plans for Protected Areas, but is a valuable skill in general for forestry and sampling. Some of the material was repeat for me having already taking Sampling Methodology, but the advantage was in the opportunity try different methods, although the time we had was limited so few data points made it hard to draw conclusive evidence for patterns among the methods used.",
    "Part of Forestry concerns.",
    "The practical aspects were useful for future work.",
    "Essential- the turnout alone indicates how much students want an applied and theoretical forest inventory class that provides the tools needed in the profession. Very few students go on to academia, so for a professional student something like this is ideal.",
    "I study sustainable land use and management, and it complemented other classes I've taken in stand dynamics and silviculture.",
    "This was a useful exercise and a good way to practice forest measurements, especially as I was about to start sampling forests for the management plans course. It was also a nice refresher on analyzing data to develop estimates and standard errors. However, this might be redundant for someone who has taken Professor Gregoire's sampling course.",
    "This should inform my program as an M.F. student, but I don't think it was sufficient to give a good foundation of forest measurement.",
    "These are critical skills for foresters. At F&ES we need more courses that integrate field skills and theory. Quantitative forestry courses seem to be few at this school, and those that exist are markedly distinct from their application in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Groupwork was important for dividing workload and helping to mull over concepts, although in some ways was challenging due to the divide in related experience among different students",
    "Collaboration and distributed work load.",
    "Allowed us to pool ideas and how to interpret and best represent field data.",
    "We could theoretically learn from eachother. Unfortunately none of us really understood the material.",
    "Everyone had different strengths and perspectives",
    "As someone who was somewhat familiar with sampling and with working up estimates, I felt like I could contribute to the rest of the group's learning. It was also more engaging to work with a group for the sampling portion of the exercise (not to mention, it is near impossible to sample by yourself!).",
    "I learned a bunch from working with my group on the project.",
    "My group members excluded me from most of the work leading up to the final project despite my repeated e-mails asking to be included in group meetings and work. I was only clued in at the end when we had to submit the final project. They sent me the spreadsheet and asked me to write up the methods.",
    "As with almost all of the group work at F&ES, I have to say that most of my group did very little work. I'm not sure if this was procrastination and they intended to do the work at a later point, but with only a couple of days left I ended up doing most of it. Nobody seemed to concerned about it. I don't feel like my group is able to actually do the quantitative parts of this, as they did none of it. Therefore, in this case, the group element was not advantageous. If we had all had our own analysis to do I think it could have encouraged people to take it more seriously and actually gain the skills. The advantage to group work is that we can collect more data in the timeframe that we had."

    "Take it. I think quantitative skills are somewhat under-emphasized at F&ES, and this is a good opportunity to get something for only a day's commitment. Do the writeup, or at least make sure you know what's going on with it, otherwise you'll find it was just MODs all over again."
