    "Thumbs way up. Typical grad seminar set-up: class once a week, 500-word reading response to usually 200-400 pages of reading. Joanna is a gift to the Yale faculty. Those interested in STS, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, multispecies theory, and critiques of hegemonic epistemology needn't look further.",
    "It is an excellent course that I would definitely recommend. However, one must be able to keep up with the reading material.",
    "Good course, would recommend it. Workload is interesting, but lots of essays rather than fewer books, which makes for a lot of it.",
    "The class goes over a number of theoretical and practical elements of STS. It was an excellent, though high level, introduction for someone not in the department.",
    "I would recommend it."

    "It provided perhaps the necessary grounding for even more advanced social studies in science and technology. It provides theoretical frameworks and important questions that are currently applied and pertinent to the field",
    "Offered a range of tools to develop further and maybe put to use, too.",
    "This course provided a new perspective for understanding my discipline since it was outside of my department.",
    "Helped develop a theoretical orientation."
