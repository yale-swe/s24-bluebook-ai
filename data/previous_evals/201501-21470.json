    "SMTC 521 allows students to deepen their understanding of Syriac syntax and grammar by close reading of various Syria texts. It provides the student the opportunity to sample various Syria literature and gain insight into early Syriac Christianity. I would certainly recommend this class for students with an interest in early Christianity.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone seeking to learn Syriac; it's a great way to pack in an entire language into a year and actually get good use out of it through a series of interesting readings.",
    "You learn Syriac in this class. Syriac is a great language so I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "Great class. I came out with the tools to be a good Syriac reader. Would definitely recommend it to any student wishing to learn the language.",
    "I would recommend the course to everyone interested in Syriac and ancient Christianity."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided me with the language background that I need to do work in ancient Christianity. It also exposed me to major early Syriac writers.",
    "This contributes to my dissertation\/research because I need to learn Syriac. Simcha was also very helpful in introducing us not just to the language, but also the broader history and context of Syriac literature and some of the secondary material."
