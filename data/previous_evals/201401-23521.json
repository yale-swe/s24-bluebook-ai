   "comments": [
    "Great material, great lectures, but a lot of work.",
    "Highly recommended for people who have a genuine interest in Soviet History. Otherwise it may be boring and difficult.",
    "I would describe HIST 242 as a very detailed course about the history of the Soviet Union. I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in Soviet history. For people with that passion, this is the perfect class within Yale College to take. I would not recommend this class to people who are not interested in the USSR, though. This class only focuses on the Soviet Union, and if a student fails to find that interesting, they would be bored by the content of the class.",
    "Look, this is a great class. You're gonna learn a ton - possibly more than you'd like - about the history of the Soviet Union and the events that led to both its creation and demise. Professor Friedman, to put it lightly, knows his s**t. Like really knows it. He knows everything. That's the huge upside. The downside to the class is that it is really, really intense. There is a TON of reading and you're not gonna get away with not reading it because Professor Friedman a) is smarter than that and b) holds everyone in the class to a very high standard when it comes to doing the class reading, especially the primary documents he assigns. The work during the semester is very manageable but the combo of the paper + final at the end (which is what he did this semester) is admittedly pretty brutal. I think this class is probably ideal for someone looking to learn a lot and take a class Credit\/D.",
    "Great class for those already interested in Soviet history and have some sort of background. Lots of information, but very interesting.",
    "This class is tough, there's no doubt. The sheer volume of info that will be dumped on you is borderline sadistic, and certainly reminiscent of the workload of some of the more intense STEM classes. However, you will learn a ton, and if you have any vague interest in Communism, Russia, America, etc. I would highly recommend the class. The best history class I've taken at Yale, and really a treat, although you will frequently feel very stupid.",
    "Hist 242 provides an in-depth review of the history of the Soviet Union. From Russia's imperialist past through perestroika, this course examines the motivation behind Russia's major historic actors. The discussion section centers on primary source material and encourages discussion about the cultural and intellectual environment of the relevant period. I would recommend this course to any student interested in history."
