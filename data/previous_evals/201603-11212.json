    "I learned about modern Jewish history, literature and thought, especially with regards to the meaning of being Jewish. Of particular interest were how some of the questions ran parallel to questions being explored by Protestant theologians and philosophers. I developed writing skills and had a chance to present to my classmates and professors. I also had a chance to look at existing research I had undertaken from a different, and, for me at least, fresh perspective.",
    "The course managed to cover vast and somewhat tricky ideas, terms and discipline in a clear and concise way which never left the students confused, but rather got us engaged in heated debates about burning issues through both a historic and a literary perspective. This course really summed up and provided what every academic in the humanities strives for - to use our disciplines as tools to think critically and politically and then take the second step and ask how we as academics can influence our nations and cultural and religious communities."

    "I loved this class. The weekly reading level was reasonable and so we had an opportunity to really unpack the readings during the class. I did not feel that I wasted my time on any of the reading, which cannot always be said when professors are basing their assignments to a particular number of pages. I also enjoyed the diversity of assignments: essays, short stories, philosophy, poetry, even an episode of Gunsmoke. I also learned a lot about academic debate and knowledge sharing from watching and listening to the interaction between the Hannan and Elli. Their debates really opened up avenues that a single professor might not have chosen to go down. They also worked hard to involve every student in the class, to listen to our ideas, but also to question us to dig deeper. It was the seminar at the very best. The only flaw was the lack of clarity about the reading assignments. Many, but not all, were posted on v2. However, the ones that weren't posted required a little searching. As a grad student, finding the texts wasn't much of a problem (that's what Orbis is for), it was suddenly discovering the day before class that the assignment was an entire book or that there were several volumes with the same name. A minor matter of housekeeping that forced me into looking ahead a little more--but it did make preparation for some of the earlier classes a little over-exciting.",
    "This was a great class, the debates were well balanced with lecturing parts by the professors, so the students were able to learn and inquire while also participate and having their voice and opinion heard. We all presented in class, which allowed students to lead a class. This prepared us not only for teaching but any future public speaking. The topics were very well organized and always relevant for current politics and identity issues. It was a pleasure participating in this seminar!"

    "Absolutely. In an era in which identity politics are so prominent, the material encourages reconsideration of the means by which group identities are constructed and the value (and costs) in foregrounding group identity formation in the public sphere. It also tracks a tragic arc around the formation of Israel--offering an explanation for today's Middle East situation and a sense of what might have been.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for any student interested in issues of identity politics relating to nationality and religion, especially in the Jewish aspect - but not only!"
