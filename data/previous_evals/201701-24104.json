   "comments": [
    "The class is very practical and you come away with knowing how to value companies, think about strategy, etc.",
    "a great overview of specific cases relevant to the private equity and venture capital industries.",
    "I learned a lot about the VC&PE field, and specifically about each stage in a fund and deal cycle.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the PE and VC fields. Highly recommend this class to anyone with a financial background looking to learn more about both PE and VC using the HBS case study method.",
    "Considering that I knew very little about private equity or venture capital before I took the class, I learned a lot about both fields. In particular, the class emphasized financial models and being able to interpret financial data, which I did not have much exposure to, so I think this is the greatest skill I got out of the class. Otherwise, I think that my ability to think critically about companies generally improved.",
    "This class is a unique overview of topics on PE. There is a week or two spent on VC but not much more, so don't expect a ton of insight there. Mr. Smith also puts emphasis on learning excel modeling skills, with mixed results.",
    "Knowledge and insights: Basic principles of the PE and VC industries, the differences, similarities, trends with a much stronger focus on PE than VC Perspectives of various business actors: PE firms, CEOs, creditors, shareholders, governments Raising funds Some ideas about operational and financial engineering of companies Exit strategies in PE: pros and cons, meaning, responsibilities Morality of PE\/VC actors and the industry Skills: Reading financial statements: balance sheets, income statements, statement of equity, (a bit of) cash flow statements Valuation of companies: comparable multiples, getting the best multiple, P\/E, EBITDA, finding enterprise value, equity value Valuation of companies: DCF (very basic) Reading of VC term sheets Derivation of share price from a variety of perspectives and actors Investment decision-making: market, product, management, odds Having your ideas questioned\/defending them in class\/speaking up and debating challenging concepts and decisions",
    "This course taught me basic modeling and projecting out financial statements. I also learned more in depth about what Private Equity is and how to work through a case study.",
    "The class introduced me to the business school case method, which is a very effective way to synthesize complex business\/investing situations. Naturally, such real world problems have several stakeholders, diverging and hidden interests, limited information, and time sensitivity - the case method is a very useful way to dissect such situations. Additionally the class also went over the deal life cycle and was very useful for a broad overview of how private equity and venture capital works as asset classes.",
    "I learned a lot about the lifecycle of a deal across the private equity and venture capital industry. I also improved my excel skills a lot which helps prepare me for any future work"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: great professor. Wake cares so much about whether his students are learning. Great format of business cases and discussion. Weakness: more opportunities to speak about careers, field trips, class dinners.",
    "Strength: great material well organized Socratic method is useful great professor weaknesses: the conversation is pretty much predetermined, but that may have to be the case due to the nature of the Socratic method.",
    "The case format with a small class and mandatory participation is crucial for this kind of study and a good preview for business school. It is good to be thrown into the fire and have to learn from mistakes. On the flip side, we were graded pretty harshly for making those mistakes, which is not necessarily fair considering that there were no prerequisites for the class and some of us simply did not have the background knowledge that was deemed necessary according to our assignments. More of a focus on VC would have been great, since nearly all of the cases were solely PE focused and the class was billed as both VC and PE.",
    "I think the strength of this class came from the seminar setting. To begin with, we were able to discuss the cases in great depth, which is where a lot of the insight and experience is to be gained. Also, because most students in the class had some background in the fields, I was able to learn a ton from the other students in the class. Honestly, the strength and knowledge of the students in the class was probably its greatest strength. It also benefitted from a handful of outside speakers, all of whom were excellent additions to the class. My first suggestion to improve the class would be that students be required to take the introduction to accounting that was ultimately abandoned before class started; I actually think this would have been extremely helpful for students with less experience in financial modeling and accounting. My second suggestion would be to have more reading. I loved the material in the class, and while the cases were manageable, I would have loved to have more reading on them, even if it were optional. I think that especially with respect to financial modeling and the more concrete concepts, a textbook or additional references would have been very helpful.",
    "The concept of this course was great. There should be more like it available to the college. The issue is the approach to this course. It is taught case-style, but sometimes skewed more towards a lecture. Mr. Smith doesn't want to provide you frameworks before he gives you the cases but especially for excel-heavy work, it is frustrating to work stuff out on your own and then not be provided a model of what ideal work looks like. It felt at times like we were constantly shooting in the dark.",
    "This was an excellent course and I am very happy that I took it. The content, the instructor and the class discussions were all great. Instructor: Mr Smith is a brilliant teacher and one of the best seminar leaders at Yale. Even though he is a residential college instructor and not a professor, he was a better teacher than many of my other professors. First of all, he moderates discussions very well and believes in the Socratic method. He has his BS-meter on with students all the time and questions their arguments if they are not valid. He also actively jockeys discussions to make sure they are on track Secondly, he crafts a structure and order for every class. At the beginning, he does a brief review regarding last weeks conclusions and then a mini-lecture regarding key concepts from that week. Most of the class is an active back-and-forth discussion among the students and him Third, the class was not meant to be too hard or too easy. Before every class, students answer 4-5 of his questions related to the readings in no more than two pages. The questions always help steer class discussion He is very concerned about feedback and made sure to collect anonymous mid-term feedback Course content: I really enjoyed the Harvard Business School cases they were short and detailed at the same time. The additional readings always complemented the core cases quite well Seminar discussions were always a healthy mix of financial analysis, business questions and social\/moral discussions Assignments: The pre-class questions were very helpful and the exam cases were very fulfilling\/rewarding once finished. Improvements: Grading was quite harsh (Yale now has grade inflation, Mr Smith...) The early pre-class questions such as the IRR calculation was a bit out-of-the-blue and I really had no idea what to do. It was suggested that those would be graded on effort but in the end, there was a penalty for the incorrect answer. In general, even if the pre-class questions were new content, I would lose points even if I put in a lot of hard work. I think those should have been genuinely graded only on hard work More VC, less PE. The class was heavily PE-oriented. We did 2-3 VC cases (maybe just 2). Although I like PE a lot more than VC, the classs name would be a bit misleading. We should have done a full numerical VC case in which we decided which VC firm to invest in (I think we did a small qualitative case) More clear and consistent feedback in terms of actual marks\/grades. The problem was that we didnt know which assignments were actually being graded. I received 4\/12-13 back and I didnt get the perfect score in several but I was expecting score in others I didnt get back. Beyond qualitative feedback (which was always appreciated), the grading schemes and expectations should have been layed out and followed consistently. In general, I think the pre-class questions should be marked only for completion.",
    "One of the best classes I have had at Yale. The key strengths of the class are the instructor and his application of the case method. For the case method to work effectively the class needs to remain a selective seminar. Another strength is the insights from guest speakers, who are all industry veterans. Since most participants in the class are knowledgeable about finance and relevant economic concepts (or the barrier to entry to self-learn these concepts isn't too high), we could have done some of the cases with more technical depth. For example, we could have attempted a more full fledged LBO model for some of the cases. Perhaps the class could benefit from having a student TA who could run a valuation\/accounting bootcamp outside of class hours that would be helpful for developing valuation skills outside class. Again this is not a weakness of the class, but just a suggestion for participants to make the most out of the opportunity.",
    "Strengths include the seminar style of this class which is conducive to engaging discussion of the week's case. People came in with very different knowledge and skillsets and this could have been addressed better in terms of the excel work we did a lot of in the second half of the class. Creating a stronger foundation with excel could have been helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Very finance heavy, but a good introduction. There's a range of experience of the people in the class, so it could be somewhat frustrating for people at either end.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in finance and in particular venture capital and private equity. Each class goes through a HBS case that focuses on specifics aspects of these industries. You'll learn a lot if you work hard and read all the material.",
    "Yes, this is the best opportunity you will have in college to learn about a specific industry in great detail.",
    "Professor Smith did a great job organizing this class with case studies. The seminar setup facilitated an active learning environment that was conducive to learning the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to private equity and venture capital, but with an emphasis on strategy and thinking through problems and not just the pure mechanics of the industry. The course is case-based, which makes it great for discussion, though I think my experience benefitted from a peer group that had a lot of background in the industry and that I could learn from. Overall, this is a great course, and I would definitely take it if given the opportunity.",

    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who was interested in finance or private equity. There are a lot of nuances to the industry and how it works that are hard to understand without doing a more in depth study.",
    "Highly recommend! While this class may sound \"vocational\" to some, it's a fascinating setting to pick up broadly applicable skills and gain an interesting perspective of the world - so yes, fits very much into any liberal arts program! Wake is an excellent and caring instructor, and makes this class great! You also get a group of involved peers to discuss these cases and that definitely adds to the learning opportunity. Obviously, know the expectations of the seminar if you get in so that you don't waste the opportunity for someone else.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any student interested in gaining practical knowledge about venture capital and private equity, especially if they are interested in this as a career path. This class is unlike most at Yale that tend to be more grounded in theory and I definitely left this class with the capability to value companies and understand the complete lifecycle of a deal. For those with less experience in excel or in these industries, the learning curve may be steeper and can require much more work compared to some of your peers in the class, but overall it was a great class."
