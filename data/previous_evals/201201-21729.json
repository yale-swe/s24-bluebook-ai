    "This class was fantastic and I would definitely recommend it to any (experienced) Latin student. Jay structured the class to include a perfect balance of discussion and translation. Every Tuesday, we sight read passages that established the plays within the context of the classical literary tradition. On Thursdays, we read as much of the week's 300 line assignment. Since everyone knew how to translate, it was a pretty chill class. The only real assignments are a midterm, a short presentation, and a final.",
    "Roman Tragedy will familiarize you with some of the bloodiest texts in the Western Canon, and introduce you to some of the fundamental ideas behind the study of Classics. Professor Fisher adores the subject, loves his students, and has an absurdly deep knowledge base. If you love Latin, take it. You'll love the class as well.",
    "YES, TAKE IT! This was an amazing class and Jay is an awesome teacher. The material is really interesting as well.",
    "This is an excellent course. We spent half of the class periods examining fragments of old Latin tragedy. This is an exercise I have not encountered in any other Classics courses, but one that should be a part of more of them. It is excellent for learning about how to work with highly limited information and provides an opportunity to look at some neat stuff that one would not normally encounter. It also gives the class an opportunity to discuss broader questions of theory in Roman Tragedy and Latin Literature. In the other half of the class periods, we have a close reading of the Seneca that we read for the week. Unfortunately, Seneca is a nearly talentless playwright, but there is no way around that fact, given the subject matter of the course. Throughout the course, Professor Fisher was excellent. It is a course well worth taking if he is the professor. He is eminently personable, knowledgeable, helpful, and downright funny, and his lectures are always quite interesting.",
    "This class is highly recommended-- if interested in Latin literature you should try to take a class with Prof Jay Fisher. He's friendly, fair, and brings an incredible amount of diverse and interesting information to every class. The small class size lends itself to very lively and energetic discussions that are engaging and great to participate in.A portion of the text is due in translation each week; classes alternate between translating in class and discussion of a sight passage or the week's reading, and exams are generally based on translating passages from the curriculum."
