   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about the device physics of diodes, MOSFETS, and BJTS, going all the way down to how atoms bond in order to create the semi conductor material used. The course really built the devices from the ground up, which was a really useful way to absorb the material.",
    "Semiconductors",
    "A lot of info about semiconductors in the nano level. Electrons, protons, holes, energy bands etc. very useful if sb wants to learn about devices physics",
    "Prof. Reed explained pn junctions and transistors like a boss, and I am very thankful for that!",
    "I learned how to go from quantum mechanical laws all the way to circuit design for semiconductor devices. A fast-paced, comprehensive look at why and how these devices work",
    "I learned how to take I-V and C-V characteristics of semiconductor devices and how to find device parameters from these measurements. The class also teaches theory on semiconductor device operation and how they are fabricated.",
    "I developed a great insight to the semiconductor devices I had learned about in EENG 200 and have since applied in 201, 203, and 325. I found practical applications for the quantum mechanics I had learned in PHYS 261. I learned valuable skills in writing scientific lab reports and analyzing graphs.",
    "I gained a fundamental understanding of semiconductors and their applications in the modern technological world.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of how semiconductor devices are constructed and function, starting with quantum mechanics and working all the way through the operation of Diodes, BJTs, FETs, etc.",
    "Definitely learned a tremendous amount about the basic operation of semiconductors and semiconductor devices. This is pretty cool since theyre everywhere in modern technology. The labs we did have served to deepen my understand of the topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was fantastic; the subject material could have been boring on its own, but Mark Reed makes it so interesting. I feel like I got an incredibly thorough understanding of the devices I use as an electrical engineer. The homeworks were difficult but in a way that was very useful to understanding the material. The midterm and final were both very fair. The only weakness was the labs; my course only had about 2 labs, which weren't very effective because problems in the lab equipment became more of an issue than the actual lab we were trying to do. Although this isn't so much a fault with the course as with the lab equipment.",
    "Interesting material, wished that we could have actually done the labs.",
    "Good lecture notes, but we went through them quite fast Lack of TA for most of the semester made this course harder. The two labs we had were useful but because the were scheduled towards the end of the semester they were very hard and a lot of work After Ta was found, ta was awesome!",
    "The labs are a ton of work, and I think the same info could be transmitted with demos, rather than full labs. The rest of the work was very fair and useful.",
    "This course was particularly strong in connecting engineering and physics. It provides an explanation for semiconductor device operation that is taken for granted in courses more focused on circuit design.",
    "This class is perfect. Great instructor and excellently prepared material.",
    "Prof. Reed is an excellent lecturer and makes the material accessible to his students. One improvement is that the lecture slides could include more of his verbal explanations.",
    "This is a great course overall. I'm surprised by how much we were able to cover, and Professor Reed did a great job of tying everything together in order to form a deep understanding of semiconductor devices.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the subject matter is very relevant and important, the class size is small and Prof. Reed is incredibly kind and likeable. That being said I wish more had been done to take advantage of the small class size. It felt like more often than not class was run like any other large science lecture."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course; it's a lot of work but it's so rewarding, and it forces you to think in new ways. Mark Reed is a fantastic lecturer, and it's so worth it to go to every class even though the lecture notes are online. You get so much more out of it by going to class. The homeworks are hard, but getting through them is really necessary to understand the material. The final and midterm are very fair.",
    "It was pretty fun and the material is super interesting. I actually want to learn more about all of this. We didn't have all of the labs this year though, so the workload would probably be greater if we had done all of them.",
    "Take this course if you are an electrical engineering major or really interested in devices physics",
    "Yes! Take it if you want to understand how the world revolves around the Silicon empire",
    "Ask about the labs. If there are labs, dont do it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches practical skills in determining semiconductor device parameters and characteristics and is generally an interesting class that provides a unique perspective on device operation through a physics lens.",
    "Hello electrical engineers and maybe a few physics people. This is a great class which you should absolutely take (because you have to). You'll learn a lot about the theory behind the semiconductor devices you've seen in EENG 200, 201, 203, and 325. Professor Reed is a fantastic lecturer. His lectures are well-prepared, enjoyable, and practical. He found an excellent balance between explaining the theory and presenting applications. The homeworks complement the lectures well, and exams are on the same level as the homeworks. I'd recommend this class to anyone. One of the best EE electives at Yale",
    "If you have an interest in learning about semiconductors- that's the name of this course and you will learn about that topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that is interested, even if it's not a requirement. Starting with a foundation of quantum mechanics, Prof. Reed is somehow able to bring students all the way through the function and fabrication of BJTs, FETs, Diodes, etc. It's surprising how much material is covered in the course, but Prof. Reed is a great instructor and makes the class both manageable and very interesting. The cleanroom tour is a great addition to the course, and also very interesting is Prof. Reed's attention to the historical development of these devices.",
    "The subject matter for this class is very interesting\/important but be sure to check in with Prof. Reed during shopping period on how many labs he is planning to do your semester. We only did two labs my year and they were a tremendous amount of work. I can only imagine what kind of semester it would've have been if we'd had to do a lab every week in addition to the weekly homework as was done previously. I cannot say I would recommend this course if it goes back to the regular once a week lab schedule."
