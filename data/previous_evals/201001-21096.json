    "I would recommend the course to another student in BME. It applies to so many applications in the field, and brings up topics that I don't think are taught elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend it because it provides knowledge in an important, interdisciplinary area relating to tissues and biomaterials. The content is important, and is handled well in a course that branches into a great number of different areas.",
    "It is a good course for someone who wish to gain a basic knowledge about biomaterials and tissue interactions.Therefore, I will recommend it to anyone who is interested in cell and tissue engineering."

   "comments": [
    "It opened my eyes to new problems in the field and how they are being approached. It also shed light on issues that are arising and how we and BMEs might deal with them in the future.",
    "The course provided essential knowledge and understanding of the application of biomaterials, which is relevant in any situation involving the introduction of such materials to human tissues. It provided good foundations and exposure to future research work.",
    "I read a lot of papers for this course, which was a good chance for training myself to get used to reading scientific papers. Now I can read a paper faster without losing its big picture."
