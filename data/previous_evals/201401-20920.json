   "comments": [
    "It definitely focuses on topics of humor, but a student must know that it is not a class focused on teaching how to write humor. I think a lot of students believed that was the purpose of the class, at first. However, we learned how to analyze and understand different theories and types of humor in a way that I appreciate because I can now look at parts of my life and understand why I laugh at certain things. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they want to read funny and interesting literature that they get to discuss and write interesting papers about.",
    "It's an intro course to learning how to write better essays, and this particular one is focused on analyzing humor in various pieces of literature. If you're not sure how good your essays are--or even if you think you're pretty okay--take a 114 or 115 course because your skills are probably not as good as Yale expects of you, and anyway you'll need to learn how to write good essays, or at least how to analyze and present things effectively and concisely, if you want to get anywhere in life.",
    "I recommend this class if you are looking to elevate the style of your writing from high school to college level. I felt like a good writer in high school but this class enabled me to see how much I could grow and make my writing more developmental and mature. Be prepared for a substantial amount of reading, and to spent a lot of time writing if you want to get the most out of this class -- you really get out what you put in, and if you're willing to put in the time, your writing and critical reading skills will benefit hugely.",
    "If you enjoy reading literature, definitely take 115 over 114. I loved this course and we only had 4 papers to write (one was a research paper). The discussions were engaging and overall interesting. I learned a lot about humor and my own opinions.",
    "Yes because it is a very interesting and thought provoking literature class where you understand the deepest roots of what makes us laugh.",
    "Engl 115 had 4 essays, some daily assignments, and a lot of reading. I think that the course is structured in a very scientific way so you are able to get your best work done and learn a lot along the way. This humor section had amazing readings and fun discussions.",
    "Yes i definitely would. The material was interesting and taught in a way that engaged the whole class",
    "Definitely, though you've got to really like literature to take this course over 114. If you do, take it.",
    "If you are really into literary analysis and don;t care about getting a B then go for it.",
    "I highly recommend it. Writing is a skill that is essential in almost every discipline and I can imagine very few ways to learn it better and in a more fun way. You learn so much about humor as well as improve your writing skill. However, I think the best aspect of this course is that it is FUN. The readings are fun to do that you actually want to read. As are the videos you have to watch for class (stand-ups and sitcoms). Finally even the discussions with your classmates are fun and intriguing. The topic of \"humor\" makes this class into such an awesome environment that is both conducive to learning and having fun."
