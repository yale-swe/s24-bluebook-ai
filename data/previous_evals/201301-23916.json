    "My expectations for the course was rather high - I was expecting a truly joint architecture and development studio. However, the expectations were not met, and both critiques as well as mid and final reviews were frustrating. During mid and final reviews, it became clear that a lot of the specifically development approaches espoused during the semester fell by the wayside, and it became critiqued from the point of view of a traditional urban planning project, the development aspects falling by the wayside as the semester progressed.",
    "Having worked professionally for several years I think I had a good understanding of the architect-developer workflow, but was hoping for additional clarifications and more detailed information regarding this process. Additionally, as this studio was slated to deliver an unusual urban design problem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 subject that I am very interested in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I had hopes to expand my knowledge in this matter as well. Unfortunately I have to admit that I have not gained much, neither from the development nor urbanistic perspectives. Despite visible efforts and interest from the developer side, our own faculty struggled to keep the studio engaging and didactic. Our faculty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tardiness thwarted students enthusiasm (and there was quite a lot of it at the begging of the semester) and will for exploration. The closed-minded approach to instruction took toll on studios morale, creativity and quality of produced work. Although the faculty put their effort in regularly meeting with students (something of a rarity), the discussion was hardly stimulating or encouraging. It is hard for me to say this, but as someone who can barely afford being in this institution, thus expecting something worthy of the financial burden, I am quite disappointed by this course and its poor handling.",
    "I had great expectations for the course. While most people opted to place this studio last or low in their rankings (taking their chances with bigger name architects or being turned off from the idea of having to deal with a developer and the lack of a design critic), I was excited enough about the prospect of learning about the inner workings of development and perhaps work on a weakness of mine, which was larger scale urban design. What resulted was that I got none of anything. I feel that I have wasted my last academic studio experience and what was told to me at the final review was just a reiteration of what I already knew.My feeling towards the studio was that it was an experiment. As I have heard before, it has rarely ever been the case (if ever), that the Bass studio did not include a design architect alongside a developer. While I know that issues in the past like developer interests overriding design or vice-versa, it was this conflict which I expected to learn to deal with and a strong architect is key in a design studio to teach design (which I believe is ultimately any reason for going to a graduate architectural design program). What resulted in the studio was that while Andrei Harwell (whom I appreciated and respected immensely) should have acted mostly as an assistant and coordinator, he ended up being the only one well versed enough in actual design to give any sort of feedback that was constructive.While some students managed to produce acceptable schemes, I know my own scheme was certainly lacking and I do not blame anyone other than myself. However I would like to argue that the whole point of school is to work on our weaknesses and had I been a capable urban designer, I would not need to go to graduate school. Had I just needed licensure, there are far quicker, easier, and less expensive ways to go about it than The Yale School of Architecture. The fact thatI went into that studio having wanted to work on my design ability and having come out of it equally unhappy with the trajectory of my capabilities seems to me to represent a failure in the studio. I understand that perhaps I may have been difficult as incompatibilities always exist between people but just as there are difficult students, there are difficult teachers and I gave my honest best to try to make the best of the situation. I did not feel that the critics (mostly Mr. Garvin) reciprocated in that effort and that it is a teacher\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s job to teach and inspire their students the best they could. One would expect a good teacher (let alone a Yale professor) to be able to set aside personal prejudices and biases to help any student under their instruction.I greatly appreciated the Dutch developer and their enthusiasm was fantastic. I greatly appreciated Mr. Harwell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ability to keep things together though I regret his lack of ability to really speak up. I enjoyed Kevin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s excitement over ideas though I think that the lack of emphasis on financials (as the prompt given by the developers was extremely open ended) meant that Kevin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s value was extremely limited. Lastly, while I appreciate that Mr. Garvin must have worked hard to teach a studio, he is not at all qualified to teach design or engage in the necessary method to drive design development and his arrogant personality only hindered what little design I could do on my own.I am incredibly displeased at the way the studio went and much of it had to do with just the poor decision to not have a strong architectural critic. It is made even more tragic in that the developer was stellar and the support staff was first-rate. There was just so much potential which was wasted. I grossly underestimated how important that is, and I am guessing that the people who put the studio together must have also. I suppose I feel a bit like I am part of a failed experiment and I hope at the very least, that this may never happen again.",
    "The opportunity to engage with different disciplines outside of architecture and to meet and learn from some extraordinary figures in both design and development was entirely satisfactory. We had a fantastic trip to Amsterdam in which we not only saw the city, but met with a wide range of planners, architects, and developers who were extremely generous with their time and attention. The MAB group extended that support throughout the semester and devoted significant time and attention to evaluating every project. Erik Go and Hans-Hugo Smit (part of Issac's team) were expert advisors. Kevin, Alex, and Andrei brought a great deal of expertise, each of its own kind, to the studio and were very available to answer questions and offer guidance several times each week. The mix of voices challenged me to think about and consider a huge range of variables on the entire range of issues, financial to aesthetic, and this was at times difficult, but I ultimately appreciate that, as it was a test of my own judgement and ability to process information and make effective decisions based upon a huge range of criteria. Ultimately, I think my design work was satisfactory and the masterplan I produced addressed a huge range of issues above and beyond physical form - in the end it was an exciting program idea, and a very plausible and appealing design underpinned by a great deal of analytical work - work of a type I'd never done before. I think the masterplan fell short as a compelling or exciting image and I should've been more radical or innovative with certain details in my design and representational approach in order to get there: next time!As far as concerns go, I do feel that the studio should've been more prescriptive - an odd critique perhaps, but looking back, a lot of the difficulty stemmed from not having a clear routine of design exercises articulated for each week. In the end, I think there were set of apathetic students who had very little interest or respect for what they were doing, and they were given too much latitude(they were treated like mature adults and were expected to show initiative and self-motivation). Work didn't get done, or ideas didn't get tested to their fullest, and somehow, some students felt that it was the instructors fault. The mentality employed by half the students was one of \"externalization\" - a term in sociology to describe the technique of blaming others for ones problems. I raise these issues not simply because I know this set of reviews will be contentious, but because in fact, I found it draining at times myself to deal with the extraordinary arrogance and negativity of some of my classmates during the semester. Two post-pros in particular were such a pain-in-the-ass that two students in the adjoining studio group (Easterling) moved their desks to the other end of the 4th floor after a month so that they didn't have to sit near or listen to them (J. Jacobson could corroborate): the rest of us did not have that luxury. Hostile work environment? I'm sorry to mention it, but it WAS an issue.In conclusion, one of the broad themes that emerged at our final was that an extraordinary amount had been asked of the students - that if we'd had teams of two, or if the brief had been more specific, we might have had better projects as an outcome: this is true on some fatalistic level because more labor = more output, and because collaboration can produce better ideas (half of the time). Still, I actually enjoyed the challenge of having to process and integrate all these ideas and inputs myself,relished the personal responsibility, and most of all, I appreciated the one-on-one time I got to ask questions of my MAB advisors. It was a difficult studio, but I got a great deal out of it and appreciate the contributed time and efforts of Isaac and everyone who put it together.",
    "I would have expected the studio to be more of understanding of finance matters and explore different areas of architecture. But at the end, it was just another urban studio with lots of confusion in between to come up with a strong design concept. It would have been a lot more helpful if we had fewer instructors. The biggest problems were very different opinions on the project matters that eventually led no where. Perhaps, the studio seems to have too many problems to tackle at once. I wish there were more involvement with MAB team along with Isaac, instead of Yale faculty members."
