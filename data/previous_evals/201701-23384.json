    "Very useful",
    "I can't say enough good things about this course. It's a skills-based course so it's extremely useful. Dr. White has the curriculum down to a t. It's designed in such a way that is most effective and efficient to learn how to develop and evaluate questionnaires. This was far and away the most useful class I took all semester. It's one of those classes that you get as much value out of it as effort you put in. And because I was engaged with the instructor's style and the curriculum was so organized, I was able to prioritize my efforts appropriately. I actually prioritized my assignments for this class over all others this semester for three reasons: 1 because there were a lot of assignments. Like a lot. 2 because every assignment was a continuation of the last, all pertaining to the end game; this consistency gave me the ability to have a big picture in mind right from the start and I was way more invested than had the assignments been fragmented deliverables that were unrelated to each other. And 3 because I chose a topic of great interest to me to develop the questionnaire about and that made me actually excited about working on each of the assignments.",
    "This course provided practical knowledge on how to develop and evaluate measures. I have found the information learned in this class (reliability and validity, factor analysis, etc.) to be very helpful in reading studies that utilized survey measures. However, the course has several weaknesses. I believe that the content on psychometric evaluations of a measure should be presented much earlier in the course. It is difficult to conceptualize an idea for a measure, when students are unfamiliar with how certain components of the scale will even be evaluated. Also, the majority of quantitative courses at YSPH are taught in SAS. The instructor teaches the course in SPSS making it difficult for students to complete the assignment unless they are on campus at the computer labs.",
    "Great course!",
    "The major strength of this class is Marney. She is a wonderful, caring, intelligent professor that makes relatively dry material fun and entertaining. You learn a practical skill that will serve you well after the MPH. Also, the final paper is a publishable product, which makes writing it feel important and rewarding.",
    "a reasonably good course, with emphasis on team work, that helps in relation building and work ethics.",
    "I loved this class. Marney is obviously a strength of the course. It's generally a great course if you're interested in learning new skills that you may use in your future career (designing surveys, using Qualtrics & SPSS).",
    "Strength - was able to leave class with a new skill set Weakness - lectures were dry Ways to improve - incorporate more interactive elements, like the computer lab class periods",
    "I loved making a questionnaire- doing is the best way to learn! Not all of the material you needed was covered during lecture, which could be frustrating",
    "Very good!",
    "I really enjoyed this class and learned a ton of practical skills. I think the group work aspect of the class was both its strength and weakness, but I think the peer evaluations were a good strategy for holding all group members accountable. The use of examples was especially helpful when discussing different aspects of questionnaire development, and the slides were extensive--I frequently referenced them when working on assignments and developing my survey. I also loved the small size and intimate nature of the class.",
    "Marney is an incredible teacher. Take this course!",
    "Opted to take this course because it came highly recommended by my peers. Decided to take this to get rigorous, tangible skills - and I did! But it took me towards the end of the course to understand how much we actually learned. Great structure in that each concept was taught and then applied through the assignment due - great practical application of concepts to solidify learning. It's a good survey course. Sometimes, descriptions of assignments or posting of comments was not clearly conveyed to students, which could improve with clarifications.",
    "Strengths: Applied, fun, interesting Weaknesses: a little bit weak on the content\/theory of questionnaire development (which is probably because the content itself is a bit dry and also because the project takes up the majority of time) Room for improvement: could have a little bit more content"

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is a professorial superstar and I think there's a consensus on that. She's charismatic, funny, and knows the subject impressively well, even for a professor. She can answer even the most complex question regarding survey design and psychometric attributes in a way that is understandable to her students. I look forward to taking other classes of hers in the future. Also, Dr. White was very generous of her time outside of class. She was extremely responsive to e-mail and was able to think through analytical issues with us via e-mail. For a while there she almost became one of our group members because she was analyzing our data on her own time. That kind of commitment certainly makes her stand out from other professors.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very knowledgeable on questionnaire development, however, she struggles in transferring that knowledge to students. Several times throughout the semester we would approach the professor with a limitation we had discovered on the development of our questionnaire and Marney would simply say \"Oh yes I knew that\" or some other statement that indicated she could have helped us in improving our questionnaire before sending it out, but could not be bothered to do so. Further, for a Social and Behavioral Sciences professor, Marney was not particularly sensitive to these issues. At one point during the semester, Marney made a comment that our questionnaires should be developed at the reading level of a \"UConn undergrad\". Overall, the expectations from the professor were also unclear. Several ungraded assignments were posted randomly on Canvas, with no description in the Syllabus. Further, the graded assignments did not include rubrics, so it was difficult to know what the professor was looking for.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great teacher",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Somehow manages to make questionnaire development engaging and entertaining! Wonderful experience.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is the best. She is so REAL and so passionate and inspired. She is someone I look up to as a fascinating professor with tons of knowledge, but she is also a friend. I have loved being her student.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths: Very friendly and approachable!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0good teacher, adaptable, considerate",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a fantastic instructor. She's clearly interested in the success of her students and creates a really great learning environment--she knows that we won't be total experts in questionnaire development in one semester, and she grades accordingly (i.e. there's no crazy grade punishment for making mistakes). Honestly, I looked forward to this class every week because Marney made it so much fun.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strength - engaging, creates fun environment",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Really nice! Gives great feedback, but has the tendency to go off topic during lecture",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Prof.White is a fantastic teacher, very knowledgable and very kind.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is perhaps the most delightful professor I've had at Yale. She is passionate about questionnaire development, and does an excellent job of peppering her lectures with interesting examples and anecdotes. Also, as someone interested in going into academia, she had many interesting insights into what it is like to work in academia and the trials and tribulations of publishing (and reviewing) journal articles. I really valued these insights. In addition, she was always friendly and attentive over email and responded quickly to my many questions.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Witty, brilliant, and very very caring",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Effective teaching! Thank you.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is definitely a great teacher - she is able to explain difficult concepts in an understandable way to students, and is very approachable. Can be a bit of an adjustment to her dry humor, for those who are not used to this type of thing. Overall great instructor, however sometimes glossed over some concepts or details for assignments probably just from having taught the course so many times. Very easy to talk to although can be a little intimidating at first. And very receptive to feedback - which is a really great quality."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely! I think this should be a required course for every single public health student, regardless of concentration. It's a skill that is universally useful because no matter what our job is in the future, we all are likely to need to develop and distribute a survey at one point or another. Questionnaire design and evaluation is a critical skill just like epidemiology and biostats I think.",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "This was my most fun class this semester. Marney creates a classroom environment that is fun, collaborative, encouraging, and enjoyable. I learned a useful skill that I think will serve me well. I have also loved working with my group and I have loved getting to know Marney.",
    "Great learning skills; definitely recommended!",
    "Yes, a reasonably good course",
    "Take it. Awesome & fun course, and I learned a LOT in just a semester.",
    "Beneficial - leave with a new skill set that is essential for research projects",
    "I really enjoyed this class, my group, and making a questionnaire. You will definitely get a skill out of this class",
    "If you want to know anything about questionnaire, just take this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone, not just those required to take it, because I think everyone has something to gain by taking this class. There is certainly a lot of work involved in this class, but at the end of it you will have useful skills and an impressive work product to show for it. Also, Marney is a great professor and she's passionate about the material, which always makes classes more engaging.",
    "The course will teach you to think more deeply about surveys and introduce skills to design and evaluate psychometric scales.",
    "Great project based class in which you learn useful things and have an opportunity to create a product you are proud of. Great applied learning. Yes - definitely recommend to other students for the above reasons.",
    "Good course to learn a survey of survey methods! Helpful for those doing a quantitative thesis, and helpful for other courses like Trace's Interventions course. Good practical application of skills. Work-heavy towards the end of the semester, but otherwise manageable. Find a group you work well with!",
    "This is a very nice class to pursue some interest that you might have. You will be exposed to relevant topics, although you wont learn enough to be able to do this yourself again. It has the plus of learning SPSS, and a fun professor."
