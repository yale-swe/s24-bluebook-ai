    "Yes it is fun!",
    "Really interesting seminar on contemporary art, especially on video art and how artists have responded to media. I recommend it! Professor Joselit leads very interesting discussions.",
    "If you have a serious interest in art history and want to spend more time focusing on contemporary art, this is a great class. There is a fair amount of reading, but the seminars are very interesting, and the discussion is engaging.",
    "The class explores the ways in which art and technology have shaped each other over the years, and how it relates to spatial and temporal experience. Most of the readings are very interesting and engaging, and the class discussions are mostly led by student presentations on the material. I always left class wanting to think more and more about the subject matter. Professor Joselit is a brilliant thinker and discussion-leader - and challenges the class with fantastic and important questions about media and the modern world. I would definitely suggest taking this class.",
    "If you're looking for a class in contemporary art (of which there are very few at Yale), then take it. Be the perfectly-casual-yet-very-active discussion group that we weren't, though, or your discussions may get dry.",
    "It's a look at postwar art in new media, generally video and installation art. Highly recommended to students interested in contemporary art! Best if you have some background in the field."
