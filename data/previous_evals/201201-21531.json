    "If you want to improve your French, this class is it. Yes, there's grammar, but it's more on a personal basis--as in you decide how much time you put in to learn the material. Overall the readings and movies are less depressing than in 140. I even watched some movies that weren't assigned because Mme Schneider does such a good job of selecting them. I would definitely recommend this class but you have to be prepared to work and participate. Mme Schneider has a wonderful voice so you'll enjoy yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are enjoyable and at a fair level, the vocabulary learned is practical and the films are entertaining and thought-provoking. While considerable, the homework is not excessive. I feel much more confident in my ability to communicate in French at a high level, after this class.",
    "This course is quite demanding. Even though L5 meets only three times a week the workload is just about the same as in L4. If you can put in the work, you'll get a lot out of this, and make tremendous improvement in your French.",
    "SUIVEZ. CE. COURS. Et suivez-le avec Mme Schneider! This course is absolutely necessary if you hope to develop fluency with or a full appreciation for the French language and its nuances. The texts\/movies you discuss are really interesting (mais un peu bizarre, bien sur) and really engaging, and provoke great discussions in class that can not only boost your speaking confidence but also widen your vocabulary significantly. The course itself is really well-designed; particularly if you take it with Mme Schneider, you should be prepared to do a decent amount of work in preparation for every class, but you should also be prepared to see tremendous results along with it. She WILL make you a much better Francophone, if you put in the work, guaranteed. She may be un peu plus rigide que les autres professeurs (surtout Diane Charney, qui est une SWEETHEART), mais je pense que les r\u00e9sultats que vous verrez vaudront le travail. I have left this course significantly more confident in my writing, reading, and listening abilities, but also much more confident in my SPEAKING (which is a HARD skill to develop, even slowly). If you plan to become fluent in French (or even pretty functional), you should definitely take FREN151. Faites-le. Vous ne le regretterez pas. Je le promets."
