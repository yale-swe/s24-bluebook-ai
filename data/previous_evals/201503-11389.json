   "comments": [
    "I enjoy this class a lot. It may be one of the hardest chemistry classes that I have ever taken but I still enjoy every bit of it. This is not a class that you can memorize but one that requires you to apply what you know. I highly recommend this class but do note that this is not an easy course.",
    "Definitely take if you can! This was easily the best science class I've taken at Yale. Professors are great and the material is interesting. The topics you cover are pertinent to current research and include some super fascinating techniques. Not a ton of work but you still learn a lot. Tests are difficult but doable and the grading is very understanding. I took this as a sophomore and was initially intimidated to be the youngest person in a room of mostly grad students, but as long as you've taken orgo and put in the time to review note and read the papers corresponding papers you'll be fine.",
    "A wonderful and comprehensive overview of the current field of chemical biology. Covered multiple experimental techniques that I found to be directly applicable to both fields of chemistry and biology, and that I would most likely used in any future research. Lectures were for the most part interesting, although sometimes dragged on, but tests were fair and cumulative. Focus on the details in the slides, and don't procrastinate on the student presentations\/proposals.",
    "This class was one of the best chem classes I took",
    "This is an excellent class. Professor Slavoff taught very well (it was a little harder to follow Professor Crawford). I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about the foundations of chemical biology. Workload was very manageable. Tests were fair and the proposal was fun to write. Biggest downside was the trek to the chemistry building.",
    "Great class--survey of interesting and relevant new techniques. Recommended to mb&b majors who feel that the biochemistry sequence is too much bio and not enough chem",
    "One of my favorite chemistry electives that I've taken. If you need a chemistry elective, this one is great.",
    "Chemistry 421 was a great upper-level elective course that I would recommend to students with sufficient background in organic chemistry and biology (2 semesters each). The course focuses primarily on the mechanisms and design of chemical probes that can be used to investigate biology in novel ways. The workload is relatively light for a science course, with only 4 problem sets, a 3-page research proposal, an in-class presentation on your proposal, and 2 exams. However, it may be frustrating for students who prefer to have abundant practice materials to prepare for exams and for those who do not have experience writing a research proposal, as the instructors gave relatively little guidance during this process. Overall, however, if you liked organic chemistry and are interested in biochemistry and cell biology, I think you will enjoy this course."
