    "Guest speakers were hit or miss. Sometimes they spoke a lot about what their job or subject area expertise was but little to nothing about leadership.",
    "I think how much time you would allocate for this course really determines how valuable the class is for you. I took all the assignments very seriously. It was not because I took the class for three credits, but because I considered every assignment as a journey for me to understand myself better. From the assignments, I began to understand myself better. They also helped me to contemplate my past life and how I would want to proceed for the future. The class is also very valuable in a way that they brought many amazing speakers to the class and learned from them.",
    "The professor, Peter Crane, was pretty much absent.",
    "Let's be clear here: Frances Sawyer or however was on stage that day was the actual instructor.",
    "Frances did a great job. Seems like Dean Crane had a little too much on his plate to be involved with this sort of thing.",
    "Obviously, though Peter Crane is the official instructor, Frances Sawyer was the real leader of the class. She did an excellent job engaging the students and guiding us towards thoughtful reflections about ourselves and environmental leaders.",
    "I really enjoyed hearing from all of the different speakers, great concept for a course!",
    "Frances Sawyer was really behind the course and its implementation over the semester, Dean Crane's involvement was really secondary, and he didn't attend all of the weekly sessions.",
    "Frances was an awesome instructor. She is skilled at facilitating conversations and thinks a lot about how to improve course design to meet student's needs.",
    "Questions 8-10 were based on Francis Sawyer, not Dean Crane. Francis actually taught the class, Dean Crane wasn't even there most of the time.",
    "This is in response to Question 9. On more than several occasions, the professor talked for many minutes while students' hands were raised - often without even acknowledging them. His answers usually were pretty inadequate, as well: half-answers, nebulous answers, etc.",
    "Question 10: I do not feel that the instructor was around enough to evaluate him properly.",
    "Frances was a great addition to the course, her experience in writing and the fact that she was a peer was helpful in understanding the potential in us as environmental leaders.",
    "Peter Crane didn't actually teach much of the course, so my ratings only reflect the small portion that he did participate in. I can't say that he was very responsive to student comments, as he was generally not present, and does not give the impression that he is a contact person for the course. Workload was relatively small, about right, considering that I took the course for 1 credit. I found the assignments to be very good and interesting. The class discussions around the assignments were helpful and interesting.",
    "I declined to answer questions on Dean Crane's effectiveness because the class was actually taught by Frances. She did an amazing job with the course. I hope this class is offered even after she graduates with another instructor leading section.",
    "Be nice if Dean Sir Peter Crane actually taught some of the courses. But that's pretty much the story of him at the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. Chris Sawyer did a good job though."

    "The best aspects of this course were: 1. All awesome guest speakers 2. Frances Sawyer, the TF 3. The three-credits group discussion every Tuesday morning.",
    "Through a series of evening talks, we learned about the lives of some important players in the environmental movement. I found this overview useful, as I tend to focus on current issues, but this prompting gave me a reason to learn about more historical figures.",
    "Exposed to wide varieties of leadership qualities and skills",
    "Some guests that were brought in were exceptional.",
    "Great reading list, opportunities to hear from a wonderful array of folks.",
    "The most valuable aspect of this course was the opportunity to reflect on my goals and values at FES and in the future. No other class gives you the opportunity to do that and we are always so busy it is not something we students think to do.",
    "The people we were honored to meet. Some were really mind-blowing.",
    "Giving a bigger picture of environmental leadership and keeping the focus on why we came to FES.",
    "It was great to learn values through other people's life and faith",
    "Personal narratives are important and it is good to spend time developing them. Some super inspirational speakers. I especially liked Terry Tempest Williams. I wish she could follow me around every day and give me life advice.",
    "Terry Tempest Williams! We need to get her as a visiting professor! I enjoyed learning about environmental leaders. I found this class to be inspiring and through provoking about my future career. This was a great class to balance out my course load.",
    "The way the class encouraged engagement with fellow students. These conversations, though awkward for many, were important for each of us to examine our beliefs about leadership, why we held those beliefs, and how, if at all, those beliefs could or should be challenged.",
    "The variety of speakers was pretty great, the women's panel was particularly excellent",
    "The speakers! A lot of real powerhouses, inspiring people.",
    "Having time to reflect on my own journey and goals in a safe and inspiring environment.",
    "Cool look at some of the leaders in environmental history. Probly stuff we all should know, but most of us don't, and this is the only class at FES that really gets into it.",
    "Some of the speakers were absolutely extraordinary - Terry Tempest Williams and Donald Worster come to mind immediately. Their visits made the class.",
    "A number of the lecturers were very interesting and engaging. It was enjoyable to learn a about the great environmental figures of the past, and some whoa re currently working.",
    "The quality of speakers was unprecedented. Having the opportunity to meet these people over dinner was one of my top experiences at Yale.",
    "The diversity of the speakers.",
    "Well conceived. Excellent guests each week.",
    "The assignments and discussions were the best parts.",
    "The Tuesday morning sections were fantastic. The speakers were not uniformly high quality, but overall were quite good.",
    "Such a great class! So many interesting people to learn about and issues to discuss. Frances did a fantastic job of running this class. If I could require a few classes at FES, I would make this one of them. With a few exceptions, phenomenal choice of guest speakers.",
    "This class had some amazing guest speakers whose experiences were fascinating. Combined with the introspection encouraged by the assignments, we were set up well to reflect on our lives and see what kind of impact we could make in the world going forward."

   "comments": [
    "The course meetings that were small group discussions were a waste of time.",
    "I cant think any. I really love the class.",
    "I don't think the writing assignments helped me gain any critical insight into my own life.",
    "Have a wider variety in terms of not just local leadership but, have other leaders from ouotside. The leadership perspectives were from an american angle and there were internationals in the class. Also, are there leaders who are African American in the environmental arena? The lack of such gives the impression the african american population isn't involved in environmental sciences",
    "The teaching. It's absurd to have a 20-something who's never worked teaching a class on leadership. It needs an established and thoughtful instructor who has the time and energy to be available.",
    "It could have been a bit more cohesive. The speakers were great but more content would have been useful. Also, more direction on the writings and discussions when we broke up into groups would be helpful.",
    "A couple of things. I hate to say this but without a real grading system I felt like I worked less hard for this course than I wanted to. The sad truth is if I have 2 assignments that require my attention and one gets graded, I probably will invest less into the other one. Similar things apply to the readings we were supposed to do.",
    "Maybe at the beginning of the class students should be assigned peer mentor groups so that they could all support eachother through the journey. Discussion section would just be with the peer group so as to facilitate openness. Could be helpful for those of us that don't like talking about our feelings and fears in front of everyone in an auditorium.",
    "Mandatory attendance. The class discussions need help.",
    "Perhaps more individual feedback on written assignments?",
    "I would suggest the addition of more non-white folks. Also, I know it is Yale so we can pull in people with amazing biographies, but the addition of some smaller scale local heroes might make those careers seem more accessible. I feel like a major takeaway from the course is that you can't accomplish anything unless you build networks of power and money by ingratiating yourself to powerful people. It might be nice to see more emphasis on other pathways for those of us who are coming to Yale from a different context and perspective.",
    "It would have been tough, but it would have been great to get more involvement with the students and the lecturers.",
    "There were way too many old, white people - particularly men. It was inappropriate and a massive blind spot from a class design perspective. It really just felt like we were peering into an elite world of cronies who were just called off of someone's rolodex to speak as a favor. The main message I heard from the course was essentially \"If you want to be a leader, all you have to be is a rich, white person.\" I was baffled by the amount of privileged advice I heard throughout the course - advice that was completely divorced from the reality of today's economic conditions and the majority demographic of FES students. Of course it's easy to start a non-profit when you or your spouse is loaded and has access to powerful people (the take-home message of John Muir's success, Aldo Leopold's, Rachel Carson, etc.)",
    "I felt that the course poorly dealt with women in leadership positions. The found the fact that female leaders were relegated to a \"women's panel\" to be problematic. I felt that this structure created a space were their lives and accomplishments could only be examined in relation to their gender. In that class, unlike any of the other classes or male figure, was focused mostly on the personal lives and decisions that lead to their careers and there was very little opportunity to discuss with them their ideas in the field, their analysis of things that had happened and projections into the future. It was focused on their experience as women leaders. While this is an important conversation to have, when juxtaposed to the way that the male leaders and speakers were engaged with I found it sexist and limiting. I think that instead the course could have thought about leadership more holistically throughout the course. Gender should have been discussed throughout and speakers men and women should have been treated similarly. It is important to acknowledge and discuss why there were not as many female names early in movement and name that as exclusion and sexism. I also felt that other minorities were not well represented throughout the course and their absence was not acknowledge. In general I thought that the ideas presented around leadership, what it looks like, who can be a leader, were very narrow and traditional. It did not feel like there was much critical thought during the development of the class as to what leadership can look like, what it has traditionally be held up to be and what we might want it to look like.",
    "It would have been nice to have Dean Crane more involved. Frances did a great job leading discussions and giving lectures but I think the TF should not be the primary instructor for the course.",
    "I think this course may have been better as a half semester course.",
    "I think that taking a more purposeful trajectory through environmental leadership might be helpful. That is, decide what elements are critical in environmental leadership are critical and bring in speakers that address a different factor each week. The course as organized was great but it seemed a little haphazard in the sense that there didn't seem to be a direction - we got to hear from and about what makes an environmental leader but there didn't seem to be a coherent direction across the whole of the course. This is not a major complaint, just an idea for a different way of approaching the class.",
    "I found the presentations by guest speakers to feel somewhat disconnected from the assignments and small-group discussions. I think I benefited from these assignments and discussions more. As was noted by students several times throughout the course, there is a wide gulf between most of us and the people who presented to the class. Many of those people seem to be connected to wealth or privilege. Therefore, it's hard to use them as direct examples of inspiration for how we can live our lives (as reflected on by the assignments). Also, the speakers, for the most part, represent only a certain type of leadership - those people who are at the top of some hierarchy (institutional, cultural, etc.). I personally found this somewhat unsatisfying. I found more inspiration in the historic leaders of the class - Muir, Carson, etc. I feel as I mature that guest speakers \/ presenters are not very satisfying to me. I appreciate and grow much more from a better developed relationship with someone. Much of what is worth learning cannot be conveyed so simply as in a lecture - even books are more useful for impart this wisdom. I think this observation is particularly relevant for leadership, as a topic. Therefore, I think a string of guest speakers is worthwhile for a variety of reasons, but a deeper study and relationship with a single person might yield better results, if \"leadership\" from us as we go out into the world is the goal of the course. Even the historians who came to class were sometimes stretched to articulate in simple memes what made the leaders they study great - how can students do this with 20+ subjects (presenters, historic leaders) and not a lot of practical leadership experience of our own?",
    "I think a little more connection between each of the lectures. I want to hear less about speaker's specific organizations and more about their beliefs and experiences with leadership.",
    "A few presenters were less exciting (Barlow Rogers, the guy who spoke about Rachel Carson). I felt like a few presenters could have been a little more informed about their audience at FES (some made too many references to US politics which our international students probably won't know about). Next time, please add in more international figures! (I understand why this was difficult to do this fall).",
    "Things felt a bit disheveled at times, and I think that's likely a function of this being the first time this class was offered. It was also difficult to attend speakers\/class sessions that were not on Thursday at the scheduled time."

    "No discussion section. However, I will add that I found the discussions we did have to be useful. I wonder if it would be helpful in future classes to have a discussion session each week and take questions for the speaker from those conversations.",
    "Most of the discussions (small-group) were excellent and I commend Frances for facilitating them the way that she did. I found the format of the class did not encourage the full participation of the students. Videorecording and needing to use microphones may be good public speaking practice, but I know that I didn't feel like I had an environment for working on ideas and thoughts I might have. Simple Q & A with guest speakers really limits the types of ideas that can be conveyed. Small groups allows ideas to be fleshed out and developed by all of the students in involved.",

    "I don't think this course will be offered again.",
    "Don't bother with the course. Go to see the speakers whom you fill find interesting and try to find a group of like minded friends and or faculty mentors with whom to talk about leadership.",
    "Take it. The self exploration is important and effective.",
    "While this class may not be offered in the future, students who chose to participate this semester will have, without a doubt, a most unique experience on which to reflect about their own style of leadership, as well as how to mold their leadership careers inspired by some of the most prominent in our field.",
    "Take it! And be sure to do a bit of research on the speakers beforehand. I couldn't always find the time to do so since this is my fifth course, but I would've liked to devote more time to it if I could.",
    "Take it!",
    "Worth your while.",
    "Don't take the class. Just attend the speakers you'd like to see.",
    "worth taking but push the people structuring it to think more critically about what leadership is an looks like.",
    "It was disappointing that Dean Crane didn't play more of a role but regardless it is an class not to miss.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, all of the speakers may not be relevant to your experience and goals but the ones that are make the course definitely worth while.",
    "It's a great opportunity. Don't miss it. I took the class for one credit. I would advise others to take advantage of the three credit option if at all possible. I wish I could have done that myself.",
    "It's interesting, and not too much work. Add it onto a full schedule. The assignments were the best part - take them seriously.",
    "Take it. It doesn't require much time, but it valuable. But it's only valuable if you're willing to be introspective and spend the necessary time thinking about the issues raised in class. Not good for people who want to passively participate.",
    "DO IT.",
    "Just go in and have fun! It's a fascinating class, and don't be tackle difficult topics and share them with peers. Everyone is understanding and positive."
