   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in the Middle Ages, Indo-European or specifically Germanic languages and\/or culture and\/or literature, or someone who simply wants to read some great works in the original language and with a critical eye (I have in mind the Eddas).",
    "Extremely interesting course.Strengths:Incredible, passionate, inspiring professorEngaging course materialVikings!I can read Viking now.Assignments greatly contributed to understanding of medieval Icelandic culture in a way that was relevant to other fields of study (I chose to do my presentation related to what I was interested in\/studying)Weaknesses: A little more breadth could have improved the course perhaps. A bit less time on really specific words could be replaced with learning more about history and culture",
    "Good blend of linguistics, literature and culture. Strongly recommend.",
    "Take the class. Honestly. If you are looking at this class, take it. It's worth it. Also the only book that's really necessary is Gordon, you can find most of the sagas online.",
    "By the end of this class, you will know how to read Old Norse with an extensive glossary and understand basics of grammar. It is exciting by the end when you go back over old assignments and realize you can sight translate them. Old Norse is also surprisingly less dead than you think it would be; modern Icelandic has changed surprisingly little in the near-millenium between now and the Viking Age, and many Scandinavian languages except for Finnish have similar vocab and grammar as Old Norse. This class is definitely a lot of work, and I spent an average of 10 hours a week on translations and review. Although it's listed as an English class, a lot of people with linguistics backgrounds took the class, and there was an obvious gap in skilllevel that made me insecure to chime in during discussion at times. Regardless, I feel like I learned a lot and it was refreshing to take an English class based on translation rather than reading. The instructor is terrific and I couldn't have imagined going on this journey with anyone else!",
    "Old Norse is a fascinating course and I would definitely recommend it. If you take it, you will read Old Norse literature (think sagas and poetry about Vikings and Icelanders) and gain a reading knowledge of Old Norse. Prof. Frank is an absolute dear. Be prepared, though, for a steep learning curve and lots of translation work from week to week. If you put in effort in the beginning it will pay off GREATLY by the end of the semester.",
    "It's quite straightforward - if learning to read Old Norse (specifically, Old Icelandic) sounds like fun to you, take this class! As a classics\/language person, I loved the idea of learning Old Norse and was fairly well prepared for the syntactic complexities of the language. Then again, ''hefir hverr til sins agaetis nokkut.''The texts that we read are also very interesting and fun - who knew the Icelandic were so prolific? You'll read first-hand accounts of the Viking discovery of America, descriptions of Ragnarok, and tales of feuding Icelandic families.One warning about this class: the people who tend to take this class tend to be really intense linguistics majors, Tolkienites, and Teutonophiles. But Professor Frank is wonderful and very nice to everybody, especially those who are having trouble. One piece of advice: if you take this class, don't worry too much about buying the translations, but make sure to prepare for each class by consulting English translations online and doing line-by-line translations on your own. It's all the preparation you'll need for the quizzes.",
    "If you're interested in languages or pre-modern Europe, a must.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Frank is simply wonderful. The Old Norse texts are extremely interesting as well.",
    "SO GOOD!! Easy, fun, and relaxing way to learn a fascinating language from a truly wonderful professor who is the nicest person ever and knows so much. TAKE IT.",
    "Yes definitely, especially if you're interested in languages. Previous knowledge of declensions is helpful but not necessary. Professor Frank is excellent and I loved this class.",
    "This is a really fun and interesting class; definitely take it if you can. If you're familiar with a few Germanic languages the language won't give you too much trouble, but you should spend a good amount of time early on learning the language either way so you can enjoy reading the stories instead of getting bogged down in the translations."
