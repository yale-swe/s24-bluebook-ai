    "I would recommend French 110, especially with Hoffmann, if you actually want to learn French. If you are looking to satisfy the language requirement with a gut, take a look at Indonesian or Ancient Egyptian.",
    "French 110 is an intensive course, with much greater work than other classes. But if you're serious about learning French, then that's expected because you really will learn so much within a short amount of time (e.g., you have an exam every week!). I would recommend Prof. Hoffmann, who is great, if you have to or don't mind being in the earliest section.",
    "A very rewarding class but prepared to spend a tremendous amount of time in it.",
    "Fast-paced, difficult, big time commitment but worth it!"
