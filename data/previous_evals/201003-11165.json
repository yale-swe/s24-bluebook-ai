    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about democracy and democracy promotion.This course offers a good general history of democracy promotion, primarily from a U.S. perspective. The course will give you a clear understanding of the varying theories that organizations, individuals and countries use to rationalize democracy promotion, and give you the opportunity to understand the various controversies surrounding the practice of promoting democracy (both in receptive and non-receptive countries)."
