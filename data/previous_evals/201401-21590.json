   "comments": [
    "Research for credit, with a presentation and paper at the end if it's your senior project. Definitely one of my best experiences at Yale, so take the time to find a lab whose work interests you!",
    "It is what you make of it",
    "Research for credit\/senior thesis. The experience you have really is dependent on the lab you are in\/the time and effort that you choose put into your project. For seniors, you basically have to do both a presentation and a paper rather than one or the other. Presentations are very relaxed, though you'll probably end up only staying for the presentations from people within your track.",
    "I would recommend taking this class especially if you want to go to graduate school for engineering. The out of lab requirements were not very difficult.",
    "Senior project for BME. Pretty straightforward. Non-lab work consists of a midterm progress report, final presentation, and final paper.",
    "This course is the senior BME research requirement.",
    "You have to take this if you're a senior BME. Start your project early!",
    "I thought the course was very informative of what it would be like to work in academia. It gives you a taste of what it's like to work on your own project and how you have to deal with different problems that crop up along the way. However, depending on your project it may require a lot of time in lab. Therefore, I advise students to careful consider the other courses you are taking so you don't feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Take it if you are willing to put the time in. 10 hours a week is the bare minimum, but to accomplish something and have enough material for the report or presentation at the end will require more like 15 or even 20 hours a week."
