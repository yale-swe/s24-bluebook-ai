    "If you're an art history major, you have no choice. This class has distinct merits--it teaches you the basic foundations of art history and introduces you to the principal writers in art history (many of whom you should have already read, but many of whom people in the class had strangely never heard of?). The reward of this class really depends on the students who take it, regardless of structure. This semester's make-up often left a stagnated conversation in which only three people engaged. Other comments seemed designed as a performance for the professor more than an engagement with one another's ideas. I just felt like discussion never progressed anywhere, which was extremely frustrating. It felt as though people were unwilling--or perhaps unable--to actually engage critically.",
    "Yes, to an art history student, take it with Prof. Nelson!",
    "Yes! This class was one of the best I've taken at Yale. It is a small seminar that you get to interact very closely with the professor and other classmates. Also, writing essay every week on different perspective is very interesting.",
    "It's required, so there is not much option. Take is junior year though. It's really annoying when you have a bunch of seniors who've already written their theses. It destroys the playing field. Be kind if you are thinking about postponing to senior year, don't do it. Spare your fellow juniors."
