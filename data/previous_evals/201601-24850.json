    "Please take this course and carefully think about the narratives and theory with which you engage. Try to imagine a world in which these live experiences are VALID, and indigenous peoples across the world are recognized and respected. This course is so necessary, the readings are on point, and you make the discussion.",
    "indigenous feminisms was a spectacular class that created an affirming space to learn about contemporary indigenous issues. i had several breakthroughs in this class, especially re: victim-centered justice, incommensurability (contrasting but not necessarily contradicting frameworks), & the nature of truth (there is no universal\/higher truth). the syllabus is purposefully global, & centers women's knowledge productions. tyler was an amazing facilitator who always valued our contributions. our conversations were so rich & have honestly changed the way i see & relate to other people. i really appreciated that he recognized & thanked us often for our engagement, especially with intellectually\/emotionally difficult material. there were weekly reading responses & three written assignments (3, 5, & 8 pages - defining theory, analyzing a primary text, & creating\/analyzing a knowledge archive).",
    "It's a great class in which you discuss many of the issues in Indian Country and I would 10 out of 10 recommend to a fellow student.",
    "I would definitely recommend Indigenous Feminisms because it will help you to understand how to decolonize spaces and ways of researching. You will also learn about Native cultures, peoples, and life ways.",
    "Absolutely! This class provides a foundation into the realm of indigenous feminisms while also providing historical context and community-based works to give an accurate picture of what indigenous feminisms are or might be. The texts push the reader intellectually, but are wholly accessible and demand a close reading. This class would be great for an experienced student with a background in indigeneity or gender, but also for someone who would like to begin their exploration of these topics!",
    "This class is a mix of heavy theory at first by indigenous and woc feminists and then afterwards we have a mix of diverse units that demonstrate how feminism affects so many elements of society from the environment to the prison system.",
    "This was a fantastic course, but will not be taught again since Tyler will be finishing his Ph.D soon. Yale should commit itself to creating more courses like it.",
    "Indigenous Feminisms is a necessary course for anyone wanting to engage with the world more critically. A must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially for those interested in Native Studies or WGSS, but also for anyone. The ideas and material are highly accessible and relevant. We read about a book a week, or the equivalent in a combo of shorter readings, write a reading response due the day before class, and discuss in class. There were three papers: one of feminist epistemology and theorizing, one on a primary source, one final on an indigenous feminist archive.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU GET IN. This is one of my favorite classes at Yale and we need a lot more of these. It was an absolutely fantastic class that taught a history usually silenced or ignored. IT encourages you to think outside the box, outside W. standards of academic, and to explore epistemologies of Indigenous women. It's also an amazing class to take if you're looking for ways to expand your feminism.",
    "Great, interesting class. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend since there are so little Native studies classes at Yale and it is important that students' education contain these.",
    "This class is hugely refreshing in that it centers autobiography and first-person accounts, rather than relying strictly on scholarly reports from \"experts,\" etc. It was accessible and interesting to me as a non-Native person and someone who wasn't already well-versed in WGSS vocabularies. Tyler is an excellent teacher. If you don't end up taking this class, still take a class in WGSS before you graduate. Take ten. Insist that more classes like this be offered. This campus will be a better place for it."
