    "I think that the material covered in this class was a bit advanced for having the MLA requirements however, the abilities in the class varied and the help from the professor was key in the students understanding the material. In the end, I think that although the students who may have been farther behind had to put in a lot of work, it paid off. Although I said the workload is heavy, the class is fast paced and the overall class is difficult, I think that I learned a lot. I do hope, that the amount of work could be parred down just a but in all three areas (workload, pace, and difficulty) because students do have other strenuous classes. I would recommend this class to other students if they are interested in learning the grammar of Arabic and are interested in translating texts. I found that the texts translated in class to be very fun and interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it deepens your knowledge of Arabic grammar.",
    "A great class for those that want to learn classical arabic and those that want help with deeply understanding Arabic grammar, definitely a course which should always be on offer"
