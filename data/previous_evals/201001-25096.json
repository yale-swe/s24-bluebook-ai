   "comments": [
    "The experiments are much more interesting than in 205, but the lab writeups can be tedious and long. But lack of a practical is a breath of relief when finals week comes around.",
    "Take it if you must, it's not bad.",
    "Obviously, you would only take it if required. It is much cooler than PHYS 205 and the 165\/166 series.It is a lot of work though since you need to write long lab reports 9 times over.",
    "Great lab if you can find a good partner, though the report take a really long time. There weren't any super-tough labs, though some are easier to write-up than others.",
    "Extremely boring and completely useless. A waste of 4 hours each week. Definitely better than 205, but still horrible.",
    "Much better than 205L. Lab reports can be time consuming, start on them early! Pick a lab partner you like, you will spend a lot of time together.",
    "it's a good second level lab class. try it out!",
    "Better than 205, except for the take-home reports.",
    "It's required, so you don't have much choice. The experiments are more interesting than 205, but the lab reports can be very tedious and time consuming with the error analysis. The grading of the lab reports seemed pretty arbitrary, and it's hard to tell what's expected.",
    "Take if necessary, and if you do take it DONT DO CIRCUIT LABS THEY WILL RUIN YOU.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. The labs are really interesting and you will learn a ton. Do ask around to see what labs you should choose though (some of them are way better than others). Also make sure you get a good lab partner so that you can divide up the work.",
    "Physics 206 lab is very different from Physics 205 lab, and it's a lot more fun! The experiments you have to choose from are almost all very exciting (Millikan's oil drop experiment, X-ray diffraction, nuclear scattering...), and you get to choose which labs you want to do, which is really great! Unlike in 205L, you actually have to go home and write a lab report every week, but it's not bad at all - also there's no practical at the end, and there are two built-in free weeks.",
    "If you're considering taking it, you probably need to. Either way, it's a really good class, and it's way better than the first semester. You do have to write reports outside of lab, but they are really easy.",
    "The class itself is quite well-organized and very interesting... if your experiments go well. I would advise that you look at the TAs beforehand, as their degrees of chill-ness and knowledge could either greatly reduce or increase your stress levels regarding this class.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to. It's a ton of work (unless you can write lab reports easily without actually understanding what's going on, which I can't do). You have a lab report every week, and it can take tons of time to decipher what's going on physically in order to explain the results. I pulled more all-nighters for this class than for any other class I've taken at Yale. If you have to do it, avoid circuit labs at all cost because they are the hardest to figure out and take the longest. By the end I feel like I understood circuits much better, but I don't know that the struggle was worth it.",
    "Although this class was fairly demanding, with 7-9 large experimental writeups, I found this lab to be reasonably interesting and educational. The flexibility in picking labs and working independently is quite nice. Additionally, the absence of homework, pre-lab quizzes, and other annoyingly graded lab hocus-pocus left more time to focus on the lab reports and the experiments themselves, which were quite interesting. Electric field plotting is super easy and not too exciting. The particle accelerator one was definitely the most difficult I did. I would recommend many of the fundamental particle\/electron\/x-ray type labs and stay always from electricity if possible.",
    "This is a very cool course - most of the experiments are fun to conduct (including one where you play around with a particle accelerator), and you can choose which labs you'd like to do for the course. The lab reports do, however, take up a good chunk of time, so beware, but they are what you make of them.",
    "Get a good TA and you'll be fine. I recommend Ana Malagon.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, do it. A great course, and it offers some flexibility and you learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking 206. That said, the lab report due every week can be a lot of work for some students. Outside of doing the labs, which lasted from 1.5 3.5 hours, I normally spent a couple hours working with my parter on analyzing our data, and then a little under two hours writing the report. Some people definitely spent wayyyy longer on their reports, but I didn't find that necessary. You definitely learn all the concepts really well and the labs are usually a lot of fun to do, and pretty cool. It's also pretty sweet that your partner and you usually have a room to yourself, which is pretty relaxing. I hear 163 is pretty brutal, so if you have the physics\/math background (I took 200, then started 201 and dropped to 181), I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Physics 206 is a bit different from 205. The lab reports can be challenging to write sometimes, but the labs tend to be less tedious than the ones in 205. I would recommend that 206 be taken if you bothered to take 205.",
    "This is a really random collection of experiments--some of them are cool, like using a particle accelerator, while some of them are just odd, like Kater's pendulum. Also, you actually have to do lab reports for this half of the 200 lab series."
