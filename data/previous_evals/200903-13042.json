I thought the choice of lecturers was very well done, and I also appreciated the opportunity to be introduced to a wide variety of issues. The lectures are not by nature linear or cohesive; rather, they are a collection of the most pressing issues from across the field. Definitely a worthwhile way to spend an hour each week!"
