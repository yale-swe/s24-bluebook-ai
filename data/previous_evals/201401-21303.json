    "It's research for credit. It's what you make of it. I had a topic I found really interesting so I enjoyed it and learnt a lot.",
    "I worked in Professor Reed's lab for my project trying to make a meter system for a device he had invented. It was a great experience because it allowed me the freedom to be creative and investigate a certain device using the concepts I had learned in previous engineering courses. If you are a science or engineering major, I would highly recommend doing research during your time here at Yale.",
    "Yes",
    "Very good class if you have an idea that you want to pursue. Make sure you pick a good advisor, as this makes all the difference in how much work is expected of you and how much independence you'll have. In general, didn't require too much work or time."
