    "The senior project for MB&B is different from the other sciences: you write a review paper of a field rather than a research report. It is an interesting way to learn about several different fields in science, since everyone presents their paper to each other at the end of the semester.",
    "MB&B490 is the required senior project for MB&B students. You write a 4,000 word essay and give a 15 minute powerpoint presentation on any topic of interest in biochemistry.",
    "This is a straightforward course. You have to write a literature review of a topic that you choose in collaboration with your advisor. It's a good experience, and will serve you well for future science writing. You have to take it, so it doesn't matter if I recommend it or not.",
    "Required class. Little\/no guidance this year.",
    "You have to take it if you're an MB&B major. Don't expect a lot of support or guidance on your paper.",
    "This is weird - it doesn't really feel like the capstone to my MB&B experience, probably because it has little to nothing to do with the research you do. It's a 15ish-page literature review, which you can put as much or as little work into as you like, but it doesn't feel any different than a seminar paper. It wasn't very well organized, which is too bad, because with more involved and caring faculty, it would've at least felt rewarding to do. Oh well, ya gotta take it. I just hope that you get a good, caring, excited advisor.",
    "If you are an MB&B major, you are required to take this course. It isn't too much work - pretty much just a literature review of some area of interest to you.",
    "The MB&B senior essay is a weird one...you get very little guidance and very little sense of importance or accomplishment is assigned to the project. You make it what you want."
