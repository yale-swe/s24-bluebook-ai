    "Generated more intellectual curiosity into how human beings interact with their environment, and specifically how this can be used as a different lens into understanding humans.",
    "Not applicable since I'm not a graduate student (regarding the part about dissertation\/research) - but in terms of learning more about MMES, definitely, since I had no knowledge of environmental issues in the region at all beforehand.",
    "Hearing from a broad spectrum of people doing work in Middle East Studies now is of course tremendously useful to get a sense of where contemporary research is and is heading. The readings and some of the ideas in the discussions have been very helpful for thinking about my research going forward."
