    "Comparisons of colonialisms across the British Empire. Some South East Asian studies, and some Black studies, including literature and theory.",
    "So so much. This class fundamentally changed the way I interact with and think about the world. Hard to even begin describing it. Gives a powerful framework for thinking about category across time and space. Introducing new political modes of thinking about identity and solidarity."

    "Yes. It is critical. Professor Grewal and Professor Carby are totally brilliant, but more than that, they actually act on the ideas and theory they read and develop. Really inspiring people.",
    "Yes; if you are interested in thinking critically about race or caste and especially both, this is the best thing you can do for yourself."
