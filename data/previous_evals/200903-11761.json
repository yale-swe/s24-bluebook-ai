   "comments": [
    "This is a very basic introduction to chemical engineering expanding on the basic process throughout the semester.",
    "All Chem E majors have to take it anyway. it's applications of chemistry to real life applications, so if that's what you're looking for, take it. problem sets do take quite a while, especially at the end of the semester.",
    "CENG 210 is an intro course for the Chem Engineering major. The problem sets are very tough, and the exams are varied; the first was easy, the second very hard. It also involves a final video project that allows students to explore the field of chemical engineering. Dr. Taylor isn't a good lecturer, but he makes up for it by really caring about his students. He adjusted his style after we gave him feedback at the middle of the semester, which I really appreciated. The midterms are manageable. The material itself isn't that hard, but the questions that can be asked from it can get very complex. If you're thinking about doing Chem Eng or Environmental Eng, takeit.",
    "Do not take it cuz it's a bad class. If you have to, sorry.",
    "This is a horrible class. Most people who are taking this class are taking it so they have to for chemical engineering. So stick with it; other engineering classes are much better. Don't lose hope in chemical engineering from this class!",
    "CENG 210 teaches you that 1) input = output (for materials and energy) 2) a bunch of gas laws 3) a systematic way of solving problems.If you have to take it then you should take it, but I don't see why non ChemE or EnvE majors would take it.",
    "Intro to chemical engineering. It a good way to learn more about the major and life after the major. You have to take it if you want to be a chem\/environmental engineer...so take it, haha.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is sure that he or she is majoring in chemical engineering.",
    "Recommend to a chem E major or perspective major. After taking this class and talking w other classmates, I think that this class is a very good diagnostic to see if you are interested in chemical engineering and would like to pursue it.",
    "Don't take it! But you're probably only reading this since it's a required class and you have no option but to take it. Well the problem sets SUCK and both the professor and the TA don't know how to solve those problems without looking at the solutions. They take hours and the book is REALLY REALLY badly written. Basically this is going to be a pretty boring class."
