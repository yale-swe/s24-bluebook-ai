   "comments": [
    "Professor Garfinkel is very enthusiastic about the material and genuinely cares about each student. He is the nicest person ever and you should definitely take this course.",
    "Yes! (But, of course, you should be prepared that this is a law class first, and an education class second.) The material is interesting, and any class with Professor Garfinkel is worth your time! You'll learn a lot, but in a relatively low-stress environment. Additional plus: You submit assignments on topic of your choosing and at your own pace -- a great way to keep your schedule balanced throughout the year.",
    "If you are interested in the intersection of education and law, this is the course for you. Also, if you are simply interested in law, you should definitely take this course. The workload is manageable if you don't procrastinate and plan ahead.",
    "An introduction to American Education Law.",
    "A gem. Must take if you can take it.",
    "Even if you don't know much about law (like me), it's a class that you will be able to keep up with. Just read, and ask questions. Law lingo will start making sense, and you'll begin to see patterns in legislation debates.",
    "EDST 230 has a lot of potential as a course, but it falls short in terms of discussion. The work load is very manageable: interesting readings, and 25 pages to be written at any point in the semester (note: do not take this course if you need hard deadlines for motivation; you won't get them, and that caught up with some students at the end of the term). The discussion sometimes lags, and this class tends to attract a very bright-eyed-future-lawyer type of student, which generates a very particular kind of seminar environment. Overall, the class is not very stressful, and you will learn what you personally need to based on the readings, and some weeks will be fantastic, while others will be ho-hum. Kind of hit-or-miss week by week, but generally a solid course.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone interested in education and\/or law. The class primarily involves reading and discussing really interesting court cases that revolve around controversies in education (things like free speech, religious rights, bulling, ect). Professor Garfinkel is great, and the workload is VERY manageable - you literally just need to write 25 pages worth of reading responses before the last day of finals period.",
    "Great survey course in Ed. Law. Take it if you're interested in the field and as a bonus you get to take a class with a US magistrate judge!",
    "Judge Garfinkel is a treasure, and I'm very glad I took this course. He chose a terrific casebook this year, and he guided us through each difficult problem easily. He's a teacher with a real personality, and he's the kindest person ever, so he lets you approach the assignments on your own terms. You'll get as much out of the course as you put in; it's worth learning from Judge Garfinkel. Learn from him as much as you can!",
    "I learned a lot from this class. It might be a little misleading to say that students don't need some prior knowledge of the law, since discussion tended to be dominated by the few who did. However, their comments were very educational for everyone else, so it's still a win. Professor Garfinkel is incredibly encouraging and sweet, and he brings up really good questions that get everyone engaged. He brings in many guest speakers who offer really interesting insight from their positions within the field. The flexibility of the writing assignments in this class is a huge plus--as long as you know how to manage your time well. Don't leave it all for the end of the semester!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in law or education and social studies. This course provides a great background for how the law and education practice intersect.",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic class! It's unique first of all in its format -- we discussed cases and readings from an Education casebook every week, and we discussed and debated hypothetical judicial problems among diverse perspectives, with a District Judge as our moderator! More importantly, perhaps, is that the only requirement other than class participation is that you submit 25 pages of writing by the end of the semester, in whatever format you like. This was both a blessing and a curse of the best kind -- it was nice to have such an open-ended chance for academic exploration, but for a procrastinator like me, that was also a curse, not to mention I had zero idea what kind of rubric Professor Garfinkel was using to grade anything. The reason I recommend taking this class, other than its unique format, Professor Garfinkel (who is fantastic), and its exciting content, is overall the PEOPLE. Everyone in this seminar is coming from different perspectives, whether direct-hands on teaching experience or purely legal experience or something in between. Conversation was never dull. Highly recommended!",
    "A fantastic course -- Professor Garfinkel is the best.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Education and the law highlights some of the most interesting and important constitutional cases, while also touching on fascinating legislation and school district practices. Schools are fertile ground for litigation and in many ways central to civil rights battles in the 21st century. The course's material is terrific for anyone interested in law, education, or the role of schools in modern society. Professor Garfinkel is an outstanding teacher. Even if you're not drawn to the course's subject matter, take the class just for him. He is extraordinarily knowledgeable, adept at conveying important insights, and knows how to run a really good Yale seminar. He is also an extremely kind and likable person, who I was delighted to spend two hours with every week. The work for the class is unusually flexible, and most students got much more value out of these assignments than normal, since they enable you to choose the type of paper, length, and subject matter you are most interested in writing on. Overall, this is a fantastic class taught by a stellar professor. I cannot recommend it enough.",
    "EDST 230 is a very laid back class. It allows you to learn at your own pace. DO NOT let yourself fall behind on the papers or else you will be miserable. But otherwise, if you are interested in understanding the constitutional complexities implicit in Education, then this class is for you. If you do all the readings and take the time to digest them and discuss them, then you will get so much out of this class. What you get out of it is contingent on what you put into it."
