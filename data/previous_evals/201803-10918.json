   "comments": [
    "I think this course would have been better if it was not taught by three separate professors. That resulted in three very different portions of the class with little cohesion among them. Certain parts of the course I thought were very useful, but others weren't, and I was not left with any confidence that I understand the field of Public Finance.",
    "The course provides a good combination of theory, application and exercises",
    "The main advantage of this course is that it covers many topics in public finance, both theoretically and empirically. The main weakness of this course is that the computational part of the course is small, relative to the topics that are covered.",
    "Cormac's third of the course was great, unfortunately it was only a third of the course. The other two instructors for the course, Aleh Tsyvinski and Nicolas Werquin, are not listed on the course evaluation. The three sections were disjoint and no syllabus was provided for the course. The first third of the course was completely disorganized and came off as unplanned. I will abstain from answering likert scale questions since only Cormac is listed as the instructor and his section of the course was not at fault.",
    "Cormac and Nick's parts of the course were very useful but Aleh's was not."

    "Yes",
    "very practical and helpful class for dynamic programming.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to another student because it covers many topics in public finance both theoretically and empirically.",
    "I would audit the parts of this course taught by faculty members who care and are interested in teaching it, like Cormac. I think 6 people were in the room for the first part of the course, and when Cormac lectured the class size nearly tripled."
