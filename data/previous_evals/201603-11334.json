   "comments": [
    "I earned a basic and broad knowledge of music theory, composition, and musical styles.",
    "I definitely learned more about the structure of pieces and how notes and rhythms fit together to create large musical constructions",
    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of basic music theory (as the course promised). I gained some additional ability to read music better, both melodically and rhythmically. Importantly, I learned that one must understand the rules in order to break them, but boy is it important\/fun to break them (something I realize I now want to do more after taking the course). I definitely grew to understand and perceive music in a different light, more analytical and structural, which didn't take away from the intangible, sentimental quality of it, but rather offered some explanations and logic for it.",
    "MUSI 110 got me from 0 to 100 in Music Theory in less than 4 months! It is wonderfully organised: each lecture teaches you many new concepts, and throughout the course you'll have a better understanding of why music works the way it does. The course focuses on harmonic analysis and basic composing techniques during its second half (after covering the basics during the first half), and for me both were equally helpful and exciting. I came in with absolutely no background (never played anything, never studied music), and MUSI 110 was a bit fast, but certainly ideal for me.",
    "I learned how to read music and analyze harmonic relationships and melodic relationship between music. This included the creation of chord construction, cadences, voice leading, etc. It helped learn how music was constructed at each moment and how it developed in time. We learned a classical western structure but the class also covered the modes means and reasons behinds other scales apart from the western chromatic scale. We also learned about song structure in its typical pattern.",
    "I learned a lot about basic music theories and skills in piece analysis and composition. Very good lesson for beginners."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I don't think the course had any weaknesses, though this is coming from someone who already had a basic grasp of music theory, so maybe it was more challenging for others. I thought it was well-taught, with a fair workload, and I learned a lot.",
    "It was definitely an interesting class with lots of relevant information, but the course moved incredibly quickly. By the end we were composing which seems a huge leap from learning how to read notes in the beginning of the year.",
    "For my section, in general, I wished we had moved a bit faster (though I recognize that I come from a different, arguably more advanced music background than a majority of the students) but I do think we covered a lot (which is good). A weakness might be the laxity and easygoingness with which the class was conducted; I wished the professor might have pushed the students a bit more, more rigorously with short in-class assignments. For some reason, despite all covered, I feel like there was more I wanted to learn, or rather more I thought we could've learned. One important thing I'd like to mention concerns the cost of the textbook\/exercise book, which was $99. Despite the quality of the book (which was, to be honest, good\/decent), that amount of money, particularly for students on financial aid or with a low income background, is very steep, and should be subsidized by the college if at all possible.",
    "Small class setting enables the teacher to interact with each student pretty well. Very serious and responsible teacher. I think the textbook of this course is not so good. The textbook is supposed to supplement the teacher, however, this textbook barely tells nothing. Instead, it has a lot of exercises. I think the textbook could be improved."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if someone wanted to take an introduction to music theory, I would probably recommend this particular section, because the professor was great.",
    "YES. If you're interested in any music theory or learning about music, then take this course. You will be moving at a fast pace - the first class, you're learning about note lengths; the second to last class, you'll be presenting a piece you composed. That being said, it's totally worth it and I learned so much. However, it being a fast paced class means that there's a lot of work - there will be work due every single class unless you're working on a composition or performance project. If you can handle it, totally do it then. It's really fun and there's so much support to make sure you do the best you can - whether you take that support to do your best is up to you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student on the condition that the person learning had very limited knowledge of music theory before. Students who have been studying music for awhile but not thoroughly practiced theory might honestly be better off buying a practice\/exercise book and learning on their own, then trying to place into 210 or a course in between (what happened to MUSI 205 this year?). It was a very comprehensive, solid class overall, and I would recommend it.",
    "This a great course for someone who wants a formal introduction to music. it teaches you the very building blocks of music and builds on those building blocks from the ground up. Very logical at first but a creative intuition comes in soon with lots of application clearly palpable with its use found in music in daily life. Great course.",
    "Strongly recommend only if the student is highly interested in studying music. Otherwise, the high workload of this course may cause a challenge to your time management."
