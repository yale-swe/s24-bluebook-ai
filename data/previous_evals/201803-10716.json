   "comments": [
    "Professor Purdy Moudarres offers excellent feedback with respect to how to conduct a close reading and execute a literary paper.",
    "I learned how to properly close read and write a solid analytical paper.",
    "I learned many more of the classic books of the Western canon.",
    "I was able to read a large number of fantastic and significant books, and the chronological structure of the course enhanced the reading by making apparent connections between texts and changes over time. Also, my writing and analytical skills improved, as did my ability to read and synthesize a great deal of text.",
    "This course taught me how to write - not just in terms of structure or technique (although Christiana is fantastic at all of this), but really about zooming in on specific ideas and insights. I learned how to accurately capture and develop tricky or uncertain ideas from the text. Although the nature of DS is that the survey of all the different texts can be superficial, the course nonetheless focused on some fascinating parts of the text that I didn't know before. The lessons on the Bible and the Oresteia were particularly fantastic.",
    "It was a great overview of important foundational works in the Western canon. The coursework was nicely balanced between close readings of isolated texts and comparative studies of common themes or motifs between texts, and there was a lot to be gleaned from both.",
    "Directed Studies Literature covered a wide breadth of Western works of literature, spanning from Homer's Iliad to Virgil's Aeneid to Dante's Inferno, covering not only epic poetry, but also lyric poetry and several books from the Old and New Testaments. Beyond the vast array of content, Directed Studies Literature's demanding pace and reading load taught me how to read quickly and effectively. I also learned to close-read, a vital skill to any reading assignment. The weekly 5-page paper taught me how to write clearly and concisely. The 15-person seminar setting is very instrumental to my learning; it allowed our class to converse about both the book at hand and the human experience. I feel much more confident about my writing, reading and speaking skills through DS.",
    "I learned how to do a close reading of a text and realized that literary analysis should not necessarily be about sweeping themes; sometimes the most meaningful analysis comes for an extremely specific question from one line of text. My writing, particularly my use of quotations, improved. Also, my engagement with class discussion improved. I learned to listen to my peers, rather than dominate the conversation.",
    "I learned how to write an analysis paper and do a close reading of specific parts of text",
    "Close reading and the intersection between all three subjects in literature.",
    "I learned a huge amount in this class, from essay writing to articulating my ideas. I was really excited by the vast amounts of material we covered and am extremely pleased by the depth we managed to go into while moving through these great works so quickly. I had never studied most of the material before and the ways in which the texts built on previous works (e.g. Ovid and Virgil coming together in Dante) gave me a really rich and exciting understanding of these books.",
    "I learned that my love of literature can be expanded by a fun class. The material is great, but it was presented in an engaging way that I will cherish forever."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it was an overall strong course. I think the choice of books could be improved, but overall it was good.",
    "Less reading overall, and more discussion on important books such as the Iliad and Odyssey. I loved class discussions.",
    "I thought that this course was wonderful! The range of texts was enjoyable, and being able to look at the works all together was particularly interesting; it was possible to, say, compare Odysseus across four different texts, something another course probably could not offer. I don't have any significant criticism to offer; of course, more time to discuss each text would be ideal, but the nature of DS limits such time.",
    "I think this course is helpful for anyone who is remotely interested in the western canon. Although it's just a survey and does not focus on any particular text at length, this breadth of coverage (together with its address of key themes and ideas across texts) helps you to understand the development of the western canon and its broad themes\/ideas, in a way that you may not necessarily get as a casual reader. However, it is still a survey and there were moments (no fault of the instructor of course) when the inbuilt superficiality of the course was a little frustrating, especially in encountering texts that were super fascinating - there wasn't much space to linger on issues at length, but that is the nature of DS and I think it's a flaw that students have to balance with their interest in the scope of the syllabus.",
    "The greatest strengths to DS Literature is the way in which it prepares you for a comprehensive education. DS teaches us how to question, converse, discuss, argue and communicate with other humans through an examination of past human experiences. In Literature, we see how different authors have incorporated similar themes into their works, and how they have answered the central DS question: \"What makes us human?\" The greatest weakness, which speaks to DS in general, is the fact that despite the expansive breadth of content, there is very little depth. We spend only two 75-minute seminars discussing hundreds of pages of text per week; the amount of class time does not effectively correspond to the amount of reading assigned.",
    "There are no weaknesses to this class. The material, the class dynamic, and the professor were all wonderful. The material of this course made it my favorite of the DS curriculum. The mythical and heroic narratives we read are engaging from both an intellectual and non-intellectual standpoint. The fact that the narratives were both so captivating and so meaningful made the course even better. The books we read in literature really do span every theme you can think of, and my class managed to cover themes from heroism to family conflict to religion. A particular strength of this class was our reading of the Divine Comedy, but this is mostly because Christiana is just so knowledgable on this topic. Also, the weekly reader responses and class led discussions really helped cement my understanding of the texts we read, and I really like the opportunity to become a mini expert on a passage of my choosing.",
    "By far the greatest strength of this class was the time spent in seminar. Through the sharing of weekly reading responses on canvas, having a student start the discussion with comments and questions on an element of the text that genuinely interested them, and the overall collaborative and supportive environment our professor fostered, our seminar discussions were wonderful and something I looked forward to. Another strength of this class was the selection of works we read. They seemed to have a nice flow and matched up nicely with what was being read in the other DS classes.",
    "I found the essay prompts interesting and varied, which made the process of writing papers quite enjoyable and really allowed me to explore an aspect of the text that intrigued me. The range of prompts we got for each paper was definitely a strength of this course for me. I also really liked how we spent a lot of time looking at recurring themes throughout the texts (e.g. kleos\/nostos, fathers and sons, physis\/nomos) which not only helped me see the connections between the works but also made the final exam less stressful to prepare for.",
    "Honestly, there was nothing that really stands out as bad. I enjoyed the way the class was run, and I also enjoyed going to it each and every day."

    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes! It was a fun course and we got to read a lot of interesting books and discuss with some great minds.",
    "Yes. It is a great chance to learn about some great texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The books are fantastic, and Christiana is an amazing professor. Literature is my favorite class at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes, a thousand times yes. Literature was the best and most fun of all the DS sections for me, and Professor Purdy Moudarres is phenomenal. It's a lot of literature in a short time, so it's really about finding that golden mean between depth and breadth, but I felt we were having profound and critical discussion every section. It's a survey course that leaves you with a hunger to study many of the works more in depth, and I think that's the best kind of success for a course of its kind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies to anyone at Yale. It is such a fundamental part of education; reading and writing skills dramatically improve throughout the course, and the sheer amount of knowledge gained is incredible. This program prepares future leaders for any career, as any career involves conversing with other human beings about problem solving-- the essence of DS.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! This was my favorite DS course not only because the reading was absolutely captivating but because Christiana was so engaging and my class dynamic was wonderful.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and the discussions were very interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend!",
    "Yes, definitely. I found the atmosphere in class to be extremely conducive to learning - a comforting environment in which to share my ideas and interact with others while also being intellectually challenging. I found it to be my most enjoyable seminar and really managed to find my voice in this class.",
    "Absolutely. This class is fun and not dry like other DS sections. Christiana makes each class exciting."
