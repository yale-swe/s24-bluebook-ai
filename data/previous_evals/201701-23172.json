    "Great knowledge on how to conduct randomized field experiments in the social sciences! Also how to conduct statistical analysis in R.",

    "Very useful class for research design. Learned all of the important steps to take when conducting experiments to ensure that results are precise and as accurate as possible.",
    "Great coding experience.",
    "How to read, understand and criticize political science research. What an experiment is and how to effectively construct one.",

    "GREAT course. The combination of theory, coding, and analyzing papers in class discussion was awesome and great for learning! Can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "The only thing that I think could be improved was starting on the practicuum a bit earlier. It started to feel rushed and the work really accumulated the last couple of weeks.",

    "A fantastic way to satisfy the research requirement for Global in a way that is fascinating and above all, USEFUL!!! Professor Coppock is incredible. I never thought it'd be possible to make the theory behind randomized field experiments and conducting statistical analysis in R so much fun. Left the course feeling like I can understand how to evaluate programs much better. Great class overall!",
    "100% I would recommend this course to any political science major. You'll learn a practical skill (R) as well as a framework for thinking about relationships and events in the world that you'll be able to take with you forever.",
    "Definitely. One of the most practical and useful courses I have taken at Yale. Gained invaluable R coding skills as well as knowledge of experiments.",
    "Definetly take this course even if your just a little bit quant. You'll learn so much and Professor Coppock is great",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Coppock is a wonderful lecturer and person, and really cares about all of his students. You will learn how to read, understand and criticize political science research, and eventually construct your own experiment. Fantastic class, fantastic professor. Cannot recommend enough!!",
    "Yes, important to understand inferential statistics and experimental design, and this course lays a solid foundation."
