   "comments": [
    "The first half of the class is great. You learn all about Muhammad and the aspects of Islam. The second half of the class is much more difficult to follow. It's fine while you're learning about Sufism and Shi'ism, but once that's over it seemed like we were getting random history lessons on various countries that have something to do with Islam. Go to the review sessions, otherwise you won't know what to study.",
    "If you are interested in the material, definitely take this class. Professor Bowering is wonderful; his lectures are extremely fast and sometimes erratic but always interesting. The work load is manageable and weekly readings are pretty interesting. Doing well in this class requires commitment though.",
    "An overview of the religion of Islam, deals with a fair amount of theology so if you're in it for the cultural aspects you might not find it so fascinating. Not too much work, be careful to really know your Arabic terms for the tests.",
    "This is a wonderful class and a must for anyone interested in religion, Middle Eastern studies, or even political science. While the class goes fast and topics are covered quickly, it provides a very broad overview of Islam - including history, philosophy\/theology, law, and reform movements\/politics (including the Muslim Brotherhood, Pakistan, Iran, etc). The workload isn't very heavy - just 80 pages of reading a week - and afterwards, you find that so many of the Western preconceptions about Islam are wrong. Professor Bowering is also very good at conveying information, and the lecture is always very small. Definitely take the class!",
    "I highly recommend this class to everyone because the professor is so smart and impressive, the material is never dry or boring, and it approaches the subject from a wide range of angles.",
    "Yeah, pretty straightforward, a good 5th class I would say. Not particularly riveting but it's pretty informative.",
    "It's a great class and you learn a lot about Islam",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to really understand the development of Islam and trace situations today back to the beginning of the religion. I would not recommend it to someone who is concerned primarily such present-day situations, as much of the course takes place during the European middle ages and focuses on ideas rather than actions. The sections, immediately following lecture, were often excruciating, but I expect the majority of my fellow students to identify them as the main area for improvement, so hopefully the powers that be will do something about that. The readings are definitely manageable, though lecture notes are probably more helpful for exams, for which the study sessions are a must. Again, I would recommend this course to any student who seeks a true understanding and is willing to work atit.",
    "For a student wanting to learn a basic overview of the many aspects of the religion, this is a great course. The class covers history, theology, philosophy, sects and modern trends. I definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in Middle East studies."
