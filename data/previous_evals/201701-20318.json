    "Sometimes readings were a bit hard, but class material was accessible. Good lectures and range of topics. Lab activities were interesting, and I liked that we didn't force a lab if there wasn't relevant material that week. Made it feel like we were focusing on the important material.",
    "The lectures cover some really interesting topics, but are pretty dry at a few points. Prof. Watts researches chimpanzees, so they are the main focus of a few lectures. I personally love learning with a chimpanzee model, so it was great for me. If you for some reason hate chimpanzees (???) then this class might not be great for you. Lab section this semester was with Prof. Watts, and he ran it well. He had exercises prepared that gave an understanding of how certain measurements were obtained. Working with the casts (and some real human bones) allowed us to get an implicit understanding of the traits that are discussed extensively in an anthropology class like this. It also helped me improve my anatomical understanding of modern humans, which is something that not a lot of classes at Yale offer. Also, Professor Watts clearly thoroughly read each of my papers, giving thoughtful feedback throughout. It gave me new directions to look in with regards to my next paper, and helped me contextualize different points in a light outside of my very limited scope of writing. This is the longest eval I have ever written for a course, and it's because this class was great. I mean it."

    "If you are interested at all in human evolution, this course is worth taking. The lab section is good, and the lectures are, for the most part, excellent. I would recommend this to anyone with even a beginner's background in evolution\/phylogeny\/etc. It's an excellent choice for a social science credit as well."
