    "I came into this class with basically zero knowledge of Japanese. Now, I know enough of the language to have a basic 10 minute conversation and could probably find my way around\/survive in Japan by myself. I also learned some about Japanese culture through the language's use in different situations.",
    "I feel that I gained a solid grasp on the basic concepts of spoken Japanese and got a very thorough introduction to the writing system.",

   "comments": [
    "This class teaches you a lot of Japanese very quickly and gives a decent amount of practice using those speaking skills. It could possibly be improved by having more individual speaking practice with an experienced speaker to get used to using common phrases.",
    "I feel that this Course, with its heavy workload, gives good experience in all of the core areas of the Japanese language. My one main complaint is the about the textbook, which does not feature any Japanese writing, but rather a romanized transliteration. This doesn't make sense if one of the main focuses of the course is providing training in Japanese reading and writing.",
    "strengths: covers a lot of ground, learned about a lot of grammar structures, builds on itself in a way that is understandable and logical weaknesses: we lack conversational skills unless you go out of your way to seek ways to talk with people \/\/ already bolstered by language tables and clinics (sign up BETA through canvas is very slow -- is there another way to signup for these?)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you're willing to put in a good amount of time and energy. If you are interested in the Japanese language, this class will get the language taught to you.",
    "If a student is interested in learning Japanese, I would highly recommend this course to supplement individual study.",
    "Yes! It was a lot of fun learning an entirely new language and this class was very well structured to facilitate that learning. 11\/10 would recommend to another student seeking to learn a new language."
