    "This course had an extensive workload that at times felt disproportionate to other similar courses.",
    "This class assigns some of the most significant writing in the Theater Management curriculum. The volume of writing can be difficult, but there is much to be learned from the challenge. The fundamentals of the coursework are sound, and the arc of the assignments over the semester is a very good introduction to the many aspects of Development. While usually useful, there are times when the high volume of work does not seem to address a specific learning objective. There are at least two weeks when two or three significant pieces of writing are assigned at once, making it impossible for students to do their best work. More importantly, feedback on these assignments is usually limited to a two-sentence summary, which does not engage with the work deeply enough to critique the thinking or writing process behind it. This is discouraging - more feedback would enable more learning and motivate better work over the semester. The course has a strong foundation, but I believe it could be improved by streamlining and clarifying assignments. A slightly smaller and more focused workload would allow both students and professor more time to engage with what is produced.",
    "I really did not see the necessity of all of the assignments we were expected to complete. The method of evaluation for each of these assignments was also not clear. A succinct desription of all the elements that should be included in each of the assignments would also be helpful. There was often a model but not many of the model assignments were incredibly long or unclear as to what components should be included in the homework assignment. Due dates were misleading and as a consequence were difficult to arrange in a time efficient manner."

    "The syllabus was difficult to read and several early sessions reviewed material we had studied in greater detail in other courses. Some materials were difficult to access.",
    "This course is sequenced beautifully. The mix of different kinds of work and discussion keeps classes awake, and materials are useful and easy to access. The syllabus requires attention in how it presents assigned work. Two changes would make it clearer and much easier for students to use. Most simply, the document is formatted as large blocks of undifferentiated text, and it takes significant effort to understand what is expected. This may seem an unreasonable complaint - students should just read more seriously - but as the primary source of assignment information it really is easy to miss something. When planning your schedule two weeks in advance to accommodate the overlapping requirements of 9 courses, a clear reference document is SO appreciated. Just the addition of line breaks would be a major improvement. More subtly, information about individual assignments could be more specific. While the pattern \"read example, then write your own\" works well enough, there are often questions about what is expected. Feedback reveals that the professor often has a more specific idea of what he is looking for than outlined in the assignment. A written list of sections to include would be a big help, and would allow feedback and discussion to focus on content rather than missing pieces. This would be of particular use for the Board of Directors, Individual Giving, and Capital Campaign assignments.",
    "The syllabus was very unclear. I never knew when assignments were due, what reading was due the day of class and what was due the next class. The sequence of the classes made sense but the content during was often just lecture-based, which mad it difficult to stay engaged. Readings were often assigned but never really discussed or commented on beyond the occasional reference."

    "Prof. Hamingson makes the idea of fundraising real, and his discussion of what it actually means to make an ask is vividly instructive. The imagination in this class could be benefited by the specificity of more examples (for instance, one or more model benefit programs), frameworks, and clear expectations.",
    "I really wish that there had been a variety of teaching methods utilized in this class. A variety of teaching strategies--fishbowl discussions, surveys,free writes, article discussions, kinesthetic activities, role playing--could have been used to increase engagement. As it was, most of the teaching involved telling personal anecdotes, which is helpful to a point, but does not allow for real absorption of any lessons. I do not feel as if I would know any more strategies for working in a development department than I did before I started."

    "This course reviewed some basic elements of fundraising but I did not feel the assignments reinforced my knowledge.",
    "As I said above, I really do not know what I'm taking away except for a little more practice at making up these documents. I wish I had more strategies for how to make asks, how to find donors, and what it actually means to cultivate relationships with a donors and board members. I heard a lot of personal anecdotes that showed me the sequence of events but I have very few strategies to put in my toolkit to help me do that in the future."

    "It was not helpful to me to use an imagined institution as the basis for coursework. I believe it would be more useful to assign existing institutions at various life cycle stages and learn them in depth in order to use them as examples. Further, I suggest each class session start with a class member making a fundraising \"ask,\" in order to allow students to gain experience, get valuable feedback and improve their comfort level over the course of the semester.",
    "Vary the structure of the classes so that it isn't just one person talking at the group. Ask questions that are truly thought-provoking and not just surface level. Include more projects and assignments that involve actually flexing the muscles we would use to make asks and work in development. Practicing writing a grant can be helpful but shouldn't we become better at actually talking to people? Shouldn't we know where to look to find donor's potential giving? Shouldn't we have more succinct models from a variety of places rather than just a few long sets? Include classes where we actually share our work beyond two minutes and spend time working on making corrections together. Allow people to get up and move and take some sort of ownership of the class. It's hard for anyone to be engaged for three hours of sitting and listening. I also felt that the field discussions that started each week were like a shaming session where we were made to feel bad for what we may not know when we're trying to grasp a ton of new information, at least for those of us new to the field. The session where you brought up the Marin Ireland article and essentially accused her of being at fault for being abused and then commented on my own personal experience of being harassed as somehow being my fault put me on edge and made me feel extremely unsafe in the classroom environment. If there are going to ever be discussions of tense topics, it is the instructor's job to maintain a safe space for ALL students."
