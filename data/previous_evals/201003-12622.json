    "GBO is a solid class, and gives you a very firm and useful introduction to the actual application of industrial ecology and combining business and environmental protection. The group work and facility reports are challenging but definitely worth it. I'd recommend the class, but be prepared to be dealing with several people from very different academic backgrounds and motivations.",
    "this class is really great. the project ends up being a bunch of work, but its also a valuable experience to work with a big company.",
    "If you are interested in the intersection between the environment and business, this is a good class to take. Though it was much more time consuming than anticipated. 4 field trips on Friday mornings through the semester - long essays similar to lab reports accompanythe field trips - can work on them with a partner. A big term project where you work with outside companies. Forestry school dominated (only a few undergraduates). 3 short problem sets. Not too much work outside of the big assignments. In the end I really enjoyed it, but it helps to be passionate about the subject matter."
