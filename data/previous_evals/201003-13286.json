    "Fantastic class! I learned a lot, it's sort of all over the place so you definitely get a flavor for what graph theory's all about and what's exciting in graph theory. I also really like the whole no-exams thing; it's the way advanced classes should be.",
    "Definitely take it, very interesting class, obviously, you'll want a bit of a graph theory\/math background, but if you think you can handle it, you should take it, because it's definitely very interesting. If you want to get a feel for the class, google Graphs and Networks 2010 and the course website should come up.",
    "This course turned out to be very different from what I expected. After taking Algorithms with the same professor, I thought this course would be just like Algorithms, except with a focus on graph and network algorithms.However, this course ended up covering very advanced graph\/network material. Lectures would be based on published papers. I often found the lectures to be a bit over my head - very technical and theoretical - the proofs that Prof. Spielman did were a bit hard to follow sometimes. I'm just not as mathematical as he or I think many of the other students are. I was a huge fan of having two tracks though - one theoretical and one experimental - that students could follow. I definitely am not a theoretical person and the experimental section was much more fun and applicable to me (as an applications kind of person) than doing theoretical, proof-based problems. I am also very grateful that Prof. Spielman posted his lecture notes online. Without them, the psets would have been impossible. I wish he would fill in the missing lecture notes. The psets are very reasonable in length - usually 3-5 problems for theoretical-track people, and 1 problem + 1 or 2 experimental problems for the experimental-track people. And you get about two weeks per pset (there were only 4.5 my year (the last 0.5 being an extra credit assignment)), so you have plenty of time to do it (even though I was still able to finish while only starting two days or the night before it was due).",
    "The material was interesting, but unless the class is reorganized (more traditional - with exams) I would hesitate to recommend the class. It wasn't much work, but it was hard to be motivated to really learn the material when there were no exams and only 4 psets.",
    "Really interesting class. Professor Spielman is great and the lectures are pretty awesome. The class was a bit unstructured, but even so I would still recommend it.",
    "This is a good course for Math-inclined students. Covers a lot of interesting and useful material. Requires a decent amount of probability and linear algebra. There is no exam so you need to maximize on the problem sets. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone who is even vaguely interested in this material.",
    "see if you like the notes from past years.",
    "good class, the lecture was hard to grok though\/got boring repetitive. if you put in the effort to pay attention you will learn a lot. also, spielman is awesome.",
    "Spielman is great and the lectures in this course were really interesting. The problem sets were tough though. I did the theoretical track of the course and really regret that. I think I would have gotten more out of the experimental track. Unless you are an applied math major you probably should do the experimental track. If you have met the prereqs though, definitely take this course. I actually think this would be a great Credit\/D\/F course thoughI'm not sure if others would agree.",
    "Yes! Spielman is brilliant! Graphs are a fun topic to think about. However, you get what time you put into it. I wish I had more time to really learn all the subjects. As such, I was only exposed to the fun, but didn't have the chance to really absorb everything :\/ Do yourself a favor, give yourself lots of time for the class, and really absorb all of the subject's (and Spielman's) awesomeness."
