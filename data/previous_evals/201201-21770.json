   "comments": [
    "Take this course. Or every course by Marcia fro that matter...",
    "Masculinities is GREAT. you learn a lot about a lot of different topics. Marcia teaches you to do a lot of dissection of literary work and the methods of anthro. Take it if you are interested. Work load is heavier, but it's only once a week, so it's manageable. I highly recommend it if you are social science oriented or any sort of public policy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Get ready for a lot of reading though -- a book a week is pretty intense especially if you have another reading-intensive course. However, if you do the reading you will really get a lot out of dicussions. Also, take notes! They come in handy for the final paper...",
    "You will read one ethnography (usually 200+ pages) every week from some pretty amazing players in the field. All of the books are pretty great in their own way. You lead one class discussion, write two books reviews, which are two pages long single spaced, and a final fifteen-page comparative book review. The workload is not too overwhelming as long as you keep up with the reading! I would definitely recommend this class, especially for the professor. Marcia creates a wonderful classroom environment. She is (literally) always so friendly, willing to talk with her students, and tell us things about her incredibly interesting life, which makes the class very enjoyable. She is truly one of the best and brightest professors we've got here - so really, don't miss out on this experience.",
    "This class examines men's health issues (sex issues, HIV\/AIDS, substance abuse, issues that come with fatherhood) from the perspective of the ways in which society defines masculinity. I would absolutely recommend this to any student. You learn so much about yourself as you fit into societal expectations of gender, and it gives you an interesting way of examining the world. It is incredibly useful for students who are anthropology majors, but also for those who have no idea what anthropology is; it's useful both for people who love health issues and for those who know nothing about them. In addition if you're at all interested in gender studies (I wasn't before this class), you will love it.",
    "This is quite possibly the best course I've taken at Yale. The workload is straightforward: you read a book every week, you discuss it, you write book reviews of the some of the books. There's some really fascinating thought going on in the world of masculinity studies, and Marcia is an amazing guide through the books. Don't be intimidated if you don't have a lot of experience in anthropology or gender studies; you'll learn a lot and have a really great time!",
    "This class is amazing - the seminar discussions are fabulous and the professor is phenomenal. You can't lose with this class.",
    "This is a very intimate seminar that I wouldn't really call a seminar... it's more of a book discussion. Think of this class as a book discussion group that meets weekly. Take this class if you are ready to read 250+ pages a week and actively discuss it for at least 3 hours.",
    "Yes, it is amazing!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a decent amount of work, but the material and class time is really enjoyable and the subject is interesting. Marcia is a fantastic professor as well!",
    "This is a great course! It\u00b4s a book a week, which is a lot, but the actual graded assignments are very easy to do well on as long as you follow the clear guidelines that you get. The books are all really interesting, and Marcia is so sweet, like a class mother rather than professor."
