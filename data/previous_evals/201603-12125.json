   "comments": [
    "I developed the ability to read a lot of material in a short amount of time, which will be essential for my own teaching. I also acquired a stronger theoretical grounding in my field.",
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of African American history and helped me to develop knowledge of the debates, questions, and genealogies of African American Women's history. The readings provided a broad understanding of historical patterns and events in the lives of African American women, and the discussions in class helped me to identify the methodological practices and problems of writing histories of African American women as individuals and collectives across history. Our weekly responses were a useful preparation for class and helped me to sharpen some of my questions and draw out some of the central concepts or ideas in the readings. Above all, Professor Feimster's teaching practice modeled a feminist approach to African American women's history, to the profession, and to teaching.",
    "Solid grasp of the historiography and chronology of the field of African-American women's history, as well as a sense of the some of the questions that are currently animating the field.",
    "I gained the ability to think critically about secondary sources and pull apart their arguments, assess their sources, and put them in conversation with each other. The fact that in a given week, our books were often from different time periods, meant that we were able to make historical connections across time periods rather than just moving chronologically.",
    "This course was essentially life-changing. While I had done some work in African American women's history before, I had never done so in such a focused way, and this course really challenged me to think about my own subfield's lackluster approach to race. It made me realize that there is no way to do the kind of work that I want to do without paying close attention to black women, and gave me the beginnings of what might turn into a dissertation topic. In terms of skills, this course was excellent practice in gutting books and being able to succinctly articulate their arguments.",
    "I learned how to read much more efficiently in this course and I also developed my synthesis skills. That the course was organized thematically was very helpful in pushing me to draw out major themes in African American Women's history that transcended topic. I developed my presentation skills as well. Writing the final paper really solidified to me that I had begun thinking about history through the perspective of African American Women's history which will be extremely helpful as I continue in graduate school and was my major goal when I entered the course.",
    "My knowledge was improved considerably. This course succeeded in bringing both breadth and depth to my learning. I developed a strong foundation in the field and dramatically changed the way I think about history and the work of an historian more generally.",
    "I loved the breath of texts we read and how Prof. Feimster structured the class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "This class was really great because it didn't necessarily adhere strictly to chronology, so we got to see thematic trends and patterns within the field between monographs written about strikingly different time periods. I liked that we had to present on two books, because it allowed me to read certain things more deeply, which definitely prepared me well for my final paper. I noticed that often class discussion did not follow the questions the presenter had prepared. I wonder if there is a way to facilitate the discussion in a way that allows these questions to be more central to the dynamic?",
    "This course provided a wonderful space for exploring African American women's history and for understanding what was at stake in pursuing historical work into African American women's lives. I appreciated how every member of the seminar participated and provided insight, and how it felt collaborative from beginning to end. The course was challenging and rigorous but the material always felt approachable and clear, and allowed students in the course to feel confident engaging in discussion even though we were never experts in any particular conversation. There were few weaknesses in the course. The high volume of reading made it so that it was challenging to read any of the books very deeply. I think this was by design, but it was occasionally frustrating, because the material was usually excellent.",
    "The syllabus is a treasure chest! A really rich and useful resource, even continuing onward past the semester. I really enjoyed this course, and Crystal did a great job facilitating discussion--it would have been ideal for the class to be a bit smaller, as it was occasionally difficult to get a real seminar flow going with so many people eager to speak.",
    "The strengths of this class were the wonderful discussions, which Professor Feimster facilitated really well. She also had us discuss current events, films, and events at Yale, reminding us that the themes addressed in our readings permeate our everyday existence and that being a historian also requires meaningful engagement with current realities. She also taught us not to just read the books passively, but to actively search them for what they could offer to our own projects and questions. I think the only improvement I would suggest is more concrete guidelines for the historiographical essay.",
    "Strengths: The amazing course community was a refuge in these incredibly trying political times, and I endlessly appreciated the group's deep understanding of the connections between the past and the present. The readings were consistently engaging. The discussions were open-ended enough to invite student-generated ideas and broad connection-building, but pointed enough that they remained challenging and resulted in a solid understanding of the texts. Less a weakness and more mixed feelings: I found the presentations helpful for getting a better grasp of the significant reading load, and enjoyed doing my own, but they didn't always work and I sometimes felt that they impeded on discussion time. I'm not sure how to balance the learning experience of presenting with the fact that some were more effective than others in conveying the key points of the texts. I definitely would not want to get rid of them, but perhaps a slightly shorter time limit would require a more focused approach and leave more room for the discussions? I also sometimes struggled with the size of the class. I loved the mix of people and was consistently excited to hear everyone's perspectives, so again, I'm not sure that decreasing the size would be the solution, but I did sometimes miss the more back-and-forth conversations that come from smaller groups.",
    "The readings in this course were amazing and really helped me understand important themes and topics in the field. The assignments were incredibly helpful in pushing me to reflect on the texts and their relationship to the field. Professor Feimster's guidance in the course was also incredibly helpful - her comments and interaction with the discussion helped emphasize the important themes and also kept the class on track with discussing the reading. I think that a shorter midterm assignment that is like the final assignment (thematic and synthetic) would be useful.",
    "The course was incredibly strong, though at times I do think seminar discussion was hindered by the size of the class. I understand this is a challenge in a course so vital and popular to the curriculum, but I think with a smaller group the exchange of ideas each week could have been improved - we could come to know each other better as scholars and peers and cultivate a more dynamic chemistry.",
    "This course was a bit large for a seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This was a great course and is really essential if you're thinking about working on women's history and\/or African American history.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student interested in history, African American history, and\/or the studies of women, gender, and sexuality. This course provided foundational knowledge of African American women's history, and of the major debates and questions of the field. Although we did not often read theory in the class, we approached the constructs of gender, race, sexuality, and other facets of social identity with careful analyses that challenged essential categories and allowed for multiple perspectives to surface. One of the best aspects of the course was the community of scholars fostered over the semester. Each member of the class contributed their intellectual perspective and voice to the conversation, and there was never a sense that there were experts and non-experts in the room. The classroom was one of the best examples of a fair and cooperative graduate space that I have yet experienced.",
    "Absolutely! A great introduction to (or dive into) the field, as well as engaging discussion and a warm atmosphere.",
    "Absolutely. This course was formative to my thinking about feminism, radicalism, and resistance.",
    "I highly recommend this class! Professor Feimster is an engaging, supportive, and all-around wonderful professor and will push you to not just absorb secondary sources but to really think about their argument and sources and whether or not you agree\/how you can use their work. You'll see the books you read in conversation with each other, so the whole semester feels cohesive and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Absolutely, no question. I wish it were required.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The readings are broad in terms of themes and periods and Professor Feimster is a generous and thoughtful class instructor. Although the reading load was very heavy, the syllabus was so strong that it's hard to imagine which texts could have been cut.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Feimster's course was integral in pushing me to think about the complexities of writing history. Taking this course has shifted my perspective on the field and I learned so much not only about the topic, but also about how themes and research perspectives in African American Women's history can influence and positively change the field.",
    "Yes, quite strongly.",
    "Absolutely"
