    "Ashish is a nice guy and a good lecturer. This is a unique class and a great way to learn about a topic you'll probably never have a chance to study again in your life. The movie screenings (up to two a week) are somewhat time consuming, but they're also a great way to relax in the middle of the week. He's not the easiest grader, but if you really ask him what he's looking for on the papers he'll be straightforward with you.He also invited us to dinner at his house in the middle of the semester, which was a lot of fun.",
    "Don't take this class expecting a gut. It's really enjoyable because you have an excuse to watch colorful Bollywood movies every Tuesday night -- but you spend SO much time on this class in the end. It's about 100-200 pages of reading a week, lots of screenings, and 2 big papers. Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into and enjoy the ride.",
    "Be CAREFUL: Know that you're getting into a class that you will be IN CLASS for 9 hours a week sometimes with 2 1.5 hour sessions and 2 three hour Bollywood films. The films are good and the class gets close, but it can be really disappointing also. If someone irritates you the first few days of class, you will be seeing them for 9 hours a week in a small seminar style environment so be aware of this. Also, the dynamic of the class is difficult because some students are very Bollywood savvy and know quite a lot about India and Indian culture, while others know nothing so many discussions are quite superficial, with the professor having to lecture on issues like Partition and caste etc for those that don't know, leaving those that do know bored and irritated. Chadha's a fantastic lecturer though, so see if the class works for you and drop it if it doesn't!",
    "Yes!",
    "This class makes you think about the meaning of something that makes such a big impact in a culture, in an intellectual, thoughtful manner.",
    "This course is really fun. It's a ton of reading and film watching, and the final paper almost killed me, but it's an excellent way to get to know Bollywood films and Indian pop culture.",
    "Yes, definitely! Bollywood is getting increasingly globalized so it's important for people to be able to understand what makes Bollywood Bollywood outside of all the song and dance. Justtake the papers seriously and go to the 35 mm film screenings!",
    "I would highly recommend this class. However, it is not an easy ride. There is a lot of dense reading and the film screenings take up a lot of time. Nonetheless, it is completely worth it.",
    "A fun class, but slightly disorganized. Definitely doable even if you didn't grow up watching bollywood (which was my case), though because most of the class is of Indian heritage, you may not get all the references made in discussion. Discussions aren't as academic as they could be.",
    "Maybe - I'd recommend watching a Bollywood film first to see if you enjoy it. The course takes a fair amount of time (1hr and 15min lecture, 1hr and 15min discussion, 1-2 3hr films per week, and 100+ pages of weekly reading), but most of the time is fairly relaxed. You can get away with not doing the reading, but only until it is time to write the papers, so it makes sense to keep up with it. I'd recommend it for a fun class, but not as a fifth class.",
    "if you can get in, take it. seriously, it's been probably my favorite class here at yale and it feels like a family by the time it's over.",
    "If you're interested in ANYTHING about India, you'll love this course. I would absolutely recommend it."
