    "This class demanded critical and imaginative ways of engaging with American history at a very critical time, facilitated through engagement with a diverse range of media.",
    "Over the course of this semester, I learned a lot about the present through the past. Especially how the former is not so different from the latter. Scary!",
    "This was done f those courses that you took home with you every day. You did not stop thinking about the themes from class. Useful skillnwas designing course plan.",
    "I learned a lot that complicated the narrative of this country. From discussing the KKK as a type of proto-fascism, to the long history of American violence and American conspiracies; from burning catholic churches to the over 200 year old illuminati paranoia, I have gained the tools and understanding to look at a little seen side of American history. Without it I would not have had anywhere near as complex an understanding of either the past or the present with respect to fascism in America or around the world. It has given me methods with which to critique the current situation. This is especially important now that there is a very serious debate as to whether the current president is a fascist. A debate, that for my part has been informed heavily by this class."

   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: not enough people. Strengths: the intellectual rigor with which the class was taught and the level of engagement among students",
    "A really great course! Good breadth of information, fair assignments. I just wish we had a bit more guidance on the Salons, or perhaps didn't have our last one on the final day of class.",
    "The strengths of the course were how well Aaron could lead discussion despite the assigned texts being not only numerous but also quite difficult as well as the variety of material covered. The weaknesses may have been the quantity of great readings -- there were so many, I just couldn't do all of them. I think it may be better to do fewer assigned readings, but talk about them in greater depth.",
    "Great professor Weakness: would be cool to offer over entire year",
    "Sometimes this course's readings seemed to lack curation. This is understandable given the short timeframe in which it must have been developed, but I think the class had difficulty engaging with readings that they didn't quite see the connections between. Additionally, some weeks the reading became a bit impossible. While this would have been ok in a section of 15 or so, in a section of more like 7 or 8 it caused problems. That said, I do hope it is taught again with more curation, and I think that the breadth of the course, student involvement and free-flowing discussions were a tremendous asset."

    "I would, but I don't know if it will be offered again. Hopefully not, to be honest -- which will mean we won't need it. But we will.",
    "Yes! Aaron has an amazing brain.it's worth taking the class because he is so good.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Yale student wishing to understand how we got to where we are, and have their conception of the nation in which this campus resides altered."
