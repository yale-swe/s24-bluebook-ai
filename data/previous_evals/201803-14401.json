    "I learned a great deal about the history of American conceptions of Islam and Muslim people. We learned to be critical of the stories that countries and leaders tell themselves, and to recognize the very real phenomenon of the lies that breed American exceptionalism.",
    "I learned a lot about how to critically think about the my own American-Muslim identity within the context of scholarly discourse as well within the context of current events. This class will improve your ability to have honest conversations, close-read, and be a critical thinker.",
    "This course does a really good job of providing students with historical context of western perceptions towards the Middle East while highlighting the relationship between culture and conscious policy decisions.",
    "This course and courses like it make me realize that course evaluations as they're currently structured are really inadequate to help students articulate the kind of learning and growth they experience throughout the semester. It's difficult to articulate the kind of learning that happens in a class like this, because it's not boundaried and restricted to the classroom. Zareena has a rare gift of teaching in a way that permeates the lives of her students and changes the way they think about and approach all the other political and personal questions that shape their lives and communities. I can say that this is a class where students learn about histories of imperialism and resistance, of white power movements and their logics, and of the forces that remake these logics. Anyone who takes this course will learn how to take in cultural objects differently and read and watch amazing theoretical work by scholars and artists alike. But how can we think about courses in a way that focus less on what individual students take away?"

   "comments": [
    "Lots of reading! All fascinating but at times hard to manage!",
    "Professor Grewal is amazing and I would highly recommend taking as many courses with her as possible. One of the strengths of this course is that she uses various mediums to supplement student learning so she varies the readings, often shows videos and documentaries in class etc.",
    "Strengths included Zareena's teaching--the best I've had in my time at Yale. She guides students in a way that helps reshape their relationship to apprehending culture in general in a way that is deeply politicizing. The readings were absolutely amazing. My only regret is that the magnitude of readings meant I had a more superficial and less prolonged engagement with each reading. With more time, I might have been able to get a better grip of some of the denser theoretical work. But the way in which we mapped out arguments in class helped to cohere arguments that didn't fully take shape in my head upon first read. Strengths are also in the assignments and the guidance Zareena offered to students completing them. They were shorter assignments, so they challenged us to really focus in and be concise in a way that actually required us to *say something* from the very beginning."

    "I would!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- Professor Grewal is amazing!",
    "This course really makes you think about the way Islam in a new light. Discussions are always fun and informational and youre never stressed in the class to say something super important because participation comes naturally",
    "yes, its great",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in learning more about the changing landscape of western perceptions towards Islam and the Middle East and the tangible impact western culture has had on the Middle East, take this course. Also, Professor Grewal is fantastic and you'll learn a lot from her.",
    "In a minute. Definitely one of my top two or three classes at Yale. I would recommend it to students coming from all range of fields and experiences, because Zareena is particularly skilled at making an AMST seminar accessible to people from all range of disciplines and levels of familiarity with the kinds of theoretical texts we were reading. She talked about cultural analysis in a way that I've never seen it explained in other AMST courses, even the so-called \"gateway\" ones. The histories we study in this course should be mandatory learning for all of us continually profiting from\/remaking this imperialist system."
