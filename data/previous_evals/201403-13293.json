    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Doesn't matter if you are straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, male, female... you will love this class. Super interesting and something that you wouldn't get to learn about at a lot of schools.",
    "Absolutely amazing class - absolutely take it. Chauncey is the BEST.",
    "YES! Must take.. lectures are interesting and the reading is good too even though there is quite a bit of it",
    "If Yale College has a core curriculum, and had mandatory classes, this should be #1 on the list. Some classes are good, some classes are great, but this is life-changing. As a history class, it is an excellent introduction to \"thinking historically\". Professor Chauncey is also a phenomenal lecturer who creates a strong sense of intimacy in a large lecture class, and puts in effort into knowing students. He redefines what good teaching can achieve. I would rate this class \"beyond excellent\", because that's what it is.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Take this class! This is material you should learn about, and the class is also enjoyable and interesting. The work isn't absurd but it's there.",
    "Take it 100%. You won't get this chance anywhere else. There is a midterm, 2 papers, and a final - workload might be more than another class you are thinking about taking instead, but this is worth it. Take it Cred D if you really just want to learn about the material but don't want to have to study too much.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. This is a history that few people know anything about. Lectures are almost always fascinating. No matter how you sexually identify, the material gives you a new perspective on today's issues around sexuality in the U.S., and you learn a lot about different cultural movements in U.S. history from a unique perspective.",
    "Take it no matter your major if you have even a passing interest in the topic. Chauncey's lectures are amazing, the papers are manageable, and the tests are fair. You get as much out of the class as you put in to it. Not all readings are completely necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Classic Yale course.",
    "A MUST TAKE! Such a wonderful course, and the lectures were mind-blowing. You have to at least shop this course during your time at Yale.",
    "This class is so important, & exquisitely planned. Chauncey is a giant in the field, & he's organized the course so everything is interesting, comprehensible, & part of a historical narrative. Aside from the near-flawless planning & delivery of the subject, Chauncey is humorous, understanding, & real w\/ his students. Every class was a pleasure & applause-worthy. The reading - especially primary accounts - really added to the course, offering different dimensions (ex. from different political perspectives or representing different racial groups). Must-take for everyone, & absolutely reasonable workload: 2 out of 3 papers, in-class midterm, final.",
    "This course is life-changing. It's definitely a must-take class at Yale. The lectures are amazing, the reading is really interesting and not too overwhelming and the TF's were grew (shout out to Claire!) There is a small ethnography due at the beginning of the course and then you have to do 2 of 3 papers over the semester. There's a midterm and a final. You'll be fine if you do the reading and go to lecture. Chauncey is amazing, like everyone's cool uncle.",
    "This class is everything. Whoever you are, however you identify, wherever you come from, you get something (probably many things) out of this class. Don't graduate from Yale without having taken it.",
    "A required course for all Yale students especially for freshmen. It's a perfect introduction to the History major, as a lecture interested in practicing history-argument-making and successful in generating buy-in into history (as a course concerned with such personal matters). Moreover, I can't think of a better way for any freshman to think about crucial everyday questions such as sexuality, identity, gender, sex, and power in society. I learned a lot as a senior but probably would have had my mind blown as a freshman. It gives you a vocabulary with which to think about all these everyday interactions and legacies of gay and lesbian history, which is not at all a narrow category.",
    "Definitely take this class",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The lectures are great, you'll never want to miss them and it is not an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "As everyone knows, this is a must-take at Yale. Interesting, fun, and thought provoking, it takes you through history looking at an aspect that most history classes never even mention. I thought the grading was a bit esoteric at times, so it would be a good idea to at least start the class Cred\/D\/F.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in queer history. It is well taught, and Professor Chauncey is a great lecturer, but you do have to have some kind of interest in this area. It teaches an interesting way of thinking about sexuality and also about examining change over time, especially given how recent a lot of the important aspects of queer history in the US are.",
    "Good class. not as life changing as advertised but very interesting for me because i had extremely little knowledge about the topic previously.",
    "This is a must-take class at Yale. You will learn so much about American society on a whole and you will enjoy all the lectures--it's like going to a short performance twice a week!",
    "A very important and socially relevant course, you must take it. Goes into the history and rise of homosexuality as an identity, and the forms of oppression used to make gay people silent. Sometimes this class will make you smile and laugh. Other times it will have you sobbing or feeling angry. This is history that everyone should know, and there is no better place for you to learn it than at Yale. It is also pretty easy (I think it is intentionally graded pretty leniently) so you honestly have no reason not to take it.",
    "Totally worth taking, even if you are a straight dude. You learn so much about the best and worst of humans and America. You won't forget it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Gay & Lesbian History to anyone who's even MILDLY interested in any kind of history - it's fascinating stuff you rarely touch upon in other history classes (and definitely not in high school). One of the best classes I've taken at Yale thus far!",
    "A life-changing experience. It doesn't matter who you are, everyone should have to take this class. Not only is it extremely relevant, but it also covers a lot of history that you'll never learn otherwise, and definitely should have learned. Take it. If you can't this year, next year. But take it. Take it. Definitely 100x take it.",
    "This class has been incredible. It has 1) given me an appreciation of lesbian and gay history 2) has really given me an appreciation for the value of personal narrative in (this type of) history 3) given me the language to describe homosexuality and perceptions of homosexuality 4) given me an avenue to start conversations about homosexuality with other people. I didn't do many of the readings, but I was able to get by just fine. I hear the readings are great, though. The essay assignments were really fun to write!",
    "US Lesbian and Gay History is an engaging, highly relevant theme-based history class. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. For anyone, but especially STEM majors, it is a worthwhile humanities credit.",
    "George Chauncey is one of Yale's best lecturers, period. He's warm and funny and caring on top of being a truly preeminent gay and lesbian historian, and that's what makes this class so great - important information delivered by a giant in the field who makes you feel like he really cares about every one of his 250 students sitting out there in the auditorium. Take this class, just like basically every other review will tell you.",
    "WGSS is a life-changing class. Not only is it a history of gays and lesbians in the context of american history, it is a history of sexuality and gender in general. Chauncey makes sure to cover the topics in an intersectional context, as to leave no one's story untold. I would fervidly recommend this course to all Yale students.",
    "Seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS. Yes, everyone gushes like crazy about it, but there is good reason to. Whether or not you identify as lesbian or gay, whether or not you like history, whether or not you think you're good at reading and writing, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is so important and so incredibly eye-opening. At first, I was under the impression that LGBT History was a separate history from everything else we had been taught in middle\/high school up to this point. This class showed me how interconnected all histories are; war, politics, social movements, changing moral codes and attitudes...they all influence each other in amazingly interesting ways and really prove Professor Chauncey's main point that nothing in history is inevitable and that we have the power to make change happen. You will honestly learn so much from this class that will give you a better understanding of the history of the United States, why gay rights, culture, and identity are such big topics of discussion today, and how they have been treated and dealt with over the last few centuries. This class has set my expectations way too high for the rest of my time at Yale. Take it, take it, take it.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History was an informative course on an understudied topic, but it perhaps didnt quite live up to the incredible hype Id heard from fellow students. Dont get me wrongit was definitely worth taking, and Professor Chauncey is a pioneer in the field, but it wasnt life-changing or anything, as others have billed it. Still, to study social history in a course like this is a valuable experience, and the lectures were engaging and well-presented, if a bit repetitive. Overall, one of the best lectures in the history department, accessible to majors and non-majors alike, without too much work.",
    "A+. This is a fascinating course. Take it if you're gay or straight or anywhere in between, for that matter. Professor Chauncey is a leader in his field and delivers clear and interesting lectures that can be emotionally riveting in a good way. His lecture on AIDs was the best I've been to in my Yale career. There's a lot of reading but it's well worth your time, and you don't need to do all of it to succeed in the class. 50% of the time this class felt like a hobby. Also, the TAs are pretty cool. Just take it. Please. Take it no matter what major you're in.",
    "Yes. A must-take history class. It really changes your perspective on social movements, Yale, and American history.",
    "Take it. I took it Credit\/D, went to most lectures, spent no more than 4 hours on each paper, barely studied for the final and midterm, and I think I don't think I'm close to the ball-park of a C grade...but I haven't seen my final grade yet, so you never know, I guess. You do learn a lot and it's really interesting stuff! Chauncey is also the sweetest! He just loves his students so much!",
    "Absolutely take this course. I've never felt so excited to go to lectures and write the papers as I was for this class. Professor Chauncey's lectures are like stories, and I genuinely *wanted* to learn the material. Both academically and personally enriching.",
    "Amazing course -- take it to learn a lot about gay history you would never have expected, to hear Chauncey's amazing lectures, and for a not so difficult history class with papers that are fun to write!",
    "So far, I think this is the best course at Yale. Especially if you identify as queer, you should really consider taking this course. I thought I know a good deal about queer history, but this course still blew my mind. It really gives you a new understanding and appreciation for the gay rights movement and how gay culture has been shaped over the decades. But even if you don't identify as queer, I think you should try to take this course because it is absolutely fascinating. Without a doubt the quirkiest and most entertaining history I've ever heard of. Every decade is completely different and until the 80's there are few trends to be found, as each generation had a different way of dealing with being gay and each generation faced different kinds of persecution.",
    "WGSS 200 is so much fun to take, but it also involves a lot of reading and a not-insignificant amount of writing, especially considering that it's an introductory course. The lectures are amazing, but they won't be available online, so you have to go to class. Many people dropped the class after the midterm, as well. If you're worried about your grades, you should audit this course, at least, because it's really interesting and tells you a lot about how America has changed regarding LGBTQ perception, including at Yale.",
    "An incredible class where you learn a lot about American history. It never stops being interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend this class because I believe it's important knowledge to know and you can't learn this information in any better way.",
    "It's a fun class you can only take at Yale.",
    "A fantastic class that I think should be required for every student of Yale College. It covers material that is so incredibly important to our history, but is hard to find anywhere else. The class is interesting, the readings are almost always fascinating and rarely tedious, and I think that everyone must take a class with Professor Chauncey, because he is an inspiring professor. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Great lecture class if you're looking for something that isn't perhaps in line with what you're going to major in, but is also very interesting. The lectures are all great. Only 2 papers, a midterm, and a final, so it isn't enormous amount of work; there is a lot of reading, which I recommend you do because it is interesting and informative (and can show up on the final exam), but you don't HAVE to do all of it in order to survive in the class.",
    "Let's be honest: you know all about this class already. All of the great rumors are true. This class is irreplaceable and mandatory for anyone trying to get a holistic view of the world around them. If you can fit this into your schedule, definitely do. Some people took it CR\/D\/Fail, but you'll likely find yourself delving more into the course material than you would have thought, so I'd just go ahead and take it for a grade. Grading's fair and relatively lenient. Lecture is phenomenal.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer and the readings are really interesting.",
    "I highly recommend to anyone. This is one of those \"must take\" classes for everyone no matter your major.",
    "Take this class before you graduate. It's a must!",
    "Even if you aren't super interested in the topic, I definitely recommend taking this class. It is a really cool way to learn about American history through a particular lens.",
    "HIST 127 is a great class that is definitely worth taking. The lecture content is interesting, and generally somewhat surprising, and the professor is an engaging speaker.",
    "TAKE IT!!",
    "Us gay and lesbian history is an eye opening class for everyone on the sexual orientation spectrum. Professor Chauncey caters to all levels of knowledge and keeps the class interesting and relevant for the entire semester! Definitely worthwhile!",
    "A strong class that might not be as great as the hype. The first half is really interesting and Chauncey's lectures build an entertaining foundation that will challenge your assumptions about history overall. The second half seems to meander a little bit and sometimes becomes a laundry list of acronyms... The readings are usually interesting, but some of the books are a little dry. The papers and exams are very fair and section is pretty enjoyable. I did feel like the level of analysis was a little below many Yale classes - it often felt like identification of basic trends or ideas were lauded as groundbreaking historical findings.",
    "I recommend!",
    "YES, TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE! You'll learn SO much!!",
    "Very good course would recommend it to anyone. Good fifth class and not too much extra work, but would enjoy going to every lecture.",
    "It is an amazing class! I would recommend it to non-history majors as well since it is a very general course. It's a big class, but you also get a diversity of ideas. It's nice that there's not always one answer, so this is a great humanities credit. You research the history of gay and lesbian life from the early American days until the present, so it's a lot of material. A must-take class!",
    "I highly recommend this course; you learn a history you never would know about otherwise.",
    "Carolee was a truly good-natured TA, who worked hard throughout the semester to accommodate the needs and preferences of every students. I would have liked to see her lead more forcefully during our discussions, however.",
    "The sheer size of the class and amount of information are extremely intimidating, but O learned so much about an important topic that is usually glossed over in our history.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. Gay, straight, pan, bi trans, ace... You learn SO much history that you had no idea existed.",
    "Take this course. Just take it. There's no reason you should not take this course. If you really want a comprehensive understanding of US lesbian and gay history, this is the course for you. Chauncey is an incredible lecturer\/teacher\/man, and this course could very well change your life as it did mine.",
    "Yes, this class is a Yale must-take. Chauncey's a legend.",
    "YES, I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "A phenomenal adventure through an often untold history about a marginalized identity in society, narrated by an incredible professor to the tune of several gay anthems throughout history. Definitely take it.",
    "Must-take. Should be required.",
    "EVERY YALE STUDENT SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. EVERY STUDENT EVERYWHERE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. This history NEEDS to be taught. This history has been shut away for FAR TOO LONG and it is so important that this become a course that everyone takes.",
    "Overall, a great, easy history class that serves as a nice introduction not only into LGBTQ history, but gender\/women's history and 20th century American history at large. Sometimes the lectures do get a bit redundant and long-winded (ie: we spent many lectures discussing bar culture and gay social spaces, perhaps a bit more than was necessary), but a very enjoyable class on the whole.",
    "I would recommend it to another student and I was describe it was a detailed and interesting history of a people that have been marginalized in a long time in our society and seeing how gay and lesbian history has progressed and intersected with other movements is very important.",
    "You learn some of the history in American they declined to tell you in high school even though it was a huge deal.",
    "If you ever wonder what you miss in high school US History, this is a class for you! Chauncey's lecturing is stellar, the readings are numerous but interesting, and the workload is manageable. The one person I know who didn't love this class had already taken quite a bit of upper-level queer theory, so if that's you, maybe shop it and think about whether the historical perspective is interesting to you. Even then, I would very strongly recommend this course!",
    "Yes, definitely! I learned so much about a side of US History that I had no background on, and it really informed a lot of my knowledge of American history as well as my understanding of the present. The oral history paper is great.",
    "A thorough, in depth, interesting history of lesbians and gays in America. Yes absolutely! It's very interesting, relevant information that should be more readily available and widely known!",
    "Comprehensive review of gay and lesbian history in the United States. It was an amazing lecture and definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Would definitely recommend! Take it",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Absolutely AMAZING class. Professor Chauncey is a master of this material and an amazing lecturer. We cover basically the entire history of the gay and lesbian population in the US, with a bit of extra focus on Yale, which helped me relate a little more to the history. All the lectures were fascinating and incredibly engaging. I looked forward to lecture every week. Readings are extensive, but not necessary to do well or understand the material. Grades are based on two papers, a midterm and a final, but all the grading is fair and nothing is too challenging. Whether or not you consider yourself a history person, this is a great class and everyone should take it.",
    "U.S. Gay and Lesbian History is an amazing class that everyone at Yale should take! You learn a great deal about a subject that is important for everyone to know about. I would highly recommend it to another student, because I believe that everyone should know the subject matter, and Prof. Chauncey is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "This class is a great credit\/D. I have friends who rave about it, who lived and breathed it--personally, I found the level of analysis a little lacking. It seems better suited to underclassmen. That being said, Chauncey is wonderful, the TFs seem really devoted to the cause, and it's a history we should all be learning about--much earlier than college, really. I was shocked that I hadn't learned, in any kind of institutional context, about the AIDs crisis, along with plenty of other things. The 3rd paper - in which you interview parents and grandparents about their experiences with\/impressions of gay people - was also a huge plus of this course. Take it if you're looking for a great 5th class!",
    "YES YES YES",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History was everything it was cracked up to be. The lectures were incredibly engaging (as were the films), and I appreciated the humor with which Professor Chauncey approached some of the material. The amount of work and balance between exams\/papers was spot-on. An all-around solid course.",
    "If you are a queer student or are interested in Lesbian and gay issues, this course is a must-take. Chauney was a very good lecturer and the material covered is not only interesting, but will also helps you understand the basis for modern-day stereotypes and ideas about sexuality and gender. The only note that must be made is that this course does cover solely lesbian and gay history, not the history of the LGBT movement as a whole. The only trans issues covered are those that also concern lesbians and gay men and no other identities are discussed. On the upside, Chauncey does make an effort to include as much intersection between class and sexuailty and race and sexuality as possible.",
    "Take it, one of the few classes that actually gives you a practical overview of a history that too few of us have exposure to.",
    "Though I don't know if this class is \"life-changing\" (as had been described to me), I think it's absolutely worth taking. If you have any interest in the topic whatsoever, it's worth the work. However, this isn't an easy history course. You need to be invested.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this to any other student. It's a comprehensive approach to U.S. gay and lesbian history, and really helps tie together a lot of the socio-political issues that our country was experiencing both then and even now.",
    "A really enjoyable class, definitely take it if it sounds even remotely interesting! If you go to lectures and do most of the readings, you'll do well in the class. 2 out of 3 5-6 pg papers, a midterm and final, very manageable workload. I'm glad I took the class as I didn't know much about the subject beforehand.",
    "A must take at Yale. You won't regret it. Good credit d if history is not your thing",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in cultural history, and to any students at all curious about LGBTQ issues.",
    "For sure",
    "LesGay starts from around thr 1600s and runs you through different themes in queer history until you reach the present. It's incredible how much I've learned in this course. The primary sources are especially interesting. Would 100% recommend this course to ANYONE. Great course to take for fun if it's not in your major. We're living through the gay rights movement right now. Know your history. Take this course.",
    "I would recommend Hist 127 to any student--even if you're not a history person! I typically don't love history classes but I really enjoyed this class.",
    "I've been recommending this course to all my friends who ask. It was an incredible experience, and I learned a lot about an area of history I didn't know really existed before this class. I also got the courage to come out to my parents partly because of this class.",
    "Take it please before you graduate!",
    "MUST TAKE",
    "It's a great, interesting class. I would suggest it to anyone.",
    "Great intro course for anyone, especially given the relevancy of the topic in today's political and social worlds. It really is eye opening once you start to think about the social construction of norms and standards.",
    "This is a wonderful class. The lectures are fascinating, the readings are fun, and the assignments are interesting and reasonable. Professor Chauncey is really conscious of challenging a lot of stereotypical narratives about gay history and including difference and nuance along lines of race, gender, and class. This is the exemplar of a well-designed lecture class that the professor obviously has put a lot of thought into, and I think everyone can benefit from taking it. You will understand the culture you live in -- especially the way it treats gender and sexuality -- in so much more detail and with historical perspective.",
    "You might think that this history has nothing to do with you, or will be boring, or preachy, or something, but you are absolutely wrong. I am a straight, white, male, computer science major and this is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Professor Chauncey's lectures are incredible, and the readings are reasonable and fascinating. If you have heard anything about this class, just go to the first lecture and you will be hooked. It is an absolute must-take.",
    "Take it! Be willing to let the term gay have a broader meaning, understand there's a bias towards talking about cis, gay, white men, but take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. I would recommend it to those thinking of studying History, American Studies, of WGSS, since it is a good introductory class for all of them, in my opinion. I would recommend it to people looking for an Hu credit, since it's a gentle introduction to history-class reading and writing. And I would recommend it to all students because it's an important part of history that almost no one knows about. (Plus you can interview your parents for a paper!)",
    "This was a fantastic course! Other students complained about a lack of racial and geographical diversity in the analysis of gay culture and the gay experience over time, but for me, I learned more than I could have ever hoped to about the material that was presented--predominantly about the gay male urban experience. Even without studying, I was so enthralled with the information and subject matter that studying was an enjoyment. This class is a must-take for all Yale students: it will change the way you see the world around you, especially the incredibly liberal world of Yale that we are privileged to belong to.",
    "This was an excellent course. I'm the daughter of lesbians and it was powerful to learn this history - a history that is so often left untold. Highly recommended.",
    "Lesgay is an interesting course, it is a history everyone would be better off for understanding.",
    "Definitely take this course before graduating Yale! It will not only change the way you think about LGBTQ issues and history, but it will also give you an appreciation for how culture is constructed--and its influence on the way you conduct yourself and the life you envision for yourself.",
    "Hands down take it.",
    "This course is a must-take, and perhaps the best lecture I've encountered at Yale. Chauncey is a brilliant lecturer and profoundly knowledgeable in his field -- every moment of every class is engaging, if not downright fascinating. The readings, too, are excellent: varied, insightful, and often very personal. You'll leave the class with a great deal of knowledge in an area of history you're unlikely to have encountered elsewhere, and, moreover, with a new understanding of society's deep influence on our most personal identities and aspirations.",
    "The course is an overview of an often-forgotten history from the colonial era to the present. The lectures are spellbinding and the readings - everything from 1800s diaries to 2000s articles - are surprising and engaging. I would absolutely recommend the course. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that the course is a must for any Yale student who wants to develop their understanding of the present and history of the LGBT community. Take it. TAKE IT.",
    "Do not graduate without taking this class. It is relevant to Yale and generally an amazing experience. I never expected to learn so much about an issue that is already so current in our everyday lives, but I was blown away by the history that surrounds modern-day gay life and movements. I learned so much and enjoyed every second.",
    "A very interesting history class, and probably one of the more relevant ones to our current world. If you're a STEM major, this is fantastic class to audit or take Cr\/D\/F because you can reduce the effort you put into the two 5 page papers and the tests and skip some of the more boring reading (of which there were many). The lectures are very interesting, and Chauncey clearly cares about the field and the quality of his lectures.",
    "kind of a lot of reading per week, but you can do it and they are wonderful - so interesting and unlike any other readings i have had. recommend this class to EVERYONE.",
    "This class covers the aspects of US history that you never learned about before. And let me tell you, they are CRAZY parts! You have to take this.",
    "You should absolutely take this class. It will change your brain and it will change your life. Just be warned that this is NOT a gut class-- you have to dedicate significant time to readings and papers in order to keep up. But definitely take it!!!",
    "ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY take this course. Whether you are a history major, pre-med, or somewhere in between, this course is a must take for everyone at Yale. US Lesbian and Gay history delves into a part of United States history that I have never covered before, and I found it fascinating. The readings are interesting, albeit at times a tad long, and lectures are incredible.",
    "It's a great C\/D\/Fail class because lectures are super interesting, the reading is fun (rarely dry) and the subject is naturally fascinating. Chauncey is also wonderful! I highly recommend it - everyone at Yale should take it!",
    "Lives up to the hype. Definitely take it. I took it even though I didn't have a particular interest in gay and lesbian issues and it ended up being one of my favorite classes thus far.",
    "I'd recommend this course with qualifications. It's engaging-- Chauncey is a great lecturer-- but it's also really limited. We spent the greatest proportion of time on white, middle class gay history. We did not discuss prisons, for example, despite the fact that many gay and lesbian people have been incarcerated and face struggles around mass incarceration. Generally we discussed what gay and lesbian people of colour did in terms of their cultural contributions (the figures we studied were singers, writers, drag ball enthusiasts and so on) rather than their political organizing. You have to memorize a massive amount for the exams, which isn't fun, and he doesn't post lectures online, so it can be tricky if you haven't attended all the classes.",
    "Even if you didn't necessarily dig the first few lectures, I'd strongly recommend this class. Chauncey is bomb. As a straight person, this class helped me understand gay history better and it was also just an amazing class about human. Everyone should take this class.",
    "A history course in US Lesbian and Gay History that covers from the 1600s to the present. Very interesting, not just an overview course but really analyzes why changes occurred over time. Highly recommended.",
    "Take this course! You can get by without doing much of the reading but you'll find you actually want to do the reading because it's really interesting.",
    "An overview of the place of gay men and lesbians in American history from the late 19th century to the 21st century, with a particular focus on the decades following WWII. I would recommend this course, though I would slightly caution history majors as it is not a typical history course. However, I am a history major who prefers military and diplomatic history rather than social history and enjoyed this course. The material is interesting, though not entirely new. I didn't walk away from it feeling enlightened, but I did walk away feeling more informed. The course is very well thought out and organized and Chauncey is truly dedicated.",
    "A very good class that comprehensively covers an important facet of US history.",
    "AMAZING. I don't know how I waited until my senior year to take this, but you can't leave Yale without taking this class. Chauncey is an amazing lecturer and backs up his points so well. The material itself was incredibly interesting.",
    "Yes, 100%. Must take.",
    "Great course and an important topic.",
    "A must take course!",
    "Highly recommend. Important for ANY individual to understand LGBTQ history. The final paper assignment involves interviewing family members about the views on LGTBQ issues and their encounters with LGBTQ individuals--really rewarding to write. A lot of historical anecdotes from the Yale community, which are always fascinating.",
    "Absolutely amazing. No matter what major you are, this course is a must-take during your time at Yale. It will enlighten you and make you view the history of the U.S. from a completely different angle. It will change how you view Yale. Take this no matter what you have to give up for it. The course load is also not too heavy so that is another reason to take it. Also, professor Chauncey rocks!",
    "Definitely take this course at some point during your time at Yale regardless of your major.",
    "This will probably be the most amazing class I will ever take at Yale. Everyone at Yale should take this course to learn about something so relevant to today (the class has definitely gotten more popular). This class gave me a new perspective on so many things and opened my mind to different points of view. It was thought provoking and challenged my opinions, and I know I will continue to reference what I learned in this class for the future. This field is incredibly interesting because it's so new and still growing. I appreciated the essays we were assigned in that they called on us to use skills we'll need in other classes\/in the future (I especially enjoyed the oral history assignment). I only wish this class didn't have to end! Professor Chauncey is a fantastic teacher. He makes the material interesting and relevant to us. I loved that he referred to history at Yale and incorporated music, videos, and more to his lectures to keep it exciting. He made himself seem personable, and I really appreciate that he made an effort throughout the entire semester to get to know his students outside of class. It was amazing to know that my professor had testified in so many cases for gay marriage. It is incredible to know that he is one of the founding historians of this field, and has collaborated with many other key historians as well. He has so much first-hand experience and I loved that he shared it with us. This only downside to this course: There is a lot of reading for this class, and it was sometimes incredibly difficult to finish the reading during busy weeks. As long as you're diligent about spreading it out though, it should be fine. Also, the reading is extremely interesting so that definitely helps!",
    "I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about a history that's simultaneously vitally important today and virtually unknown to the general public. It moves from the 17th century to the present day, the whole way revealing a history that you've likely never heard a shred of. This is the rare class that you'll enjoy getting out of bed to go to lecture for, not least because of Chauncey's engaging teaching style.",
    "This was the history of gay communities, responses to gay people, and looked at related gender issues starting in the colonial time but mostly in starting in the late nineteenth century. We mostly looked at gay men in cities and focused on political and social movements.",
    "It is a big lecture, but it feels smaller than it is. Within the first week, you have an mini-ethnography due, which is frankly why I shopped it last year and didn't take it. It kinda sneaks up on you, but if you can get over that hump, it's not too much work. You choose 2 out of the 3 essays and there is a midterm and final. The last choice of essay is an interview, so if you don't want to interview your parents or grandparents (or find an alternative), you might want to do the first two essays. About the midterm and exam, know the big ideas and back up your opinions with sources. It will not help you to just know facts. Know big picture and big trends and be able to back them up with some specifics.",
    "YES! Fabulous lecture course -- Chauncey is amazing. Sometimes the lectures can be a little unfocused, but if you have any interest in this history at all TAKE IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great credit\/d class since lecture is always very interesting but the reading can be kind of tedious.",
    "Fun and engaging lectures that start off with a song from the time period we are discussing. Anecdotes of people and their diaries supplement the discussions and present vivid images of particular eras. There is an emphasis on gay history during the 20th century, though the class also touches on pivotal events from the 1600s - 1800s and today. I particularly liked the references to Yale in the course and how the university ties in to gay history because it made me feel like part of a larger gay historical experience.",
    "AMAZING!!!! You MUST take this course before you graduate no matter who you are!!",
    "YES YES YES",
    "Take this class! By far one of the best I have taken at Yale, and it definitely lives up the hype. Chauncey is absolutely amazing he is one of the founders of the study of gay and lesbian history, so he knows everything and clearly cares deeply about every lecture and every student in the class. Chauncey made a 300-person lecture feel like a tight community; he read every single student's ethnography, and attempted to learn the names of everyone in the class. His lectures were always engaging, well-organized, and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, it was really interesting",
    "TAKE IT! One of the must take classes before you leave Yale!",
    "As you've probably heard already, this class is amazing. Definitely take it.",
    "Cannot recommend this course enough!",
    "I would recommend this course to two different constituencies. First, my constituency: seniors taking it Credit\/D. Your mind probably won't be blown because you have been around these ideas for several years (even if you've never seen them laid out so distinctly), but you will get to a witness a master story-teller at work, and tie ideas together in a coherent whole. Second, underclassmen taking for a grade. You might have your mind blown, it's a great lecture, and the exams and writing assignments are not terribly difficult."
