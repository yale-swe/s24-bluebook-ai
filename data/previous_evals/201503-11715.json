    "CHNS150 is pretty rigorous in terms of the amount of characters one needs to learn and the amount of time given to do it. But I think it's definitely manageable once you fall into a sort of rhythm. You do have to memorize a lot - especially for oral exams and presentations - and that's pretty hard to do. Aside from that, the class is pretty enjoyable.",
    "*Review from (probably) an A-grade student. Just being honest. Overall, a disappointing and poorly managed course. STRENGTHS: -Tonnes and tonnes of vocabulary. You will learn a lot of words, from sex industry and share certificate to overthrow (a government) and information technology. - People dont mention this in reviews but CHNS 150 is a lot easier than 1st or 2nd year Chinese, especially if youre coming from a summer language program. If you did HBA or PiB, you will probably have a ridiculous advantage over those who didnt. (As a relevant failure: because of this, the classs grammar will feel stale\/repeated, many vocabulary words will feel repeated and the class will mostly fail to challenge you). The workload matches a 1.25 credit course, not a 1.5 one. -Reasonable expectations. For the final exam, unlike first year\/second year, you arent expected to know how to write 1500 challenging words; just know how to recognize them and write some ~200 words. -A well-made final exam, which gave space for personal expression and had interesting figure out the words meaning from context questions! Such activities enrich the learning experience. -Listening to and engaging with other peoples oral presentations (from those on environmental conservation and ageing populations to separatism and China-Africa ties) was always a rich and welcome experience. WEAKNESSES: -Great discrepancy between Li and Mu Laoshi. Li Laoshi mostly knows how to teach but Mu Laoshi just spends the entire class making you memorize the textbook or figuring out how to play Youtube videos. He also cannot figure out how to explain nuanced grammatical differences to students. -Poor teaching methods in class one slide would have a very random list of grammar points and words and every week, we would struggle to adequately discuss word usage and grammar points. Important, similar meaning words like were never differentiate with nuance during class these common-English meaning words should be recognized by the teacher (not the student) and presented in the form of slides. This was sometimes done () but it was not enough! -Neglect. This course caters to non-heritage, non-ultra-fluent students and unlike first year, it felt like no one really cared if we truly mastered the language. The teachers in first year were wayyy more committed, rigorous and efficient. In the final exam, we were allowed to pretty freely use pinyin. We did translations in class but the ones in the exams were always harder\/never discussed. No one was encouraged to reject mediocrity\/go the extra mile\/learn new vocabulary outside the classroom\/use previous grammar structures. The most mediocre and standard essays normally got the highest scores. -Horrible tutorials with TAs who dont care. The tutorial time is dedicated to preparation for the oral test during which you regurgitate the textbook content to the TA\/try to memorize it. Very boring and not natural. -Over-emphasis on the content of the stories in the book rather than independent thought, debate, speaking or writing ability. -Very very poor course book. The grammar points are explained very poorly without any attempt to distinguish between really similar ones. The stories are boring, ridiculous and poorly written. Ive been to Harvard and their book is much better and has a systematic progression to it dialogue, word list, pages for grammar and finally, a culture\/history section in English. -An imbalanced grade distribution in which some things are weighed too highly (oral test, traditional characters) and some things weighed too little (presentations, written tests).",
    "Chinese is really great, if you're dedicated. That's the thing though: you have to really like Chinese in order to succeed in this class.",
    "I did L1\/L2 freshman year, did the L3\/L4 summer with Light, then didn't study Chinese sophomore year and took this class junior fall. I regret it. I should have continued in sophomore fall, because I lost a lot of my fluency having not studied it for that year. I'm happy I took it now, because I now remember a lot of the stuff I had forgotten. Having said that, this portion is less well-taught compared to your other experiences studying Chinese at Yale or at HBA\/PIB\/Duke. Continue with it though. Its worth taking it to stay in touch with the language otherwise you'll lose it very quickly."
