   "comments": [
    "Great class, interesting readings. Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely take it with Kapustin. A lot of reading but not a ton of work.",
    "This course was an outstanding survey of Western intellectual history (specifically economic, ethical, and political thought). The amounts of reading were just right, Professor Kapustin's explanations of the texts and elucubrations of their larger significance were remarkable (if you have the chance to take it with Professor Kapustin, do so!), and the thinkers we read were selected so that we saw how they were all participating in a conversation over the centuries, part of a cultural and intellectual tradition with certain recurrent themes and concerns. If you took DS, this was like DS redux, with some different authors and less work. The workload was manageable, with approximately 80 to 100 pages of reading a week and a midterm and final exam comprising the written assignments for the course. If you're an EP&E major, you have no choice but to take it, but even if you're not an EP&E major, I would recommend taking this class if there's room.",
    "Absolutely. Get Kapustin if at all possible.",
    "Take this class specifically with Professor Kapustin!",
    "Absolutely. Not just because it is required for the EPE major. You get a full understanding of critical works, and read modern philosophy that you might not otherwise get the chance to analyze in other courses.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially those interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of society and political thought.",
    "readings are great",
    "It is a great class with Professor Kapustin. The size of the class and the philosophical focus intimidated me somewhat, making participation a bit hard. The readings, midterm, and final paper are all very manageable.",
    "As I signed up for this class, a surge of dread shot up my spine. I was completely terrified of taking a philosophy class, especially after hearing about Kapustin's brilliance. But, as soon as I walked in, that fear subsided. Kapustin is a captivating lecturer, he sucks you in and when the class ends two hours later, you wonder where the time went. He is extremely available in office hours and the feedback he provides on papers is extensive, helpful, and ingsightful. A real \"Yale\" class that will stimulate you intellectually and spiritually.",
    "Absolutely yes. One of the best classes ever."
