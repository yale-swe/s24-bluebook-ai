   "comments": [
    "Learned to think about architecture and space in a different, new way. Learned how to draw architecture in ways other than just observation drawing.",
    "I have learned how to understand the world and express my ideas through visual ways.",
    "Every time I left the classroom I would notice something new about the built world around me. This class was fantastic in opening my eyes to aspects of architecture I had never considered. I also began to learn how to draw and experiment with different media.",
    "I learned to look at architecture and the built environment in a different way, to pay attention to totally different things--light, and material, and space. I also learned about history and architectural styles, and that I can draw, if I put in the time and effort.",
    "This course taught me how to appreciate the link between people and the spaces they live in. I also learned how to be less of a perfectionist, which (ironically enough) led to my drawings getting better!",
    "How to see architecture. Rather than analyzing or learning technical or historical aspects of architecture, it focused on almost philosophical and aesthetic interpretation of architecture. It also allowed me to experience what architecture as a field is like - using drawing as the main medium for communication, crits etc. - which was very interesting and something unique to Yale.",
    "I took Intro to Arch because I had previous art background in high school and wanted to do a drawing class for fun. I'm a biochemistry major and left this class seriously considering the architecture major. That's how amazing this course and Professor Purves are! I loved each one of his lectures - this is the first class I've taken in college in which I did NOT fall asleep in class. Each lecture explored a new topic and showed us how to see the buildings and spaces around us. This is a skill that is not easily taught but Prof. Purves did an amazing job. I also learned how to communicate the spacial experience through drawings.",
    "Intro to Architecture has been one of the most wonderful classes I have taken at Yale. Even though I am not an architecture major, it was so easy to grasp all of the concepts presented in class and in section. It's the kind of class that makes you think different about the physical world and will make you into someone more insightful.",
    "I series of introductory architecture lectures with time spent on theory, design, history, etc.: nothing groundbreaking in that aspect, but good foundational material. Weekly assignments were more interesting, and played well into the architectural peculiarities of the Yale campus.",
    "I learned how to see, and how to translate what I see onto the page in drawn form.",
    "I gained an ability to see buildings and design in a new and unconventional way. Of course, I also learned a lot about introductory architecture ideas and found that the connection between architecture and other aspects of life was much greater than I had imagined.",
    "Visual\/ spatial thinking, design process. Drawing instruction it self was very limited",
    "I definitely gained more exposure to dealing with design in space.",
    "I learned so much over the course of the semester about architecture itself, how to appreciate it, and notable architects. I also improved my drawing skills greatly and learned different way to convey visual information about a building in my drawings. I feel I gained a lot of insight into the amount of creativity and consideration that has to go into a piece of architecture. This course definitely changed the way I see things and made me become more observant and appreciative of my surroundings, especially on campus.",
    "While I already had a good amount of exposure to architecture, ARCH 150 got me thinking about spaces in new ways and forced me to draw the spaces that inspire me regularly.",
    "I learned a lot about how to use drawings to convey my ideas. And I learned to appreciate architecture around me.",
    "I loved this course, it definitely opened my eye to many different ways of thinking and made me question not just the buildings but everything that includes a design process around me. I really enjoyed the structure of the class with the section meetings and sketchbook assignments.",
    "We spent most of our sections critiquing and developing our drawing skills, not only in how to draw but how to convey ideas through drawing.",
    "It definitely gave me a new way to appreciate architecture, which is exactly what I wanted. I felt myself compelled to \"look up\" more and to be less precious with everythingwith my sketches, with my creativity, with my ideas.",
    "Architectural thinking, how to observe and critically analyze different types of architecture. Fundamental drawing and building skills of architecture.",
    "you need to physically work with your material and parameters when building something. the more you sketch the better you get at sketching and seeing. how to see. I also appreciate lampshades a lot more. You can make weird architectural works as long as you are able to explain your logic; seems to be true of art in general",
    "This is one of those classes that literally changes the way you see things. I look at buildings and spaces completely differently now. There are so many beautiful buildings on Yale's campus that I never stopped to appreciate - the Center for British Art or Rudolph Hall, for example. I look at the arches of Gothic windows much more closely after having spent hours drawing one, and I think about the plan of my residential college and how it was arranged to facilitate meeting spaces. I also learned so much about drawing and model building in this course. My drawing skills improved so much over the course of the semester and I have a much easier time now translating what I see onto paper, something that had always been frustrating for me. This was all presented in a very non-stressful way -- I was never worried about my sketchbook assignments, I just wanted to do a good job on them and spend a lot of time because I wanted them to be as perfect as they could be. The final lamp was one of the rare instances where I was purely proud and satisfied with something I'd made. This class made me want to take more architecture classes for the rest of my time at Yale and keep learning more about this incredible topic, because this really was just the tip of the iceberg.",
    "As Professor Purves first advertises at the beginning of this course, ARCH 150 teaches you how to see- I've grown to be much more analytical, observant, and aware in how I occupy space, understand the human interactions and dynamics that unfold naturally in and are supported by particular spaces, and how the built landscape - in its surface-level ubiquity - is an omnipresent agent in shaping our human experience. I learned how to examine light and materiality, from the smallest details to entire cities, and why\/how certain design decisions are made and their repercussions. This course is also an excellent introduction to drawing and drafting.",
    "You learn to look at buildings a different way",
    "I learned how to look at my surroundings with a new appreciation for the thought and design process that went into conceptualizing these spaces.",
    "I learned much about the basics of architecture, and although I have not mastered any concepts from this class, I can speak of and analyze architecture in a sensible way that I could not have done before. I appreciate the wide range of topics this class covers, although personally, I more enjoyed the material from the first half of the course.",
    "I had always been interested in architecture, but had never had a formal introduction to the discipline. This course was that introduction, and it could not have been better. I was able to learn about different elements in architecture, architectural theory, drawing, and more. Professor Purves's weekly drawing assignments were really helpful in understanding our material and communicating it in sketches. I had never drawn for a class before, but the TAs were very helpful. This is not a history of architecture, as Professor Purves will jump around to different time periods in order to illustrate his points, but this gave me a more holistic view of the course material.",
    "I look at buildings with a lot more care now, and I'm probably a better drawer."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I truly have no idea if I even have grades posted in the this class or not.",
    "I think it went very well with interesting lectures and then drawing assignments. I think the paper was not as effective in learning about buildings around us.",
    "This is a really great class for anyone who has or has not drawing background. As someone who has zero drawing background, I see my potential on developing visual thinking skills from the lectures and sections.",
    "Prof. Purves has fantastic lectures which are clear and engaging. I think the examples he uses for each topic are excellent in that some are familiar and some we've never seen anything like. The drawing assignments were challenging. There was one drawing workshop but it wasn't enough; I would've liked to have a few more drawing workshops. Section could be improved if it were more interactive. It tended to just be the TFs commenting on each student's work individually, so you'd just have to sit there while they said things about everyone else (which you can certainly learn from, but it's hard to stay engaged). It would be better to let others comment as well.",
    "There were too many readings; so many that with my other courses, I ended up not having time to do any of them because I would look at the syllabus and see a long list of things to read. That was a shame, since a lot of the readings were important, core architectural texts. However, readings were not brought up in lecture too often, and assignments didn't usually require them either. But Professor Purves' lectures are amazing and so interesting, and the assignments and section really helped me learn and grow.",
    "This course was very well structured. Every lecture was well planned, the TFs were on top of their game and the syllabus\/schedule was very clear. The assignments were a consistent amount of work, but definitely not too much. This course was very \"slow but steady,\" which reflects how well taught it was.",
    "The lectures are amazing, the readings really interesting, and the sketchbook homework\/design problems really engaging. I absolutely loved every aspect of this class. You could choose the level of engagement\/commitment to this class, and the more time and effort you put into it, the more you got out of it.",
    "Both design projects were fun and the drawings were interesting too! Purves' lectures were always engaging and the TAs super helpful. No weaknesses - except it almost turned me into an architecture major.",
    "Professor Purves was a wonderful lecturer, and the assignments were very well structured and feedback was much appreciated. I think more clarity regarding the expectations for the assignments and posting the assigments sooner would be appreciated.",
    "The course could be improved by required individual checkpoint meetings with teaching assistants to review sketchbook progress and to receive constructive feedback.",
    "First, Professor Purves is always so excited to teach which makes the class engaging and interesting. The TA's were incredible and the assignments were very thought-provoking. I think the one downfall was that there were quite a few readings each week that weren't used much in class or section and therefore felt a little irrelevant.",
    "Maybe could include more optional drawing tutorials. Would prefer more feedback too.",
    "Intro to architecture was a solid course. It was taught more like an art class than a history class, which I appreciated. Rather than organizing lectures chronologically, each lecture explored a different field or design principle within architecture. I really liked this approach, but I did not leave the class feeling like I knew much more about architecture than I did coming in, and I wonder if the class would have benefitted from some structure. My other complaint is that a student's experience in this course seemed to depend on their TAs. I found the class to be pretty easy and chill, while my friends in other sections found the class much more challenging. When it came time for the final review, students in my TAs' sections produced worse work. I was happy to have a lighter workload, but I think future iterations of this class should strive for consistency across sections in terms of workload.",
    "We were not getting grades so I had no idea how I was doing throughout the course. I also wish the paper were optional and we could do another project instead of that.",
    "The course is excellent in all aspects. It gives an excellent introduction into all areas of architecture without being overwhelming. The only weakness for me was trying to understand what to make of architectural theory and how to apply it because it is so intimidatingly broad.",
    "The sections were very helpful, though I think more could be provided in the way of advanced drawing tutorials.",
    "The second half of the course was kind of disorganized. I hope there weren't that many guest lectures and the course material in the second half could be more focused.",
    "One negative thing about the course would be that you have no idea what grade you are gonna get at all. You get midterm reviews and sketchbook reviews and there is a paper. But all the feedback you get are written and nothing is quantified till the very end. So right now, I really have no idea what grade awaits me.",
    "The material is very interesting! Lecture was always filled with a lot of information. I wish there was more transparency with grading, however.",
    "The lecture is AMAZING...Purves just makes everything look and sound so cool! And sketching in class was fun too, a nice reprieve from break...the in-class teaching portion was definitely the highlight.",
    "This course was the perfect combination of architecture theory\/history (learning about the greats: the Pantheon, Louis Kahn, Prairie House) and practice (drawing a plan of my suite, building a stage out of foam-board planes). I loved taking notes in my sketchbook in class, and I woke up excited to go to section on Friday. The only suggestion I have for improvement is that the readings were very auxiliary to the class. I almost never did them because they were completely unnecessary to success in the class, and on weeks I did, I didn't necessarily feel that they added a lot to my experience of the lectures or the assignment.",
    "The lectures were all incredible! Professor Purves's passion and expertise in his field is evident and electric. I particularly love that the course stresses handwritten\/drawn notes- putting pen to paper to highlight details of a slide image really helps to keep you engaged in lecture and to hone your observation skills.",
    "there should be more teaching on how to draw\/sketch buildings for the assignments as this is an intro course",
    "I appreciate the wide range of topics this class covers, although personally, I more enjoyed the material from the first half of the course.",
    "This course has excellent lectures, a great set of TAs, and assignments that are both unique among other Yale courses. The final assignment can be either a paper or a model, but since everyone does the model, I question why they bother to even give the paper as an option. It's a great introduction to architecture!",
    "Non guest lectures are a great strength: really engaging even at 9am. Guest lectures were interesting but their powerpoints weren't as solid and the material didn't always integrate as well (probably valuable for intended majors though). Assignments were fair and helped me learn, sections were always fun. Biggest weakness is not having any clue about grades: the laid back and text based evaluation (rather than giving grades on things) induces a lot of unnecessary stress"

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this course for anyone whether they're thinking of majoring in architecture or not.",
    "Yes, I took it as somebody with no architecture background or desire to major in architecture, so it was a great way for anybody to learn about buildings and space.",
    "This is a really great class for anyone who has or has not drawing background. As someone who has zero drawing background, I see my potential on developing visual thinking skills from the lectures and sections. This is a great class for everyone!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this. It will really open your eyes. Sketchbook assignments are interesting and a nice change from psets or essays.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's not a large workload, and the work it does have is so different than the work you'll be doing in other courses, that it's a fun variation. Most assignments are drawings in your sketchbook, and there's one essay and one final project, to design a lampshade. The work is a lot of fun, and lectures are so interesting, that I'd recommend this even if you're not intending to do architecture.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm a STEM major with a budding interest in architecture, and honestly I wasn't planning on taking this class at all. I shopped the first lecture and just had to continue with it. The lectures are so interesting and there are no exams. You grade comes from weekly drawing assignments that are based more on improvement than skill level, a design problem, a short 3-4 page paper, and a well-defined final project or paper. Sure, you don't get definitive grades throughout the semester, but you get a lot of feedback from your TAs and can mostly tell if you're doing well throughout the course. I literally used the assignments as a study break from my other more intense classes, and you learn a ton about architecture through the really engaging lectures. Do yourself a favor and take this class. The humanities credit is merely a bonus to all you get from the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Though I have no intention of pursuing architecture as a major or a career, I always looked forward to lecture and section. The assignments were enjoyable, and it was a relief to work on something that wasn't a paper or a problem set. I learned so much about the way that architecture relates to society and history and I now feel like I can appreciate the power of buildings a lot more. Also, Professor Purves is INCREDIBLE! His lectures consisted only of pictures, but somehow he was always able to talk for 50 minutes and link everything together so gracefully. Even if you're only vaguely (or not at all) interested in architecture, take the course just for Professor Purves.",
    "Prof Purves is just amazing. His lectures will change the way you see architecture completely. It's quite different from other courses at Yale, since we have architectural sketchbook assignments and design problems, but it's been a really exciting challenge for me. Also, studying architecture as a liberal arts course is something that you can only do at Yale! You should totally take this class!",
    "I took Intro to Arch because I had previous art background in high school and wanted to do a drawing class for fun. I'm a MB&B major and left this class seriously considering the architecture major. That's how amazing this course and Professor Purves are! The lectures are engaging and the drawings\/design projects fun. Take it!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Drawing can be fun and will be a nice change of pace from writing, reading and doing problem set.s",
    "I think this class can benefit majors (who would be taking it out of necessity) and non-majors alike. It's a fairly simple and straightforward class that does what it says in the title.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for all students at Yale, particularly those who do not have a strong background in architecture, as it is a very accessible overview class, though I found that diving into assignments and spending lots of time thinking about my approaches to them was very rewarding.",
    "Yes, the course has low workload, but there is a lot of learning to be done",
    "It doesn't matter if you're an architecture student or even anything related to design, taking this course helps you to look at the world in a different way which I will always recommend.",
    "It's a good class, especially if you like drawing. I thought it was pretty easy, but the level of difficulty depends on how critical your TAs are. Lecture is interesting and the readings are never mentioned in either lecture or section.",
    "People may say that this class has quite a bit of work, but I didn't really feel that and enjoyed every part of it. The final project is also cool - not as burdensome because you don't need to go up and present it with a speech, and you can just look at all the types of design people have made. Not too sure about how much the weekly assignments really improved my drawing or \"architectural\" sense but the TAs were so friendly and accessible, and Professor Purves taught me how to appreciate the different architecture we see on Yale campus. It's true that you don't know your grade until the very end, but I would say worth it and overall a great semester!",
    "Yes! This is a great course for students to learn to appreciate the architecture around them more. One learns to perceive and depict things in different ways. The course is a good mix of intellect and creativity. In order to do well, this course does require a bit of work and genuine interest. Section is mandatory because that is where your assignments are evaluated, but it is genuinely helpful and the TAs really push you to expand your boundaries.",
    "Yes - this course is a must for anyone remotely interested in architecture",
    "I would definetely recommend this class to everyone, not just architecture majors. The course lets you think differently and I think everyone needs that \"educated eye\" insight.",
    "Yes! This class is very fun, for everyone, not just architecture students.",
    "I took it Cr\/D and would highly recommend that...I have no idea what my grade was the entire semester, and though I suspect that everyone does well, the strengths of the class are the lecture part. Drawing is fun, but was not something I wanted to put a lot of time into and thus section ended up being kind of a dragit was fun to see other people's work though! Honestly, the best way to take this class would be to get a small sketchpad for in class drawing and then just audit. The value is in Purves' lectures and slides.",
    "yes, but i would tell them that you get what you put in to the course",
    "I cannot recommend this class highly enough!!!! This is one of those classes that literally changes the way you see things. I look at buildings and spaces completely differently now. There are so many beautiful buildings on Yale's campus that I never stopped to appreciate - the Center for British Art or Rudolph Hall, for example. The course is the perfect combination of architecture theory\/history (learning about the greats: the Pantheon, Louis Kahn, Prairie House) and practice (drawing a plan of my suite, building a stage out of foam-board planes). Your drawing skills will improve so much over the course of the semester and by the end you'll be able to represent the things you see on paper, which is a really satisfying ability. The workload usually isn't terrible -- weekly drawing assignments that you discuss in section with your TFs, and two longer design problems that take more time but are pretty fun. Purves is one of those low-key great lecturers -- he speaks pretty softly and everyone stays quiet to catch every word. You'll learn so much in this class and drawing assignments are such a nice break from readings and psets and papers. Whether or not you're considering the architecture major (I wasn't) this class is incredibly worthwhile. There's no letter-grade feedback all semester so I don't know if I got an A or a C, but it's one of those things where you try really hard on all of the assignments because you want them to be perfect for you.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic course that is highly relevant regardless of your field of study. You learn how to be a conscientious inhabitant of the built environment; the course adds new dimensions to your daily routine- you begin to pause to look at the joints of a building or admire light streaming in through glass.",
    "This is a great course - there are weekly assignments that challenge you but aren't to difficult. The professor is sweet.",
    "Yes, especially if you are considering majoring in architecture.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It was engaging, interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as long as you know that there is a significant workload to be expected!",
    "Yes. I took this class credit\/D as a senior but very much enjoyed the experience. I learned much about the basics of architecture, and although I have not mastered any concepts from this class, I can speak of and analyze architecture in a sensible way that I could not have done before. I appreciate the wide range of topics this class covers, although personally, I more enjoyed the material from the first half of the course.",
    "This is a fantastic course--for architecture students and non-architecture students alike. The course material is super-interesting and very accessible to people of all disciplines and majors. The TAs are a big help with the weekly drawing assignments. If you have any interest in architecture, take this course!",
    "This is a great Credit D class, or even one to audit. It's not so much that anyone gets a horrible grade, but the infuriating lack of transparency around grades doesn't affect you if you take it credit D which allows you to enjoy the drawing and not put a ton of time in when you have a bad week. Lectures are seriously so fascinating and I look at buildings totally differently now. I didn't do the reading, but it didn't seem like anyone did unless they were really trying to be an architecture major. I'm sure the reading is interesting so if you have time do it, but it won't improve your grade at all so the credit D advice still stands. Course is super well designed: lots of thought put into the structure in ways you'll appreciate. Take with a friend or two!"
