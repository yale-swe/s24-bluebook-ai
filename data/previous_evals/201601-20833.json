   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course if the teacher is solid. The curriculum is okay: easier than L3 but also less fun and fulfilling. Find yourself a good professor and all will be well.",
    "Span 140 is a fun class that helps you to become more comfortable speaking and reading Spanish. It also focuses on teaching about the culture in various Spanish speaking countries. I would recommend this course, as the readings are generally interesting and make for good discussion during class time.",
    "The course is honestly fairly average--there's fairly helpful review of grammar, but as is a trend with the Spanish department, there's an overabundance of strange and somewhat unnecessary passages\/short stories. Some have interesting relevance to the course\/culture, but others are a little too complicated and irrelevant. Prof. Simonet makes the whole thing--he approaches the process and his students in a way that cuts through the actual bureaucracy of the course and makes it so much more enjoyable.",
    "If you are considering taking a spanish class, you should definitely take it with Jose Simonet. He is a fantastic teacher and an all around great guy. He takes his job seriously and works hard, but he does so in a laid-back manner that makes the class really enjoyable.",
    "Small daily assignments and in-class discussions lead to large improvements in speaking and writing abilities.",
    "Learning the fun part of spanish and actually helpful terms in a great and interesting way. The teachers are fantastic and want you to succeed.",
    "Take this class if you want to become better at Spanish. The syllabus focuses primarily on improving the student's grasp of grammar and being able to write proficiently in Spanish. Proficient=\/= fast. Very bearable if you're not a whiz at Spanish. grading is fairly straightforward and fair. Not necessarily a fun class but not impossible to get an A in",
    "One does not really learn anything super new that is useful to be conversational in Spanish. its a fine course a lot of work but either you have to take it or you want to and there is no other option. Also it depends on the teacher so find a good section."
