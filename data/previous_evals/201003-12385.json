    "Sarita Kwok knows everything. It's so fun to be in her class. This class was the joy of my life. So fun, so little stress, but so instructive too. I heard so many new fantastic pieces which have become some of my favorites. If you are even remotely interested in classical music, this is a class to take.",
    "A relatively light course that improves listening skills. Great teacher.",
    "This is an outstanding class, that will get you to think about music in new ways, and will broaden your horizons. As it is a half-credit, there is very little homework in the class, but class meetings are challenging and engaging. I had this class at 9:15, and I was always excited to start my day with it.The only things I did not like about this class were the keyboard labs, which teach continuo figured bass playing, but don't really seem to be closely linked to the subject matter of the course. They seem to belong somewhere else.Overall, though, this is a class that I would recommend highly to any music devotee, music major or not.",
    "This class is just wonderful... if waking up two times a week to listen to classical music and write it down sounds appealing to you, then this class is definitely worth it. We never really had homework to speak of, though Sarita was very helpful whenever we didn't quite get something in class. There is a figured bass section in addition to the class- just to let you know- but it's only a half hour a week and really is fun."
