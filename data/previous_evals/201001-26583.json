    "The studio remained at a building scale and dealt more with surface geometry than landscape, planning, or structures. However, Greg was direct in his wish that we attempt to produce volume not from accumulation of mass but from a buildup of surface. This shows foresight, and the studio was generally successful in adopting this approach.",
    "I don't think it was the intention to coordinate with the related disciplines of landscape, planning, or structures.",

   "comments": [
    "Pacing of major pinups was good. It might have helped to have had at least one major interim review with guests. Class discussions were vigorous and the final jury was formidable and impressive.",
    "The most valuable aspect was Greg's ability to diagram a project. At the same time, a more in-depth discussion of each project would have been more helpful later in the semester.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was the general discussions regarding the aspirations the studio which usually occurred in group sessions or at formal reviews.Many of the discussions during the studio trip were very helpful and could have taken place earlier in the year.",
    "The most valuable aspects of the studio were a.) learning and using new technologies, b.) pedagogically interrogating the sequence of a studio - ie. not being given the site until after midterm c.) the use of precedent - both Ledoux and Le Corbusier and d.) Greg Lynn was amazing at diagramming and I think we all learned a lot from his ability to quickly dissect a project and draw it's main ideas and possible formal responses.The least valuable aspects were a.) The critics short visits that were often changed at the last minute b.) Lynn's lack of clarity in terms of the goals of the studio and his own practice - Yes, we understood that we were dealing with \"massiveness and surface\" but, some of the other aspects - ie. his use of a loaded site were not made explicit and at times seemed not thought through by the critic. It seemed that he had reasons for certain approaches both architecturally and pedagogically, but didn't let us in on that - which is a shame because I think we were all thirsty for that.",
    "Because Greg\u0092s schedule was erratic, the studio would have been better served by a series of established deadlines and deliverables, perhaps from the assistant instructor. Week to week, it was unclear whether we were supposed to resolve our studio projects in particular ways. When we pinned up, it seemed like the projects were susceptible to change completely. Even though Greg had said at the outset that the site would not be of consequence until after midreview, by placing the site in an historically significant context, he seemed to push aside our original focus: tectonic explorations in surface form and interior expression."

    "great studio!Greg Lynn is an excellent teacher and a master of the subject.Having no site for half of the semester really makes students to focus on developing architectural idea. Every meeting with Greg was valuable and learned so much from each pin up.Creating architecture through surface was a bit new to me at the beginning, but as the semester goes, and as Greg explained and showed all the examples from the trip, everything made much more sense!",
    "It's probably not a good idea at Yale to hedge bets and take on a major from the middle of the semester. One way is simply to take it on early, as is conventionally done. This leaves plenty of time to develop robust schemes which are sensitive to the site without being obsequious. The other is to remain siteless and, in the case of Ledoux, address purely issues of massiveness, blankness, surfacing, detail, rustication etc. This approach is arguably more in keeping with discourse today with regard to ornamentation and facadism. It also makes clear that the withholding or elimination of site forces students to produce strong, coherent geometric strategies as opposed to simply extrapolating Enlightenment organizations into the generating lines for a project.As always, more questions than answers. What are viable approaches for applying contemporary form-making strategies to loaded sites? Does flat-out juxtaposition ala Koolhaas work? How can we generate a constructive dialogue without imitating older processes or sacrificing the ability of our work to stand alone?",
    "This was an excellent studio to learn a specific process of design.",
    "I wouldn't say that the studio's function as a pedagogical tool relied on the elements of program, schedule, or production. I think the pedagogy of the studio was about making form and space using an architectural language (surface) that most of us haven't fully explored before. It was engaging surface not as a piece or part of a building, but as the total language of the design, with many different possibilities about its articulation depending on the specific ideas of the project.I think Greg could have been more straightforward or upfront with the conceptual ideas of surface in architecture and engaged us much more on a theoretical level than necessarily just a critique of form (which is how much of the discussions in studio felt).",
    "The support and encouragement of students to explore and develop an unfamiliar formal language was one of the main strengths of the studio.The agenda of the studio was stated at the beginning, but never clearly defined and till the end seemed like a contradictory ambition.The decision to withhold the site until after the midterm resulted in a lack of time discuss its implications and to fully develop and articulate position towards such a site.",
    "See above",
    "Not having a site for the first half was fine, but being placed across the street from Ledoux\u0092s Salines confused the original objectives. The studio changed course and started to focus on exterior massing after midreview. If the site becomes so significant, then siting, organization, and final output should be worked out so that the studio can continue to work on original digital research while testing it against these new parameters."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I expected to be able to engage new techniques of form generation and this was fulfilled. I expected more time to be spent on research and site analysis, though it was refreshing to take a studio that broke free from the default framework.",
    "My expectations weren't necessarily met for this studio, but that's a good thing. I was concerned that the studio, pedagogically, would be focused on the tools (digital 3d modeling) as the generator of architectural form. I was pleasantly wrong about that - I think the form was driving what tools we used and how we controlled them.",
    "I expected a more catered and advanced instruction of the digital tools that were a necessity in cultivating an enriched project for this studio. Though the workshop conducted by Cody Davis were well done, they were more general and catered more towards other studios and also could have been conducted earlier in the semester.",
    "In a few ways my expectations were exceeded - but, overall in the end I was disappointed that the studio and Greg Lynn's ideas were not clear enough to really evaluate and critique the work. At times it seemed too surface, as in lack of rigor and focus. There were a lot of unanswered questions like - why Ledoux (other than platonic form and massiveness) or why chose such a loaded site (other than to place next to historically relevant project)... The reason for disappointment is that the sense is that there was a lot of thought into these questions, but we just weren't let in to that discussion. Maybe this is simply due to the fact that we didn't see him much over the term.",
    "I hoped to develop a studio project with a focused, rigorous study of the translation between the digital and physical in massing, surface, and form. The studio was not structured for this. It supported projects with a stated position towards the historical precedent in the end."

    "Brennan was available and punctual. His criticism showed strong intuition and a sense for picking out what the student missed. He was successful in pushing clarity of big ideas while allowing for personal exploration.",
    "Greg has the amazing ability to read a project almost instantly and see a multitude of options for its articulation and development. He was great at always pushing our projects beyond our conceptions of them, while also being aware what we as individuals needed for our growth as designers.It was also greatly appreciated that Brennan and Greg were so clearly \"in sync\" in their approach to the studio. By that I mean that, in Greg's absence, I always felt that Brennan was very effective at conveying Greg's ideas and intentions for the studio. I never felt as if we weren't making progress or getting great criticism and feedback between Greg's visits. Brennan kept us all pushing our projects forward throughout the semester.",
    "Greg is a fantastic educator and instructor. I give my highest endorsement of this semester.",
    "Prof. Lynn has an incredible ability to absorb and digest the architectural ideas put forth by students and represent them in a more abstract, succinct and potent way. However the tendency towards offering constructive ways forwards rather than a critical evaluation of the work tended to weaken rather than strengthen the projects.The assistant teacher was available and willing to offer feedback but could have benefited by focusing the discussion towards the main agenda of the studio and also by offering more technical advice as well.",
    "see above. and, Brennan Buck was amazingly organized, thoughtful in responses and has an incredible ability to discern what type of study (a physical model, computer modeling, drawing...) would push the project to the next level."
