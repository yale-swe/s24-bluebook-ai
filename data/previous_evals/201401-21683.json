   "comments": [
    "DO NOT TAKE IT...unless you really have to. Yes, public finance and econ is important, but not sure how much you'll get from this class.",
    "It's an interesting field course. No strong opinions about it.",
    "If you are interested in politics, public publics and America then take the class!",
    "Pretty interesting class that is pretty painless. Exams can be pretty tricky if you don't study. Problem Sets are surprisingly very difficult. You should actually start them early.",
    "It is a great class because it teaches you about policy issues that are being debated today. The lectures suck, though, and there are only 6 problem sets but they are very long.",
    "Definitely take this if you like politics or policy and are an Econ major.",
    "Very interesting application of Micro concepts. More writing heavy than I would have thought, but it made me more knowledgeable about real world concepts like Social Security and Health Insurance. It incorporated many important topics and was very heavy on incentives. I feel much more knowledgeable about the world after taking the course. Problem sets were hard and exams weren't easy, but most people didn't go to class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "interesting material. lectures weren't the most engaging, and the grading was kind of arbitrary it seemed at times. but if you are interested in understanding the government's concerns with their policies from the economic perspective, you get that!",
    "Pretty standard class. Not the best not the worst. Psets are long tests are fair.",
    "If you're considering this class you're probably an econ or polisci major. If you're polisci I wouldn't recommend it unless you have background in econ. As econ electives go this class wasn't great. The exams weren't terrible but the problem sets were pretty bad (they're assigned every other week). Not sure if I would recommend this class unless you have a serious interest in public finance....",
    "Interestingly enough, I would highly recommend it more for a political science major and only moderately recommend it for an econ major. Econ majors need to be aware that tests are very qualitative and not the typical plug and chug econ exams.",
    "The textbook is great. You don't need to go to lecture. If you read the textbook, you will get an A.",
    "The class material was interesting especially if you want to know about insurance, taxes, public policy etc. But the class wasn't fairly graded pset and exam wise.",
    "Not while sobber",
    "Yes, it won't be the most inspiring course, but the material will serve as a very strong basis for analysin economic policy and its implications.",
    "I would recommend it if you really want to learn about economic policy, taxation, public goods, etc. The course definitely helps you understand those topics better. The content is quite econ-heavy; the psets have a lot of calculations. So take it if you like economics.",
    "Useful stuff to know!",
    "Yes if you are either interested in political economy or looking for an easy economic credit.",
    "Good class, lecture and readings are very overlapped. Focus is more on conceptual things on exams and more on quantitative things on psets",
    "A course concerning public policy and finance. You get into topics such as health care, taxes, public goods, moral hazard, insurance etc. These topics are extremely interesting and can be applied to various other sectors or majors. I would recommend the course to those who have particular interest in working in public finance, it may be a tad dry for those who have little interest in the aforementioned topics."
