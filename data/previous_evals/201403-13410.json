    "This course is very useful with regards to becoming a better drawer and ultimately painter. The extent to which it helped me understand form was remarkable! That said, the workload and the professor's responses were very emotionally taxing. Only take this course if a) you can devote the time and b) you can steel yourself to insults to your personal character.",
    "Take it even if you don't have any drawing experience before and are not an art major. It is a transforming experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student interested improving their drawing skills and general visual literacy."
