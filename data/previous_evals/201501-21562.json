   "comments": [
    "The class format changes every year, so who knows what it's going to be? It's a great way to get to know many different kinds of people and hear their views on the environment and wilderness. If you're passionate about wilderness, take the class!",
    "I would 100% recommend this class! The reading is so interesting and fun, the types of people the class attracts are warm and wonderful, and the additional perks (overnight on an island, class dinner) are great! Expect to talk about the West in a laid-back classroom atmosphere with a bunch of upperclassmen who know a lot about and love the outdoors.",
    "This is a great class, but it is highly dependent on the graduate student teacher and the people in the class. The professor this year, Sigma, and the other students in the class are what really made this a good experience by having everyone engaged and passionate about the topics we discussed. The readings and requirements also vary by year so be sure to check on the syllabus, but typically the readings you'll do are great and the workload is manageable.",
    "Awesome course. Had nothing to do with my course of study but I feel like I learned a lot about basic environmental history and had some really good discussions about the concept of wilderness and how it affects a lot of other aspects of our culture and our lives. The work was totally manageable and very flexible (you could write about whatever you wanted and it could be more personal than academic) and Sigma gives really useful feedback. The field trip was incredible.",
    "It's a fun class for anyone who finds the syllabus to be interesting! Not too much work, good discussions, a field trip (watch out for poison ivy!!!), and class dinner included. Great class to take senior year and the teacher changes every time so definitely shop the first class to see if you jive with the person.",
    "It is a great class. The class field trip is wicked awesome and was such a phenomenal experience.",
    "The quality of this class is heavily dependent on whoever is teaching it, so consider the hype but consider the grad student and the syllabus too."
