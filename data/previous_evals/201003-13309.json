    "Yes, but DO NOT TAKE WITH JULIE VAN DYKE. Cognitive Science is a wonderful class that has the potential to be one's favorite class at Yale. That said, do NOT take it with Julie Van Dyke! One of the worst teachers I have ever had at Yale who truly ruined the course for me. Wait for Brian Scholl to teach it again. I've had many friends who took it with him and they swear that the class was one of their all time favorites. In contrast, almost everyone in Van Dyke's class that I know can't stand the way she teaches.",
    "I plan to major in cognitive science, but if I didn't have some familiarity with the field already this class might have persuaded me otherwise. We cover a wide variety of pertinent topics, but Professor Van Dyke presents them in a fairly boring way. A cognitive linguist by trade, 2\/3 of the articles she assigned us were about language. This is important, surely, but she left out so much. Furthermore, Prof. Van Dyke didn't really seem to have a good understanding of connectionism or dynamical systems.The class is, however, very easy. Reaction papers are a piece of cake, tests are easy, essay isn't bad at all. Only take the class if you are considering cognitive science, but if you do its an easy, if dull, ride.",
    "Before taking this course I heard Cig Sci was a great class. The problem is that the usual professor did not teach it this semester. The concepts were interesting, but I would not recommend taking this course with Van Dyke. I believe this was her firstintro class, so maybe she is still working it out.If you do take this course, make sure to take the reading seriously. There is a good amount of overlap between the reading and lecture, but the book tended to be more helpful in understanding the material than Van Dyke.",
    "Yes! My only issue was the lectures being dull sometimes, but Prof. Scholl (who usually teaches the class) should be teaching it again next year. He gave us a guest lecture and he is FANTASTIC!",
    "This class is necessary for most psych majors and obviously all cog sci majors. Interesting material if presented in a different way or by a different teacher. not one of my favorites at Yale so far",
    "I would recommend Introduction to Cognitive Science to a fellow student only if he or she was either a) extremely interested in the material, or b) wanted to fulfill a requirement for the psychology major. The material presented was sometimes confusing and often theoretical, and I think that Introduction to Psychology is a much more accessible class for those interested in an introduction to the mind. However, the workload was manageable (weekly reading responses, midterm, 6-8 pg. paper, and in-class final) and the grading fair.",
    "You will love it if you're interested in the materials.",
    "You need to take this class to be in the cognitive science major, but I would not recommend it otherwise, unless you want to learn solely about computers and linguistics. It's boring, and it's a huge amount of work if you actually do all of the readings.",
    "A very good, broad overview to the field of cognitive science. You will cover a LOT of material and learn a lot of opposing theories of how the brain works. Sometimes challenging and confusing, and Dr. Van Dyke focuses a lot on her area of research (linguistics) but it's very interesting and I would recommend.",
    "When I came to Yale, I was very excited about taking classes like Introduction to Cognitive Science. However, while the class was full of interesting subject matter, I finished the class somewhat disappointed with my experience. The class does a decent job covering the foundations of the field and the many difficult theories that comprise it, although the different sides and debates presented can often be confusing. There\u0092s also a lot of philosophy, which may be uninteresting to you if you\u0092re interested in more of the neuroscience side of things. The readings are pretty interesting and mostly come from original sources\u0097we didn\u0092t use a true textbook but rather a collection of essays from the field. However, Professor Van Dyke\u0092s lectures did little to enhance the knowledge from the readings. Her presentation of the content was often unfocused and disjointed. However, she can be engaging at times and does present a variety of interesting examples and studies. There were also multiple guest lectures, which were all fascinating. The workload was mild\u0097weekly one-page response papers, a longer 6-8 paper, and two exams, one of which comes at the end of the course before reading period. In its current state, however, I don\u0092t think I would recommend the course unless you are really interested in psychology or the cognitive science major.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone under one condition: take it with Brian Scholl.",
    "If you are sure you want to do Cognitive Science, then you have to take it. IF you are not sure and just curious, maybe just shop it. The class just mostly made me realize that cognitive science is not my cup of tea.",
    "I recommend the course to psych majors to get a group b requirement taken care of. However it is not the most thrilling course if you are looking for just another class.",
    "Cognitive Science was a good intro course, covering all possible areas relating to cognitive science. Still, the information taught was overwhelmingly spread out. The first half of the course, the philosophical side to CogSci, was good because the Prof. taught the material relatively orderly. Still, the second part of the course very disorganized, going back and forth between readings and materials, with no apparent connection between them. I felt that I learned a lot. But I don't know how to put the concepts that I learned together (for the second part of the course). I would have much rather learned stuff that was more closely related, but learn it in a profound way, even if it wasn't as spread out. IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON TAKING THIS COURSE, TRY TAKING IT WITH A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR. I entered as a CogSci major, and changed my mind after this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend people to take Cog. Sci... I thought the material was fascinating. It is great to have a general knowledge of whats out there, even if you aren't planning on taking any future coursework. While sometimes lectures are boring, the readings were awesome, and when all your knowledge comes together in the end, its rewarding. I was grateful for all the philosophical work and scientific work we got to see.",
    "I wouldn't take this unless you had too. The days with guest lecturers were fun and interesting, but otherwise the rest of them were uninteresting and not helpful.",
    "I think you either hate or love Cog Sci and I found that I'm not a fan. I'm still not sure if it's the course or just Prof Van Dyke's focus, but there is a lot more linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence (as opposed to psychology, neuroscience, or philosophy) which can get pretty dry. Prof Van Dyke has good slides, but her lectures aren't super interesting and she's not very good at answering questions in class (much better over e-mail).",
    "If youre willing to do research by yourself, then take it. the tests are pretty much fair.",
    "Excellent class! You learn a ton, but it is definitely not going to be easy. The readings are long and a little boring unless you thrive on texts grounded in computer science theory and basic linguistics. There are some components of the class that are really fascinating, but, being an intro course, you won't spend very much time talking about them. Professor Van Dyke is very nice, approachable, and understanding, so she is definitely a great benefit of taking such a fundamental course. Be prepared for a few exams, paper, and multiple reading responses every week though.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the connection between the brain and the mind or wants to understand what thoughts are made of.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science explores many various concepts and modules for how the brain can contain all that the mind produces. Content of the course is constantly updated because of the relatively new emergence of the field. I would recommend this course, but not with Professor Van Dyke.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class is Professor Van Dyke is teaching; just don't do it. Wait until Brian Scholl is back and it will be more worth your time. However, fairly easy A.",
    "This class was basically about machines and how to computationally model our cognitive processes - lots about Turing Tests, Physical Symbol Systems, and Connectionism - a bit too much actually. There were about 30 - 40 pages of reading for each class, plus a reading response of no more than 1 page single spaced, a 6-8 page paper, and 2 exams, that were fairly straight-forward and easy. The reading responses helped you focus your attention; however, I'm glad that there were fewer of them after the midterm, because they did take time. If I were a student considering this class, I would wait until Brian was teaching it again, because I heard this class is amazing, while this one is merely so-so. If you're interested in the modelling of cognitive processes though and very philosophical questions - go for it!",
    "IT was a great class but the professor needs work.",
    "Interesting questions are brought up in passing in this class. Unfortunately, the interesting parts (emotion, consciousness, errors in perception) are not dwelled upon. The lecture was scattered, unengaging, and the professor wasn't the most knowledgeable (she was also quite moody...who enjoys having a moody professor?). There was very little incentive to engage in the readings. However, the guest lectures were fascinating and give me hope that being a cognitive science major will be a rewarding pursuit.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of uncertain theories and no real consensus on the material. The lectures present a lot of topics (which did not always correspond with the dense readings), and it kind of lacked direction. I will say, however, that if you slogthrough the readings and do the weekly responses, you can get in A in this class...",
    "Okay, so this class is usually taught by Brian Scholl. It's supposed to be *amazing* when taught by him, but I didn't like it when it was taught by Professor Van Dyke. Take it with Scholl if you can, or try it with a different teacher if it's not Van Dyke.",
    "Intro to cog sci was very different this year from previous years when Scholl taught it. Professor Van Dyke is passionate about the field and it shows in her reading selections and commitment to bring in some guest speakers. However, lectures could be a bit dry. Exams were fair and the workload during the semester was reasonable once she reduced the reading responses from 2 to 1 per week. It's worth shopping if she teaches it again, but make sure that things have been improved from this year.",
    "I would recommend this course, it was interesting and not too difficult.",
    "I would only recommend if it's a requirement.",
    "Highly recommended! While the material can be dense and even a little boring at times, I wouldn't trade my current understanding of the trends of this fascinating but complex field for anything.",
    "I would strongly recommend Intro Cog Sci to any student at Yale as long as Brian Scholl is teaching it, and not Julie Van Dyke. He gave one guest lecture that blew every one of hers out of the water. Now, with that over, I can instead choose to extol the study of cognitive science. Drawing on so many field such as psychology, neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy, this field is one of the most fascinating and up-and-coming studies across all universities, and for good reason. If you are ever frustrated (as I am) by the single-minded approach through one methodology that most field take, try out cog sci. All sorts of different methodologies are integrated to address central questions about our minds, beliefs, and essentially how we are and how wecame to be who we are.PS Dancing Keepons!",
    "This course was way too much computing and computer science for me, which was not what I expected. Don't take this course unless you're interested in programming or things like that. The lectures in general are really boring, and I didn't enjoy this class at all.",
    "I would recommend it if taught by Brian Scholl. If taught by Julie Van Dyke, then only take it if you absolutely have to. It is a frustrating class that takes all of the interest out of the subject.",
    "This subject matter of this course is very interesting, and yet somehow the course itself was not. I might recommend taking Intro Psych instead, unless its for your major. That being said, however, it is easy to succeed in this course if you do the reading.",
    "I think it is probably hard to tell what this course will be like in the future. First of all, I'm not sure whether or not Prof. van Dyke will continue to teach it, or whether Brian Scholl (who I hear is fantastic) will return.Here, however, is what I thought of the course, as taught by van Dyke.Some of the readings were interesting. However, in lecture, Prof. van Dyke essentially read off bullet points in her lecture slides, and had a tendency to drift into detailed analysis of things such as formal logic or the mathematics of a connectionist system. She also had a tendency to talk only about language (her field of study) at the expense of the many other disciplines that fall under the umbrella of Cognitive Science. Guest lectures were usually interesting, but by the end almost no one came to class.Grading was based off of short \"reaction papers\" once or twice a week, as well as two exams (essay and definition format) and a 6-8 page paper.Not a hard class-- ifyou put in the work you'll get an A-- but I hope it will be spiced up somewhat next year.",
    "ONLY TAKE IT WITH BRIAN SCHOLL.",
    "I really would try to take it another semester. Cogsci is broad enough that each teacher can focus on his or her own interests within the discipline, and Professor van Dyke's interests were beyond what an introductory student could fully grasp.",
    "If you are possibly interested in cognitive science or any of the overlapping fields like linguistics, computer science, or psychology, this is a good class to take. It definitely was not my favorite class, but I am glad I took it because now I know I am not interested in cognitive science as a possible major.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for everyone, even those (like me) who are not anticipating to pursue a Cognitive Science or psych. major. The course introduces you to the different theories on, basically, how the mind works, which is useful and interesting for anyone interested in learning.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone if Brian Scholl is teaching. I would recommend it regardless of teacher if you are interested in the brain, philosophy of the mind and are willing to do a fair bit of reading and thinking about the subject.",
    "Take it with BrianS.",
    "This course provided an overview of the major ideas of cognitive science. We went over the beginnings of symbolism all the way to dynamic environments, and just covered various things like perception and artificial intelligence in between. I would recommend this course, although the readings are what makes the course great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Cognitive Science 110 for any student that is curious about the biological basis of the mind and its functions, as well as how the brain system can be modeled in machinery. I would advise, however, that any student taking this course MUST keep up with the readings and try to attend lectures; if not, it becomes incredibly easy to fall behind and earn a low grade.",
    "I would only take this class if you want to be a Cog Sci major.",
    "I think it was a great intro to cog sci class, and I recommend it to any student who is in the least bit interested in the philosophy of the human mind.",
    "I recommend that you wait for another professor to teach the course, and then go ahead and try it. There is a lot of interesting material to be learned, if there is a professor who will teach it.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 01 is a great introduction to the cognitive science world (obviously), but don't expect it to unravel the mysteries of the mind or the secrets behind your ponderous and questing soul. It is much more scientific, focuses on linguistics, and I learned quickly that not many scientists know for sure what's going on underneath the skull. It is both exciting and frustrating to be learning about such a new scientific frontier.",
    "I took it Cr\/D, and I'm glad, because after a while I began to lose interest. Only take it if you're really intrigued by the subject matter, because otherwise it'll be hard to stay committed.",
    "I would recommend it as a subject, as I find the material to be incredibly interesting. However, with Ms. Van Dyke as the teacher, I could not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I'd recommend this class before seriously thinking about applying for the CogSci major.",
    "Do NOT take this class with Prof. Van Dyke.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in cognitive science or artificial intelligence. It can be an interesting look at developments in cognitive science, but it can also be a little bit technical and complicated at times.",
    "Absolutely do not take this course. It is boring, and graded hard. Intro psych is so much better. Ilove psychology, but this was my least favorite class at Yale so far. Consider it with Scholl, but absolutely not with Van Dyke.",
    "This course is a good way to expose yourself to what exactly Cognitive Science is and to see if it's a field you're interested in. You get exposed to the main theories underlying the field and the modern-day hot topics. I wouldn't recommend taking it with Professor Van Dyke unless you are either really into linguistics or are prepared to put many hours into the class. The lectures aren't that engaging but the homework reading can take hours to try to comprehend since they're often dense scholarly articles. The exams demand a very high understanding of the concepts and how they're all integrated, which is something not discussed much in class at all.",
    "I expected this class to focus more on science than on philosophy and was mistaken. The guest lectures were fun, though.",
    "Psych 130 provides a very interesting new insight into the field for psychology majors. The class is very well taught by Professor Van Dyke who emphasizes interaction with the students. Even though this is an intro class, it was very interesting for me as an upperclassmen as well.",
    "If you're going to be a cog sci major or think you want to be, then you have to take this anyway. I've heard in years when Brian Scholl was teaching it, the class was phenomenal, and something take regardless of whether you have to, but this year it was kind of so so. The subject material was very interesting, and the pace was quick but not overwhelming. I thought it was a little too focused on philosophical questions and philosophy of mind, and it would have been nice to learn more about some of the other disciplines and focuses in cog sci for more than just one or two guest lectures. Also Professor Van Dyke was pretty good and helpful one on one, but she's an inexperienced and scattered lecturer. The course isn't too much work, but we did have to write two reaction papers a week, which I think was different from the workload in the past.",
    "Yes. It's definitely an interesting class.",
    "Would absolutely not recommend. Frustratingly disorganized course. Deterred me from interest in cog sci.",
    "It's wonderful if you intend to read the readings and be engaged with the subject. Otherwise it's not simple to get through.",
    "Don't take it...that's my honest recommendation."
