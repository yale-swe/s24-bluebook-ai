    "I learnt to apply logical thinking to decision making by firms and consumers. It was interesting to learn about market interactions. While the course covers very basic fundamentals of game theory and risk, it forms a good foundation for higher level economics classes.",
    "A cursory understanding of basic economic concepts and then more in-depth knowledge on things like insurance and interest towards the end of the course.",
    "It is great course on some basic concepts of microeconomics such as supply and demand, monopoly, free market, equilibrium and so on. Very useful stuff.",

While it may not have been \"necessary\" per say, it was extremely beneficial to have that knowledge and because I had no background in it I struggled immensely. The professor should be honest at the very beginning of the course about how much of an impact calculus has on one's possible understanding of the material.",

Professor Berry was a very engaging lecturer, the workload was just right all in all. I loved how the course was applicable to real life scenarios, especially when we would tackle areas like taxation, externalities, insurance.. Other than the basic base of knowledge it provided me in economics, it also equipped me to better evaluate public policy.",
    "I learned a huge amount about economics in this class this year, the class was well taught and I feel as if I gained a very broad but not extremely deep.",
    "So much!! I'm a junior, and taking this class primarily for the QR credit. And I am so glad I did--most useful and relevant class I've taken to fill a requirement.

    "Steven Berry is a great prof that makes the class as interesting as intro micro can get. The class generally has a one-size-fits-all approach though, so take advantage of the peer tutors and residential college tutors",
    "I developed an understanding of basic microeconomic theory, including the laws of supply and demand, different models of competition, and basic game theory.",

Much of the skills gained from the course involved applying mathematical models to decisions we make on a daily basis (such as deciding what type of lunch we want, etc). It was really an amazing experience to learn all the mathematical models and figure out how we can use this information to help solve problems of efficiency and equity in society as well.",

    "Having no prior experience in economics whatsoever, this course taught me a lot. However, initially expecting the course to initially take a thematic approach that would eventually progress into more application based economic approaches, I found all the details and depth of the course to be a bit overwhelming.",
    "I learned how to better interpret basic economics.",
    "This is a good introduction to economics, and the lectures are fairly well taught. I learned to think in terms of opportunity costs. I felt like other ways of thinking may not be as realistic and applicable, but it was good to get a feeling of what economists do.",

    "I learned about microeconomic concepts and algebra used.",
    "Over the course of this class, I developed a fairly robust understanding of the essential concepts of microeconomics; I feel fairly confident in assuming that this was the point of the course. In any case, I can now explain the basics of supply and demand, the internal trade-offs faced by both consumers and producers, the effects of government intervention in markets in the forms of both taxes and regulations, the differences between perfectly competitive markets, monopolies, and oligopolies, positive and negative externalities, public goods, some basic concepts of insurance and savings markets, and probably a few other areas that I am forgetting. In terms of skills, I learned relatively little that I could apply to academic fields outside economics, but I do feel that the core insights of this course will be useful to me throughout my life, especially the essentials of supply and demand and the more realistic examinations of markets that were covered toward the end of the course. All in all, I learned a lot and gained a wide range of basic economic knowledge.",

    "I learned basic economic skills. It helped me better understand concepts like supply and demand, the effects of taxation, the basics of investing, and issues like minimum wage.",
    "I learnt a lot about basic micro economics and more importantly it's application in the real world. Nash equilibrium and oligopoly and how it all works about",
    "I learned basic microeconomics skills, such as marginal analysis",
    "I was able to learn and understand the basic skills required to think economically and work through problems on the microeconomic level. I found that I could apply much of the material to other aspects of life such as politics - for example, many policies, regardless of party affiliation, are saying the same thing on the economic level and just varying in how to cover the cost.",
    "I gained a better understanding of how markets work from a producer standpoint",
    "I had never had any sort of economics class before taking this course and I definitely learned quite a lot about the basics of microeconomics. I also developed my listening and note taking skills during lecture since this course requires extreme attention during class.",

    "Enjoyed the course, learned a lot of information and made me think in different ways.",
    "Having never taken economics before, I think I really gained a lot of insight into the field by taking this course and I feel like the professor did a really good job of applying it to real-life applications throughout the course. The funny thing about economics, specifically on the supply-side, is that it doesn't pertain to things that people consciously think about on a daily basis, but now I realize how pertinent it is in our daily lives which is really cool.",
    "Minimal economics background going in - this fantastic course gave me a much deeper understanding of what economics is and how to use it.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics.",
    "I learned how to base my decisions off of economic concepts.",
    "I expanded my knowledge on economic theory.",
    "Basic knowledge about micro economics",
    "ECON 115 taught me the tendencies of individuals placed before a set of choices and market conditions along with the social costs that affect them in general. The concepts of scarcity and opportunity cost expounded the majority of economic principles presented, and it started with an introduction to trade-offs and market graphs for demand and supply, revealing the price dependence on quantity produced as well as the quantity demand dependence on the willingness-to-pay for the good or service. This demonstrated the change of extrinsic worth due to rarity\/paucity and its relationship to other worthy goods or decisions. It continued with the tax toward goods and the analysis of new prices and quantities. Because of ECON 115s emphasis on graphical representation of these concepts, the course helped me develop a keen appreciation for graphical analysis, pushing me to consider the movement and quality of curves. With this mindset, I could better understood the social reasoning of markets in the context of microeconomics. Utility and indifference delivered important messages about our ability to prefer and to maintain a state of preference. I found it pensive to relate the two with marginal analysis, the applications of which gave mathematical relationships equal to the economic principles of marginal rate of substitution, the equality between marginal benefit and marginal cost, and the optimization between cost constraints. Even the understanding of firm costs and production was explained using marginal analysis. After the costs and production of firms operating under perfect competition were taught, the course led into oligopoly and monopoly markets. I found these to be the most difficult because the topics brought together the knowledge of market demand and supply as well as firm revenue and costs, relating the markets economic conditions contributing to their existence as well as their disintegration. This connected the Nash and Bertrand equilibriums which led into a small introduction to game theory. Further knowledge on the human responses to competitive conditions became the subject, and I developed the skill to explain my actions\/choices, especially with examples of risk aversion and prisoners dilemma, which can apply to insurance, markets, oligopolies, plus a wider range of life lessons concerning myself and others. The difference between normative and positive assumptions became clear to me at this point, where the previous masks of money-making became replaced by the fairness structure of most societal transactions, including the contribution toward pure public goods and the reversal of social costs by means of Pigouvian taxes. Truly, this course helped me develop an understanding of the reasons we think and act and of the reasons why efficiency and equilibrium are idealized frames for economy.",

   "comments": [
    "Lectures are pretty boring - hard to stay focused",
    "The TAs for this course are not always the best at teaching us. According to friends of mine in other sections, many of them go through the problems without fully explaining the solutions. Because of this, a lot of people do not attend section. It might be good to hold the TAs more accountable in how they teach the students.",
    "Weakness is that the class is so big that sometimes it could be really hard to pay attention and not get distracted.",
    "Strengths: Psets Weaknesses: psets and lectures had no correlation",
    "Strengths: Professor Berry us amazing. I was in awe how he managed to keep a 400 person lecture engaged for 1 hour 15 minutes twice a week for an entire semester. The anecdotes he incorporates into his lectures kept me engaged through out class, and motivated me to show up for each lecture, even though the (very comprehensive) ppts were uploaded later. Weaknesses: The discussion sections sometimes felt haphazard and unorganized, I am not sure how much I learnt by going to section. Additionally, the review sections for the exams let me down. It would have been more effective if we went over the topics instead of just doing questions.",
    "Strengths: Berry is funny and engaging, Weaknesses: technical skills (like the calculations we learn to do in this course) are incredibly difficult in a lecture setting where we're using all our brainpower to copy notes, not think about what they mean. Also we should do more hands-on practice in section instead of listening to a bamboozled grad student telling us to \"just do calculus\" in a course that specifically says we don't need calculus.",
    "I think this course is great. Professor Berry is very engaging!",
    "Really need to get better teaching fellows. Eion was the best. He was amazing, but the others I had really struggled explaining things clearly sometimes.",
    "One of the strengths in this course is that it is well organized and it is pretty clear as to how one might find success in this course; namely by doing the problem sets and practice questions, going to section, The primary weakness of the course is that both the TAs and professor could make more clear how to solve economics problems. By the end of the course, I have come out still with an unclear understanding as to how to structure evidence\/arguments when solving economics problems. The best instructor for this course, ironically, was not the TAs or Professors, but a residential college QR tutor\/Economics Graduate student named Chuan Du. I'm sure many other students would agree with me, given the fact that during every one of his review sessions, probably about 50 students would show up. Chuan made economics make much more sense than the professor or any of the TAs could. Please hire him as a professor. Another major weakness in the course is the grading of the problem sets. It's very arbitrary and unclear as to what the standards are as each TA seems to have his\/her own standard, and when you lose points, it's very unclear as to why you lost points., or how many points you lost.",
    "This course was not organized well in its procession of material. It can be improved by following the textbook more so that one can get help more readily other than lecture.",
    "I feel I have a working understanding of basic microeconomics and the exams and psets were for the most part fair. However, I don't feel that my section really benefited me very much and I only went to peer tutors and fellows as a last resort because their sessions were always so busy that it was difficult to get my questions answered.",
    "It's a good introduction for people who are unfamiliar with economics and I like that it does not require calculus. It covers a broad range of topics but goes into enough detail to facilitate real understanding. Sometimes the PSET material seemed to be one week ahead of the lectures.",
    "One strength is the preparedness of the TF's. However, the course is difficult to study for and does not enough resources to feel confident for exams.",
    "The lectures can be boring or overwhelming in terms of information.",
    "see above answer for Q1",
    "Strength: material is presented pretty well for the time we have, and is often tied to real-world problems and questions which makes it more engaging. Weakness: it's just a very large class so it's impersonal and less engaging than a more intimate seminar.",
    "the course was okay. I had a bad TA that wasn't very good at answering questions, but there were some other TA's and tutors provided for the class that were incredible. the curve and the fact that you can drop 2 homework assignments is really nice.",
    "not very interesting",
    "Absolute trash.",
    "It is a massive lecture, so there is very little interaction with Professor Berry. As he is such an interesting professor, it would have been ideal to have a little interact with him more on a one to one basis, if that it is at all possible. Also, I might try to make the various components of the class more applicable to the real world. I know it is hard in the beginning, especially with perfect competition, but I think that using real world examples makes the class a lot more interesting and makes the students more motivated to work on the material. Furthermore, I would have liked to see more math proofs behind the economic reasoning we learned. We were talking about derivatives all term, but never mentioned the word derivative. I found this incredibly frustrating. I love to see when different subjects overlap, and this was a missed opportunity, in my opinion.",
    "Good lecturer. But material is kind of boring.",
    "It's relatively straightforward, the lectures are good, and it's a good textbook. Sometimes the professor assumes that people remember things without going back and making sure we do (this wasn't a problem for me, but it was for some others). The lectures that get posted aren't always easy to understand online, and this is coming from someone who attended every single lecture. Clarity could be improved, as well as more explicit statement of certain formulas.",
    "The strengths are the problem sets and the lectures. They certainly helped with my understanding of the material. However, the TAs and the weekly sections that were held for the course were not much help. I felt like, other than the lectures and consulting with my peers, I was left alone to understand something I didn't understand.",
    "The weakness of this course is it is very easy to be swallowed up and slack off due to the size of the course and the optional sections. I didn't like how we never used the textbook because I learn better by reading through books and practicing than by someone purely telling me during lecture the concepts and then adding confusing lines to graphs quickly and moving on to the next topic. Could just be I didn't engage enough, though. Another thing that bothered me was the number of people who had already taken AP Econ and flew by the course. Regardless, though, the curve was really nice and saved those who didn't have experience in it before. Berry is a very nice man and an enthusiastic lecturer. So much so that, some days, the only thing that kept me from falling asleep was his energy to teach.",
    "Basic lecture course - better TF\/ better structured sections would be helpful and more effective",
    "It's a 400+ person course. It will be rather dry, but it's something you need to know, and the content will be as enjoying as you choose to invest in it.",
    "With such a hard lecture, it is hard to learn in lecture. Sometimes I felt the lectures didn't completely cover what we needed to know to do the homework, but the class was overall good. I think a large lecture is not conducive to learning, but sections can make up for that if you have a good TA.",
    "A lot of students struggled with the PSETs and felt that section could have been more helpful. Professor Berry, however, is a very engaging and dynamic professor who teaches the class amazingly well.",
    "Jumps in too quickly for people who have had no experience of economics and do not understand the basic concepts.",
    "Very little of the problem set content was a direct reflection of what we did in lectures. It would be great if things lined up a bit more. It was hard to do psets given this discrepancy.",
    "Strengths: you get a QR. Weaknesses: you will hate this class and you will hate your life because of it.",
    "The Psets kept me in check and helped me make sure I was learning. More practice that was in line with the difficulty of tests would be helpful in ensuring that we could perform well.",
    "The course was weak in that the lectures did not always line up with the problem sets yet the professor expected most of your knowledge to come from the lectures. I didn't feel well prepared for the homework. The teaching fellow was not always helpful either, and sometimes difficult to understand.",
    "Its touggghh curve's alright though",
    "There seemed to be a large grading disparity across the TAs. Often, when you got points taken off on a test you didn't know why. Also the grading of the problem sets were very unforgiving. I suggest making the problem sets worth more points (maybe 10 rather than 5) because the questions had multiple parts to them so if you missed one part of a question then you were down a whole point when you actually got the rest of the question right. The course material also liked any flow. I felt like we often just jumped around from subject to subject, and often the material felt disjointed. I took a microeconomics course in high school that taught much off the same material, but had a much better flow to its content, which made the class much easier to follow and comprehend.",
    "Strengths - Prof. Berry was great about posting his lectures as well as providing lots of practice material for the exam. Lectures were very engaging, and problem sets\/midterms were (famously) scheduled with the students' best interests in mind. This was enormously appreciated. Weaknesses - Time seemed to be a constraint, and a few topics were rushed through very fast. The textbook was costly but rarely utilized. Depth of understanding could vary a lot based on which TF one was assigned.",
    "A strength is that past exams, midterms, and problem sets with their solutions were on campus. It made for very good prep material for tests. A weakness is that my TA was extremely unhelpful for the entire semester.",
    "the lecture can be hard to follow at times, however the teaching fellows were excellent at supplementing the lecture.",
    "Sections should do a better job of reintroducing material with proficient teaching assistants.",
    "The math was suitable for most and the material was very interesting, yet I feel like the course would benefit from being more precise and clear in the presentation of material.",
    "It's a great intro course. I learned a lot, and the difficulty level was appropriate for someone with no econ background. I especially appreciated how Professor Berry related all of the topics together (i.e. instead of having disjoint lectures, he made an effort to connect ideas, which really improved my understanding)",
    "Class size is too large to effectively teach everyone",
    "Not too many weaknesses, Id say. Lectures were engaging and interesting, p-sets were reasonable, the routine worked well, exams were fair, the way slides were posted was really helpful. Section was also solid, especially that it was on Thursday, after the weeks lecture, when we starting to think about the p-set.",
    "The course was a large lecture, which isn't ideal in my opinions. Maybe splitting the course in half would make it more personalized (although even thag is a large class)",
    "It's a good introductory microeconomics course. Prof. Berry teaches it well, and cracks the occasional joke. It's not the most engaging material, and the size of the lecture only accentuates this fact.",
    "Pretty good course. The material is straightforward, especially if you take notes. The professor was kind and engaging during lecture (as much as is possible with 400 students).",
    "I thought this course was good, but because it was such a large class, there were definitely things that distracted from the material due to the other students in the class.",
    "This course, thanks to Professor Barry, does a great job of conveying all the information it can in a large lecture style format. I think the problems of the course come from the inevitable disconnect that results from being in a class of over 400 students: students do not receive consistent, direct feedback on their understanding of the material. I do not think there's any that can really be done to combat this problem: it's just a downside of having such a large lecture.",
    "Berry -- great professor, speaks fast, clear command of the knowledge. However, he does assume that students have somewhat of a basic understanding of the material he is teaching, so read the book!",
    "The strength of this course is absolutely its lecturer- Steve Berry. He is engaging, challenges his students intellectually, and is focused on preparing students to become good citizens, not good economists.",
    "It's a verrrry large course and has the downsides of being such - lack of attention, for example - and it's difficult to make the subject matter itself interesting given that it's an introductory course as well as a more quantitative one, but these aren't necessarily things that could be improved about it.",
    "Great course, Prof. Barry is an amazing and really funny lecturer. Easier curve compared to seminar. If you wanna learn more but okay with slightly lower grades take the seminar. However, if you want A's and if you can read the book before exams, take the lecture, you will do well. In lecture, you will get an A more easily, and you can always read more if you wanna learn more. Slights are usually engaging. No interactions since it is a huge lecture. Probably you can ask the professsor whatever you want in seminar version of this class. Keep this in mind. But also remember that if you have a good TA, you can get all your questions answered in the sections and office hours (once a week, each) of the lecture version.",
    "The course could have focused more on the mathematical calculations for each type of firm and focus more on the post-midterm 2 material (I felt kind of rushed).",
    "Due to the size of the class, the course required a lot of resources and aid to be given outside of class. The wealth of resources outside of class was definitely a strength of this class. As a freshman, I attended discussion section and still felt lost at times. I went to the peer tutoring sessions and still could not seem to get higher than a 4 on my problem sets. I wish there was some sort of communication between TFs and students letting them know where they need to improve. I tried extremely hard on each problem set and could not get the higher grade.",
    "There needs to be more tutors available. Also, a weakness was the unstructured sections.",
    "It is very easy to fall behind in this course because there is only one problem set a week that only took about 3 hours. Also, I did not find my section helpful so I really felt like I was on my own learning the material. It takes so long to get problem sets back that they are not very useful once we do get them back.",
    "Lectures were somewhat boring and difficult to learn from directly. The first half was dedicated to reviewing new material from the last lecture and the second half was new material. Things felt rushed, so I wonder if going over new material once, but dedicating an entire lecture to it would have been more effective.",
    "One of the strongest parts of this course in my opinion was taking the notes and new topics we learned in lecture and applying them to problems together within section. However, since section was made optional, not many people actually showed up. I think making section a mandatory part of a person's participation grade would provide more constructive engagement for all students.",
    "The lecture is huge and it's hard to follow. I didn't really get anything out of going to the lectures and trying to follow along was difficult because it was occasionally hard to hear what Prof. Berry was saying. It was also difficult to write down everything that was on the lecture slides and what he was analyzing. It would have been much more helpful if he posted blank copies of the slides before class so we could follow along as he presented and write down what he was saying.",
    "I think the course was at its best when topics were presented in contexts of how they are applicable to life beyond economics. As someone interested in economics I was generally pretty engaged, but I could see my fellow students were paying more attention when we talked about, say, the economics of life saving drugs. Some of the course material can be opaque, and p-seta challenging. It would have been nice to have had a few more resources for building understanding, since in a class with 400 people many of the tutors, etc. were always busy. This course has an idiotic no-late p-set policy which just straight up doesn't make sense. I realize two p-sets drop, but for most students that ends up being their two lowest scores. I turned an early p-set in late with a dean's excuse and was told it still didn't count. Obviously I did better on that p-set than I did on some of the later ones, so I was essentially penalized for getting a concussion and needing a dean's excuse. Doesn't make sense from a very basic equity perspective.",
    "This course is really big, so there are obviously going to be many students who have different levels of math experience. There should have been time to find out where students were math wise, and provisions should have been made to help those students. The textbook for this course is absolutely unhelpful if you're not looking up terms.",
    "The material is straightforward and you know what you're expected to know for exams. If you do what you're supposed to do, you will learn the material. In the light, the lectures can be a little a little dry. You won't walk out of Berry's lectures feeling inspired.",
    "The course is fairly large; therefore the professor almost seems unapproachable. However, with more research of the resources, I'm sure I could've found a way to contact the lecture professor. Also, the class goes over vague concepts but the homework has a lot of mathematical problems.",
    "This class was strong in the organization of material and how the problem sets were applicable to the exams. It could be improved by having more example problem walk throughs in lecture and in section.",
    "Strengths: gives the basics of microeconomics in very understandable detail. Lectures are always fun. Considering class size, it feels like a community of students. Weaknesses: optional midterms.",
    "It is a very well taught course for a lecture, but it felt like the level of engagement was so low because of the sheer number of students in one room. Understandably, there isn't a ton you can do about that, though:",
    "The late hw policy is ridiculous. I forgot my pset in my room one week and was 15 min late by the time I got to class. The TA's refused to accept it, and I had to count it as one of my drops.",
    "This was a well taught and well structured course. The greatest weakness in my mind was that calculus actually made the concepts a lot easier to understand, and sometimes the way Professor Berry explained things in a way that specifically didn't use calculus made what he was explaining seem more confusing than it actually was.",
    "The practice problems in the textbook reflect the type of realistic problems one might need to solve using the theory and formula provided. In contrast, the problem sets are the most difficult and abstract questions that the professor\/TFs could come up with. They actually had the overall effect of reducing my understanding rather than enhancing it. I understand the need to make the PSETS challenging, but starting off with questions that reinforce or clarify the lecture material before giving students questions that multiple tutors were often unable to answer would certainly be more conducive to actual learning rather than frustration.",
    "I personally think the format was too repetitive although I know it helped many students who had not been exposed to microeconomics before. The sections were not always helpful because I did not want to review past problem sets but would prefer to go over new material.",
    "Strengths: - good lecture course - flexible professor - lectures generally pretty clear Weaknesses: - psets could be extremely confusing and it sometimes seemed as if there were few avenues for help",
    "The lectures are informative. The problem sets and exams asked questions that accurately portrayed what I learned in the course. I wish there had been more practice problems.",
    "Professor Berry's lectures were not the most engaging, but he tried to make the content interesting and was very organized. The lectures and sections did not do a very good job at all of preparing students for the psets and exams.",
    "It could be improved by clearing up the purpose and goals of section. Oftentimes it was unclear if we should be reviewing old stuff or delving deeper into stuff we have learned that day making it confusing at times.",
    "The class was structured very well as in the lectures, psets, and tests worked well with each other. Everything was clear and concise. It sometimes felt too theoretical.",
    "Very boring lectures, repetitive and tedious.",
    "The main weakness of this course is the discrepancy between the materials taught in different sections by the different TAs. The course was overall a great one.",
    "I think that the size of the class created a disconnect with the professor, obviously.",
    "Though the lecture was huge, Professor Berry did a pretty good job of making the class seem a little smaller and more personal\/intimate (mostly because he has such a big personality!). Structurally, the class balanced lectures and smaller group settings quite well. Sections were optional, but I don't think I could have made it through the course without attending--and there are plenty of tutoring sessions that are also quite helpful. If I had a suggestion for the course, I would recommend that section style and piece-set grading be a little more standardized.",
    "I enjoyed the lecture format overall but through the first half of the course found it hard to pay attention because I wasn't used to a class like that. Once I began to consistently pay attention I found I really enjoyed the course and the material it covered.",
    "The size of the class is very big, but that means the curve is usually more generous.",
    "Only some of the TAs and sections were helpful. If I didn't have friends in the class with me, I have no idea how I could've done any of the psets; I don't see how you can figure out how to do the problems just by reading the textbook and listening to lectures.",
    "It was just quite hard to understand the professor and to really feel pushed to comprehend and ask questions because this class is a lecture of 400 or so people. It can get impersonal and the urge to work on something else, sleep, or not show up can win sometimes.",
    "The course could be improved by allowing section to meet more in order to review each lecture. However, as it is, the course was well planned and highly engaging.",
    "The course was based mainly on what was taught in the lecture. It could be improved by slightly more engagement with students during the lecture, because after about 30 minutes I found it incredibly hard to pay attention and follow what Prof. Berry was speaking about. A strength was that each lecture began with a 10-15 minute review of what was taught the prior lecture (usually stuff I had completely missed and did not understand). The problem sets truly helped to enhance learning of the material and reinforce concepts introduced in class. Tests were challenging but doable.",
    "Strengths: Professor was a good lecturer, seemed very engaged Weaknesses: sections really varied in how helpful they were",
    "I think the main strength of this course are the lectures. Professor Berry is engaging and clear, and I felt like I took something away from every lecture. I highly recommend taking this course while he is teaching it. I felt that sections, by contrast, were not particularly helpful. I attended a few sessions during the first few weeks of the term, and they did little to extend or deepen my understanding of the material presented in lecture. During the sections I attended, we went over alternate versions of the problems from each week's homework.",
    "I would have appreciated having some more difficult problems to try in lecture and watch the professor explain -- or perhaps he could make a video explaining them, because sometimes the psets were harder than what we learned in lecture. The old psets and tests posted online were very helpful.",
    "Moved pretty fast but the TAs help a lot",
    "I think that, at this point, professor berry has really perfected the course syllabus. I felt like I left with a strong understanding of economic theory.",
    "The lectures were often repetitive of the previous lecture and often did not help with some of the more complex facets of the problem sets.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course is that the material is just kind of boring. Berry does his best to keep it engaging, but supply and demand and marginal whatever just isn't interesting. However, the lectures do cover the material well enough. The worst part of this course is trying to stay awake.",
    "This course is fun, well taught, and covers the basics of a lot of interesting topics. This broad view is a big advantage for people looking to gain an introduction to economics. A downside is that no topic is covered in extreme depth, and at times the course is very fast paced.",
    "This class had a wonderful professor. Professor Berry was as engaging as possible in a lecture with over 400 students. I think this class could be improved by making class sections more personable.",
    "It is easy to get pushed behind. It seemed as though the p-sets were much more difficult than what was discussed in lecture. The TAs were okay. Professor Berry was engaging, knowledgeable and passionate.",
    "Professor Berry is legally nice. I recommend reading the textbook and studying the problem sets. The problem sets were the right lengths.",
    "The grading of PSets is variable, depending on the Teaching Fellow. My teaching fellow also explained everything with calculus (this is a non-calculus course) so most students stopped attending section.",
    "i would like to see how some of these concepts we learned are relevant in the real world because this was not explained as well.",
    "Steven Berry did a great job making connections with other areas of Economics.",
    "I've learned that bing big lecture style courses are Joyner for me; that I should have taken a seminar micro intro course",
    "The information in the problem sets is not taught beforehand. The professor teaches the information in the problem sets after we turn them in so most people have no idea how to do them.",
    "This course was well taught by both the professor and TA. It was made interesting by real-life applications.",
    "Professor Berry did an amazing job teaching this course. The only thing I would have changed is the way the homework was graded. It was always out of five points, and if you got something wrong (even if it was a small mistake), it was automatically a whole point off. Five points doesn't seem like enough to be able to accurately represent the grade a person should receive on a long problem set.",
    "I think the weekly psets were very helpful towards preparing for the exams and helping me to understand the material better. One weakness was that sometimes psets would be about material not directly covered in lecture, but I still found that to be a welcome challenge to learn more. Another strength of the class was that there was always lots of help provided, whether through TFs or tutors.",
    "This course would need a little more private instruction by teaching fellows.",
    "Amazing professor and the course is great because it applies concepts to real world situations, making it easier to understand.",
    "The large lecture was not very conducive to learning although Professor Berry did try his best to keep everyone engaged.",
    "Great and interesting lectures. Challenging Problem sets.",
    "The lectures explained everything one needs to know for this course while the sections are only sometimes useful for solving a specific problem. However, the lectures were pretty long and sometimes got boring.",
    "Many people take this course and a strength is that you could form big study groups and help each other out. Another strength is that it is taught in a very accessible manner to even people who never studied economics before.",
    "I thought the information in the course was interesting and important, but I would prefer more application in the course, rather than just models and calculations.",
    "Fantastic lecturer and great TAs. There could have been more office hours",
    "The main weakness for me was the lack of focus in section, which caused them to feel unimportant.",
    "The lecture was huge and could be a bit dry at times. The fact that professor Berry reviewed old material at the beginning of each class was quite helpful. The weekly section was extremely helpful in better understanding the material as well.",
    "Good lecture style; Prof Berry is very engaging, but a bit too much review of the last lecture at the beginning of class.",
    "Strengths is that the professor is great. Weakness is that the TAs were not helpful at all.",
    "I felt like the class size was a bit of a detriment. Because the lecture style class was so large, at times it felt difficult to figure out conceptual problems in class. Even though office hours and tutors were available, there seemed to be times when easily-clarified questions weren't due to the size of the class.",
    "The examples given in class corresponded well with the problem set, and the questions on the problem sets were very similar to what we saw on the midterms and the final. This was a major strength of the class because it allowed me to effectively prepare for each exam. However, I wish there had been some type of vocab list so that I knew which words were important to study. I also wish there had been more of an opportunity to receive feedback for my work on the problem sets and the midterms. That would have been very helpful when studying.",
    "Sometimes the psets would include questions which were slightly different from those in class.",
    "The course is strong in that the professor's lectures are very well done, but I feel that more material could be provided to help students learn the material outside of class as well. I would like more learning material along with problem sets and lectures to supplement learning on the student's own time outside of class.",
    "This was an amazing class. Professor Berry did a rear job at presenting the concepts in theory in class, then the TAs did an excellent job at hellping us understand the math behind it in section. Overall a well strucutred, well balanced class.",
    "This course provides an introduction to micro economics which is both accessible, and quite challenging. However, in an attempt to be accessible, the course often oversimplified ideas and the math behind them leaving me, and many others, with an incomplete understanding of the concepts until we arrived upon the calculus ideas that they were truly based on. While I would typically appreciate this, the class progressed so fast and dove in to complex topics that really needed to be taught in the correct way, not with a calculus or mathematical addendum.",
    "It got hard to pay attention for so long in the large lectures, I imagine that is just the nature of a large lecture class. I really really liked the discussion sections though.",
    "Its strength lies in its very thorough overview of Microeconomics (with good mathematical principles embedded throughout). One weakness was that the course started quite slow, but towards the end of the semester, it taught material at a very fast pace (sometimes sacrificing comprehensiveness for finishing the material).",
    "I felt that a lecture to over 300 students was challenging for me as I had never experienced a class like it. Because it was hard to stop Mr. Burry to ask a question I often had trouble tracking the lectures.",
    "pset grading is too hard.",
    "It is challenging which is a strength, the weakness is the lack of engagement in the lectures.",
    "Sections were ultimately very helpful once we started focusing on the upcoming problem set, rather than only going over the past one. It would be more helpful if we had access to Piazza or another Q&A forum where fellow students, TA's and the professor can answer questions.",
    "WAY too big of a class, making it very hard to focus. Also the discussion sections were not very helpful, and the problem sets went over topics not covered in class. I think the strength is that Professor Berry is a very interesting lecturer, so the concepts he brings up are fun to listen to, but the actual knowledge he presents in a way not easy to learn. Especially when it comes to the graphs and mathematical concepts he just breezes through them, expecting everyone to already understand.",
    "This class had a very engaged professor that truly cared about his students. Professor Berry makes me want to take more Econ classes because I want to share his enthusiasm of the subject. This class also has very helpful sections (I was in Eion McGuirk's section) that go over anything that might have been skipped over during class. This class's biggest weakness is that the psets are graded out of 5 points, so if any details at all are missed, your grade drops to a 4\/5. This makes homework grades a lot lower than they should be.",
    "The strenghts are the lectures because the Professor was excellent in explaining. The problem sets each week are very helpful in making sure I knew the information.",
    "Strengths: Scope -- a lot of material is covered in a little amount of time; the material with which students are taught are high-level texts that MBA students often use Weaknesses: pacing of the class (no time to catch up if you feel behind because you did not understand a previous topic very well); not enough policy introduced (although the end of each unit touched a bit more on the ways public and private policies connect to microeconomics, sometimes it was easy for students to get carried away with the minute details forget about the larger-scale implications they have on entire markets and societies), TA and discussion section (not enough focus on contacting students and getting them into section)",
    "The professor was amazing and he made the material easier to understand.",
    "The class was very large so at times it was difficult to grasp concepts.",
    "The lectures were good, but there were a lot of unclear and unsatisfactory points regarding the exams. The mid-term exam was graded very weirdly, and some of the questions were asking things in a way we had not seen before. I would have liked if they provided more materials to study and practice for the exams.",
    "Strengths: Steven Berry was charismatic, eloquent, knowledgeable, caring. Weaknesses: Large lecture impeded individual engagement",
    "It's a little math heavy, which is fine. Greater focus on the reasoning behind the math could be beneficial.",
    "Weaknesses: - No office hours with the professor. - Maths based coursed which defeats the social science component of it. - No room for interpretation: arguments for and against policies are not addressed in the class. - Market based economics was the majority of the cases. Real markets that combine market and government interventions were not introduced in the course. - Essay based questions are also not introduced. These improve the critical thinking skills of the students.",
    "The book added to the professor's lectures well.",
    "The lecture class was really big, so there was little to no individual interaction in class. However, the sections were really useful.",
    "Discussion sections helped a lot. Large class means its harder to get questions answered during class.",
    "weakness: never learned how to do problems on the psets in lecture or section",
    "Either get rid of the expensive textbook or pick one that is more relevant to the course because I rarely used the textbook and felt like it was a waste of money.",
    "The class size is huge and so it is hard to pay attention. I think the problem sets were hard, but fine as long as I was able to get help. That being said, I always needed to go to a TF office hours and there were never enough.",
    "I think that one way this course could be improved is in the way the concepts are presented. In lecture, I often felt like i did not have enough time to absorb and try to understand concepts as I was rushing to get them written down.",
    "Weakness - hard to learn and understand in large lectures when you can't ask the questions you have in the moment during lecture Strength - discussion sections. Eoin McGuirk is the best tf and every time he explained something to me I understood it. Another strength was the problem sets. They helped me to understand the material further and apply what I learned from lecture and the textbook to real world situations and problems. Also the fact that the pset questions were very similar to the test questions was nice.",
    "I could not concentrate in lecture--could not hear the lecturer well if I was not in the front rows. The class was not very clear in its structure.",
    "Frankly, I do feel that this particular version of ECON 115, as taught by Professor Berry, can probably do relatively little to improve itself. On the one hand, thats good news; the course had clear strengths, in that Professor Berry was able to deliver the material in a clear and often intellectually compelling fashion, and I do think that most of the students probably learned a fair amount. On the other hand, if a student does not like the course material itself, there is little way to make it interesting. The problem with the average student enjoyment of this course, that is to say, is not the course itself, but instead the fact that so many students take it, and a fair amount of them are bound to not be particularly interested in the material. The course would probably be more interesting to more humanities and social sciences-oriented students if it included some more economic history, real-world examples, etc, and it would, conversely, probably be more exciting to the more quantitatively oriented students if it included more math, including calculus, but doing either of those things would perhaps alienate just as many students as it would help. Basically, this is a pretty shallow intro course, and Professor Berry, who was pretty darn good, probably made it as good as he could.",
    "This class is huge. It is great for someone who just wants to show up and learn without having to directly participate. It is for this reason that you have to put in effort to learn the information. Lecture is the prime source of information so going to class is imperative. The psets are very helpful in gauging how much knowledge you have and are similar in structure to the exams. Professor Berry is very engaging and made the long lectures bearable.",
    "The lecture\/section set-up is fine, but I wish the course focused more on how to solve real-world problems in conjunction with the conceptual knowledge. Sometimes it was made unnecessarily difficult to decipher what was \"wanted\" for different problems on p-sets and tests.",
    "The strengths are that there are a lot of freshman in the class and the curve is very nice.",
    "This course is excellent in teaching and reinforcing the economic principles covered if the student can grasp the concept. If the student does not initially understand the concept, I found it rather difficult to learn the information on my own time, as oftentimes the things that would've been most helpful to understanding the new concept is a piece of information that Prof. Berry mentions offhand in the middle of one of his lectures and that wasn't covered (in writing) on his slides. Additionally, I believe that this course material would be significantly easier to digest if it was taught alongside calculus applications -- not necessarily that students would be tested on their calculus at all, only using math to teach a new discipline. As a student with a strong background in math but with no background in economics, I found that many of the concepts that we learned in class would have been easier to digest if I had been taught how all of the concepts were connected mathematically.",
    "The class is relatively clear and covers a lot of important introductory information. It was a good intro level course. Even though it was good that the class was made accessible to students with a wide rage of mathematical ability, it would be good if the class offered students with a higher level of mathematical ability insight into some of the math concepts that under pin the material we were studying.",
    "Maybe the problem is the class is too big, but it's every wellnraught",
    "One of the strengths was how it had a lot of review sessions as well as peer tutoring sessions which I found very useful nearer to exams.",
    "Berry is a great lecturer but at times he would move rather quickly through slides.",
    "A great strength of this course is that it prepares you well and fairly for the exams - the P-sets are actually representative of all midterms and finals. The professor also uploads several practice exams and different ways to prepare - which is very appreciated. A weakness, I think, is the length of the lecture: the lecture requires being very engaged and taking thorough notes unless you have had AP Micro before (and even this doesn't get you through the second half of the course) so by the time the last 30 minutes or so of the class roll around most likely you are very burned out and kind of fidgety. It might be an improvement to split the class over the course of three days rather than two.",
    "I think this course's biggest weakness was that it did not provide a lot of support for struggling students. I met with a tutor almost every week and yet I still struggled in the course. My TA did not provide much help and in such a big lecture it is very easy to get lost because you don't understand one topic and then cannot understand the rest of the material. Another weakness in this course was the carried grading that occurred. There were occasions when I got different grades on my psets then the grades that my study buddies got even though our work was basically the same.",
    "Although the content is interesting and TAs are accessible, the greatest challenge of the course is the large lecture size. It is more difficult to engage with the material that way.",
    "The material is interesting but the large lecture makes it hard to learn",
    "Course was good, I think that there needs to be more help on homework understanding.",
    "The TF (teaching fellow) lottery definitely determined how much you really understood what was being taught in the lectures and how well you did on your problem sets and exams. For example, I mixed up one part of one definition of one part of one problem and received a 4\/5 on my problem set, while my friend who was in a different TA's section could skip an entire problem and receive the same grade. The only way to get a 5\/5 on problem sets in my section was to legitimately get everything perfect, which was nearly impossible (especially since the problem sets were due Monday beginning of lecture, and we would usually cover the information which would have been extremely helpful to complete the p-set right after we turned them in). My TF was very math-wired, so he explained concepts by deriving formulas and writing out equations, but that really never helped me. I learn best through graphs and explanations in words, so that was always a bit of a struggle. To be fair, I had never learned anything about Economics, so everything was really new to me. A lot of the students in the class took AP Econ in high school, so a good portion of the stuff we learned was familiar to them. I had to start from ground zero, so I had to learn a lot of the basics on my own (KHAN Academy was a lifesaver). The textbook we were using was a self-described intermediate microeconomics book, so for someone who knew essentially nothing about economics, it was not a very helpful resource. Prof. Berry is a great lecturer, and his lectures weren't too hard to follow, but they went through complicated material really fast and I always felt behind. All in all, I did learn a lot, but I had to pour a lot of extra time into this class to feel like I was at the same initial level as most students around me. I would recommend this class to those who took AP Econ in high school, but if you didn't, I would say the seminar is the way to go.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that Professor Berry explained concepts very differently than they were presented in the book, so it was nice to be able to see two different approaches to learning the concepts which really helped me learn the material. One weakness was that the course is structured on a curve so essentially, to get good grades you need to know more than most of the other students but you aren't really required to have a full grasp on all of the material to do well on exams which is kind of scary.",
    "The course is a very standard introductory microeconomic course. The course covers most of the basic microeconomic concepts and provides a good foundation for future study in economics. However, due to its large size, the TFs are often hit or miss.",
    "Excellent class. Strengths: Awesomely enthusiastic professor, engaged TA's, clear topics. Weaknesses: Maybe more math (Not sure of students' math background)",
    "The lecture format was a bit dry at some points, as it was hard to remain engaged during all of the lectures. It was effective at passing large volumes of information onto the students though.",
    "I think the problems on the psets and tests could have been explained better.",
    "The strength of the course is that is was relatively well paced. The weaknesses of this course are ensuring student engagement and providing students with enough resources to seek help. In addition, there was an unclear standard when it comes to grading problem sets; some were graded significantly harsher than others. Additionally, there was little emphasis on definitions on problem sets but they were graded extremely harshly on the exams. These nuances were neither discussed in lecture nor in section.",
    "ECON 115 is an introductory course available to the whole Yale student body. Because the target audience of the course can quite literally apply to anyone, I find it a strength to maintain this prevalence among students, especially due to its popularity as a course (and as a social science credit for non-economics majors). ECON 115 provides multiple opportunities to review its expansive material and its homework problems with review and discussion sections. I found both types of sections to be very helpful, however I add that the chosen textbook for the class was just as powerful, if not more. Along with the textbooks collective insight on the topics that were taught, the various writing files that are passed to us effectively describe concepts such as efficiency and marginal analysis from their basics. This enables a much more secure thinking about these topics and remains a strength for any student willing to dive deeper into the material. ECON 115 is an amazing course, I do not find any weaknesses nor do I suggest any improvements toward the class.",
    "lectures are really good - midterms were accurate of what we had done in class (a bit more difficult)",
    "Strength- Insight into economics Weakness- So many people but sections help",
    "The classes, for economics, need to be smaller. We went through too much information too quickly in class, which made it hard to retain and hard to even get down on paper. Smaller classes, slower speed (even if that meant meeting 3 times a week). The TAs varied greatly in their ability to teach, and many had trouble with English which meant they could not articulate explanations well. This was harmful. Maybe tAs should stick to the same class material plan so all are receiving at least the same information. I think this aspect is very important since it is the only small setting students have, so it needs to be very good. By the entire of the semester, of the 20 people signed up for my section, only 2 came because they were the only that found it somewhat helpful.",
    "The course was a good introduction to microeconomics, and I feel like I gained a really broad base of knowledge. However, the class was so large that it was not possible to have confusing topics cleared up during class. The discussion sections were not very helpful because they were only to go over the problem set from the week before. Unfortunately, we never got back our problem sets within a week, so it was impossible to know what needed to be gone over.",
    "Definitely worth moving around until you find the right TA. TA's make a huge difference and Yijia Lu was definitely the best!",
    "Professor Steven Berry makes this course. So much can be said about his kindness, clarity, and enthusiasm. I never dosed off or lost his drift during lecture.",
    "For an intro course, there was a great deal of special attention. My section leader (Eoin McGuirk) was fantastic. There were no real weaknesses to this course.",
    "Overall, I feel as thought the consistency in difficulty between the problem sets and the exams could be improved. At times, the problems on the exams felt far more difficult than those on the problem sets. While this is solved with the curve, it is still jarring while taking the exams.",
    "The lecture was huge and sections also formidable in size. Understandable, but it was difficult to stay engaged for someone taking the class for a requirement not an interest.",
    "Steven Berry is a good lecturer but often times the lectures do not help with the P-sets and the textbook is not quite in line with the course in that it often complicates the concepts for this course. The lecture format is great for those able to supplement with self-study outside of class but was often very disengaging (a lot of sleeping\/absent students). However, the assessments are fair, and the curve is generous.",
    "P sets were challenging and I struggled to do them alone.",
    "A suggestion would be to offer a physical print (some sort of textbook, packet) that corresponds more closely with the actual material covered in class.",
    "This course is well-structured. The lectures are clear and all available on Canvas. The TA sessions are great for more interpersonal learning. Students just need to learn to manage their time effectively and balance group and independent work.",
    "The course was taught by a great professor and provides a broad view of microeconomics. At times, I think the class was a little too theoretical.",
    "I think that sections should be made to be mandatory and that they should be improved. Personally, when I went to my section it was very helpful, yet I have heard from other students that their section leaders were not helpful at all.",
    "Strengths: the lectures were clear and understandable. Weaknesses: sometimes explanations in lecture and section were more complicated than they had to be.",
    "The biggest flaw in this course is that it is structured and taught conceptually but is tested quantitatively.",
    "Strengths include amazing lectures, weaknesses are perhaps inconsistent TA allocation.",
    "Sections are helpful and I wish we had sections more than one a week.",
    "Strengths: Professor is enthusiastic about subject matter Fairly thorough explanations Exams are rigorous but not impossible Good use of online materials to provide resources to a large class. Weaknesses: Huge class Notes online are often somewhat indecipherable without context Sections vary in quality somewhat wildly",
    "I felt the lecture required the student to extrapolate a lot in order to figure out applications. Making connections between the theory and how we would actually apply it would be helpful.",
    "One strength of the course was that it started out at a good pace. However, it could be improved by including the definitions of terms on the slides.",
    "The strength is the instructor and material. The weakness is the size of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Should take class if you are looking for a QR that is not math. Big curve.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if they plan to use economics in their career pursuits. Sometimes (since the class is so large) this class might lose its allure so it's important that you have a passion for the topic.",
    "It's a decent introduction to macroeconomics, nothing fancy here. Traditional lecture style, with psets to facilitate practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to prospective Econ\/EP&E\/Global Affairs majors (any major for which 115 is a prereq). 115 is not a particularly interesting course because it basically gives you the tools that actually help you take more interesting courses later (Development Econ, Financial Markets etc.) So definitely take it if you want to explore Econ later, not so much if you are a hardcore STEM, or Humanities major, in which there are more interesting Econ classes out there.",
    "Unless they could essentially learn the course from the textbook while having their preexisting knowledge reinforced during lecture, no. The curve allows people to subsist with a 60% and call that \"learning\" because it anticipates that students won't learn all the material.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Whether or not you are a Econ major, this course gives you some basic knowledge of the economic world around you. It enriches my world view.",
    "As a first semester freshman who had no experience with economics and limited experience with social sciences in high school, I really enjoyed learning the material in Econ 115. Much of what you learn is essentially just basic common sense about how basic economic principles work, without getting too much into the mathematical details A large variety of students take this course. While having some background is basic calculus can help a lot, it's not really necessary at all, and even if math is not your strongest background (wasn't mine) it's definitely possible to get an A and do well. The curve is what will save you. From what I've heard, it's one of the nicest among intro classes. I'd recommend this course if you are interested in one of the majors that lists it as a prereq, but this isn't a course where you will necessarily come out a different person after taking it. You don't really \"learn\" much; you just practice arguing things by using basic (emphasize BASIC) economic principles as evidence.",
    "I would recommend as an introduction to economics, because the professor is fairly good at lecturing. The material is very informative and useful.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a good introductory course.",
    "If you really love econ or need it as a prereq, this is a solid course to take and you come out feeling you have gained some concrete knowledge about econ. However, I don't think this course really gave me many insights on society and everyday life (though I wasn't really expecting it from an intro course) and it was at times quite boring and grueling. If you just want to take it for fun, probably don't unless you actually love econ.",
    "I recommend this to people who want a broad overview of microeconomics, or are starting out in Economics, especially those who have no experience with calculus.",
    "Yes if you are interested in majoring in economics or another related field.",
    "I would, in fact, recommend this course to other Yale students. Economics is a course that is important for most, if not all, students to have an understanding of. It was a great introduction to the field.",
    "Yes because I learned a lot about economics.",
    "Yes.",
    "no.",
    "Yes I would, especially were they looking to major in something Econ-related. It's a great foundational course.",
    "It's not awful but it's also not the greatest class ever. If you're interested in economics, it's a good standard intro class that will do what it's meant to do: introduce you to microeconomics. I know the seminar class goes more in-depth but if you self-study diligently, you can learn a lot.",
    "I personally really don't like Econ, but it did take taking this course for me to learn that.",
    "Never do this nonsense.",
    "Beware with this class. The content is not that difficult, but the big lecture style simply did not work for me.",
    "Yes. The knowledge gained from the class was worth all of the hard work that I put into it. The grades are forgiving, even when I felt like I was drowning in the concepts.",
    "Understand that this class takes more effort than most people will admit. Anyone who tells you that you don't need to read for the class is lying to you and does not love you. Read the book, take some notes. It's immensely helpful. Try to find a good TF and go to office hours when you can to try to get one on one explanations about troublesome topics. It's not a horrible class over all, but it's more work than you may expect to really understand concepts.",
    "I think this class is a great class to take, even if you aren't an economics major. It provides information about a lot of different economic principles anyone will need in the future regardless of career path.",
    "If you are interested in economics at all, I would recommend this class. It can be a little tedious at times, but I think that I left the class with a substantial understanding of microeconomics in the end. Beware that in this massive class, you will not receive any attention from a professor or TA, so you really have to be ready to go out of your way to seek help.",
    "This course does exactly what one expects. Probably harder than its analog at a state college, but not by that much. If you're strong with algebra you should have absolutely no problem with this. I spent about an hour per week on the problem sets and no more than three hours studying per exam. Compared to other QR credits at Yale (like anything in the MATH or STAT departments), this is very simple mathematically. However, if you are not proficient at algebra you will probably get lost. The curve is somewhat gentle (at least 10% got an A, 20% got an A-, 25% got a B+ if I remember correctly), but if you do not do well with algebra I would be skeptical that you could get a good grade without really working on it. Sections are hit-or-miss. If you have a good TF you might learn something each time and find them helpful. If you have an average or poor TF, you probably won't learn that much, though if you have nothing else to do, it can't hurt to go, I suppose. Still, you should be just fine even if you never go to section.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is planning on majoring in economics or just simply wishes to possess a basic understanding of microeconomics. This course is very helpful and necessary in that sense, but I would avoid it if you aren't planning on pursuing a career path that either directly or indirectly requires an understanding of economics.",
    "Yes, good intro to micro",
    "I think this is a good subject for people to take at least some time in their life, so I would recommend it. Who you have as a TA, though, has a lot to do as for how well you know concepts. I did not have a great TA, which meant I had to learn concepts more on my own than I probably should have, but if you have a good TA it'll be fine.",
    "This class is a great QR because it is not very mathematically demanding and lies heavily on logic. Micro is also very useful information to know.",
    "Yes, it's a necessary introduction to economics and a good place to start.",
    "It depends on what the students interests are, but in general yes. This is a great way to get to know concepts that define every aspect of our lives as we know them. Don't be fooled by the \"technicalities.\" Everything, including what you choose to eat for dinner, can be determined by economics.",
    "No. If you enjoy not enjoying your classes, go ahead. I didn't talk to a single student who enjoyed this class or the content.",
    "Steven Barry is great! He delivers curriculum in an easy to understand way. This course also has a lot of resources available to students to make sure that everyone in this massive lecture can receive help. It does take effort to do well in this class, but it's nothing that can't be managed.",
    "In terms of introductory microeconomics courses, this is the better of the two options at Yale from what I understand. However, the problem sets aren't graded with feedback, nor are the midterms so there isn't much direction in terms of how to improve. The teaching fellows aren't necessarily equally helpful either.",
    "Not unless you're going to or are thinking of majoring in Econ. Not worth the stress.",
    "Yes, but only if you are considering a major in economics. Otherwise, the material might seem a little dry.",
    "If Prof. Berry is teaching, I would definitely recommend this course, albeit while warning about the weekly problem sets and unreliability of TF teaching quality. As long as you find a study group and a responsive TF or tutor, this class is very doable and interesting.",
    "Yes, the course was interesting and the course material is useful for anybody to know.",
    "Definitely take the course if you are thinking about global affairs, ep&e, econ, applied math, or something like that. It isn't hard, and learning about the economy is good. Make sure to get a good TA though, they are the ones who grade your psets.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who 1. does well in a lecture setting and 2. has an invested interest in economics. for those without a serious interest in the subject, it can get quite dry and quite frustrating at times.",
    "As an introductory economics course, definitely",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is independent, disciplined, and motivated, for the nature of the lecture is that it can be difficult for students to get the individual attention they need, as is possible in smaller classes. Thus, it is important that a student can self-study the material, although section does help.",
    "No, class is too large to effectively teach everyone, especially those who are struggling.",
    "As someone with no prior econ experience and no interest in pursuing it further, I still had a good time. Professor Berry is a great lecturer, really smart but also super engaging. And, as he proved this semester with the election shenanigans, a really good guy. The work isnt always easy, but, if you show up and pay attention, none of it is honestly that bad. The perspective the course provides is different and interesting and hopefully will be useful for life. If youre a humanities person looking for a QR credit thats not too painful but also intellectually stimulating, you could do far worse.",
    "I'd recommend the course to anyone considering an Economics major. It's a good class to get an idea of what the major will be like.",
    "It's introductory microecon. What do you expect honestly? It's good for what it is, but don't think it will change your life. Take it with Berry. He's a good professor, and a thoughtful person, as evidenced by how he made the midterm optional because of the election.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is not too hard and if you try, it is easy to get a good grade. Also, very necessary for taking econ classes in the future.",
    "I thought it was a great introductory course to test the waters of economics.",
    "Take it if Berry's teaching.",
    "Yes, I think this class provides crucial information on how our economy functions and how firms and consumers make decisions. The course is honestly just helpful in improving one's understanding of life.",
    "Recommended. Professor Berry is a strong lecturer, and does a good job of linking the more abstract concepts to things we care about. Also feel like the material in this course is stuff most people should know.",
    "Yes, but be sure to do the readings! And be sure that you are somewhat interested in Economics, because it can get dry at times.",
    "You probably need to take this for your major, but if you take it with Steve Berry, you will actually enjoy it and learn a lot. Professor Berry is not only one of the most engaging, funny lecturers I have had in my time at Yale, but he places an emphasis on the real-world applications of microeconomics, which was refreshing in an intro class. The workload is pretty average. The problem sets are not easy but also definitely not impossible, especially if you work with a study group (and they drop the two lowest grades at the end of the semester). The exams were reasonable, and the best way to study for them is to just do lots of practice problems. Professor Berry provided us with a wealth of past problem sets and exams to study from, which was so helpful. You've probably heard about the generous intro econ curve, which is certainly true, but don't take it for granted. Especially if Berry is teaching, not many people will drop the course and fill out the bottom of the curve.",
    "Yes, I think it provides a good foundational background in microeconomics and is also a bonding experience because about 1\/10th of Yale undergrad is taking it during any given semester! The workload isn't too bad and the psets can be completed with friends. Exams are straightforward enough, and if you do the psets you'll be fine.",
    "It's just one of those intro classes you have to take. I recommend the lecture. Not necessarily hard. Boring if anything. Generous curve too.",
    "This is a good course for any student thinking that they might want to major in economics. It is very helpful in determining your level of interest in the course.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course. Easier curve, great understanding with Prof. Berry, well planned curriculum. It all makes sense in the end.",
    "It's a good foundation course and refresher for those who took AP micro in highschool. If you took the AP course in your senior year and are eligible to skip, you should.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good introduction to microeconomics, however I would advise students to take advantage of every resource given on top of discussion section. Attending discussion section is not enough! Speak with your TF a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in microeconomics or want to learn more about supply, demand, and taxation. Though Berry is a good lecturer, it is not a very exciting course so you have to be interested in the material already. I also recommend not putting off the work, because it is easy to zone out in lecture and fall behind.",
    "It was a good way to get introduced to Econ. Having a nice curve helped reduce stress, but not so much that you could slack off, which made sure you kept up. I wish seminars were available without the stress of a strict curve because the lecture format made learning more difficult and rather boring. Students who have taken econ before definitely have an advantage in either setting, but may want to take the seminar because it is more engaging. Students who have no prior experience can definitely do well in the lecture if they work hard, and I'm not sure if the same can be said for the seminar.",
    "These principles are important in understanding the frameworks of the capitalist societies that dictate the systems we live in everyday. It is important in applying to any of the myriad social sciences, and is a good class to take regardless of your overall major.",
    "Yes. Great course I think everyone should take regardless of interest in econ or not.",
    "No. If you have not already taken Econ, this course will be extremely challenging.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. A lot of students may say otherwise because they like to complain, didn't go to lecture, and did bad in the class. People blamed Berry for their own incompetence. The course is fine and you will do fine if you're responsible.",
    "Yes; I feel that it's a fundamental part of the Yale experience, but also it helps one understand some of the basic reasons of why the economy works the way it does.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to get an introduction to economics with a solid background in algebra. If you have difficulty with formulae and number manipulation, this course could be pretty challenging for you.",
    "Yes. It is worth it for the fun times that happen.",
    "Yes! Econ is a subject where you really don't know if you'll like it until you try it, so definitely give it a shot at the very least.",
    "Good introduction to economics for anyone who hasn't taken the course before.",
    "If you are comfortable with STEM this course will be significantly easier for you, but you need to go to class! (or at least get the class notes from someone). The problem sets take twice as long without them.",
    "Economics is worth taking for a number of reasons, and these may or may not include how interesting the course is on its own merits. I'm not going to say I looked forward to going to lecture every day, and the number of topics I found genuinely interesting were far outweighed by those I didn't. But they're concepts that everyone should know, and the material gets more interesting the more you understand the basics. So, I would recommend this course, but don't take this to mean that it's especially enjoyable.",
    "Unless that student was interested in a career that would actually employ the skills learned in what is predominantly a math course, I cannot in good conscience subject a fellow student to this. I will likely follow suite of past course evaluators in not only not recommending this course, but actively attempting to dissuade others from taking it. It was unfortunate that I did not heed their advice in the first place.",
    "Yes it was an interesting course.",
    "Take it if you want to see what econ's like. Pretty solid course, no higher math beyond basic algebra required. Can be conceptually difficult, but the curve is also generally fairly good.",
    "Being an intro course and QR credit, a lot of students take this to fulfill a requirement. If you're considering taking this class, it can be made a much better experience by doing the following: - figure out which TA is good and start going to their section. The disparity in TAs was pretty huge and important in this course. - study outside of the class. Professor Berry will often draw a graph or mention a concept once in lecture an then expect you to know it by heart. A lot of it builds on itself, so it's easy to fall behind. - it's not required, but read the textbook when needed. A lot of students found it more helpful in learning the content than most other resources. - when preparing for exams, practice as many past tests as possible and go to the good TA's review session. On the whole, this class isn't a ton of work and has a really nice curve. If you work at it, it's a manageable class.",
    "I would recommend it, but be prepared to teach yourself how to apply the concepts and formulas learned in lecture to questions that you will see on exams. The PSets are the only practice you get with problems, so do those on your own unless you want to be cramming the night before the exam because you understand the concepts but have no idea how to apply those concepts and formulas to actual problems.",
    "Steven Berry makes this class fun, informative, and worthwhile. While I know some people have difficulties keeping fully engaged during a large lecture, if you can muster the strength to keep focus, the class gives an excellent foundation to economics with a generous curve and low workload. I'd absolutely recommend to anyone.",
    "Take it even if you're not an econ major. A lot of my friends who aren't are now genuinely interested in Econ. It's not a hard class, you just have to make time to understand and become one with the concepts. Graphs are hella important!!!",
    "Yes! This course is a must-take whether you are considering economics as a major or just for the general knowledge that would equip you with a better understanding of basic yet essential economic knowledge. It has a light workload, one p-set a week, 2 midterms and a final, with the exams being easy, very similar to previous exams provided. Steve Berry is an amazing lecturer : he is extremely engaging, light-hearted, and a very good teacher!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes--to a freshman exploring different fields of study, to an upperclassman trying to fill a credit, or for a humanities major looking to round out their curriculum. Definitely useful skills to learn. It also helps you gauge your understanding of markets and how consumers\/producers interact (valuable knowledge out there in the real world).",
    "Definitely! Great course and the professor was excellent, very insightful. I think it's definitely a course everybody should take for a thorough understanding of microeconomics and its applications to important issues today like health insurance, pollution regulation, etc.",
    "Yes! It is a great overview of microeconomics and teaches you to think about graphs and mathematics in a new context.",
    "Be prepared for more work than you expected; problem sets are challenging and tests are even more challenging. Understanding the material is not easy, and lecture moves way too fast to be engaging, and it tends to become incredibly boring after the 30 minute mark. However, Professor Berry is incredibly knowledgable and is teaching at the mere surface of economic theory. It is much, much easier to understand the material after going over his lecture slides on your own- he presents information well on paper, but tends to get confusing when he speaks over the slides. The class has a great curve, and you'll have 400 other classmates willing to help explain problem sets or key concepts to you!",
    "Yes.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who might at all be interested in Economics or economic thinking. It's the basics. Take it if you want.",
    "Yes",
    "Could class to see if you enjoy Econ. Easy curve as well",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to dive into economics, obviously, but also to anyone interested in how human behavior and choices can be expressed scientifically and mathematically.",
    "If you are interested in econ, yes! If not and are just looking for a QR, it's a lot of work.",
    "Yes, a great intro economics course.",
    "I would never recommend this course as just something fun to take. Micro is boring, and the hardest part of this class is staying awake in lecture. However, if you need it for your major or need it as a prereq it's really not bad. It's good enough to take if you need it, but not good enough to take for fun. Definitely seems to be graded fairly, and Berry is pretty entertaining in lecture. Just overall a meh course, but more so because of the material than because of the professor.",
    "Yes, I would. Prof. Berry is an engaging teacher, and he makes the topics seem interesting and fun. The course is not terribly difficult, since only the basics are covered, but I felt as though I gained a nuanced ability to analyze advanced topics nonetheless. Also, do not worry too much about grading. Berry has a generous curve, and essentially no one gets a C or lower.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it is important to have a foundation in economics as a part of a liberal arts education. I think this class should be necessary for all majors.",
    "Yes, it was a good, fun way to cover the topics and a ton of my friends took the course too so that was fun.",
    "Yes. The material is interesting and is good to know at least the basics of.",
    "Not a hard course. Read the textbook and you will be fine. I would recommend this to another student.",
    "Yes - very good introduction to micro",
    "It is fine",
    "yes because it provides a good base for those who are interested in economics",
    "This course is a great way to start your path towards an Econ major, but it can also be used useful for students looking for an interesting distributional requirement.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although the curve saved my grade many times, I feel I would have learned a lot more in the seminar course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an easy QR, and to better understand how consumers and firms make decisions. Intro course in micro, pretty self explanatory.",
    "Yes, good course great teacher",
    "Yes, this was a relevant course that was engaging and made sense. It was also my easiest course which was nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great introductory course if someone has an interest in economics. I liked it more than some other introductory courses I have taken because although it is introductory, we still were able to go in depth into the subjects that we studied.",
    "Yes, I think this class was a great overview to microeconomics. Definitely a useful class to take, especially with Professor Berry.",
    "Yes, it is a great opportunity to understand how economics applies to the real- world.",
    "Yes I think any the topics covered are important for anyone to learn as they can help with understanding of the world.",
    "Take if you want a solid foundation in micro.",
    "Yes, because I think it introduces a useful way of thinking about the world and is very applicable for other subjects.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as you get a lot of support from the course instructor and TAs. Everything is organized really well and the resources offered online are splendid!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for students who need a QR credit or would like to major in economics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, as I believe a basic knowledge of Economics is important in developing one's knowledge and broader understanding of the world.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other Yale students. It is quite informative and not too difficult; it covers principles which are applicable to everyday life.",
    "Yes because the material is a solid basis for future economic exploration\/coursework.",
    "Introductory Microeconomics is a class that is useful for understanding the details and workings of choice in terms of spending and production. If students are interested in understanding how the economics on a more personal scale (small towns, individual purchases, etc.), I believe that this class would be suitable for those students.",
    "I think this was a well organized indroductory economics course, and although I'm not sure that I would like to continue with Econ, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the field.",
    "This class is a good introduction to economics and might help you discover if you want to major in it.",
    "I would recommend it because the course material is so important, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a student because of how good the course itself is.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The subject matter is very applicable to many fields of study and life in general. Professor Berry was great, and all the TAs were increasingly helpful. Overall a great class!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students. It was both challenging and accessible and taught many valuable concepts about the power of the market and helped educate us on how to be critical consumers and thinkers.",
    "Yes it was a lot of information to learn and not extremely difficult.",
    "This course was enlightening and very thorough. If you want to receive an introduction to economics as a field, this course is perfect. The instruction by Prof. Berry was perfect, and he really helped make the information more understandable and relevant. I also liked that he would take time to apply information to current events (like Obamacare and mortgage, etc). Overall, I loved the course and would def. recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this to a student genuinely interested in Economics. I think the class is demanding so a real commitment is necessary to ensure that they perform well",
    "yes, minimal work",
    "Take it if you want to learn a little bit about basic economics. Professor Berry is good, but it's not the most incredible class you will ever take. Find a study group, and make sure to check out past tests and problem sets for extra help. Knowing some calculus is not necessary, but it would definitely help.",
    "I would not reccommend this course to another student, especially if they're trying to take it for a QR credit. You need some sort of background in economics or else you'll fall behind, which is ridiculous for an introdutory course.",
    "If you are interested in taking economics classes, this is a great class to take. The seminar version of this class is definitely harder, but may not prepare you any better for an Econ major. That would be a question to ask someone in the seminar though.",
    "Yes because it helps understand the market better and it helps with the general knowledge of economics.",
    "Not really, unless you're interested in taking higher level economics classes in the future.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "If you need a QR, I guess you could take it. It's one of the more useful courses in QR.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone considering a potential major in Economics - good framework upon which one can pursue more economics classes.",
    "I would. I think the reasoning the course teaches you and having an understanding of our economy are important skills for any graduate.",
    "Yes. The lectures can seem boring and repetitive and it is frustrating to learn econ without calculus, but I learned a lot of important vocabulary and concepts with regards to economics that really helped me understand the news, the world, etc.",
    "- I recommend it only because it is a prerequisite for a lot of majors.",
    "Yes, everyone should talk microeconomics because it is applicable in whichever field they study",
    "Yes would definitely recommend if you're interested in econ at all.",
    "Yes. It is very interesting and gives a new perspective on analyzing markets.",
    "no",
    "No.",
    "Yes- but not because of how the course is taught. I just think its important to know economics.",
    "Yes it is very applicable in life.",
    "Yes, i think it is an important course and I would recommend it to other students because i believe it is a valuable course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in economics. It can be difficult to understand some of the concepts and the problem sets are often challenging however it does give you a good, strong introduction to microeconomics.",
    "I would not recommend it because the lecture learning method is difficult and disengaging for microeconomics which is a subject that is easy once engaged in.",
    "Of course! The general economics gained in this course is important for any field. The class is not easy but it is doable of you are willing to put the work into the assignments and attend section.",
    "The class is a fine introduction if you like economics. I disagree with several assumptions made within the philosophy (i.e. more is better, utilitarianism is a good philosophy), and wish we would just read the Wealth of Nations as part of the class.",
    "Yes offers a good intro to econ.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. lf a student is very engaged with the course, then the course provides a very strong understanding of economic principles.",
    "I would recommend this course. Having a basic understanding of economics is important no matter what your field of study is. It is a well organized, well taught, relatively easy class. The p-sets take about an hour a week and the tests are fair. It can be a little dull and a little slow, but that's part of making the material accessible to a wide range of students.",
    "Yes I would",
    "Yes, it's a good course to begin to learn how to think marginally and economically.",
    "Yes, I believe that everyone should take at least a basic class in economics. I feel that this class offered the skills and thinking that are necessary to certain aspects of adult life.",
    "This class was good and a pretty easy SO credit. It certainly helps if you are familiar with calculus, but definitely not necessary. GO. TO. LECTURE. You don't even have to pay attention all the time, just go and listen. It helps TREMENDOUSLY.",
    "I'd say go for it - it will be difficult and sometimes frustrating but if you pay attention in class and go to residential college peer tutors you can make it through the class well and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who wants to learn content, but who does not necessarily want a high level of engagement in the class.",
    "Yes, because as long as you are making sure that you are understanding the material as it comes you can do well.",
    "Yes, it is an important course to take and understand the material.",
    "Absolutely. As someone who had never studied economics before, this class was instrumental to my learning of the concepts and I really enjoyed it. Although I had never taken microeconomics before, most of my friends had taken Econ in high school and still struggled and learned a lot of new material in this class so I would say even non-beginners should take this class.",
    "The class is a 400+ person lecture; the TAs will be your main points of contact with the course material. Professor Berry was definitly highlight; he was engaging and funny and really tried to make the material relevant to all of us. Don't listen to reviews that say this class will be \"easy\" though. It won't be if you slack off. You've gotta keep up with the lecture notes, and READ. In-class explanations will be broad and examples will be sparse. Make sure you do the practice P-sets and exams as those will be where you will get the most learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I most certainly would.",
    "Only because it is necessary for many majors here.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. ECON 115 teaches about the way we think and act within the lens of market transactions and economic efficiency, going through the legal and social realms of their explanation. The potential to apply this to real-world experiences is so high that one might even find herself thinking about the principles as she shops in a store or market, or as she hears about the economy of individual businesses on the news. To be a well-informed citizen is to know the system of economy and I believe that any truly capable student will enjoy the insights taught in this class.",
    "yes, I would take it if you are at all interested in economics",
    "Great introductory course and insight into economics.",
    "It's an important stepping stone that you should at least attempt to take so you get at the very least a basic understanding of concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the basics concepts of economics, but not to those who are just looking for an easy QR credit. This class is definitely not easy, especially to students who are not interested in economics in the first place.",
    "Yes! It's a great way to learn the basics about how our economies work!",
    "Yes, the class was interesting and challenging without being overbearing and course material was quite applicable to real life.",
    "Take this course WITH Steven Berry. The other instructor is not comparable, from what I hear. Prof Berry gives a beautiful introduction to economics, telling both the great things about markets while highlighting some important critiques. An informed citizen has taken a class similar to this one.",
    "Yes. A great introduction to learning how to manage time in college, and the class itself is intellectually stimulating.",
    "I would recommend this class over the seminar only if you've taken microeconomics before and are good at self-studying. If you find math helpful in explaining concepts, I hear the seminar is much better.",
    "Yes, challenging but well set up and rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would. Good introductory class.",
    "Yes to a student seeking an overview of microeconomics in a low-pressure learning environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics.",
    "Economics is a subject that influences every aspect of our lives, everyone should take introductory econ.",
    "Yes; it is a good course to learn the basics. It is also helpful to work with all of your classmates.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is a great course and I would recommend it to anyone. The textbook is very helpful and it is a good idea to look over the chapter before lecture. This will help you keep up with the material during lecture.",
    "I guess? I took it for a social science (don't need it to major or anything) and it was okay. Honestly the easiest class I took this semester, and it feels good to feel like you understand the economy a bit. That being said I've been told there are better ways to do that, like ignoring prerequisites and just sneaking into Macro. Seriously, nobody will stop you. I haven't taken Macro myself, so I can't REALLY vouch for it, and Micro is a solid course, I'm just saying, that's what I've heard.",
    "This is a great course taught by a great professor! The class provides a fantastic introduction to the foundations of economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student but caution them that it may go at a bit of a fast pace for someone who has never taken econ before.",
    "Yes, I would, to all students."
