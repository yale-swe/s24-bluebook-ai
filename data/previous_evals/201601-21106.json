    "Make sure you pick a project you are willing to put time into, pick an advisor who is supportive, and find friends to work on senior project with so you dont fall behind. It is very easy to fall behind.",
    "Start thinking about your project as early as you can and talk to professors the semester before you enroll in 490. It's really beneficial to go into the semester knowing what you want to work on and who your adviser might be.",
    "Anyone taking this probably has to, so yeah, take it.",
    "umm, it's required. find a PI\/project early. Don't expect any help from the DUS.",
    "It depends on the project and advisor. For me, I met with my advisor once a week to discuss ideas and get advice on implementing them. Then I coded by myself for 6-10 hours\/week.",
    "Work on something that you care about and that excites you, and you'll be fine!",
    "Treat the project like any other class. Work on it 7.5-9 hours a week from the beginning of the semester and you will be fine. I had a lot of fun writing a program that I wanted to write, and researching a problem I thought was interesting. I would have wanted to do these things anyway, but it was so much better to do them as my senior requirement project!",
    "A fairly easy capstone class in the CS major. Find an advisor early, preferably in the semester before and make sure to make significant headway in the project before midterm. Your advisor appears to be your primary grader, so be sure to meet with them often and demonstrate that you are making headway on your project. Unless your advisor has a stake in the project, you must be very independent and proactive about the course. Clearly, you wouldn't be taking the class if you didn't have to. Just make sure to do it right.",
    "It's really nice to be able to work on whatever you want. Take advantage of that.",
    "Yes. 1) You have to take it. 2) It's nice to work on an actual project trying to solve actual problems instead of cobbling something together for a problem set. 3) You get to know a professor well, which is often difficult in other computer science courses.",
    "You gotta do it, might as well make the most of it. I loved Professor Rushmeier as my advisor because she held weekly meetings with me and another student doing related work which both helped me keep track of my own progress (pressure from a weekly meeting works great for me at least), and gave me someone to work with and bounce ideas off of in the form of another student."
