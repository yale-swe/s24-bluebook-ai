   "comments": [
    "Not really. Lecture was extremely boring, readings were worse (although, luckily, the readings were totally unnecessary). I learned a ton in this class about a part of the world I didn't understand at all, so I don't regret taking the course, but I wish Prof. Cho had turned it into an interactive seminar instead of interminable lectures. If he changes the format, take the course, otherwise skip it.",
    "I would def recommend this class for more knowledge on politics of South and North Korea.",
    "If you have any interest at all in political science, international relations, East Asia, or Korea in particular, I highly recommend this course. I came into it knowing virtually nothing (about Korean history\/politics and about political science in general), and came out having learned so much. The history and political situation of the two Koreas is fascinating and instructive on many levels. Professor Cho's lectures were great, and he has many anecdotes from his own experience growing up under both authoritarian and democratic regimes in South Korea. The only drawback was that there is so much material to cover that Professor Cho sometimes had to rush through certain parts of lectures, making it difficult to keep up with note-taking. But that wasn't a huge problem, because he posted all the powerpoint slides online afterwards. Although there is a decent amount of weekly reading assigned, to be honest, the readings were not necessary in order to do well on the exams. I recommend you read them anyway, though, just because they are so interesting. Readings aside, the workload of this course is very light - one midterm, one 10-page essay, and a final. The learning-to-work ratio felt very high, which is always a plus.",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations. The title of this course is somewhat misleading--I was expecting a course on the politics and society of South and North Korea. Although we did cover those topics, we devoted a lot of time to the economy and economic histories of the two nations. As someone without econ background, this often proved confusing and challenging. The lectures were somewhat dry, especially those on economics. But the readings were often interesting, especially in some of the books. Also, most of my classmates were either Korean or had an extensive knowledge of Korean history (which was not my case). This seemed to put me at a disadvantage in some of the lectures.",
    "Take the class if you are interested in Korea. Don't be discouraged about the teaching style",
    "midterm is easy. paper is graded harshly, please be wise. final is slightly harder. lectures are pretty boring, so decide for yourself. the professor is super nice, (pushed paper due date back a week for everyone) very smart, but not very engaging (typical prof...) some readings are interesting. overall pretty average. not horrible, not bad. going to lecture once or twice during shopping period will give you a clear idea of entire semester.",
    "Good course to take if you're interested in N\/S Korean relationship, but not the course to take if you are just looking for an easy class or a random poli sci class.",
    "Grading seems arbitrary and lectures weren't the best. With that said, I did learn quite a bit although this course does have much more potential.",
    "Yes, highly recommended",
    "It's a great way to learn about the social, political and economic drivers behind the development of the two Koreas and the nuclear conflict, from both historical and present-day perspectives.",
    "Yes, I would, but only if you're interested in the two countries of course.",
    "If you want to learn about the political and economic situation in North and South Korea, take this class. You will learn A LOT and come out with a much stronger knowledge of the roots of the problems that exist in the two Koreas."
