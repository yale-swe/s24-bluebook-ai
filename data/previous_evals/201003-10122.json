    "yes. take it",
    "If you have ever thought about trying to start a business, take this course.Even if you haven't, if you are in science or engineering, the lessons you learn in the class could be invaluable to you later in life",
    "Great class where you learn a lot about entrepreneurship and not only the how to's of starting a company but also the theory behind it in addition to the. Yes, DEFINITELY TAKE IT!",
    "Interesting class on starting a tech start-up. Not too much work, but is focused on completing a semester long project. Be ready with some start-up ideas before going in, otherwise you may be left in the dust. The speakers were definitely the highlight of the class. People from law firms, investment banks, and entrepreneurs all were brought in to make this a more complete experience. Definitely recommend.",
    "I have learned so much about the intricacies of entrepreneurship from Sean and the guest speakers that he invited. As someone who has started a company before, I know that a lot of the stuff he talks about in class are extremely relevant to real-life application. Some of graded works is kind of redundant in my opinion, but not too big of a problem, workload is not difficult at all.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any aspiring entrepreneur, or even someone who enjoys applying critical thinking to the business domain (which not many Yale courses offer). The readings are also excellent.",
    "Interesting course. Wish Yale offered more practical\/applicable classes like this one. Sean (and the course) was pretty disorganized throughout, but he extremely knowledgable due to his real world entrepreneurship experience. I really have no idea what to expect in terms of grade, so be warned about that. He probably won't teach it again, but if he does, I guess I'd recommend it.",
    "A pretty light course with valuable real-world lessons and networking connections. Take it--if you can get in."
