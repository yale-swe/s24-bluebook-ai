   "comments": [
    "Throughout the course I learned how to not only read papers at a higher level, but also how to think more deeply about problems\/experiments\/etc encountered in science. Also developed the ability to better articulate and communicate my ideas",
    "How to read a paper, how to critically discuss scientific methods\/theories\/etc, and how to creatively think of improvements\/new experiments to solve a problem.",
    "Most importantly, I learned how to think better.",
    "I developed critical thinking skills when reading research articles. I learned the classical logics behind molecular biology research and a lot of elegant research techniques and strategies.",
    "Learned how to analyze scientific papers and look through the authors' logic to understand the paper better.",
    "The course has pushed me beyond my ability to think critically about and become familiar with the methods. What I appreciate from the course are the professors' efforts to ask us questions about the articles. They have shown us the way that we should be thinking about these articles when we do read them and shouldn't always believe what's written but rather use our knowledge and reasoning to logically validate whether the results support the hypothesis or not. Coming up with a question for the proposal was particularly challenging for me but this course gave us the potential to think about unique ideas for a follow up experiment on a research article. Reading, writing, and presentation skills have also improved. Overall, a great course and my favourite of the semester!",
    "different methods to study biological questions, critical thinking about how to read experimental data and design our own experiments",
    "How to read papers and all the tools I need for research",
    "I found that this course was particularly helpful for developing my science vocabulary. I really appreciated the time on Tuesdays working with my classmates to understand the papers we had read for the week.",
    "I had already read a lot of literature and had experience discussing experiments in the style used here, but I still think this was the most useful course I took this semester. The repetition in reading was useful and I have more appreciation for the progression of scientific knowledge. Additionally, I feel as though I learned more in the way of techniques than I did with either of the two other MB&B courses I've taken.",
    "This class challenged me to think about research critically and a certain amount of skepticism. Reading primary literature is an inevitable part of conducting research and this class allows us to exercise that skill. This class allowed me to expand my molecular biology\/intellectual arsenal and pushed me to think outside of the box.",
    "I developed my skills in critical reading and creative thinking.",
    "Great knowledge about the basics of science methodologies",
    "I think the course was the most useful course that I took. The course helped me learn about how basic research progressed over time, and also familiarized me with lots of biochemistry and genetics tools.",
    "How to think like a scientist and examine literature critically",
    "I think this course greatly developed my skills in academic research paper reading comprehension. I also think we learned a lot about how to evaluate and discuss research effective with my classmates as well as professors. The course also familiarized me with common methods in a more practical way than I had learned them previously. There was also an emphasis on the logical connection between hypothesis, experiment and interpretation.",
    "Critical Thinking",
    "How to understand a paper and how to ask appropriate question. This course lead us to see all the important and different method applied in the past to see how they solve the problem and their strength and weakness.",
    "- understanding that even well-put-together papers by respected groups in respectable journals can be completely wrong (the Vale actin paper, for example) - greater appreciation of the creativity required to do molecular biology, especially in the early days (Luria\/Delbruck, etc)",
    "This course helped me improve how I read primary research articles. Our class discussions ensured that we had understood the authors' overall goal, had engaged with the material, and understood the figures. I also learned so much other information about research techniques and strategies that were discussed in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Encourages critical thinking. Enough work to make you \"think\" about the course a bit but not too much to be overwhelming. Very fun and interactive discussions about papers. Weaknesses - The course is very much what one makes of it. Days when I was sick or otherwise off made for a poor experience in discussion section. Quality could very much be dependent on classmates.",
    "we need pizza on Tuesdays, too.",
    "Strengths: immeasurable Weaknesses: papers are more genetics focused and is a little out of our field of interest. It's not necessarily a weakness, however. There were just some papers that I cared about less than others as a result.",
    "Strengths: very effective in training critical thinking skills. I hope we could discuss more modern research papers and more advanced techniques.",
    "Challenging us to think critically. Promoting a learning environment where everyone's ideas and thoughts are welcomed. I think that the course has done a good job of making everyone comfortable enough to express our thoughts, although there were still a few shy persons in the classroom. Push students to think deeper by guiding and challenging their shared thoughts and ideas. Be explicit with the writing requirements for the proposal. I like the chalk talks but I like it better when the professors \"drill\" us with questions, but I sort of missed it on the day of our presentations. I would have liked to hear more criticisms about whether the methodology is appropriate for the question, whether the question is appropriate or relates back to the big picture of the paper, whether the hypothesis justifies the scientific reasonings, etc. If the students could meet with the professor(s) in the middle of the semester to know about their progress or any form of feedback valuable to their development as a researcher, that would be good.",
    "the session I was in wasn't good organized because some of my classmates spoke too much, while other students were less engaged",
    "Final paper can be longer than 8 pages",
    "While not necessary, some basic outline of what we might want to talk about on Tuesday would have been helpful during the first and second weeks. However, I thought that on the whole the course was well organized and very engaging.",
    "This course is extremely helpful in becoming more comfortable with scientific discourse. In general, it's a great course and I'll leave further explanation to other students. Instead, I will say that the one major weakness is one for which I don't see a ready fix, with that problem being increasing engagement by quieter students. Especially for those who struggle with English as a non-native language, that class both has a lot of potential to be useful, but also is understandably intimidating. It's obvious that these quieter students are having thoughts that are insightful and would be beneficial to the group, it's just difficult to step into the conversation. As such, finding some means of helping to bring out these voices would be ideal. Also - I think even the weaker papers provide for useful discussion.",
    "This is an excellent course and I feel that it pushed me each week throughout the semester. I would recommend that students are encouraged to keep some sort of brief journal summarizing the paper they read, techniques used, main takeaways, etc. It may be useful for future years. I would also recommend the integration of a couple more modern papers.",
    "The paper selection for this class is obviously very well thought out and reflects many of the seminal discoveries in molecular biology. I enjoyed reading the papers very much. This class may benefit from a few more small writing assignments during the semester to develop writing skills and provide feedback before the final paper.",
    "The course is great, the papers are very interesting and in overall its great",
    "The class is one of the best Ive ever taken. Just wish we had more diverse papers. I think that there should be more quant heavy papers since the track now has a quantitative focus.",
    "This course really helped me to feel like a graduate student. I learned how to both argue and work with my peers at a higher level and how to interact with the faculty members. The emphasis on the logic of the papers helped to make the older papers feel relevant, while also giving me a chance to learn more of the history of the field. The only weakness I would mention is that the familiarity some of the professors had with particular papers was lower compared to the other papers occasionally, which lead to a lower quality of the discussion. This was infrequent though.",
    "None",
    "This course include many classic paper which could show us how people solve the problem in different period. However, some recent paper is less representative and a little confusing.",
    "Strengths: overall, mostly very interesting papers; good discussion questions; I like the Tuesday\/Thursday students\/students+faculty setup Weaknesses: 1) did not like the prion paper (didn't seem as high-quality as most of the others) 2) not sure mix of papers reflected the interests\/focus of the BQBS class. I thought there was a too much \"pure\" molecular biology and not enough biophysics, biochemistry, and structural biology.",
    "Strengths: A very useful class in grad school. In just a few months I feel like I learned so much. We had inclusive, understanding professors and interesting conversations. It was helpful when we discussed the other possible experiments that could be done, instead of those used by the author. In fact, it would be great if we did more of this because it would help thinking about the final project - but I know it is tricky because then we might get ideas for the final project. Weaknesses: It would be nice to get clearer instructions on the final paper, but I get the sense that the point is to be vague so that we can interpret it as we like, in which case it is fine the way it is. Additionally, when a question is asked and students who have not spoken yet are encouraged to speak, we should wait a bit longer before moving on."
