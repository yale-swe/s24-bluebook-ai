   "comments": [
    "I loved the opportunity to conduct my own research and then write about that research. I learned so much and it was a really great, conclusive experience to my time at Yale.",
    "I learned a great deal about self discipline and planning, conducting extensive research, excel use, presentation and topic focusing skills, and more.",
    "Wrote a thesis!",
    "The ability to conduct original, primary-source research to prove\/ disprove an argument; the ability to deliver dense, jargon-laden findings and backgrounds in concise and comprehensible prose; the ability to present data and use figures to convey a point.",
    "I got to become an expert on my topic, which was cool",
    "This course was the first time I feel like I really engaged in formal scholarship over a long period of time that was driven by my own questions, with a methodology designed by me. Doing a thesis is really challenging but you come out on the other side realizing how much it pushed you to a next level with your scholarship. I think this course most taught me how to work on a project over an extended period of time, while your ideas (beliefs?) and the things you're thinking about are changing so much.",
    "I learned a huge amount about my thesis topic, cell-based meat."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Less random assignments at the start of the course. It would be better to have a certain amount of pages due each week\/every other week. Everyone moves at a different pace and its good to make people just start writing out their thoughts. In addition, the small assignments were not very helpful.",
    "This course was very well done. I wish we had met a little more often but other than that I thought it was great and the individual support from section leaders and primary advisors was invaluable. I especially appreciated the clear and helpful feedback on ideas, drafts, etc.",
    "Strength: getting to bounce ideas off of your peers, having a good number of deadlines in the Fall semester in order to keep us on track Weakness: the advisors tend to try and angle us to research topics that they find interesting and that they work on and not necessarily topics that we want to pursue. There was also a lot of lack of communication when it came to deadlines -- we never received an email when the syllabus was changed for the Spring semester. Updating us more frequently over email would have been useful. The extension also seemed more to benefit the advisors to return comments to us rather than a benefit for us to have more time to finish the thesis. It added stress.",
    "Overall I felt that the second half of the course moved pretty smoothly. The actual colloquium aspect of the class did pretty much fall off this semester, and I felt that I hadn't actually seen any of my peers for most of the semester, but the pace of work on my project felt good. Peer feedback in the form of google doc comments or track changes might have been more effective than just reading and talking about each other's work",
    "strengths: course meetings that are not too infrequent to lose track of the progress of students, yet not too frequent to be a burden. The course combined the dispersed, individually paced nature with the educational objective very well. weaknesses: the colloquium should really try and make identifying thesis topics and advisors a mandated early process...",
    "Professor Fotos was really helpful and made himself available to talk. He gave helpful feedback. Could be improved with more deadlines in the Spring and more guidance on how to write a social science essay.",
    "I loved the family-style closeness of our colloquium. Having taken classes for all four years under these professors and alongside my peers, it was rewarding to see our hard work come to fruition together. I have also had the most one-on-one conversations with experts in the field (my advisors) and people who made sure my thesis was clear enough for them to be an expert too (my colloquium advisor). Finally, the perks- froyo for essay completion, SEF funding to complete the thesis, refreshments for thesis presentations- are unmatched by any major!",
    "I wish there was more put into helping students decide on what they want to research\/accomplish in their junior year. I have spoken with some other EVST majors about this and several of us feel as though we completely fell through the cracks. If you didn't do research the summer before senior year, this was a challenging process to start.",
    "This colloquium unfortunately was not very useful to me during this project. I embarked on my thesis in a pretty isolated way, and therefore found the mandatory attendance and assignments for the colloquium kind of frustrating. I think the second semester was better, because we weren't really obligated to meet with our colloquium groups (something that was not helpful to me, as all the members of my group were working on wildly different topics and coming from entirely different disciplines). Instead it was quite helpful to have organized work time, which we did one week instead of meeting for the dinners. I think to keep the weekly meetings optional is really useful because some people might be interested in coming, but it doesn't make sense for everyone. Also, it was really a problem that the colloquium was introduced to us as highly important (and small-group meetings and assignments were emphasized as mandatory), but by the last few weeks of the semester we essentially stopped hearing anything from the advisors. We got an email informing us about the change of policy regarding printed copies of the thesis only days before the deadline, and then got a week-long extension the day before the deadline... It just seemed confusing that the colloquium assignments and meetings were presented to us as so important at the beginning of the year and then right before the deadline, when students needed the most support and could have benefitted from frequent communication, the communication just sort of stopped and we were left to fend for ourselves (at last within my colloquium group, which was headed by Prof Park). We did not receive any emails or updates for almost three weeks before the deadline.",
    "I think the assignments could be better spaced out to avoid having students leave a lot of writing until the very end. I appreciated the 10-page requirement before the end of winter break, but wish that we would have had those 10 pages due before Thanksgiving break and perhaps another 6-10 due before winter break. Similarly, I would have appreciated more writing\/page number deadlines in spring semester because it would have forced me to get things done and still have time to edit and revise without being crunched.",
    "The course enabled students to engage with their thesis in a very manageable way. It enabled discussion and provoked new angles to assess how to go about creating a thesis."

    "Obviously you need this to graduate as an EVST major. But going through this exercise is 10\/10 worth it, especially given how supportive the faculty is, and the fact that you will have a piece of academic output that makes for a great photo op (among other benefits).",
    "You will procrastinate as much as they let you, but EVST does a pretty good job making sure you actually do stuff throughout the year.",
    "I mean, it's not really an option not to write a thesis for EVST ,but I would recommend it! I absolutely loved learning about my topic and having the time and ability to delve deeply into it!",
    "I would reccomend this course as it brings the EVST major to an essential close."
