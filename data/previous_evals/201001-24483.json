    "This isn't the most intensive writing workshop in the world, but it is a great excuse to read good nonfiction and to improve your own writing by example. Class discussions are really fun if you have a mixed group of people who disagree a lot. The course is worth suffering through the motherload of Hazlitt on the syllabus.",
    "YES-great class to learn how to write.",
    "This is a great class. A smart, interesting mix of students. Bromwich is not only brilliant, but also warm and helpful. A cool blend of outside reading and workshopping for a writing seminar.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is already confident enough in their writing to not be too encouraged or too deterred by any of Prof. Bromwich's rather cutting insights.",
    "You'll do a bit of reading, Hazlitt, Orwell, Woolf,and writing about cool stuff, a mini biography, an art review, etc.Yes take it. Bromwich is BRILLIANT. Take it for that reason only.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you are interested in writing and reading the great writers, this is a class for you."
