   "comments": [
    "Go to lecture, Schwartz is a hoot and Brazil is awesome.",
    "Only if you need a ROW credit. Not awful but not great.",
    "Interesting walk through Brazilian history, from its founding to the (almost) present. Not a bad course if you need an LAAA credit for the History major, but the readings are long and the exams are more difficult than they need to be (several trick questions that seemed unnecessary, seeing as the point of a history exam should be to test whether a student has learned the big themes and key historical figures\/events\/turning points of the period being studied). The course curriculum has not, it seems, been updated in several years. Overall, not a bad course, and probably important if Brazilian history is your thing - but for those looking for an LAAA, there might be better options out there in a given semester.",
    "I would weakly recommend taking this class. It's good, not great \u2013 and I'm sure there are better Latin American history classes out there.",
    "Yes, a great overview\/survey course on Brazilian history. You can go into it with literally no background on Latin America and come out with a fully formed idea of Brazil and its place in the world. Schwartz is a knowledgeable lecturer and great guy. Not too much work - readings each week, 4-6 page paper (not at the very end, which helps space out your reading period), midterm, and final. Take it.",
    "Yes. It's a good class. Not a tun of work. And a great ROW if you need for the major. Definitely take it if you're considering it.",
    "Great class!",
    "As the title suggests, it covers the course of Brazilian history and is like a long epic. It is best when you have an interest in Brazil, whether political or romantic and the lectures are a must. Don't miss out. The readings tend toward interesting, especially as you progress in the semester, and the paper is a great excuse to really delve into a part of the history that really intrigues you.",
    "A decent, though by no means amazing, way to fulfill the ROTW requirement for the history major. The lectures are interesting, but often jump around quite a bit thematically and chronologically, which can make them difficult to follow. The readings are of reasonable length for a history course, though non-history majors might be overwhelmed. The biggest problem is that it covers 500 years of history, which is too much for any course but especially one dealing with a country most of the students don't know anything about going in. Overall, though, it was a fair way to fulfill that ROTW requirement and given the choices there are I would probably take it again.",
    "This is truly one of the worst history courses I have ever taken at Yale. I'm a senior and in four years I have never had to sit through a lecture where the material was so scattered and lacking in any historical analysis. Honestly, the class seemed more in fine with something taught in high school than anything I would expect at college. The sections were a whole other issue. The professor, seemingly out of apathy, left almost half of our grade to the discretion on the teaching fellow. With little oversight, these sections were meaningless wastes of time with little, if any, relevance to the lectures or anything worthwhile for that matter. I would never suggest anyone take this course and frankly think it should be removed from the school's offerings",
    "not too difficult ROW course for history majors but not the most interesting or well taught either.",
    "History of Brazil is a great history course. It provides a comprehensive profile of Brazil from colonial times to the present in a way that is very manageable and insightful.",
    "As a survey lecture on the history of Brazil, from its \"discovery\" in 1500 to the present, you can pretty much figure out what the course is like. It does a good job of taking you through the whole history, but some of the lectures are disjointed and the arc is unclear at times; it was better for the first half. Schwartz is the absolute expert on Brazil's history and an engaging lecturer, and the work for the class is reasonable. I recommend it to history majors who need a ROW, Latin American studies majors, and anyone else interested in Brazil, one of the world's rising powers (and the only one in the Western hemisphere).",
    "I definitely recommend this course. If you have any interest about Brazil, you will leave this course knowing a lot about social, economic and political aspects of the country.",
    "Yes! Take it, whether or not you are a history major.",
    "History of Brazil is a comprehensive class that covers Brazil's social and political history, starting from the very beginning up until the end of the twentieth century. Professor Schwartz provides engaging lectures; his slides usually include old photographs and paintings depicting different eras in Brazil. I entered the class knowing nothing about Brazilian history but I have learned enough to be able to carry a conversation about Brazil. I wish the class put less emphasis on political history and more on cultural history\/music, but overall it's a great class to take if you want a solid grasp of the foundations of Brazil. The reading can be a bit dense but usually ends up being pretty rewarding. Workload is not too bad and this can be a credit-D class, though to be honest it shouldn't be that hard to do well in the class if you attend lecture and attempt to keep up with the readings.",
    "Definitely if you are looking for a Latin American history course.",
    "YES, TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "Good class and readings, interesting for laaa credit",
    "I really liked this class however it really wasn't due to a great ta or Professor Schwartz. I think the material was really interested and I was genuinely curious about the topic covered. There was a lot of reading but it was informative and useful.",
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "History of Brazil is a great introduction to Brazil and to Latin America. Take this class! Prof. Schwartz is THE authority on Brazilian history and makes each lecture engaging and interesting. The class is not necessarily difficult, but it is insightful and makes you look at Latin America in a new light.",
    "This is not your typical history course \u2013 which could be exactly what you want or exactly what you are avoiding, depending on your major and interest in history. This course is pretty in-depth, yet approachable for the non-history major. The beginning focuses on Brazil\u2019s relationship to Portugal and Europe as a whole; later on, the focus is placed on the development of Brazil\u2019s economy, government, and national identity. Professor Schwartz has probably had the same presentations since PowerPoint was invented, but that does not take away from his expertise in Brazilian history and culture. He lectures in a chronological fashion, which makes studying much simpler. From my experience, doing a sizeable portion of the readings is fairly crucial, but they are fascinating with few exceptions. There is one 5-7 page paper, for which you can choose your own topic; I suggest you do a bit of research. The midterm and final were both fair, and we were given enough information so we could adequately prepare. I would suggest this course to non-humanities and humanities majors alike. It\u2019s a decent course for history majors looking to fulfill an easy LAAA requirement.",
    "History course that covers Brazil from the beginning. Really interesting, good balance and pace. Interesting course readings. Great way to practice your Portuguese--definitely changed the way I view Brazil, Portugal, colonialism, the general history of the world and global development."
