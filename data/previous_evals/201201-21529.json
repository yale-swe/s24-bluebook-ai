    "So I'm not going to lie: French 151 is a lot of work. You will have homework every day, and the class is small enough that you have to do it. You get out of it what you put into it. Personally, I really struggled in the beginning, because I felt my French background in high school was not too rigorous, but at the end of the course, I realized my French had improved tremendously. When I was studying for the final, I was looking back at a composition that I had done way at the beginning, and I realized, Wow, I actually learned a lot. Sounds like a totally banal observation, I know, but sometimes, amidst all the endless grammar exercises and awkward class discussions where you're frantically searching for something to say because it's such a small class that you're forced to participate and having to memorize lists of vocab for tests that happen every two weeks, well amidst all that, it just starts to feel like a ton of work and you forget why you're doing that. THe point is that if you want to truly get a grasp on French, take French 151.",
    "French 151 is generally much better than French 140 in terms of material studied and books read. I would recommend it for any French majors and those just passionate about French."
