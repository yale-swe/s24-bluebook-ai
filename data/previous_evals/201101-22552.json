   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! A fascinating class, and definitely worth it if you're interested in the material. But keep in mind that it is somewhat theoretical. The professors are great, and the workload is reasonable, but you will be expected to do your work well. Prof. Wood in particular expects a lot of her students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in perpetrator behaviour. There's a lot of reading and it's difficult to gauge how you're doing in the class (we have 5 reading responses marked with just checks and a final paper). I wish they could have provided more feedback but they are definitely difficult graders. Nonetheless, we learned a lot and I think they selected a good group of students to be in the class, which led to pretty fruitful discussions for the most part.",
    "Great class. There is a lot of reading, but it's well worth it.",
    "It is a tough subject to deal with, but the sort of thing that everyone should attempt at least once in their lives.",
    "Don't take this unless you are willing to work very hard and be criticized consistently by the professors. this class seemed very interesting and I did learn a lot from it, but it is way too focused on theory and discussions in class were often boring and repetitive. The professors set expectations very high for students and it almost seemed like they expected us to be grad students at times. I am unsure how the grading will work here.",
    "I totally recommend this course. The readings were carefully chosen, the professors were knowledgeable and approachable, and the discussion was intellectually stimulating. The material refines your understanding of human psychology, especially the reasons that lead a person to harm another person. If you're interested in the motivational and social psychological explanations for violence, you should take this seminar.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! BEST seminar or class I have taken at Yale by far. The discussion was extremely genuine, with a lot of kids who were really interested in the subject, and had a lot of international experience relevant to the course. This course is a lot of work, but I cannot imagine a better course in which to do my senior essay. Prof. Wood was a fantastic advisor ! She will make you work hard, but your paper will be great by the end.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in learning more about political violence and social psychology. When I went into the class, I don't think it was clear to me that there would be such a large focus on social psychology, but I found the material to be fascinating.",
    "Good class.Elisabeth wood is incredible. Demanding and won't cut you any slack, but it will push you academically probably more than other classes at yale, which is good.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Both professors genuinely care about the subject are sweet and approachable and were eager to improve the course for the future. Reading about genocide and killing week after week does get a bit depressing, but for such heavy material the class struck an appropriate balance between serious and light.",
    "Take it, you won't regret it. Meghan and Professor Wood are great instructors."
