   "comments": [
    "Writing at Yale 101. If you want to write anything, take this course (unless you are a writing superstar). I enthusiastically recommend this course to other students-you learn so much. Prepare for lots of work, and brace yourself for bad grades.",
    "I highly recommend English 114 14 because of the interesting readings and helpful advice of the professor. I can definitely say that my writing improved significantly as the semester went on. Entertaining and relevant movies plus good readings\/discussions and a helpful teacher made this an excellent class.",
    "War Terror and Text begins with a review of classic military theory. The ideas in these core texts are then developed through close readings of modern military documents, political essays and cultural objects. I would recommend the course; it was fascinating material.",
    "Yes, it's a a great way to talk about texts and writing in a low-risk atmosphere, but I don't particularly enjoy writing that often, and thus I would not take the course again.",
    "The course really makes you mature as a writer and get a very good introduction to academic writing at Yale. A must take.",
    "I would recommend taking Currell's War, Terror, Text English 114 class if you are really interested in the philosophy and politics behind warfare. I myself was not, and as a result did not get a lot out of the class. Shop this class if you need a WR, but if you don't love the material and the feel of the class from the first day, beware. Those who are looking to do some serious writing should definitely check out English 120.",
    "I can't say anything about the other 114 sections, but this one was great. If a follow-up class in the same topic were offered next semester, I would take it. As far as summaries go, it's an overview of war theory from Hobbes to Petraeus, encompassing quite a bit of political theory as well. I took the class thinking I would just be writing and critiquing analytical essays, but the material itself was also important and enlightening.I rated the workload as \"less\" than other classes, but that's just because two of my other classes happen to have massive workloads. The workload will vary depending on how much you want to put into your essays and how acquainted you are with the ideas. Overall I'd say that the workload is average.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class with David. I count myself fortunate to have taken it with a batch of exceptionally intelligent students--from whose insights I greatly benefitted--but it was also David who made the experience worthwhile. He was gracious, witty, smart, and articulate: it was always a pleasure listening to him speak in class discussions. The readings were definitely manageable and very interesting as well: they shed light on various aspects of war, from its philosophical dimension to its cultural resonances. David's essay prompts were stimulating in that they were often open-ended, allowing the students to freely pursue their topics of interest; however, such liberty could also be a challenge to those who find researching difficult. I'd suggest going to David's office hours in that case; you will be amazed at how helpful it is.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Not only was it thoroughly enjoyable, but I learned a fair amount and improved my writing."
