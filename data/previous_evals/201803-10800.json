    "Pretty well taught in my opinion. I previously learnt Japanese at a different place and the syllabus is more well structured here in my opinion. Nishimura Sensei is also a very dedicated teacher who gives a lot of thorough feedback. The only 'weakness' is that it is quite a lot of daily work, which can be quite the time-crunch when it coincides with other activities that you may have during certain weeks, but I guess that's true for any language.",
    "Nishimura Sensei's teaching methods are very effective. The breadth of tools she uses keeps students constantly engaged. The homework assigned, though there is a lot, is useful for thoroughly learning the material.",
    "pro: very rigorous, good class dynamic, good teacher con: assignments a bit disorganized, often have to be done on various books\/packages which is very inconvenient",
    "Small class size. Engaging material."
