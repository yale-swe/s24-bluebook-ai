    "Among Yale's faculty, there are good seminar leaders. There are great seminar leaders. There are sensational seminar leaders. And then there is Bev Gage.This was without a doubt one of the most skillfully put-together and led courses I have taken. I felt like I genuinely learned a lot from my classmates, the readings, and from Professor Gage. Gage is just so incredibly knowledgeable and helpful -- it's quite hard to describe.In any case, if you're at all interested in this period of US history -- and it is a US history class with a political lens, NOT NOT NOT an intellectual history class -- you should take this course without a doubt.",
    "Yes, definitely. The workload is very manageable. The political autobiography assignment is quite fun. Professor Gage does a great job leading this engaging seminar.",
    "Liberalism&Conservatism goes through American federal political history from 1932 to 1988 by analyzing the political history and public policy debates through the lens of the ideologies of liberalism and conservatism. We chart both the significance of specific historical moments and broad ideological and historical trends. The class reads a combination of primary sources of intellectual and political thought and secondary sources for historical background. Professor Gage is a fantastic teacher - she leads amazing seminar discussions and she also structured the research paper assignment in a very helpful way, including having us write drafts. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The course traces the American political terrain (generally from liberal to conservative consensus) throughout the 20th century. The readings are seminal works in U.S. political thought, and really give the student a clear sense of the fault lines that have existed in American politics throughout the last several decades.",
    "Fantastic history seminar. I had never taken a history class before (polisci major) and I loved this. The readings are great - you do a sampling of primary source materials with some (optional) supplemental secondary sources. The political autobiography is great fun to write. Be prepared for an INTENSE experience writing the final paper, but Prof. Gage gives you tons of guidance, including a mandatory drafting session (not enough guidance picking a good topic, which is crucial though).",
    "So far this is the best course I've taken at Yale. The readings are all interesting, discussions were great, and the research paper at the end was completely manageable. The weekly reading responses will help keep you on top of the reading. Professor Gage gives great feedback on assignments, and she can be really funny in class.",
    "Definitely. A great way to survey American history. But know that the focus is on how political ideologies change over time rather than on the history of events themselves.",
    "This has been perhaps my favorite class so far at all. Definitely overlooked. The material was very interesting and the discussions were great. I would definitely recommend this to another student, especially one who is interested in the history of politics and not so much theory. You come out with a better understanding of today's political rhetoric.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who want to get a better understanding of the nature of liberalism and conservatism--however, having a background in us politics would be useful.",
    "Definitely take the class if you're at all interested in the material. It's worth it. The reading is not too heavy, but you have to be prepared each time to really discuss the readings in a meaningful way.",
    "A great, in-depth look at the development of 20th century politics from FDR to Reagan."
