    "Yes absolutely. Best seminar I've taken thus far at Yale. Fascinating readings.",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in American politics. The reading is manageable and provides viewpoints from activists, intellectuals, and presidents. You learn a lot about the importance of political movements and grassroots activism, so the course does not just focus on \"high politics.\" The class is surprisingly relevant to today's political debates, and many of the individuals you read about are still discussed by politicians and commentators today. Professor Gage is engaging as she leads each seminar and is helpful with her comments on the papers. The course also does a good job of looking at broad themes of the \"liberal story\" and the \"conservative story\" and examining how each side tries to spin its own narrative of history.",
    "YES. Prof. Gage is awesome, the readings are incredible, and while there's a lot of work, it's definitely manageable. Take it!!",
    "I would recommend the class to everyone, because the issues we cover on 20th century politics and ideology are still so relevant to modern politics.",
    "I definitely recommend this - both the professor and material are fantastic.",
    "TAKE IT. It's that simple. Kind of hard to get into if you're not a history major, but it usually settles out alright. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale; I cannot recommend it any higher.",
    "This was a great class. Very challenging but you'll learn a lot and it will be super interesting as long as you like politics. Prof. Gage is a good discussion leader and very knowledgeable about the subject. Don't be intimidated by the big research paper if you haven't written one before, since she gives you very good guidance in the whole process.",
    "Great class, great assignments. You will learn so much about the formation of our current political parties. Take it in a heartbeat.",
    "If you like history, or just good classes in general, take it."
