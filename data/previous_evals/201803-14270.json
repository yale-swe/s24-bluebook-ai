   "comments": [
    "Definitely refined a lot of my before nebulous knowledge of the region. I feel I have a robust understanding of Middle Eastern dynamics from during the Ottoman Empire and up to present day. Moreover, I feel I have learned both in highly geopolitical, diplomatic terms of these histories, as well as qualitative, nationalistic ones. Together, I have developed a nuanced and I believe quite comprehensive of how these states operate in the modern nation-state paradigm.",
    "In the first part of the course we gained a general understanding of the literature on nationalist theory which was very interesting and then throughout the rest of the course, we talked about how these were applied in specific case studies across the MENA region.",
    "This class is structured as a series of case studies each week, focused on some twentieth\/twenty-first century period. It covers a lot of ground and thus doesn't enter into any one subject or history in depth. I didn't have much of a background in sociology and this class, especially in the first half of the semester, introduced a lot of the basic strategies and texts on the sociology of nationalism. I enjoyed this aspect for the most part, but for people thinking of the class as a history course, it's something to keep in mind.",
    "Seeing the MENA region through a much more theoretical lens than usual at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot of theory about what nationalism is, and then delved into case studies in the MENA region that were very fascinating. The papers we wrote pushed my research skills and my ability to compile many ideas into one claim.",
    "This course did an excellent job developing my ability to synthesize information and theories in order to apply them to global problems. I learned an incredible amount about the Middle East, and this class improved my writing.",
    "This course gave me a great foundation in nationalism theory and then helped me apply it to various examples. I learned how to evaluate various nationalist movements and important questions about identity formation.",
    "First third of the course covers theories on nationalism.Next two thirds cover nationalism in various countries in the Middle-East (as well as regional movements like pan-Arabism).",
    "Professor Wyrtzen's class is great in that he looks at nationalism in almost all of the Middle East and North African countries. I can confidently say he does a great job at giving us an overview not only on the lines of thought on nationalism by different theorists but also how nationalism plays out in different countries. He assigns enough reading that it actually taught me a lot about not spending hours poring over the details when preparing for class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Wyrtzen is brilliant and very knowledgeable. However, he was not great in the seminar setting and I found the discussions we were having to be very dry, abstractly theoretical and lacking continuity.",
    "Strengths would certainly be the nature of the material itself. I would self-select as a theorist, and enjoyed how the course first took root in purely theoretical terms of how the nation-state produces and reproduces itself, and then overlaid a series of empirical case studies to deepen our understanding of these complex histories. At times, I do believe the reading bordered on slightly ambitious levels, but I do think skimming all of them never felt out of reach and I came to classes well-equipped to discuss.",
    "The content was very interesting but also very dense at times. While the format of a seminar and having people explain the readings in a group setting was helpful to keep us accountable to reading, I wish there was more of a teaching aspect to the class, rather than just having the students regurgitate the theses of the readings.",
    "At the beginning of the course I had wished that we could dive right into the case studies, but I now see how important the theory we read was. Professor Wyrtzen organized the class very well to help our learning. I also liked having discussions in pairs, but I wish that we sometimes started the class with the floor open to a big discussion before the pairs, to see where other people's ideas took the conversation.",
    "Strengths -- excellent teaching. Discussions were well-facilitated, in-depth, and engaging. The weighting and timing of course assignments was perfect for developing knowledge and for learning. Weaknesses -- some of the readings are duplicative, and it may be better to have fewer readings so students can concentrate on getting both big ideas and details from the most thorough readings",
    "The course readings were very intentional and reasonable which was a great strength. I have no complaints.",
    "Strengths: Gives you a snapshot of nationalism in most countries and some non-state groups (Amazigh, Kurds) in the MENA region. Also builds a very strong theoretical background which is definitely useful if you're planning on taking other classes on nationalism. Wyrtzen is a very knowledgeable lecturer. Weaknesses: The syllabus does seem a little survey-ish in its attempt to cover a lot of geographical area, so it sacrifices depth in any particular case study. I personally found the theoretical foray a little too long, so spending less time on that could make the course more interesting.",
    "I don't think there are any weaknesses to the course. Professor Wyrtzen is very organized-- you're expected to do the reading, he makes sure that every student participates-- which I really like because no stone is left unturned. Also bonus points that laptops aren't allowed in class because there's nothing worse than a seminar with everyone typing on their computers and not being fully focused on sharing their thoughts."

   "comments": [
    "In its current form, I would not recommend this class. However, I think it has a lot of potential because the material is very engaging and Professor Wyrtzen is very knowledgeable and kind.",
    "Certainly. If you are remotely interested in the MENA region, Professor Wyrzten is incredibly knowledgable in this vein. Despite some of his longer-than-expected tirades about its history (something I find truly indicative of his love for his work), he is so well and critically informed, it is impossible not to learn even simply by osmosis.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Wyrtzen is brilliant and such an understanding professor. While I thought the theory part of the course was going to be dreadful, it was actually super interesting and I think Professor Wyrtzen does a great job of picking really good readings for the most part. That being said, there often was a lot of reading for each week that was hectic sometimes.",
    "Yes, if you're into identity theory and applying it to the ME.",
    "Yes. I leaned a lot nationalism theory and the various nationalisms in North Africa and the Middle East. As someone with little background in the area, this class was challenging because I felt everyone knew much more than me, but looking back on the semester, I probably learned more in this class than any of my other classes. Professor Wyrtzen is very knowledgeable and the workload is manageable. The class is structured so that the readings are divided up, and then small groups present topics they want to discuss. Oftentimes, we would spend most of the time on the first reading, leaving the others feeling a little rushed, but otherwise it was well organized. The guest speakers were awesome and I really enjoyed this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, or any course taught by Professor Wyrtzen. He is very knowledgeable, and pushes interesting discussions. The subject-matter is also really important.",
    "Yes, this is an incredible class and Professor Wyrtzen is so great",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the Middle East and developing general theoretical knowledge about nationalism. Professor Wyrtzen is amazing, enthusiastic, and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course for the thorough exploration of theory and course studies. It is fundamental to understanding current relations in MENA.",
    "Yes, it was a great introduction to nationalism in MENA and just a great intro to the region's history in general (I definitely did not feel like I needed any background in the Middle East or North Africa). Unclear how the course is finally graded since everyone seems to get extremely good scores, but it does seem pretty lax in that department. In any case, Wyrtzen is a fantastic (and flexible) seminar leader and lecturer, so if you have any interest in the area definitely take his course.",
    "I would definetely encourage another student to take this class. Professor Wyrtzen is dynamic and engaging. The material is interesting and is a very good survey on nationalism in these regions. There's no reason NOT TO, and he's very chilled."
