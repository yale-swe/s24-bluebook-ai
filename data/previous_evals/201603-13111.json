    "Strengths: while the presentations weren't always relevant to me, I appreciated the exposure to topics I might not have thought about otherwise. Weaknesses: I usually did not find the readings for the small group meetings particularly helpful, and definitely enjoyed the more open-ended meetings better. I think the course could very likely be improved by using the just-us sessions to talk about students' own experiences as WGSS scholars rather than to try to use such a small amount of time to try to learn about the field as a whole, which would likely work much better in a theory or WGSS-inflected history sort of class."
