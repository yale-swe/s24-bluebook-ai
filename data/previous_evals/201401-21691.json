   "comments": [
    "The course is scattered and doesn't really follow a linear chronological progression. Instead, we cover discrete topics in the history of the early modern period (and the middle ages\/antiquity to a much lesser extent) that have to do with art, technology, or culture. This means we look at a lot of books about botany, anatomy, machines, etc. This can be fun, but it is hard to know where you are going from week to week and that gets very boring very quickly. If you are interested in improving your historical writing skills, this might be a good course for you: Bertucci does a good job of making sure your writing improves and says she will base your grades on improvement. If you can put up with material that is not always the most exciting and you need to improve your history skills, this might be the class to do it in. The readings are long, but doable (skimmable) so this class is maybe ~5 hrs of work\/week? More on the weeks that you have reading responses due. There is a midterm paper (5 pages) and a final paper (12? pages)",
    "HSHM 460 01 is an investigation of texts and ideas relating to the intersections of Art, Science and Technology in the Renaissance period in Europe. This investigation is done through the close analysis of rare texts from libraries on campus. I would recommend this class because it is a great introduction to thinking critically like a historian of science and questioning and performing the practice of history. Overall, a great and fascinating class.",
    "This is a fabulous class! I don't think that this exact course will be offered next year, but regardless, you should try to take any class with Professor Bertucci if you can. She is kind, an excellent teacher, and incredibly knowledgeable. She challenges her students without being overly harsh. This seminar was amazing because we went to one of the libraries or galleries almost every week (Beinecke, Cushing, YUAG, etc) to view original objects and books from early modern Europe. Our midterm and final papers were based on primary sources of our choice, which was awesome. Overall, this is an opportunity not to be missed!",
    "This is not your standard seminar, because it moves from library to museum to library, where you get to look at amazing books and discuss them. It is this kind of course that makes me want to be a historian. You are really engaging with objects from the past and trying to figure out what they are telling us."
