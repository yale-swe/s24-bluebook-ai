   "comments": [
    "This course was great, but mostly because of the instructor. Dagan Karp is a visiting professor this fall. He is an amazing teacher, but he was here for this semester only. The course itself is good, though. Algebraic Geometry is pretty advanced stuff, and you get the sense that you're seeing only the tip of the iceberg in this class, but it's still some cool stuff: using abstract algebra to look at the zero sets of polynomials.",
    "As with any math course at Yale, it really depends who is teaching it in the future. Dagan Karp was great, but he was only visiting for a semester. The material itself was interesting but quite challenging conceptually, so without an instructor who is willing to answer a lot of questions it would probably not be worthwhile to take this course.",
    "Dagan made a great effort to get to know everyone in the class and make instruction very personal. Overall the class was extremely fun and a good math elective.",
    "Take it. It's a very cool subject and provides nice motivation for the things you study in 350.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn the classical approach to algebraic geometry. There is also an emphasis on good mathematical writing, which is refreshing.",
    "Algebraic geometry is a very cool, very popular subject right now in mathematics. Lots of pretty perspectives and results. Unless you despise commutative algebra, you should probably take it...and even in the exceptional case, I would still try it out. If nothing else, you get to talk about projective space, which is pretty sweet."
