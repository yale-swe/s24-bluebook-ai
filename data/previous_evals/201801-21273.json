    "Gained a much deeper historic and philosophic understanding of the region, and how the regional ideas impacted the wider European and international structures. Seminars were very engaging, discussions with Professor Snyder are amazing and an absolute privilege. Don't be scared off by the on-the-spot presentations - it is scary at first, but an amazing experience and you learn a lot. Coursework in the form of NYRB Style was of great help in deeper understanding of books and were a great writing exercise. Take this course - you will love it!",
    "History of Eastern Europe: conflicts and relationship among the nations The most important thing I learned is about how to learn history, how to think like a historian"
