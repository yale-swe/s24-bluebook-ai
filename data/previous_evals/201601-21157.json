    "Great course, so glad I took it this year! Well organized, though reading heavy.",
    "I am so, SO sorry that you will never be able to take this class because Professor Thachil is leaving. It would have made your life so much better. To get a better sense of what this class is like, imagine you're at his last office hours before the final. Half the class is there. They normally go until 4:30, but everyone is begging Thachil to stay, not even to go over more class material but because we are dying to hear more of his perspective on present day Indian politics and things that have gone down since the class left off. Oh yeah and throw in the fact that he has to pause the discussion for a second to answer his phone with \"Hey dude.\" I mean seriously. We're talking about an exemplary human being here. Since he won't be around to teach next year, the only recommendation that I can make is that your transfer to Vanderbilt to take one of his classes if you haven't taken one already.",
    "I would absolutely recommend! But be warned that our primary focus is the analysis of research papers.",
    "This is an incredible course that I highly recommend! Besides the readings, the workload is not too great, and Professor Thachil is fantastic. The material is fascinating, especially if you're interested in development and post-colonial countries.",
    "PLSC 384 studies democracy in India, democratic politics in India, and compares these to different governments. I'd highly recommend the class because of Professor Thachil and the interesting course material.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course!"
