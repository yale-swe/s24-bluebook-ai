   "comments": [
    "I enjoy reading the cases for each class, and all these cases are very typical and valuable. I learned one legal topic for each week, and this is a good pace for me.",
    "Just about right! The exams take a lot of time to study for but they were definitely among the more fun exams (well as fun as exams can be) I have taken at Yale. I enjoyed writing the paper as well. I'm glad I talked about the topic with Joan beforehand and appreciate the freedom in choosing the topic.",
    "The workload was a great amount - I didn't think there was too much work. We had cases that we needed to read, and maybe 10 documents to read and prepare for every single class, but they were interesting enough that you could get through them and enjoy them and not feel like you had too much work. The open-note exams also decreased the workload, but Joan rationalized it in a very smart way - if judges can use notes to look at precedent you can too - and it was very helpful to have the notes with you as you were taking the exam.",
    "I have never quite had so much super dense reading at YSD. It was mostly worthwhile, but I ended up either abandoning certain documents or skimming unabashedly.",
    "The workload for this class is, for the most part, very manageable. There are a few weeks in the syllabus where the reading is prohibitive, but a student can be informed by choosing a smart portion of what's assigned to read. Generally, it's possible to read conscientiously, and if you do so along the way, prep for the exams is reasonable.",
    "You have to read a lot of pre-edited cases that do not fully display the subject matter at hand. It is not until class meeting that you will discover the nuances of each judgement. The midterm is out of left field, as in Joan asks you to complete an exercise that you have never done for class before: give a judgement to a case she presents on one double sided print out. Be prepared for her to give her favorites the better grade, but even when you are her favorite you are graded harshly.",
    "I appreciated that the beginning of the semester had a heavy reading component but then it eased off. I feel like it was well matched to the amount of momentum I had in me.",
    "I found the number of cases and articles we had to read in preparation for each class to be manageable."

    "This class is well organized. I get the clear instruction from syllabus and download all materials form website easily. Each topic we learned is step by step, so its easy for us to understand each legal issue.",
    "I thought the course was very neatly structured. It is probably not the easiest thing to put the topics and readings in sequence (because many cases touch on multiple legal areas) but I found the class very logically coherent.",
    "The class was organized very well - each week we did a different aspect of Copyright law. One week we'd do copyrights and another week we'd do contracts and another week we'd do personality rights or moral rights or trademark. Everything was well organized - all the lecture notes and documents were up on class from Day 1 and the discussions in class proceeded very well.",
    "The course is well organized and easy to follow throughout the semester.",
    "I thought the course was logically organized. I felt like everything built on important details from the previous class.",
    "Regarding the mix of lectures\/projects\/discussion, I found that the more variety the more engaging the subject. It was fun to have the visiting lecturer. I also found the midterm and final to be extremely fun and challenging, and the discussion of the midterm during class after we had all taken it was a good one."

   "comments": [
    "Joan is a professional and experienced instructor. Shes class is rigorous and interesting. She was always patient to answer all kinds of questions, and led us to go through each legal issue. She provided a clear way for us to study and understand law, which I believe it will greatly benefit for our career.",
    "Joan is great. She is clear when she lectures and fields questions well. The slides were helpful. I loved the personal anecdotes and stories from her own work experience. Definitely helped me remember and make sense of some of the more dense materials.",
    "Joan is one of the kindest, most caring professors I've ever had. She takes time out of her schedule to help you even if you think you have the most insignificant question. She really cares about her students and is extremely flexible with them - her priority is her students and their wellbeing, and it really shows in her interactions with them. She'll even come in early every class and make sure there are enough chairs for all the students, because we had a large class and were provided a smaller room. I was pretty worried about my grade towards the end of the semester and Joan went the extra mile (many more miles than just 1) to assure me that it would be okay. She calculated all the possible grades I could get depending on how I did on the final exam and final paper and gave me many options to work with, one of which was writing a longer paper that would be worth more. You come across a lot of professors that have stringent rules and policies when it comes to their grading system, but Joan's priority is the student and what that student gets out of the class. That's the difference between this instructor and so many others.",
    "Sometimes I felt as though we were beating certain points to death, and sometimes glossing over key details. I suppose this depends on which questions the class was interested in?",
    "The course is well-tailored to its audience, and the instructor is very good at balancing depth and specificity with the (lack of) background knowledge of the class.",
    "I would have liked to go more in depth on these issues. I would even like to have the rigor of a real law school class with respect to dealing with contract law and intellectual property law. Though I do feel I have an introductory basis for understanding these issues, and a basic literacy in the law, which I value greatly, I would like to be on the level of law students."

   "comments": [
    "The visitors were very insightful and most definitely added to the class.",
    "I like Carol's lecture, and I hope she can come back again.",
    "Carol is very personable. Her class was engaging but it felt quite rushed at the end which was a shame because she (and Joan) probably had more interesting things to say about the Yale contract than we had time for.",
    "James Bundy, Dean of the School of Drama, came by to sit it on the class once. He didn't participate in discussion and was only there to observe. Our notable visitor was entertainment lawyer Carol Kaplan, who was extremely engaging, bringing candy to pass out to students, breaking us into small groups to tackle projects, and throwing hypothetical scenarios at us to test our knowledge of copyright law.",
    "I forget her name, but she was awesome.",
    "Carol Kaplan - As a first time visitor, Ms. Kaplan was interesting and engaging but could have been better organized. Her knowledge and perspective was definitely useful, but the class spent a great deal of time on topics already covered, and was left without time to adequately address the topic of the day. I was left wishing I could have taken the day's class as taught in the past by Joan Channick. The contract analysis portion of the class could have been really great had we had time to step back and think about the document as a whole. Perhaps in the future, Kaplan's visit can be almost entirely devoted to this project.",
    "The visiting lecturer was fun."

    "This class gave me a sketch of American Law. All the knowledge that I learned from this class is very useful and valuable. I will continue to study it.",
    "Awesome Class. It would be a more effective class all around, if it was smaller. It might be worth making it a YSD only class. The undergraduates I know get a lot out of the class, but they do make it larger, and slower.",
    "This class was a really good introduction to copyright law. Subject material was interesting enough to make the technical stuff digestible. It's less discussion than the average undergrad seminar but I actually liked it that way. I feel listening to Joan talk is definitely a more productive use of my time because she has lots of interesting things to say. It was really cool taking a class with the Drama School students too (and listening to the questions they ask) because the material is much more relevant to their careers. Thank you for letting undergrads take it.",
    "I had a really good learning experience in this class - the manner in which we discussed the cases was so helpful to learning about the intricate details of the case. Having open-note exams also made it more conducive to learning because otherwise students would be so focused on memorizing which case name corresponded to which facts that they wouldn't be focusing on analyzing the facts of the cases themselves.",
    "I had very little knowledge of these topics before, and now I think I understand them with some sophistication. This is a great class - foundational and very useful.",
    "I learned more in this class in a short amount of time than I think was possible. The experience of reading court rulings and learning to understand and interpret the law was really valuable. I would not have traded this class for any other law course."

    "The class was great overall. Invite Carol back! Since some cases were discussed more in depth than others, it might be helpful to flag which ones we will talk more about (or the ones that are harder to understand) before we do the readings so we can spend more time on them.",
    "I really don't have any suggestions for improvement - the course is great exactly the way it is run.",
    "Some of the undergrad folks had NO IDEA what we were talking about. Like, what is a director? What's commissioning a play? I'm not sure what the conversation with those folks is like, but maybe a 101 of theater the same way we get a 101 with law would be helpful?",
    "I think more variety in how we interacted would have helped. It would have been really fun and engaging to have us debate an argument in a group or before we had read something. In fact, it may have been cool to give us a challenge like we had in the midterm but let us get in groups to discuss then present our stance in opposition to another gorup, then to have the next week's reading be to see how it was really handled. This might have made the nuance to each case more memorable since we would have to really try to come with a stance first. I will never forget the results of the midterm because I had to try to make up my own argument first.",
    "More variety in lecture style would be welcome."
