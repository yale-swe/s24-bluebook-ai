    "A great senior seminar for art history students, and a great topic for students interested in any aspect of historical preservation-art history, history, architecture, art etc.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in HOW THINGS ARE MADE. This class is very different than most other art history classes at Yale because it has an emphasis on the technical properties of art objects; basically, if you hatescience, you might want to reconsider taking this class. However, at the same time, this class is manageable if not pretty straight-forward even for those, like myself, who haven't taken science classes since high school.",
    "This is a fabulous class that introduces you to many aspects of conservation. It can feel a bit science heavy in the beginning but it's really interesting and then you get to apply what you learned to the final paper. When I took this class it was a very small group which was a big luxury since you get access to actual museum objects and conservation labs. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in art and definitely for all history of art majors!",
    "Take the class if you're into art. I have no interest in becoming a curator, but it gave me a new angle from which to appreciate all art."
