   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take Apoorva's linear Algebra!",
    "I would recommend this class only to someone who is very serious about studying theoretical mathematics. This coursework is extremely difficult, and even if you've done well in your previous math classes, you may find this class to be very challenging.",
    "Definitely, it was a great course to develop my proof-writing skills and in comparison to my previous Linear Algebra course it covered the material in much more detail and I feel like I have a much stronger grounding in the subject.Did a good job of answering my constant \"why\" questions.",
    "If you like math, take this class.",
    "Math 225 is a theoretical math course. Prof Khare was a good teacher; he explained things well. We had weekly homework but the load was alright and the tests were reasonable.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend the class if you are interested in Economics or just like Math. There were also several physics majors in the class.",
    "If you're willing to be committed to the math, and seeing real proofs of the math that you do from fairly early foundations, you'll like this version of Linear Algebra over the \"let's draw an even LARGER matrix and calc out the numbers\" version that is MATH 222.A LOT of homework, but it's necessary to understand - trying to do the class without, or with only part of, the homework is questionable business. If you have the time to give it, it's a rewarding class."
