    "Very frustrating class. The class is unrealistic in its scope. The reading load is way too much, to the point that nobody is bothered to do the reading. On top of that, the readings are way too dense and difficult. The professor does not do a good job of breaking the material down in a clear manner. The student presentations on each reading, however, are more helpful. The examples given by the professor to try to explain the readings and concepts are highly convoluted and difficult to interpret. The class is simply disorganized. It could be improved by more systematic discussion and explanation of the concepts, to ensure that students are all on the same page, or at least have a baseline understanding, before jumping into deeper discussion. The course should not try to be as ambitious in its scope and level if it is to achieve even part of its aim.",
    "Excellent course - Prof. Fradinger is an awesome professor, and incredibly dedicated to the subject matter. This course is very much what I wanted to take when I came to Yale - a group of students learning together because they are interested in the material, guided by a professor who is knowledgeable but also willing to take the class in odd directions. The readings for this class are very difficult, and the section can be quite large. Allocate a good deal of time per week for the readings if you choose to take this course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. This course will give you the best understanding of Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalysis that you can possible get in one semester. It will also make you feel like your brain has been taken apart and put back together. There might be some extra screws inexplicably left over, but I promise it's worth it. It doesn't matter if you're a science person. It doesn't matter if you've never taken a philosophy course. It doesn't matter if you think that Freud\/psychoanalysis has been \"debunked.\" Take this class and you will learn. Period. Also, you'd be surprised how many authors across fields use psychoanalysis in their writing. Honestly, I'd take this class for Moira alone.",
    "I would recommend, but tentatively. The readings are fascinating mostly -- some are REALLY difficult. Like unbelievably difficult. Discussion ranged around a lot. This course is really about life, relationships, society. Idk. I would take it again, knowing what I know now. But it was a really particular experience. Also, moira is a trip. Shop it and you'll see if you like it or not. She's incredibly nice, but a big ego, so if that makes you upset, maybe don't take it. Really good course overall though.",
    "It's useful to learn about Lacan and Freud, since it'll factor into your reading of texts\/ films\/ ideologies in the future. Moira definitely knows the subject and explicates the concepts in detail every class. I would have wished for more application of Freudian\/ Lacanian concepts to various works of literature or film, but that's perhaps impossible due to time constraints. Your seminar experience is likely to be highly dependent on the other participants though - sometimes discussions get bogged down over trivial details just because of a couple of very vocal people, while the rest of the class stares on in despair.",
    "LIT 480 was the most challenging, intellectually rewarding and personally fulfilling experience I have ever had at Yale; a community of scholars getting together to discuss high-end concepts in a true seminar fashion. Whatever one may think of Psychoanalysis, this class is worth taking just for the depth of thought and Moira's ability to create a group dynamic while making it very clear that she cares deeply for each member's intellectual preoccupations and own strands of thought. Take this course!!!",
    "A wonderful course! You will read a ton of Freud, with the guidance of a wonderful and enthusiastic teacher.",
    "LITR480 is intense, but not in the way most seminars are. Moira was great, and alone makes the seminar worth taking. The people who take it are all interesting characters who are very into the topic at hand. Great introduction to psychoanalysis.",
    "This is an amazing class, definitely worth it. Prepare to read theory like crazy, but it's all worth it. The sessions are dynamic and interesting. Moira is incredible, she will make you understand the texts and more as you progress. Definitely a must if you're interested in psychoanalysiseven as literary theory.",
    "Incredible course. Moira is a god. Take it.",
    "This class was my favorite at Yale so far. Moira is an absolute delight as a professor who has developed a very unique seminar environment that encourages true curiosity in her students. The quantity of readings and paper assignments were always reasonable and flexible. Class discussions often went 2-3 hours past the stated time due to student interest; Moira was always kind enough to stay and answer all questions with her wealth of knowledge. I finished the class with a strong baseline understanding of Freud and Lacan and a new community of my seminar peers. I highly recommend this course to any interested.",
    "\"Psychoanalysis\" doesn't know what it wants from you, what it wants to be, et cetera. It might want to be a lecture? But it also wants to be a seminar! It might want you to engage with the texts in the style of a \"humanities person\"? But it also wants you to engage with Freud's pseudoscientific ideas! I do (!) believe that a course can be interdisciplinary, but I found that the STEM people and the humanities people took approaches to the texts that were simply incompatible. (Not contradictory! But the expression \"apples and oranges\" comes to mind.) Moira is a great professor smart, funny, caring and the reading is certainly fascinating, canonical, etc, but I don't think \"Psychoanalysis\" is a literature seminar. Maybe I just mean: one or two STEM section assholes almost ruined the class?",
    "If you care about Freud, psychoanalysis, dreams, or simply a previously unknown way to read the world, this class will give you exactly what you want. You will quickly see that all the inane armchair comments made on the subject of Freud are airy and worthless if not simply wrong, and you will, if you do the reading, be rewarded with a profound depth of knowledge. Civilisation and its Discontents, having been read after a foundation in the Freudian opus, is perhaps the best book I have ever had the privilege of reading, or of being taught as it were. The final paper choice is incredibly flexible and rewards courageous choice. Moira has indicated that she can only teach this course so many more times, for numerous reasons, but I hope students have the good fortune to find themselves in this class for a few more years.",
    "I WOULD *HIGHLY* RECOMMEND THIS COURSE TO ANY STUDENT INTERESTED IN IDEOLOGY, 20TH CENTURY HUMANISM, SUBJECTIVITY FORMATION, BIG BAD NEBULOUS 'THEORY', AND TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT IF TAKEN TO HEART CAN HELP IN CREATING A NEW FORM OF HUMAN - A MORE RESPONSIBLE AND SELF AWARE HUMAN; ONE THAT DOES NOT CONFUSE IDENTIFICATION WITH EMPATHY OR LOVE. Take this class for Moira, take this class for humanity, take this class for yourself. These are the very courses you come to college for (or at least what I came to college for).",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested.",
    "I have already recommended this course to many people."
