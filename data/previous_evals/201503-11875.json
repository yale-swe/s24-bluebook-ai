    "If you want to take an accessible, college level English course in which you can work on many aspects of writing about the self and experiences, this is a fantastic course to take. My instructor was wonderful and I would highly suggest this section.",
    "A survey course on the modern essay in which you read a certain style and then try to imitate it. It's relatively demanding if you want to produce good essays, but also worth the work. I would recommend it because the readings are good for general knowledge and good writing is important for everybody.",
    "A helpful class for people who want an into english class. I took it because I wanted to make my writing better and this section didn't do that but I have heard various accounts from people taking other sections. My suggestion; shop the professors and ensure that you can pick the right one.",
    "Definitely take this. Each professor has her or his own spin on the class, so shop around and find the person who's class you most enjoy.",
    "10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend. This is a great class to take if maybe writing isn't your major, but you are sick of writing research paper after research paper. I had never even heard of creative nonfiction before, and now I really enjoy it!",
    "Course to learn to write better. The specific focus is non-fiction, but the use is for all type of writing.",
    "In ENGL 120, students learn how to write modern nonfiction essays by analyzing the works of professionals writers.",
    "The writing is fun, and if you wish you can produce some really creative pieces. It would be a nice break for anyone who has only been writing academic essays in their time at Yale."
