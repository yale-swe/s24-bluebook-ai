    "I liked that we were exposed to all kinds of different documents through people bringing in their own texts to read. On the other hand, I felt the course was quite disorganized and it was not clear what we were meant to get out of it - vocabulary? practice at deciphering certain kinds of scripts? Obviously this was difficult partly because of the different levels of the students in the class but I felt it could have been set out better. Also, I did not find the quizzes particularly useful - as I don't actually think that vocabulary is a particularly good use of Ottoman class time as it is so specific to genre and time period.",
    "It is a challenge to teach students at such different levels, but I think considering that, the course was organized in a sensible way that allowed all students to benefit."
