    "Yes for Econ maths majors",
    "NO DROP ECON\/MATH MAJOR THIS CLASS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. unless you love math and econ theory, just find another major. this major is taught by yale's worst professors and filled with some of the most difficult courses. enjoy.",
    "I really liked the content of this course, being more of the quantitative type. The exams were also not difficult to study for, since the topics to be covered were rigidly defined. Also, some of the test questions were drawn from the homework and textbook, so there was incentive to really work through the course materials. If your previous exposure to probability is 0, however, you may find the learning curve to be steep. Lectures did not help at all, since all the material is straight from the textbook and the professor was usually less clear than the text. I never went to the sections, but they didn't seem to do any good either. Our TA was also horrible, and homework grading looked like it took 20 seconds per paper. Overall, this course is perfect for those who like to learn from the book and hate going to class.",
    "To be honest, the more talented Econ students probably gravitate towards taking this class, even if they don't have to, because they want to challenge themselves. Most people would be fine taking Econ 131. You should take econ 135 if: 1) you're an Econ\/Math major; econ 135 is required 2) you're going to do graduate economics 3) you're hardcore and want to challenge yourself. Econ 131 is the easier class; this one goes more deeply into theory. To be clear, this class (probability and statistics) makes no connection or application to economics, but neither does econ 131.",
    "Depends. If you don't need it--no, I think the 131, 132 track is a LOT more comprehensive, teachable and you will learn more. If you need it for econ and math, well that sucks but you'll come out of it alive.",
    "if you want that extra math next to that 'econ' in your degree, by all means.",
    "only take it if you have to, i.e. econ and math major. 9am lectures and incredibly boring material are a recipe for missing class just about every time.",
    "Don't take unless you need it for your major.",
    "You would have to take it to major in economics and mathematics. If you are purely interested in the subject, I suggest you take another course.",
    "Take this class. It gives you a nice foundational knowledge about how probability and statistics works. If you've taken AP Stats in high school, this course will provide you the \"why\"'s behind all the formulas that we've taken for granted in high school. If you have not taken AP stats, no big deal, Professor Otsu went over from the basics.The structure of the course is very nice, and especially this year Professor Otsu decided to focus on certain key aspects of the course as opposed to covering everything (often grad level) as in past years. This focus really helped us a lot.The textbook selection is amazing--it is a easily written textbook that is available to any students with any background. Last year they used some grad-level textbook, and I'm really glad that he used this one this year.Downside of the class is not engaging lectures. By the end of the year, I think about only half the students showed up to lecture, realizing that they can learn everything on their own from the textbooks and lectures were not that necessary.Also, take advantage of his office hour. Professor Otsu is amazingly nice and helpful in the office hour.All in all, take it. It really gives you a solid foundation of probability& statistics.",
    "Not unless you have to for the Econ\/Math major.The professor's a very nice guy if you go to his office hours. Sadly, the lectures are useless, he can't get his points through.",
    "I would recommend taking 135 just to take 136 in the future. It is a terrible course by itself, but is very self teachable. Lectures are completely useless, but the material is relevant and interesting which means one should take this curve.",
    "Good class. Pretty easy if you have an extensive math background, but it can get pretty difficult if you don't since it gets pretty theoretical.",
    "Decent class if you're a meth and economics major.",
    "Take it if you need it for econ math, otherwise 131 is much easier",
    "I would recommend this class to students who need to take this class for an econ or econ\/math major, or for learning about statistics.",
    "A good class for learning introductory stats. Covers everything necessary.",
    "This is a very difficult proof-based, intensive introduction to probability. The math involved is often very difficult, and I would not advise you take this class unless you plan on being an economics and mathematics major. I was planning on being one, but this class has shown me that I no longer wish to continue towards this major. Additionally the textbook is very helpful for this course.",
    "The material and subject is manageable, if long. However, be prepared to learn from the textbook and leave the class knowing not much more than when you began.",
    "I think that it is extremely poorly taught and the TA was useless. While the professor is good on a one-on-one setting, his skill does not come through in class. The textbook was good and helpful so be sure to study from that. i also think that while the course is difficult, what makes it harder is the fact that half the class drops the class after the midterm and the teacher may\/ may not consider the people who drop the class at the bottom of the curve which he should do as that is standard econ dept policy!",
    "The class was not impossibly hard; the second half of the course turned out to be mostly plug-and-chug problems. Professor Otsu made an effort to make the course easier for us this time, so I suspect that this semester's Econ 135 was much easier than in previous years. Most people in this class were EconMath majors - take the course (with Otsu) if you are one. Otherwise, consider other stats classes.",
    "I recommend it to a student who wants to major in Econ and Math.",
    "The only reason you would ever take this is if you're an Econ\/Math major. I stopped going to class after the midterm because it just wasn't worth going to anymore (and it was at 9 in the morning). Otsu only regurgitates what's in the textbook so just study the textbook diligently, and you should have no problem doing okay in the class (although I haven't seen my final grade but that's another story). Also the TA was absolutely useless though entertaining at times. So DON'T TAKE unless you are an Econ\/Math major.",
    "Only take this class if you are either deciding whether or not to major in Econ\/Math or are set on that major. It will help you determine whether or not to pursue that major if you are uncertain. It's the stereotypical poorly taught econ\/math class, but with interesting material.",
    "Pay attention to what I am saying: You will learn a lot in this class by your own. Professor Otsu is the greatest guy ever, but he does not lecture very well. He is very helpful during office hours. The TA, Mr. Zhentao Shi, does not speak English very well and is not very helpful. The grader for the class does not speak English whatsoever. But you will learn SO MUCH in this class, that you feel like taking it again. I definitely think that I made the right choice taking this class. Problem sets were fair, exams were fair. The final was not hard. The curve is very generous. But the way the exams were graded... oh my god! That was not real!",
    "It's a class required for econ\/math majors. If you can, take the other econometrics class.",
    "ECON 135 is a rigorous and mathematical introduction to statistics and econometrics, and I would say it is definitely harder than ECON 131. Frankly speaking, there is not much (barely any) economics in this course, but mainly math and statistics, even though it is technically an econ course. Be prepared to face some difficult concepts if you have never learned anything about the materials, but you will be able to master them quickly. The homework and exams are both pretty fair and the workload is generally manageable. Professor Otsu is pretty funny and friendly, but keep in mind that he has a strong accent so it might be hard to understand him at first. Sections are okay but not particularly helpful. Overall, if you love doing math and statistics and don\u0092t mind going through some heavy formulae, I would recommend the class and you will enjoy it."
