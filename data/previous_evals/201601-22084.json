    "If you want to run your own experiments and research, go for it.",
    "These classes should not be Pass\/Fail, they almost screwed me on applying to grad school by my research coming up Pass rather than with a grade. HOW CAN THE ONE THING IMPORTANT FOR MY GRAD SCHOOLS APPS BE THE ONE THING THAT DOESNT HELP MY GPA AND LET ME SHOW I'M GOOD AT IT. ALSO students in the Psych major trying to go to graduate school NEED to be allowed to work on ONE project and still get two credits. PSYC is not a viable major for pre-Phd and this single situation regarding research for credit is why I regret being a Psych major. RESTRUCTURE research for credit so you don't keep screwing over kids trying to go into academia. If the psychology department can't prepare kids for a career in psychology research I have no idea what the point of having this major is at all. The weird policies around research for credit needing to be two separate projects is INSANE and the way you guys actively tried to not let me do double research for credit BLEW MY MIND and almost fucked my career.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I learned so much and it was great to observe and actually see patients and participants with autism!",
    "A chance to do independent research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and research for any psychology student that wants to do research.",
    "Yes! It's been such a great experience to gain real-life skills in a course. I plan to use what I've learned about teacher evaluations in the future (I myself would like to teach).",
    "Make sure you have a responsive professor\/graduate student",
    "I highly recommend signing up for directed research if you already plan to work in a psychology lab during the semester -- it's a great, low-stress way to get an extra credit, and it can be very rewarding as long as you're at least moderately interested by the subject matter. Just do it, if you can!",
    "Must be self motivated and hard working!",
    "Would 100% recommend to any Psychology student!",
    "Getting hands on experience with research is invaluable for anyone considering continuing in the study of psychology. It was a very positive experience."
