    "I guess there's little point in reviewing this course given that Paulo will be leaving Yale after next semester. But for those of you looking to take one of his courses next semester, I can assure you that taking a class with Paulo is a phenomenal experience. He made sure that class discussion was never really awkward or boring, quite a feat for a course conducted in Portuguese. The workload was completely manageable, and the readings were fantastic! Paulo's lecturing style is fun and engaging, and I came away having learned something new from every single class. He has an incredibly enlightening way of making the most complicated historical, philosophical or literary ideas accessible to students from all backgrounds. He is also an eclectic thinker, so be prepared to take a tour through a variety of topics and disciplines. And to top it all of, he was never condescending, which is rare for a professor in literature and upper-division language courses. It's a pity he's leaving--Yale will be missing out on a brilliant, kind scholar.",
    "Great class with interesting authors and texts. Really enjoyed the class"
