    "Yes! If you like math, and critical thinking, you will certainly like this more than intro",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. Period. It sucks. Don't do it. You'll regret it.",
    "An abomination, but required for a large number of students. That is all.",
    "Only take it of you really have to. Waste of time and energy otherwise",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.If you're deciding between fall and spring, I've heard that the fall instructor is better. But I've also heard that the fall course is more difficult because the students are better.If you're EP&E, save your Cr\/D for this class. Don't waste it on Intro Ethics. In my opinion, it takes much more work to get an A in this class than it does to get an A in Intro Ethics.",
    "Most poorly taught class I have taken.",
    "If you have to take it, Econ 121 is a totally fine and at times enjoyable class. If you don't have to take it, it's not worth it unless you'll really try to engage with the material.",
    "Hard, but if you come to all your classes and do all your psets you'll be fine. Just keep swimming",
    "Boring, hard for people who are not math inclined and poorly taught.",
    "Very easy class. If you know basic calculus you really do not need to worry about this class.",
    "Very interesting",
    "Microeconomic theory. It's thorough and hits a lot of topics. If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "not fun at all, but have to take for the econ major",
    "This was a hard course, and also a bad course, and I regret that I had to take it. Though Professor Faingold is smart, precise and pretty organized in lecture, the material is so dry that it barely matters. I remember fearing this course before I took it: those fears were founded. I would not consider myself someone who is good at math, but I made it through Math 115 and 120 much more successfully thanthis course, mostly because of the courses' format. The problem sets in this class were too hard, as they often expected students to find nuanced answers before letting us practice the basics. In preparing for exams, the biggest problem was that answer keys were never provided for the practice exams, which is the way most of us learn how to answer these types of questions. The review sessions before exams were so bad I thought they were scenes from a movie.I want to be clear: this is the first negative review I've ever given a class at Yale, and so far I've taken over twenty classes. I gained little to nothing from the course. When your teachers give up on you, it's quite hard not to give up on them.",
    "Take it if you have to, its hard, but if you put in the hours and work on it all the time, you'll be able to do well",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably not because you want to but rather that you need it for your major.. You just have to bear through it.",
    "If you are not required to take this class for your major, I would recommend against it.This course is not well taught. It is probably the most difficult class in the core of the economics major, but I often felt lost and at a loss for how to catch back up and learn the material well. The lectures were decent, but the lectures, book, problem sets, and exams did not match each other very well. I often found myself relying on the book to learn the material.Prof. Faingold is a great guy, but this class is still not very well taught. It's also just really difficult by nature, especially if you're not very good at calculus.",
    "Look, you have to take it for the econ major, and it's going to suck. Faingold is apparently easier, so take it with him I guess. The problem sets were unnecessarily difficult and unrelated to the midterms, but graded pretty easily. The midterms were both easy and curved really intensely. The final was fair but difficult I honestly felt that I could learn more by not going to lecture and self-teaching with the book. Grab an econ tutor from your college and work through the math with friends, you'll make it through.",
    "Intermediate is not a great class- there are a lot of proofs of concepts that are not really applied in anyway. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but you probably have to take it as some sort of requirement so hunker down with a good study group and just push through. It actually is helpful to go to class so as painful as it is, it's worth showing up for lecture.",
    "It's a pretty easy class. Very little actual math, and the curve is very generous.",
    "only for major",
    "Take it if you have to. If not, stay very far away from Econ 121.",
    "I would recommend intermediate micro if it is a required course. If it is, I would recommend taking it with Faingold over other professors. This is probably the most straightforward version of a very complicated topic.",
    "If you are not an Econ major, you shouldn't take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it allows you to have a foundation for higher level econ classes that you need.",
    "Only take this class if you are an econ major.",
    "It's necessary for Economics majors. It's not the most exciting class in the world, and, at times, you might find it difficult to stay enthused about the class. Overall, however, I feel like it is a solid course.",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless you need it for a major, and if you do need it for a major, taking it with Faingold is a decent option. It's a straightforward, fair class, but you won't gain any new concepts from intro micro, you'll just do a lot more math.",
    "If you've gotta do it, you've gotta do it.",
    "A truly awful course. Poorly taught, poorly supported, poorly contextualized.",
    "Necessary for econ majors and not that bad, don't need to take it otherwise.",
    "Do not take this class unless you are an Economcics major, it's brutal.",
    "Tough",
    "THE WORST. Honestly, if you have any choice in the matter, DO NOT TAKE THIS! It is torture and your mind will explode with misery and anguish. If you are a Global Affairs major, go run and tell Jackson that this class is insane and will not contribute to your GA knowledge or skill set in any way, shape, or form (seriously, IT WON'T). Honestly, i am convinced that the administrators at Jackson who think this is necesssry have never even looked at the syllabus or met the professor, never mind sat in on a class or looked at a problem set. This class is insane. All it will do for you is sink your GPA and destroy your happiness. Run while you still can. If this class is required of you, don't go down without a fight.",
    "-Take it if Econ. is your major. This class has an easier curve but getting an A isn't easy. A- seems doable.",
    "The material is interesting. Faingold is unbearable. Just read the textbook.",
    "Not an excellent class.",
    "Only if you have to for your major. Don't take it for \"fun\"",
    "Are you an Econ major? Then you mustAre you an ep and e major? Then you mustAre you a global major (development track)? Then you mustDon't take this class otherwise.",
    "Only take it if you have to for your major. It is pretty dry and you already know a lot of the concepts from Intro Micro.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to.If you have to, make sure you get a really good TA and know people in the class that you can work on the problem sets with (they take forever). You really have to stay on top of the material in this class and make sure you understand it in order to do well. While that goes for any class, it's especially true for this one because the TAs don't make much of an effort to be accessible, lectures will probably be more confusing than elucidating (this may just be a problem with Faingold) and often the psets are on concepts not covered in class\/barely covered in section. The curve is huge, but for a reason...this class is pretty much designed to weed people out of the econ major.",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "No option, but take it with Professor Faingold! It was a less painful experience.",
    "Only if you like to torture yourself. Then this class is for you.",
    "Wouldn't recommend it, doesn't matter because if you're in it, chances are you have to take it.",
    "Could be one of the worst and terribly taught classes at Yale. I bet you no one learns anything here.",
    "No I definitely would not. I don't think anyone takes this class unless they have to.",
    "No. No. No. Worst class ever. TAs are clueless (nobody knows what they're doing) and the prof goes out of his way to be unhelpful. He posted sample exams, and then nobody posted the answers because, according to the TAs, \"We have better things to do.\" That's the level of don't-care you'll be dealing with.",
    "This class sucks.",
    "Well its required for the econ major, so if you're thinking about taking it, you probably have to take it. The intermediate econ classes are more a right of passage than anything else, so just suck it up and take it. It's really not that bad. As for whether you should take it in the fall or spring, I don't think it matters all the much and the best choice is just to take it when the majority of your friends are taking it so you can work on problem sets together.",
    "A tough Econ class that is made harder by bad teaching.",
    "AAThis is the worst course I have ever taken in my life. I am not writing this because I failed or something like that (I finished with an A-). Professor Faingold is a poor professor and this class if poorly structured. The problem sets are unnecessarily dense and trivial, forcing you to prove really trivial derivations. This class is less about micro economics and more about doing annoying derivations and proofs. The professor will tell you this is an important skill for down the road, but it is taught in such a way. The exams are graded super hard and I did not get anything from coming to lecture. Faingold bumbles and stumbles through the material, his slides aren't great, and he focuses on weird aspects of the material. I recommend just reading the book and slogging through the class as much as possible. ONLY take it if you have to. DON'T take it with Faingold.",
    "Eduardo is really great, he is extremely organized, provides extensive class notes and really cares a lot and invests in the course.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "I would recommend the course to students interested in the mathematical underpinnings of economics.",
    "Take it. You probably have to and it's more palatable than Samuelson, I hear.",
    "Faingold's lectures are very dry and are taken directly from the book. He is not a fantastic professor and doesn't explain things very clearly, but at least he cares about his students. Problem sets were overly mathematical, but exams were fair.",
    "The class was great; it wasn't at all too hard or too much work. The biggest problem with this course are two: 1. The problem sets are too hard and not in line with things covered in either exams or textbooks; 2. The expectations are unclear as to how much math one should master in order to understand the materials well. Professor Faingold is a great professor, very patient. If you go to class and actually try to understand the material instead of just copying problem sets, you should do well.",
    "Yes, ya need it for the Econ major.",
    "ECON 121 is a much more theoretical and mathematical version of Intro Micro. It is a challenging class especially in terms of problem sets, but Professor Faingold is very kind and the TA's are always willing to help.",
    "It was an interesting class to learn a lot of the mathematics behind microeconomic theory. It's a class that one should take if one wants to understand why people or firms do what they do. A strength of this class were the problem sets and also how representative they were of the exams. A weakness was the organization of the class; there weren't very many connections between topics when we switched between them.",
    "Easy class if you do the psets",
    "Its everything you expect a micro econ class to be. Very math oriented and can get boring at times",
    "No one actually wants to take this class. If you're an econ major, have fun.",
    "Not with Faingold",
    "If you like math, it's fun!",
    "Pretty tough. May the curve help you.",
    "It was a decent Econ course. Sometimes p-sets were very (very very) long and sometimes very short, so just be aware when planning out your weeks. Tests were fair. I would say don't panic after the second midterm if you get a B+ on it or something, because the average is probably in the 40s. Just a warning. Do go to lecture. Don't read the book, but do skim to find the sections you need to go over. Do read each appendix.",
    "The reviews are accurate. Beware.",
    "I would only recommend as core course and as elective to those seeking to specialise. Never to someone as general well roundedness",
    "Not a fun class. Only take it if necessary",
    "a rough econ class to be avoided if at all possible",
    "You have to take it if you are doing econ, so try to take it with a different professor as I heard the other guy was better."
