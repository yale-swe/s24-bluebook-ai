   "comments": [
    "I think that some of the speakers are great, but it feels really forced. I have heard that some groups of students take turns attending and just sign each other in which really bothers me and indicates that students don't value the course.",
    "Interesting lectures; however, if you're in the global health concentration, you've probably been exposed to many of these topics\/lecturers before and so it can be repetitive. Also, one lecture is simply not enough to thoroughly explore a topic..",
    "variety of speakerssometimes not engaging enough",
    "Interesting to cover a range of topics and hear from a range of public health and medical professionals. It could be improved with more opportunity for discussion within the class, which would be facilitated by a smaller classroom space.",
    "This course could benefit from more discussion. I understand that it is a seminar but it often felt disjointed, like a series of unrelated lectures instead of a cohesive seminar. The quality of the speakers also varied greatly.The module on global mental health was the best. I appreciated having an introduction from Dr. Maya Prabhu for each of the sessions. It helped the unit feel connected and encouraged me to do the readings.",
    "Good introduction to GH with a range of speakers. Wasn't a big fan of the mental health emphasis. The disaster portion was much more interesting.",
    "Good exposure to global health. Great presenters from different disciplines.",
    "The speakers have all been very interesting. The module, however, was not organized and the requirements were unclear.",
    "The seminar had very interesting speakers and topics, but was disorganized at times.",
    "This was a great opportunity to hear and meet some of the leaders in the field of Global Health. I thought the smaller breakout sessions were a waste of time, however.",
    "I enjoyed the thematic sessions over the semester, and think that they helped to frame certain topics well. My biggest complaint was that the room was perhaps too large - it created vast tracts of space that did not lend themselves to discussion easily.",
    "Strengths:--the opportunity to meet many researchers (networking)--the opportunity to hear about interesting research--we were FED!Weakness:-- if you did not find the speaker\/researcher interesting--the class is way too long, it should only be 40-60 minutes",
    "Did not understand the concept of the required modules. A better clarification of the course structure in the beginning would have been helpful, as well as a schedule of all the speakers for each week in advance. However, really enjoyed the variety of topics and the interdisciplinary approach to global health.",
    "I enjoyed the variety of topics covered and the chance to interact with the speakers after the discussion in this seminar. However, I felt that the module was too narrow in scope. I saw this seminar as a way to get acquainted with the main issues in global health work today. I did not have as much interest in global mental health, and felt it was a niche topic that might have been better covered in a class for those who were interested. I would have liked the course to consider and evaluate more general global health trends (for example, discuss the largest health issues and interventions found in West Africa etc.) to give a big picture of different areas in the world and the challenges they face.",
    "Enjoyed the speakers",
    "Great speakers: diverse assortment of PH\/medical practitioners",
    "Great! I learned a lot from this course. Weird timing, but I probably would not change anything about this course.",
    "Although I am deeply passionate about global health, I felt that not all the seminars engaged me as I thought they would have. I enjoyed the topics presented, particularly the mental health module. I did however appreciate the great variety of guest speakers that we could speak with and hear from.",
    "I wasn't incredibly impressed by the selection of speakers. There were about half that I enjoyed and the other half that seemed lacklustered.",
    "Good subjects, interesting speakers",
    "I LOVE GLOBAL HEALTH, so the speakers were very interesting. I like to know more about how the speakers got to where they are today, so the dinner with the speakers afterwards is great.Requiring that the internship be abroad is a strict criteria that I would suggest needs to be revised.Attendance requirement was confusing, especially as it pertained to the modules.",
    "Good. Can be improved in terms of course structure and communication to students.",
    "The course had interesting topics some weeks, other weeks could have used better speakers, and sometimes the topics were less interesting to non-medical students.",
    "It was great to hear from so many health professionals from around the world.",
    "Excellent sampling of relevant topics in the field of global health from faculty with significant first-hand experience in these topics.",
    "An eye opening course. Very useful in the exploration of global health.",
    "Geared more towards those on the medical track, but still has many valuable insights for public health students.",
    "The course was interesting and a nice glimpse into global health possibilities. I don't feel as if I came away with any hard and fast lessons, but the lectures were useful, and the free dinners on Monday nights were definitely appreciated!"

   "comments": [
    "It's what you make of it. I thought some of the lectures were really interesting.",
    "Yes, it's interesting.",
    "This seminar is a series of guest lecturers on various topics in global health. Some of the speakers are excellent. I would recommend it, but as someone who went to every single seminar, I would suggest only choosing a few that seem particularly interesting.",
    "Really good job of integrating several departments in the field of global health.",
    "I don't think that all the classes should be mandatory. Maybe instead allow for students to watch videos on ClassesV2 and participate in a discussion thread there.",
    "Great course to learn about different work being done in global health.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned a lot of interesting information.",
    "A weekly opportunity to explore some of the aspects of global health through a series of lectures by professionals in the field.",
    "This class will only be good if you happen to find the speakers\/topics interesting. If not, it is an opportunity to do your emails or catch up on some other stuff. Less sections should be required.",
    "Good exposure to a variety of global health topics with relevant speakers",
    "I would highly recommend it to students interested in the module topics.",
    "Needs to improve if Global health student need to get the full experience of global health education at Yale",
    "Yes, because you will get context for your studies in global health. I looked forward to the class because it always shocked me into reality. Yale is a special academic world where you can easily get removed from the pain and suffering of other humans. I liked that the talks made me remember why I wanted to do this in the first place. And it was great to see real adults making a difference with their careers and actually still being idealistic enough to give a damn about the health problems of today, not just sit back and get paid.",
    "Be prepared for an unpredictable Monday evening. A few topics will keep you entertained and motivated. Others may be less interesting.",
    "Great course to take. Learned a lot. Got to make a few connections and one of the best courses I have taken so far.",
    "Enlightening course especially for those interested in global health.",
    "This class covers a lot of different global health subjects.",
    "Good lectures. I recommend this!",
    "Will recommend it.",
    "Yes. It was interesting to listen to the lectures but it was not necessarily engaging, which I think a lot of students were OK with.",
    "Excellent exposure to topics in global health. Selection of topics and instructors was very good. Essential to those wishing to work in the global health field, and of interest to anyone in public health.",
    "Different topics every week relevant to current issues in health. Good if you have an interest in global health, especially if you are going into medicine.",
    "I would say, you will not waste your time by going. If you hope to work or research internationally, this course is imperative, and the invited speakers are usually very interesting!"
