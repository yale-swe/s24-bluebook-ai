   "comments": [
    "Take it! Not always the most interesting material but a great foundation for Spanish, especially for grammar.",
    "Oscar is a great teacher. He's fun, nice, and by far the best out of the other L3 spanish teachers. Take his class.",
    "I would recommend it, good review of L2 topics and introduces new concepts that aren't too difficult",
    "Spanish was one of my favorite classes this term because of the small class size and the sense of community our professor created within the class. It was always a joy to go to class. At the same time, we wereable to learn a lot through a well structured syllabus and a variety of in-class exercises. We also spent a lot of time watching movies and reading stories which introduced us to various cultures, which I found quite enjoyable. The only downside of this course, besides having to do homework for five classes a week, was that the material felt rushed towards the end, and various new concepts were thrown at us daily. But besides that, this was an excellent course and I recommend it to anyone considering a language.",
    "I doubt that you are taking this class for fun, if you are, then don't worry, it is exactly what you would expect from a language class at Yale. If you are like me and are taking this class because you are required to, take it with Oscar, he will make your life easier, or at least more fun.",
    "Oscar is amazing although he goes on tangents sometimes. Very understanding and caring"
