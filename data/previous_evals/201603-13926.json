   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Much stronger capacity for intersectional analysis. A certain awareness of a conspiracy theory entitled \"neoliberalism.\" An acute awareness of how US foreign policy has oppressed and continues to oppress thousands of people in the Middle East.",
    "Theory is absolutely indispensable for advocacy.",
    "I learned how to think sociologically and understand different aspects of how conflict and uprisings can both affect and are driven by different types of people in society. I also gained a deeper understanding of US imperialism and the orientalism framework at the beginning was newer to me and helpful.",
    "This course helped me greatly with understanding concepts in sociology such as the idea of a social movement, the panopticon, necropower and feminist theory. Further, it gave me a lot of insight into the Arab Sprinf and social movements on the ground in the Middle East.",
    "This course was the perfect balance of theoretical and practical. Since the class was a mix of political science students and english\/philosophy\/gender studies students, we were able to engage with the course material on many different levels and really learn from each other. I learned so much about the Middle East, how revolutions work, and how to use highly complex theories (like Foucaults theory of governmentality or Saids theory of orientalism) to analyze modern political movements.",
    "I developed knowledge of Middle East politics of the Arab Spring from a gender and sexuality perspective.",
    "This course taught me to think about the Middle East from a different perspective- Professor Salime was very effective at challenging held beliefs and speaking as a Morrocan native about the Arab Uprisings.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about the discipline of sociology, and specifically introduced me to the theory behind understanding government and control. This course also introduced me to some of the political realities related to the Arab Revolutions (I have a good sense of what took place when)",
    "What I gained most from this course was a theoretically informed, critical framework that will prove exceedingly useful in understanding both the region's complexities and others' common misconceptions\/problematic positions.",
    "Through this course I improved my ability to critically engage in readings from a wide variety of disciplines. I came to understand the multitude of factors that contribute to the perception of women in the Middle East. I also was able to explore and better understand different feminist theories."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the selection of the readings. For the most part, excellent and thought provoking. Weaknesses: I wish the discussions had been more structured - maybe by having a discussion question associated with each week. I wish we had gotten more feedback on our writing.",
    "Strengths: great discussion, great incorporation of primary sources, and very engaging readings Weaknesses: the readings for each week were not grouped into sections (they did not have titles indicating what the theme of the week was) so sometimes it was difficult to tell what exactly we were supposed to be getting out of them or what we should have in mind when doing the readings.",
    "I thought Professor Salime was the greatest thing about the course, she was engaging and brilliant. The presentations and the reading choices were also very strong, but personally having to write the reading responses each week was difficult for me and I felt did not necessarily help me process the information. I also wish there had been more emphasis on learning the background histories of the various countries and uprisings before diving into the themes and different perspectives on them, and I felt a lot of people in the class were learning on background knowledge of the region that not everyone else had.",
    "This course could be improved if laptops were not allowed and if the students were more engaged with the readings. The course did not emphasize the readings enough in discussions and was too student-led.",
    "The course material was extremely interesting and the professor was extremely experienced and led interesting discussions. However, I would have preferred to have two essays rather than weekly reading responses, since in my experience essays give more space for reflection and engagement with the text than reading responses. Further, I would have liked a bit more practical texts. Lastly, I really would have appreciated more feedback on the assignments I turned in.",
    "The whole course was strong and well organized. The weekly reaction papers were difficult, but made me engage with the readings on a deeper level than I would have otherwise. I thought the presentations were the weakest part of the course there was only so much we could learn from our cursory research for our own presentations, or from watching others present on their topics.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "The course could use a little more organization-- I liked the student presentation, but I would have liked it better if there was more of a plan for each class and if Professor Salime began with a small lecture or even gave a more pointed goal of what to learn each class.",
    "This course was good. It made me engage because of the weekly reading responses, and also because a great deal of the material was interesting. I wish the professor had prepared more of an organized discussion for class- since we were not middle east experts, her input and a lecture by her at the beginning to frame the discussion would have been useful.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. The professor was engaging, thoughtful and did a great job of pushing the students to think critically about the readings and subjects covered. I looked forward to the discussion every week and learned so much from the professor and my peers. The student presentations on different topics were also very interesting and provided a nice contrast to the group discussions. I would recommend this course to every student at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as they can handle studying on their own and not being afraid to ask for help from the instructor.",
    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "In general yes, but if you don't have a lot of background in the area then maybe not. The people in the class were kind of difficult and pretentious at times.",
    "If the group of students taking the class was more open minded and engaged with the readings, then yes. If it was a repeat of my experience, then no.",
    "I recommend this class 100%. You will gain a deep appreciation for the various uprisings in the Middle East, and Prof Salime is an incredible person to learn from.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take the course no matter your background. Professor Salime offers a really unique perspective as a teacher and challenges you to think outside your conceptions about the Middle East. The readings are very interesting and Professor Salime offers a perspective on the world of someone who's actually lived the things she teaches. One of my favorite Yale courses.",
    "This course was good. The positive aspects of this course include: 1) weekly reading responses instead of more little papers, which kept me more engaged in the course and kept me consistently prepared each week 2) an open ended final project, which allowed those of us with preexisting ideas to work on developing them, 3) interesting material that you might not be exposed to in other courses. The seminars could have allowed us to gain more and been more organized, but the general structure, material and professor allowed us to learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students without reservation."
