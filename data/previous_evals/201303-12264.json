    "An overview course on Human Evolution. No prior knowledge of material necessary. Conducted seminar style with readings assigned on a chosen topic and in depth discussion about assigned topic in class each week. Would definitely recommend to a fellow student. I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed doing so.",
    "This course exposes you to the many theories that exist on the evolution of homo sapiens and other hominids. I would recommend this class to any anthropology and archaeology students, due to the discussion on various techniques for dating.I would recommend this class to liberal arts students for exposure to the hard sciences with out being overwhelmed by technical information they are not prepared for."

   "comments": [
    "While this course was not directly relevant to my course of study, I chose to take it because I have an interest in the subject matter. The course certainly deepened my knowledge and appreciation for various aspects of human evolution.",
    "As an archaeologist primarily interested in the Bronze Age, this course covered a time span I had no previous study of. It made me realize how much material I have to work with compared to what paleo-anthropologists have. It is truly a different approach to archaeology and I am glad to have gained knowledge of it.",
    "I am a historian of the modern period so this coarse is not very applicable to my studies directly. However, in general this coarse exposed me to ideas and other students that I would not normally come in contact with and was very broadening. It would be directly applicable to historians of antiquity and pre-history."
