    "Great experience with excel assignments and hands-on skills.",
    "Learning about financial tools and how to use them to build predictions about the value of your land and its evolution depending on your management decisions (thinning, road construction...) was extremely useful. Really liked how the homework had us apply the concepts to real life situations.",
    "It is practical.",
    "For me this was a \"connective\" course--it linked other courses I have taken for the MF (silviculture, econ, forest operations) in a very practical way.Deborah's practical experience in the field she is teaching makes her a credible and expert instructor.",
    "I really enjoyed the case assignments. They forced me to apply the concepts we learned in class and helped develop a different skill set than is required for other forestry focused classes.",
    "The problem sets were excellent.",
    "Real world anecdotes interspersed with theoretical presentation.",
    "The real world situations that our Professor spoke to us about. She was able to put these concepts into context, and talkabout real deals that her company has done.",
    "Good presentation of material (powerpoint).Enjoyed focus on timber AND ecosystem services.The teaching assistant, Spenser, did an excellent job. It was helpful to hear his experience and thoughts.",
    "Gaining a basic understanding of finance concepts, forestland investment, and environmental markets.Learning from a practitioner.",
    "The course is a valuable part of the curriculum. I wish there was a more advanced option as a follow-on.",
    "- Learning from a practitioner- Instructor and TA very accessible, open to student questions and participation- Valuable practice modeling NPV of various timber and mitigation credit investment projects",
    "The professors personal experience, the very applicable content, the practical skills gained, the interactive and real-world assignments, the pulled-from-industry publications reading, the clear slides.",
    "The best aspect of this course was the explanation of basic financial valuation principles as they apply to forests and ecosystem services. Understanding how to do a rudimentary analysis of this in excel was also important, mostly because it will allow us to read these analyses better in the future.",
    "The assignments were fun and clearly applicable.",

    "None.",
    "Change the location. Deborah Spalding was obviously frustrated by the lack of interaction induced by Bowers' airport-like dimensions.",
    "I felt like there were too many readings. It also would have been helpful if we were given a quick primer on financial terms to be used in the class.",
    "I would have appreciated more discussion between students",
    "I think a more round-table discussion style would be best. Numbers forced us to a larger room unfortunately",
    "Readings could be streamlined",
    "I think this course would benefit from some discussions every once and awhile. Three hours of lecture can be a challenge to focus the entire time.",
    "The return time on assignments was really unacceptable.Better classroom location.Prompt start to lecture.Textbook?More \"real world\" examples of property appraisals and investments.Final project revision.",
    "Better readings - Im not very familiar with this field so I don't know if better reading material is out there, but I didn't find the course readings extremely helpful. Most seemed to come from land appraisal and didn't provide the basic background to the concept in question. Considering that the course is relatively introductory, some popular nonfiction about conservation finance might have well timed.Student presentations - see 16Perhaps team - teach with someone like B. Gentry or B. Cashore, or at the very least, bring some specialists to guest lecture the topics that Deb is less familiar with. Deb has really valuable experience as a practitioner, but limited knowledge about some aspects of conservation finance because she is not a full time professor and just doesn't have the time.Two lectures \/ week is probably better than one.",
    "The instructor used mostly outdated slides and market outlooks. Most material was pre-2008 and irrelevant in today's markets. Current data is widely available.",
    "More guidance on bigger projects like the final one would have helped melearn more from the experience",
    "Focus on excel as a tool, not the focus of the study. Also, I don't know if there's a way to address some more of the students' reservations about the inherent environmental validity of wetland mitigation banking as it's practiced, but that would have helped me remain engaged.",
    "Integration of readings.",
    "Never teach this course in Bowers again and cap enrollment."

    "I actually sat in Kotchen's class during the first week of the semester and soon realized that I couldn't possibly take one more economics class as general as that (I've taken quite a few). Forest Finance is the finance class that every MF student should be required to take. It ties ecological concepts with financial mechanisms and gives us a clear notion of how investors interact to shape the market.",

    "I am dual MF - MBA, so it was great for me to get an intro to conservation finance.",
    "I am not studying forestry or even conservation management, but it is useful to understand how a company might go about valuating ecosystem services. Further, the course provides the opportunity to develop\/practice modeling investment payback scenarios; which is a transferable skill to any kind of investment valuation (energy, infrastructure, etc)",
    "This course might be the most improtant one I take at FES- I wish it were two semesters long so we could go more in depth. It is exactly the type ofthing I was hoping to learn when coming here. IT managed to mix the financial and environmental aspects of conservation without compromising either. Some classes when studying where these two things come together you dont end up studying much of all. Not the case here. Really hands on and applied - I would suggest stressing that more in future iterations of the course.",
