   "comments": [
    "A great class. It is better is you have some prior knowledge of Japan, but it is not at all necessary. I would also recommend this class for those that want an interesting take on politics and its relationship to economics and the voters. The professor is very approachable and really helps to make the material accessible to the class. The course work is very manageable and in no way overwhelming. This is definitely a class that you should take if you are interested in Japan, and even more so if you have an interest in Japanese politics.",
    "The biggest part of your grade comes from a term paper at the end of the class. It's a project that's worked up to in steps, though (submitting a research proposal mid-semester, and presenting your arguments in one of the final class meetings) before submitting the final draft, so its not too overwhelming.The class focuses very heavily on the intricacies of the electoral processes of Japan, and looks much more at the set of conditions that have contributed to Japan's modern state than necessarily what the modern state is.There's a lot of reading if you try to do it all- I spent huge amounts of time trying to do it all at first, but ultimately this class improved my ability to skim and take the essential points out of reading significantly.",
    "The course is an interesting look at a variety of features in postwar\/contemporary Japanese politics and society. It assumes very little knowledge of Japan, so it can feel a bit tedious and repetitive if you already have a background in Japan, but it may be more interesting if approached as a case study for various political science and political economy theories and principles. The course, however, is structured poorly; two hours into a 'seminar' which is more like a lecture can be deadly. There is barely any incentive to do reading and the final paper is straightforward. So...it's not too much work, but I don't know whether that makes it worth it, especially if you have background in Japanese history or society already.",
    "This is a very good course. You learn a lot about Japanese Politics mostly, a little less about the political economy. The readings are very varied, which is nice, and the movie about a candidate's campaign shows a lot about what you've learned in class. Professor Saito is very knowledgeable, but the class is not structured a lot like a seminar. Professor Saito lectures most of the time. He is helpful and promptly replies to emails. The first portion of the class is problem sets that are very manageable and not too hard, and the second half is the research paper. Take the class if you're interested in learning.",
    "I would recommend to another student. The readings were interesting and relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who are interested in Japanese politics and\/or politics in general."
