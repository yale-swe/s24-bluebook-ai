    "Intro to Lighting Design was a wonderfully satisfying course to take because I actually learned a great deal of a practical skill that I previously didn't have. Reading plans, worksheeting, actually hanging and focusing and programming lights and cues Yale often doesn't seem like much of a practical education but this class did, which was fun."

    "We tried to fit too much material into this course, so we didn't cover it all, and what we did was not all covered thoroughly, but Alan was always willing to answer questions and go back over the things that we wanted to spend more time on, so it felt like the most that we could have done in a semester. Practicals were sometimes frustrating just because we started them before we had the practical skillse.g. programming the Expressso they were a lot of troubleshooting that didn't seem particularly educational, but by the end they were much more productive."

    "Intro to Lighting Design was rewarding and not a lot of work. The two-hour seminar (though at 9 AM on a Monday) went by almost too quickly we covered an insane amount of material in the semester, but there were no quizzes\/exams, so it really felt (and this is rare at Yale) that the entire point of it was learning as much as we could, not for regurgitation, but for learning and synthesizing it. I left class knowing how to do something that I didn't before hanging and focusing lights, picking gels, reading plays to imagine their lighting, magic sheets, worksheeting, light plots, etc. Would recommend. Alan was super low-key and I learned a lot."
