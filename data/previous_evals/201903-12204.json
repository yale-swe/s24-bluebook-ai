    "I conducted literature review, situational analysis, and facilitated the integration of findings into strategy formulation to help UNICEF Angola draft the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP), and also presented to multi-sectoral stakeholders in Luanda.",
    "Topic-wise, I learnt extensively about neonatal mortality and RMNCAH in general, and about the Angolan context. Skills-wise, I learnt how to carry out a proper literature review, and come up with a strategy plan with cost estimates."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Support from UNICEF and partners in Angola for the project. Detailed feedback from the advisor. Weaknesses: Generally not well organised.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Alipui is excellent. He knows everything there is to know about public health, he's very experienced, and he's incredibly patient\/invested in his students. You get to work directly with the Government of Angola and with UNICEF, which is a truly rare and exciting opportunity. The work is very important, and could have a large impact on people you care about. Weaknesses: because the work is so important and the timetable is so short, one can sometimes feel as if they aren't doing a good enough job to merit working on the issues addressed in the class.",
    "The course was a unique opportunity to contribute to UNICEF's ongoing work to reduce neonatal mortality in Angola, and its main strength was the constant communication with Angolan counterparts through Zoom calls and email feedback to ensure our work was grounded in local needs.",
    "Our project was high-impact and very relevant today, and having partners who were much more experienced in the field was extremely insightful. The course gave a very good taste of what it would be like to work on an actual problem in the capacity of an international NGO. Our trips to Angola were unique opportunities to really understand what was happening on the ground and the roles of various stakeholders. Finally, being able to work closely with other students provided many learning moments for me."
