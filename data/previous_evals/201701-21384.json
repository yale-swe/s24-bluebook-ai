   "comments": [
    "I analyzed literature for its meaning and writing techniques, wrote a number of short prose pieces for practice, and then ended the course with a 15 page short story which is intended to get you into an advanced writing course next semester. This class helped me develop my creative writing skills, especially in regard to developing realistic characters which is especially important when writing contemporary literature. Also the workshopping and revision process gave me insight on how other people write and how to improve my own writing.",
    "This course helped develop my creative writing skills and taught the different nivel literary periods.",
    "I gained exposure to a selection of English language literature across a variety of time periods, including representatives from genres\/movements with which I had not previously been familiar. I also learned the process of planning and writing a lengthy fictional story.",
    "I learned to read fiction with an eye towards how it's made, got better at reading large amounts of creative text quickly and so as it be able to discuss it cogently in class, and practiced my workshopping skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lots of opportunities to write shorter pieces for practice, seminar-size made great learning environment where you could get constructive criticism and insight about pieces of work. Weaknesses: Could have met more than once a week, wish we had more time to read short stories on top of longer works of fiction.",
    "The material taught was very interesting, and the amount of readings was very well balanced. I thought that it was very helpful when Professor Baker offered us a small break in the middle of class because the class period was fairly long. In terms of weaknesses, it would have been nice to have been given feedback halfway through the semester on how we are doing in the class. Otherwise, this class was very well organized.",
    "This course includes a lot of discussion, and the size of the course (only about eight students), as well as the literature selection, facilitated that. Almost all of the students seemed very interested in the literature we were reading, and we never had trouble filling the class period. We read about one book a week, which seemed like a good pace for the course, and the discussions were interesting. The course's weaknesses were: 1. it was heavily weighted on the final story, and no grades were given on the small writing assignments throughout the semester, only (very limited) feedback. As I write this review, I have absolutely no idea what grade I'm getting in this course, and no way to guess where I fall. 2. The professor really guides the discussions, and he had very strong opinions. Often it felt like students would express opinions and he would evaluate them as right or wrong, leaving little room for alternative perspectives on an issue. This is a common problem I have encountered in English classes throughout high school and college: essentially, the professor is always right. I think the professor's role should be to offer guidance, but students should be allowed to take a more active role in discussion and not feel like their opinions might be pounced upon and negated any second.",
    "A strength of this course was the sophisticated literature it asked me to read and the larger questions it posed about colonialism, the novel, etc. I wish that I had written more, and that what we had read had been more directly applicable to the sort of writing we did in the class.",
    "I thought this course was far too heavy on reading, and didn't line up with students' expectations and desires for what they wanted out of the course. I entered hoping to improve my writing first and foremost, but we spent most of the semester focusing on the history of english-language literature. I wished we had spent more time on writing exercises and been able to get more feedback on our writing."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Anyone who is interested in creative writing, especially fiction, should take this course. It is much more in depth than \"Intro to Creative Writing\" as you are only focusing on one genre versus three. Also, the small class size makes for really thought-provoking conversation and helpful criticism. Also, of the eight students in my seminar only one was an English major, so I think this is a class that anyone who is interested in strengthening their writing skills should take!",
    "I would recommend this to another student because it revealed a different form of literary analysis than that I have been exposed to before: it examined what makes a great fictive story great.",
    "I would recommend this class with reservations. Be prepared to do not very much work over the course of the semester but a lot of work at the end. If you're a slow reader, you may struggle with this because you read an entire novel every week, so it can be hard to pace yourself. And be conscious that you need to contribute intelligently to discussions (this is a major portion of the grade), so you absolutely cannot get by without doing the reading. I wouldn't say this is a revolutionary class, but I learned something, wrote a cool story, and got to read some pretty great books.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student with prior creative writing experience looking for an excuse to write and read some great stuff. I wouldn't recommend it to another student looking for a true introduction to the craft of fiction.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you are looking to really get better at writing fiction, take a class that's dedicated to writing fiction (i.e. Introduction to Writing Fiction). If you are looking for a class that's dedicated to reading fiction, take a class that's dedicated to reading fiction. Do not settle for this unhappy medium."
