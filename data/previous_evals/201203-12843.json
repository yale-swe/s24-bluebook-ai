    "\u00c2\u00a1Si! I would definitely recommend this class to other Spanish Heritage speakers. This class has a nice balance between the TYPES of assignments students have to complete. For example, there are basic grammar skills one has to learn (like any other language course), five escrituras, and we have to watch about five movies that convey messages\/themes that are pertinent to Latin American countries. If you want a class where you ACTUALLY want to wake up in the morning to go to, THIS is the class!",
    "Spanish 132 is the perfect Spanish class for those who were raised speaking Spanish but do not have a good grasp on grammar and speaking professionally in Spanish. I would recommend this class to any student who wants to improve their Spanish in order to better communicate with their family and avoid being called a \"gringo.\"",
    "I would recommend this class to any Spanish Heritage speaker. It is an excellent and fun class. The work load is manageable and you will notice an increase in your profeciency in spanish.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "This is a great course if you want to strengthen your understanding of Spanish. I grew up with the language yet had never taken an actual course, so I was glad to find a class that provided a comfortable and encouraging environment for me to improve my fluency. The workload is good and varied -- including short stories and films -- , and really helps students learn different grammar concepts or vocabulary.The instructor focused on helping students improve their understanding and fluency, without a focus on the practical uses of grammar, rather than the nuances or details.",
    "Spanish 132 01 is a class for native Spanish speakers (or anyone who has lived in a Spanish speaking country). It is an amazing class in many aspects, especially when it comes to the classroom atmosphere. Since it is such a small class, you will get close to your classmates in a very real way. It is a very inviting atmosphere.",
    "Yes!"
