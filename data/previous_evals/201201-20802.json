   "comments": [
    "It's a good introduction to bioinformatics, but unless you plan on continuing on in classes of that nature, the techniques aren't too terribly useful (or extensively covered).",
    "A good course to get acquainted with the statistical concepts that underlie computational approaches in biology.I would recommend the course for its relevance in the statistical concepts underlying applications in computational biology.",
    "Statistical Genetics and Bioinformatics is important to bioinformaticians and statisticians interested in applying their skills to bioinformatics problems. I would certainly recommend it to other students.",
    "I think it as a practical class for CBB students to take. And I certainly feel it will be helpful for our research.",
    "I would say that it is possible to learn about a lot of computational Bayesian methods that are not taught in other courses I have taken. However, it is not very easy to learn in the class, so doing the homework is a necessity to understand the concepts.",
    "STAT 645 is a solid introduction to techniques commonly used in bioinformatics, especially those with particular relevance to Professor Zhang's research. Professor Zhang is very challenging but very supportive as well. We covered a broad depth of topics in lecture. Some background in biology is preferable but not necessary.",
    "Take it if you like bio, bio research, or biostat or programming applied to bio.",
    "The materials covered are extremely relevant and useful in bioinformatics and statistics. So the course provides a very thoughtful topical view of the field with decent deliverance during lectures. But if one is looking for guidance in certain unfamiliar topics which I am sure people will often have, the lecturer might be less accessible than one would expect. This is really a shame since in general, this has a great potential to be a really great course.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to others. It uses the methods learned in STAT 538 to more specific bioinformatics problems."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It provided a better understanding of the basic statistical elements used in CBB. It contributed by allowing me to focus in an important question related to haplotypes in genetic analysis, a core element of my main project.",
    "This course helped me improve my understanding of my research and gave mevital information for future studies.",
    "As an undergraduate, I think this course equipped me with common tools, strategies, frameworks, and approaches in computational biology. It helped me realize some of the strengths\/weaknesses in bioinformatics and allowed me to better understand how we can merge statistics and genetics to answer questions we're interested in answering. Perhaps most importantly, this class really helped me gain some invaluable research experience, too.",
    "Gave me great exposure to research, what is publishable, and related matters.",
    "It definitely did expand my knowledge in my discipline. But I was expecting much more since the topics covered are extremely relevant. It is going to contribute alot my research, in terms of knowing the existence of such topics but not necessarily my depth of knowledge in that area.",
    "I feelthat I now have a good understanding of Bayesian statistics and of expectation maximization methods. I do not yet know how it helped or how it will help in my research, as I did not finish my rotations yet, so I did not start my own research yet. However, I imagine that the methods that I learned in this course will help at least some."
