   "comments": [
    "Yes. A chance to close read important novels predating the nineteenth century and to trace the evolution of the early novel.",
    "This is a great class - a huge swath of important and enjoyable novels, well-crafted discussions, and a decent smattering of secondary material. Even if you don't take the class, go read Jacques The Fatalist.",
    "Comp Lit 646 is a more or less chronological survey of key european narrative texts of the 18th century that speak to each other in more or less direct fashion. I would recommend this class to whomever wanted to read important novels, canonical or otherwise, expand their knowledge of national literatures other than the one in which they specialize, or who would be interested in the concept of the novel as a genre and the various typologies and histories of it that have been made. Students interested in gender issues and issues of class or racecould also take this class.",
    "Very open conversation about some canonical novels with a professor who wants to help students learn and think deeply about the material",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student -- not only because Katie Trumpener is an excellent professor, but also because this course offers essential background on the development of the novel. I think it's necessary for all literature students, particularly those focusing on European literatures."

   "comments": [
    "It provided me with background on a period I normally do not work in.",
    "I believe (I hope) this class has made me a better reader - I learned new ways to look at texts both from Pr Trumpener and fellow students. I have also garnered several potential ideas for my dissertation during this class.",
    "Definitely many novels \/ writers who I had not read before--many of which could appear on a future orals list. The book review exercise also an important one for students",
    "This course provided an excellent background in literature of the 17th and 18th centuries; I found it incredibly useful, as it gave me a better context for my own interests (in late 19th century and early 20th century literatures)."
