    "I developed a base of Italian vocabulary, grammar, and culture that I did not have before.",

    "I learned the basics of Italian grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Good grasp of most grammar rules in the italian language. - Reading comprehension - verb tenses",
    "Study habits, communication skills, grammar and vocabulary",
    "It was a fantastic course for beginning a brand new language and the generally heavy course-load was, apart from difficult, a kick-start into the academic expectations at Yale.",
    "I learned basic Italian language skills.",
    "I feel that I learned more than I had hoped to learn from this class, and I am extremely happy with the amount of progress that I made. I now have a strong base in the Italian language and I have a much stronger proficiency with the language than I imagined could be possible after studying Italian for a single semester.",
    "A decent understanding of introductory grammar and pronunciation.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of Italian grammar and speaking which will provide a strong basis for further study."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are definitely the class size, having the class meet every day and the exercises we would do in pairs and groups during class. I think it's always good to have more speaking in language classes so having more Italian conversation would be nice.",
    "Strengths: class was always enjoyable, focused structure Weakness: very high workload",
    "Sandro explained concepts relating to grammar and vocabulary in a very clear, intelligible way. I would have appreciated if we had spent more time speaking in Italian though - we had one short oral presentation at the very end of the semester, but it would have been nice to work more on developing our speaking skills. I also thought the daily quizzes were completely unnecessary and a lot more stressful than they should have been - they didn't help me to improve my understanding of the topics.",
    "Strengths - Verb Conjugation - Reading Weakness - Speaking",
    "You are forced to listen and speak Italian every day. Helpful in the long run.",
    "The strengths of this course include extensive grammar work and a solid foundation in the language. It is also, generally, a very enjoyable course with high interactivity and a great insight to Italian culture. A weakness I find with the course is the lack of speaking in Italian, with only a five minute presentation being the only formal necessity to speak Italian for the class. I also felt that the three-hour final exam was a little unnecessary, with other L1 courses not using the exam at all.",
    "strength-Had very competent teacher. weakness-At times we moved through the course material way too fast.",
    "This course covers a wide range of grammar and skills in the Italian language, and is the most challenging language course I've ever taken. I have no complaints about the course and believe that it has been a very valuable experience for me.",
    "The course moves very quickly, which I understand is a necessity. However, I wish there were more opportunities for review and practice (lots more practice!) throughout the semester before the final exam.",
    "This course was well designed. It moved at a fast but manageable pace and had numerous and helpful exercises centered on speaking, grammar, reading and composition. Some language courses, which go overboard on (potentially useless) group projects, making films, etc., this class struck a nice balance. The textbook was logical and helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It moves pretty quickly, especially if you have no previous experience, but it's very organized and a great class overall.",
    "Yes. If willing to take a difficult language with high workload, this is a great class. Learn a lot, also enjoyable",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to gain a solid foundation in Italian.",
    "Yes, Italian is a great language to learn and the teachers are dedicated to helping you learn.",
    "Yes, it's challenging and engaging, but worth it by the end of the semester and is certainly helping me learn the language",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that is interested in studying Italian. It is a thorough introduction to the course that makes you interested in the language and the culture of Italy. Be warned though - this is a very tough course with a lot of work attached and high expectations to learn the content of the course on your own before going to class.",
    "Cool language to learn but you do move through the course material pretty fast.",
    "I would recommend this course as a class that will definitely increase your knowledge of Italian, and that does so in an engaging manner. It provides an excellent base to pursue studies in Italian."
