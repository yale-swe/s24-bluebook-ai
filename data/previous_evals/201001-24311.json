   "comments": [
    "I would completely recommend this course. You will leave the class having learned a lot without ever feeling overworked.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who has any interest in black literature or the classics. It's important to get outside of the world of the classics as the past and understand their relevance today.",
    "It will blow your mind.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Classics in Black to another student. Classics in Black was an excellent, excellent course. The subject material was fascinating and surprisingly relevant in linking ideas of the classics, education, and culture to postcolonial societies, indigenous and minority cultures, and themes of imperialism, civilization, and more. Also, Professor Emily Greenwood is brilliant--incredibly articulate, thorough, knowledgeable, and kind. Take this course! It's an excellent compliment to Directed Studies (which I took)---it provides a modern lens through which you see the impact the \"Western Canon\" has had, both positive and negative, in the Western and other\/related (i.e. African, post-colonial Caribbean, African-American, etc.) traditions. You see how the \"Western Canon\" was used as an instrument of extreme oppression and power as well as how is was, and is currently, used as a means of subversion and inspiration.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a different and refreshing look at the Greco-Roman classics from a Black point of view. I definitely feel that I learned a lot from this course and had fun while doing so. The workload is manageable and the reading is phenomenal."
