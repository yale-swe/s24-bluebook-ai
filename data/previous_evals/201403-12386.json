   "comments": [
    "Phil would be a great class for any phil majors, but was hard to follow as a sciency person and psych major. Interesting but nothing like i had taken before.",
    "Essentially an intro philosophy course with a focus on, as the title suggests, faith and reason. As it is currently taught and laid out, there was a huge disconnect between material and teaching styles in the first and second halves of the course. Though the assignments are manageable, I would say there is more work than might be expected of an intro philosophy course (reading responses, midterm, final, final paper). Overall, I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Definitely take Faith and Reason. Even if you're not super interested in philosophy or theology, the readings are pretty accessible and the subject matter is inherently interesting (at least I think so). If you stay on top of the reading responses, the workload is super manageable, too. All in all one of the most interesting classes I've taken so far.",
    "PHIL 127 was a fantastic course. Julianne and Keith have very different lecture styles, both of which are highly effective, and section is used as a great tool to better understanding. The workload is extremely manageable (5 short homework assignments, 2 in-class essay exams, and 1 final essay) and the professors are very available to help. My one warning for philosophy majors taking this class (like myself) is that a lot of the material covered in PHIL 127 was also covered in PHIL 126; I didn't necessarily mind this overlap, but I wish I had known about it going into the course. Overall, I would say definitely take Faith and Reason if you are considering!",
    "Take it",
    "Interesting content but not necessarily a satisfying exploration of the broader concepts of faith and reason. Section discussions were always really interesting, especially since I had never taken a philosophy class before.",
    "If this is something you're interested in, but apprehensive about the philosophy part, definitely take it.",
    "Good introductory class for someone who wants to take some first philosophy without trying to cover an entire tradition. Hits on issues of knowledge and religious experience specifically while avoiding focusing to the point of being a philosophy of religion course. I would recommend it to someone interested in the syllabus questions who does not have much background."
