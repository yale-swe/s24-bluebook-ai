   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course. The instructor didn't follow the syllabus at all regarding assignments. The structure of the course was somewhat incoherent; it was presented sort of like: \"here's a bunch of arbitrary theory and journal articles presented in no order and with no application of theory to journal article concepts.\" This was by far the hardest I've worked in a course from which I felt like I took almost nothing. The main theme of the course is a regurgitation of the labor-choice decision presented in intermediate microeconomics along with a bunch of arbitrary econometric concepts and arbitrary journal articles.",
    "I would recommend this course if you know your econometrics and are willing to spend hours on a problem set(which were sometimes so brutal). Yet, I think very differently because of this course. It really gets you to think like an economist.",
    "Take it. The class was great, and will be even better next year. It will be hard for the few days before assignments are due, but you get so much out of those assignments that the temporary stress is well worth it.",
    "This is a math-intensive course, but worth it in my opinion.",
    "I would recommend it if you need a seminar and are interested in learning about the U.S. welfare policies (past and present). I entered the class with no interest in the topic but gained a newfound appreciation of the importance of the topic.",
    "I would warn students that this class has quite a bit of advanced math and econometrics involved. However, if you are willing to put in the time to work on problem sets and go to office hours, this has the potential to be one of the more rewarding classes you will take at Yale."
