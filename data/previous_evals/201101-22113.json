   "comments": [
    "A good overview to inorganic chemistry. Lecture goes very fast because they are on powerpoint and he doesn't really write on the board.",
    "Be warned: exams are sometimes nothing like problem sets, so they can be tricky to prepare for. It's not that easy to do well for some people. Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "A great overview of inorganic chemistry in terms of reactivity, catalysts, and general syntheses.",
    "This is either a course you need to take (inorganic requirement for the chem major) or one you don't everyone else. If you are everyone else, don't take it. It isn't an enjoyable elective, and it's a terrible choice as a premed class.",
    "This class was pretty good overall. Crabtree is super disorganized and doesn't care very much about teaching this class. The material is really interesting, though. I can't imagine taking this class without having had organic first. It would have been awful. The midterms are major wildcards, but the final was pretty straightforward. I have literally no earthly idea what grade I'll be getting, which is a little terrifying. Small workload though- if you can get credit for your major for this class it's probably a good choice.",
    "Decent class, need to pay attention in lecture because slides are pretty disorganized and the reading is kind of dense.",
    "This class is likely a requirement. In any case, it's not too challenging, and the workload is below average. With the option to drop one of the three tests (midterm 1, midterm 2, final), it's also low-stress. I do wish the class would be a bit more rigorous with some subjects. Starts out very easy and becomes more challenging towards the middle and end.",
    "This class is basically fine. You're only really going to take it if you need to for some reason, which is fine. The class is a pretty good introduction to Inorganic chemistry. At times it can be a little all over the place, but when you get to the actual organometallic stuff it's fairly useful. Not amazing and not awful.",
    "good introduction to inorganic chemistry; appropriatefor all students in the class regardless of prior chemistry experience (from senior chem majors to students who had just finished CHEM 118); fair tests and workload. I appreciated the balance between historical anecdotes, current research updates, and concepts. It might have been nice to have a closer correspondence between reference textbooks and course material, though I understand that this is difficult given the level of most inorganic texts. If powerpoint slides aren't your style, this class probably isn't a good fit for you.",
    "It's a good class about the chemistry of transition metals. The subjects aren't the most coherent, and the material is a bit \"all over the place,\" but it's a good class overall.",
    "DefinRely pay close attention in class since the slides can be confusing.",
    "This course is not particularly challenging, especially before the first midterm. The second half of the course requires some more work, but overall it's quite manageable. Professor Crabtree also does a great job making the coursework relevant to the real world. Unfortunately, though, he uses his own textbook for the second half of the course, and the book isn't particularly in depth. This means if you don't understand what he's said in lecture, you won't be able to turn to a textbook to learn the material much better."
