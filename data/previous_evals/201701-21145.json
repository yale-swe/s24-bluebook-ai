    "I developed a more nuanced understanding of Spanish grammar and improved my writing abilities.",
    "I feel much more confident speaking and writing in complex sentences. My reading ability has improved and I have a much more comprehensive knowledge of Spanish grammar now.",
    "Better control of some of the trickier nuances of Spanish - most of the concepts weren't new, but I got much better at applying them.",
    "Better understanding of the nuance of tense and mood as applied to the Spanish langauge",
    "I gained greater understanding of finer grammar points for Spanish (distinguishing between the meaning of words\/verbs that meant the same word in English but had different uses in Spanish, knowing when to use different verbs\/tenses, which prepositions to use, etc.). I learned about grammar rules. I also was exposed to Spanish films and literature."

   "comments": [
    "The course itself is poorly structured, with topics appearing in a seemingly random order. This could be improved by either working methodically through the textbook or explaining the process behind the ordering of the grammar topics. The strength of this course is absolutely Profesora Pilar-Asensio. She is fantastic. Do not take the course unless you are enrolled in her section.",
    "The course moved at a good pace and covered a wide range of material. We covered all of the grammar structures that I used to avoid, so now I can use them confidently. One weakness was just that there wasn't a lot of speaking practice. I enjoyed the conversation partner program with the students from Quito.",
    "It kind of makes sense that inherently the course doesn't emphasize comprehension and speaking as much as writing, but I still would've liked to do a little more - I feel that my speaking skills are far behind where they should be relative to my writing.",
    "Strengths: goes more into detail about the Spanish language structure itself, GREAT literature\/film content (my favorite part of the class was analyzing the films and short stories, more than the grammar....) Weaknesses: grammar concepts still are slightly confusing and not clear-cut; not sure how useful such a detailed grasp on grammar is because people don't really pay that much attention to it in conversation; conversation partners bit of the homework was not helpful"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a serious L5 credit and want to continue to study Spanish at Yale. This is not a gut class. Definitely take this course with Maria Pilar Asensio. She is fantastic and is much more understanding in terms of grading.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who placed into L5 but still feels that there are some gaps in her knowledge or that she has to avoid useful grammatical structures in conversation. This course builds confidence in speaking and writing and is a great way to bridge the gap of high school Spanish to college level literature courses.",
    "A non-trivial amount of work but generally graded quite leniently and my section was small, so profesora was really flexible and understanding. Won't do much for your speaking or comprehension but I feel more confident writing after this class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you really want to get into the nitty gritty grammar rules and are prepared to do a lot of work, and if you want a nicely structured class that meets more often. It's definitely a good class to take after L4 and focuses more on the language itself, which may be dry, but the literature\/film content is excellent."
