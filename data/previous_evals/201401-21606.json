   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Decent class, but there are probably other more interesting classes to take at Yale.",
    "nope. Particularly if you're not a comp sci person, this class is more difficult than people make it sound in the reviews.",
    "I learned a lot about social networks in this class. Prof. Erikson is extremely talented and eager to help outside of class, but often times class discussions were a little slow and we didn't learn as much as we could have. Part of this was that it was at 9 AM, but I think Prof. Erikson could have been more energetic. That said, I learned so much and the final project was very fun to do.",
    "I would take this class if you are confident that you can pay attention and understand the readings.",
    "Great class, great discussions, straightforward weekly work, and a fun final project (if you start early enough). Highly recommended for anyone!",
    "Highly recommended as a pretty chill course. SOCY 167 is a very cool, and the subject matter is from a pretty new field of research. If you pick the right final project you will have a whole lot of fun learning fascinating patterns in how people interact.",
    "As a soc major, I was a little bit behind when it came to using pajek or understanding network analysis and it felt like the class was heavy compsci or computer-savy majors. It made things a little uncomfortable but in the end, I think it was a good challenge for me. It's not your typical sociology course so be prepared for something relatively unfamiliar if you're not used to using pajek.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in using quantitative measures in social research. It is pretty easy, and I expect that it will improve as a course overall soon.",
    "Yes, a very interesting class. I gained a broader understanding of network analysis and an interesting perspective on the influence of networks on outside factors."
