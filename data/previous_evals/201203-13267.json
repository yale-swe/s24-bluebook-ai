    "Interesting class on the basics of biomaterials. Not too much work, tests were all fair, and the material all ties together nicely by the end of the class. It definitely helps to have at least a basic biology and chemistry background. Overall, I would recommend the class.",
    "Good solid course for any engineering major, with pertinent applications in clinical care. Workload is not bad, and the material is really interesting!",
    "This a great survey course about modern materials and their properties and how they are used in the field. Take this course if you want to know the challenges that many face in the biomaterial and tissue engineering field. It's a great course, well taught, and the test and homework is reasonable and informative.",
    "Not too difficult a class, but make sure you take good lecture notes to do well. There's only 3 problem sets the entire semester, and they're pretty easy. The midterms were fair, and the final was long, but not terribly hard.",
    "434 is a really good course. The material is pretty interesting and definitely relevant to stuff you'll encounter in other courses, and Professor Gonzalez is one of the nicest professors ever (she brings candy\/cupcakes to the review sessions!). The workload isn't too bad-- 3 homework assignments, 2 midterms and a final, as well as a pretty short presentation-- all of which the expectations are clear for and are fair. BME undergrads-- definitely a worthwhile elective!",
    "Good course that covers a bunch of applications",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in getting a brief overview into the field of biomechanics.",
    "Biomaterials is an elective that fits pretty well into the mechanics and molecular track of BME. The class is pretty chill, and only has three big problem sets throughout the semester, which is nice. If you catch up on the reading once in a while, the class will make much more sense. Some of the lectures are kind of confusing, but it usually makes sense after the psets\/after you cram for the exams. The exams aren't awful, but definitely require looking over all the notes\/psets.",
    "Although I'm not a BME major, I feel like this course is essential to anyone looking to good to grad school in BME or interested in building medical devices in the future. The course material was incredibly practical and centered around real-life biomaterials and their everyday applications. I'd also recommend this to people interested in going to med school and pursuing a surgical field. Knowing so much about various implants and other devices would almost certainly be helpful for this.",
    "This is a pretty good course and a good elective if you are a BME major. The professor is very nice and helpful and she shows a genuine desire for you to learn, rather than trying to trip you up and make it hard for you. I would definitely recommend this class."
