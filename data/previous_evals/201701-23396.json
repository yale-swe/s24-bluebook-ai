   "comments": [
    "Very contemporary. At times too technical.",
    "Poorly structured course with weird tangents during lecture. Was constantly unclear about assignments and expectations. While we did cover a wide range of topics, we did very little to cover the chemical effects of toxicology\/what was promised in the class description.",
    "This course brought a number of very interesting guest speakers, and the majority of the course was taught through guest lecturing. However, this was also a weakness of the course because it meant that there was very little continuity from one class to the next. Although we repeatedly heard we were learning the public-health toxicology of the future, it felt like we did not learn the tools being used by the guest lecturers, for example. I would recommend having more in-depth instruction with databases and online tools. I think a strength of the course was in its emphasis on applied concepts of toxicology, and the relevance of toxicology and risk assessment type of decision-making for the public health practitioner. But again, we didn't necessarily have the opportunity to practice these skills during the class, and so I'm left feeling like I have a little bit of knowledge about a lot of different things, but cannot actually do any of them.",
    "like \"TED\" talk, can know a lot of toxic knowledge; but a little bit lack of logic",
    "great class. Professor also invited some important speakers to help us better understanding toxicology.",
    "The course felt a bit like a speaker series but all of the speakers were really interesting",
    "LOVED all the experts from various agencies the professor invited. That said, I feel like I know very little about the biochemical aspects of toxicology. I wish we'd learned more about those mechanisms in the body.",
    "The guest lecturers were very interesting. The course felt a bit disorganized, but the information was interesting. It was strange to have all of the work backloaded at the end of the semester.",
    "The course aimed to provide students with a strong background and understanding of toxicology and its role in public health. The interactive discussions and guest lectures were definitely indicative of that mission. However, there was definitely some room for more engaging in the classroom. Maybe assign students one presentation during a Friday discussion to help discussion.",
    "This course needs to be improved significantly. I do not feel like I learned any toxicology really. The parade of experts who came in and gave separate lectures left me feeling like the course is very disjointed and unorganized. I understand that it was supposed to show us new topics \/ discussions in the field of toxicology, but it felt very random. I wish the first couple lectures had been slowed down a bunch and that there were fewer guests. Would only recommend this course if needed, do not take as elective. Also, the discussion sections should be redesigned to include student discussion, not lectures.",
    "I think this is a very good overview for public health toxicology and the latest science informing the field. I think sometimes the balance tipped more to the science than the public health issues per se, but overall all relevant topics were covered well.",
    "I think it's important for the instructor to keep in mind that this course is not just for environmental health students and that there were other MPH students in the class, therefore the class has to be tailored not only to EHS students but all MPH students.",
    "From word of mouth, this new toxicology class was much better than the old toxicology class taught by the former professor, Dr. Borak. This tox class was taught according to Toxicology in the 21st Century as opposed to old school tox. Because of this, I learned a lot of relevant topics and thoroughly enjoyed the course. The various guest lecturers throughout the semester were also very insightful and had a breadth of knowledge.",
    "I liked the discussion topics better as they were interesting and challenging to think about. I wish the discussions were better lead\/facilitated amongst the students more.",
    "I really liked Professor Vasilou, he was a great lecturer. I did feel that the course was a bit disjointed because we had so many different lecturers, and there was not necessarily a flow between topics. This class was also heavily weighted towards the end of the semester with both a final paper and test, and no midterm or interim assignments. It would have been better to actually have more assignments, like small writing assignments and maybe a midterm, in my opinion.",
    "good, provided basic knowledge about toxicology and latest research as well.",
    "This course was deplorable. I left learning absolutely nothing of value to my work as a public health practitioner. Lectures were disorganized and uninteresting. The fact that this is course is required for those unable to take the other EHS core course is an outrage."

    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Vasilis really cares about the subject material, and his enthusiasm for the course is refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Dr. Vasiliou is an amazing professor. He is very in touch with his students, encourages participation, and cares about providing a quality class that is relevant to how to field will progress. He used his connections to bring in many high-profile speakers, proving students with a unique look into toxicology being conducted right now. If I were to give Dr. Vasiliou a grade, it would be an A+.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Enthusiastic and interested in teaching. I was very happy.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Went on many strange tangents that often didn't make sense given the material. Very passionate.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Dr. Vasiliou was very enthusiastic and is extremely knowledgeable about all things toxicology.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Excellent and professional",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Great teach!",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0So enthusiastic! He inspired me to become interested in subjects that I had never cared about before.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Vasilis was very passionate and knowledgeable about tox. He was sometimes hard to understand. Overall, he was a great professor and I loved his class.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0He was always kind and encouraging. My one piece of constructive criticism: He kept talking about the prestige and position of each speaker he invited in a way that I found really alienating. I know people suffering from exposures to environmental toxicants who don't have access to the resources to discover or eliminate those exposures specifically because they don't have that same kind of power, prestige, and access to people in high-ranking positions at various agencies. I wish that Yale were less focused on drawing power, money, and prestige to itself than on helping those people. I did love the speakers, though!",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Professor Vasiliou is enthusiastic but can be disorganized in his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Dr. Vasiliou is definitely interested in having students learn. He's more concerned with grabbing your interests in the topic rather than fostering a typical environment in the classroom with exams and an overwhelming amount of assignments. I would gladly take another class with him as he's one of the few professors I've met in my life who is interested in having student's learn and promote curiosity above all else.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0He clearly cares a lot, but he was slow to respond to email. He is a good lecturer and I did learn a lot from him. And, he knows a lot about toxicology. But, would recommend re-designing the course to have more small assessments or assignments throughout the semester as well as fewer guest lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Great job! Very passionate about the course and has done so much work putting it together.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Very unclear in terms of what was required for the course and not very good at lecturing.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Dr. Vasiliou is a wonderful professor and mentor! He is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to toxicology. I enjoyed his engaging teaching style. He deeply cares about the well-being of his students and wants them to succeed even upon graduation from YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0He was a great, energetic lecturer who was very passionate about the topic.",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Vasilis Vasiliou \u00a0Professor Vasiliou was not an effective instructor for the course. He was unable to put together a cohesive set of lectures with the appropriate level of detail contained within lecture slides. When it came time to study for the final, he was unable to describe what material would be tested, and was late in posting study materials for the exam. There was no student engagement or feedback whatsoever over the course of the semester."

    "Take this class!",
    "Take this class. As a PhD student from environmental engineering, it was a broadening experience where I gained significant insight into how toxicology connects in with the world we live in today. Dr. Vasiliou is on top of designing this class, and he does all he can to ensure the class is a good experience.",
    "Contemporary, practical, up to date. I would recommend this course.",
    "Class was not what I expected and had little to do with the chemical aspects of toxicology. Confusing class at times, strange tangents, unclear on expectations... Would not take if I had the option.",
    "This course is focused on big picture ideas in toxicology and risk assessment. You will hear from a number of very interesting and extremely accomplished people, but may feel like you leave the course without a concrete set of tools to carry out the work of, for instance, risk assessment or health impact assessments. It is not a traditional toxicology class, so if you are looking for chemistry, look elsewhere.",
    "YES",
    "recommended",
    "It was a survey class of the harmful chemicals in a variety of areas in the environment. Really interesting and informative and a lot of opportunities to network within the field.",
    "Yes, mostly because it's SO little work and because we got to meet such great speakers.",
    "Toxicology was a course geared towards individuals who are curious and interested in the field as it pertains to public health. Definitely a course where you can see all disciplines come together from microbiology to chronic disease. If you enjoy learning and asking questions with a professor who is well versed in the subject as well as guest lecturers, then I definitely would recommend the course.",
    "Did not like the participation requirement.",
    "Would not recommend if not required. There need to be more evaluations \/ assignments, otherwise you have no incentive to learn until the end of the semester. Also, you will struggle if you're a non-STEM major.",
    "Would recommend for those with interest in public health effects and impacts of chemicals, heavy metals, and other environmental pollutants.",
    "Overall the class was fine, not much of a burden in terms of workload but overall extremely boring and I do not feel like I learned that much.",
    "I would recommend, with the hope that some aspects of the class structure change.",
    "Do not take this course unless you are required to."
