    "Yes, definitely!",
    "This is a good course, and very easy. Unfortunately, most people in class don't care about it and are just doing work for other classes or checking their email, which is super depressing if you're actually engaged. Also nobody seems to read the Shakespeare plays that correspond to the movies.",
    "Yes, interesting way to think about Shakespeare",
    "YES. Fun, not too much work. If you think that watching Shakespeare movies and talking about them is something you'll enjoy, you will be a happy camper.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes take this course! It's so fun and you get to read Shakespeare's plays and watch movies!",
    "this was such an amazing senior seminar! we watched a different shakespeare film each week and then had great class discussions. I've never had such a fun class\/home work assignments and as an english major who had never studied shakespeare films before it was such an interesting way of analyzing shakespeare and it was really academically rewarding as well as being entertaining! professor walsh is also so great! he's a lot of fun and a great seminar leader! definitely was one of my favorite classes at yale!",
    "I would definitely advise anyone to take this class as a pre-1800. Maybe not a great senior seminar for someone looking for something a little more rigorous, but a fun extra class if you take it on the junior track.",
    "absolutely. prof walsh is great and the films are lots of fun to watch",
    "Take this class if you like Shakespeare or Film. Lots of fun."
