    "If you are interested in the field you have to take it ! Raul is awesome always super friendly and reachable and the discussion was always just at a very high level. Even if you are not into the whole East Asian thing great class to see a different perspective from the same old problems..",
    "This course was a much-needed addition to the almost exclusively Western, and generally very traditional and conservative offerings of the Yale Philosophy curriculum. I would recommend this course to junior and senior philosophy students or anyone who's had a solid introduction to metaphysics and is interested in paraconsistent logics or learning more about Eastern schools of thought from a rigorously metaphysical and logical perspective. The emphasis was on metaphysics more than logic.",
    "An interesting seminar. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a big fan of seminars in general, but this one struck a good balance between Raul presenting material and discussing the ideas with us; it helped that there were only 6 students. Eastern philosophyis different, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I took a course in it. Still, despite the fact that we analyzed it in a rather rigorous way, the material and the course did feel unstructured at times, so be prepared for that if you're looking at this course in particular. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at Raul for another course, I would recommend him\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very approachable."
