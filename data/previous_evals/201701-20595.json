    "I came out of this course feeling unexpectedly enlightened. On some level we all know a decent amount about how precious water is to life, but actually looking deeper the way we did in this course made me so much more conscious of how important this topic is. I developed a greater ability to comb through science papers, to investigate further into things I don't understand at first glance, and I definitely developed a curiosity for how the essential resources to life effect society.",
    "I learned how to read science papers in a way that makes me better understand them. I also learned how to present for an hour and fifteen minutes and gained the confidence to do that.",
    "I learned how to better analyze scientific papers (as well as skim for key information). In addition, I also gained a broad understanding of water's role in various parts of the natural world.",
    "I'd say this class is just a really great overview of a lot of current scientific issues. We talked about a wide range of topics, everything from exoplanets to climate change. I admit that I was kind of skeptical about taking this class because I haven't enjoyed science classes in the past, but I really enjoyed this one! It was actually one of my favorite classes this semester and I ended up feeling like I learned so much about very relevant scientific topics.",
    "We studied water's relation to a wide range of concepts, including pollution, conservation, scarcity, exoplanets, and energy. The class material was very engaging and intellectually cultivating."

   "comments": [
    "I really loved the student-led portion of this class. We came out of the course having bonded in a way I never could have expected for a 9am science credit mostly taken by seniors, but the collective project of understanding how far out this topic reaches into our lives and the universe was one that brought us together, and that kind of learning environment is really difficult to develop, which is what made this course special. The assignments were fair but rigorous, the coursework was made as relevant as possible to everyone in the course, and the structure of the course was really conducive to learning.",
    "I don't think that this course has any weaknesses. I really like how balanced it was with Professor Lee presenting and students presenting. Also all the papers were very interesting and I liked how the reading responses forced the students to read them critically.",
    "The Tuesday lectures were interesting and engaging. I typically learned a lot from these lectures, especially about topics I had never heard of and might not directly take to water (i.e. Doppler redshift!). I thought the Thursday presentations were sometimes repetitive, especially if the papers that week were not particularly difficult. However, I did understand those topics more in depth after presentations. Perhaps this complaint is because some of the presentations were not very well executed.",
    "I'd say this is a great course if you want a more intimate, seminar style science class. There aren't any tests, but each week you have to read a couple of papers and write a response on them. You also have to choose a topic and give a presentation on it and write a research paper. I personally found this format to be really helpful. It lowered the stress of the class, but I still feel like I was able to think critically about the material and learn so much from it.",
    "The course is very well thought, and the material is fully relevant to today's most important global problems. For those of you looking for a science credit, take this intellectually challenging and yet fun class. For those of you who are focused on the content, I can assure you that you will get a lot out of the class if you put some effort and join the discussions."

    "Honestly everyone should take this course. I came across it very last minute and found it to be surprisingly enlightening. Honestly I came in as a non-science major second semester senior in need of that last distributional credit, and Kanani blew me away with her intellect and warmth. Not only is she a wonderful person, this is the best structured course I've ever taken at Yale. Having your peers present on the topics you're reading about forces you to really listen and respect one another's work, and in turn gets you really engaged in the material. The grading is really fair, the material is SO important, and at least from my year taking it, the people who are interested in this topic are pretty rad and interesting in their own right. So yeah, take it. It's worth it, trust me.",
    "Yes, great science credit, or regular credit if you just are interesting in the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who needs a science credit! Professor Lee does a good job engaging the class during lectures and making sure that all sub-topics are covered before delving into more complicated topics. However, if you are a STEM person like me, keep in mind that the work for this class was entirely writing (weekly reading responses and a final essay). I didn't think about this going in, but by the end I would have loved to do some math or some calculations haha. Would recommend if that's the type of course you're looking for. We also read some very interesting scientific papers each week.",
    "I highly recommend this as a science credit! You'll learn so much, but the format of the class makes it all quite low-stress and very engaging. The seminar style and the student presentations really makes the class feel like you are there to learn the material and discuss it, rather than focusing on memorizing it for a test. Also, as long as you stay on top of the weekly responses, the workload is super manageable. And you really get a lot of leeway to do what you find interesting, especially with the final paper.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Lee is an amazing lecturer. The material covers some of today's most important topics including water scarcity, (renewable) energy and global warming."
