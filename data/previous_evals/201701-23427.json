    "Strengths were the hands-on type of experience. Weakness was the difficulty in getting 100 hours and getting context at Practicum site.",
    "Amazing opportunity could benefit from better structure This course has been a key component of my learning at YSPH",
    "I loved practicum. I had a great placement and I liked out meeting times.",
    "Great practical experience.",
    "Strengths: depending on the projects\/location, could be a rewarding experience Weaknesses: variability in practicum location led to a spectrum of experiences, ranging from very positive to very negative. Overall, it was good exposure to Yale Health but I didn't learn much more in the field relative to what I would've learned in a class.",

    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Very receptive to student feedback. Very nice guy and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Marty did a great job of stepping up to teach this course, He encouraged student feedback and tried to make our meetings relevant to our projects.",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Good!",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Could coordinate meetings throughout the semester a little better.",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Course needs to be more organized with dates\/sessions clearly laid out. It felt like every in-person meeting had to be re-scheduled due to conflicts. Also, 3 minutes to present the final projects is way too short. Felt repetitive and half of the class had left by the end of the presentations.",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Dr. Klein is amazing and a pleasure to learn from, his patience and engagement were well appreciated",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Very helpful and great communicator. Always available for questions, although the course was mainly handled by the student's preceptor.",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0Marty was very flexible and clearly wanted to create a supportive and engaging environment for the practicum students. my only suggestion is that the final presentation session be organized differently, i.e. maybe instead of sequential presentations that are very short, projects are instead grouped in some ways and those smaller breakouts could go more in depth",
    "Instructor: Martin Klein \u00a0The communication and coordination of this class left a lot of room for improvement. I'm not sure what Dr. Klein did for this class. I wouldn't call what I saw \"instructing\"."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if the student really wanted hands-on experience and was aware of the time commitment.",

    "I would recommend this if you really want to apply your work to the field or pick up a new practical skillset.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student, especially if you have 2+ years of work experience. Unless you do not have healthcare experience and are trying to gain more experience, then perhaps this class may be useful.",
    "Good course if you have a good practicum - suggest pushing outside of Yale\/YNHH boundaries. Should really plan on the meetings at beginning of semester to minimzie who needs to miss them for scheduling conflicts",
    "the practicum is worthwhile if you will be able to spend 8-10 hours per week (and sometimes much more) working with your client organization."
