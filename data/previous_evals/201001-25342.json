   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. Really interesting, engaging, a great way to start your theater studies at Yale. Awesome community of fellow theater people too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Take this class. Especially if you're a freshman interested in theater, because it is a great way to connect with other theater studies students, and the material gives you a great background to understanding drama. It's also a great way to improve your reading skills and to work on close readings and analysis. So much fun, it's definitely worth it.",
    "This semester of Theater has been so interesting. The plays we have read have been varied and so fascinating. The lectures also touched on a lot of contemporary issues close to Yale. I really enjoyed this semester. I wish that there had been a little more opportunity for performance but overall this course was very enjoyable. It's worth taking whether you are a prospective Theater major or not. This semester was definitively better than 110 in the fall semester so stick with it!",
    "I took THST111 as a follow-up to THST110, and it is the same course except with a focus on post-1700 works, more from America and Europe than around the world. It gives a less broad array of performance styles, but at the same time is more in-depth about the factors that play into modern Western views of the theater. I wholeheartedly recommend it to people interested in being knowledgeable about theater in general, and to people considering the major.",
    "I would recommend if for all theatre\/literature\/english types. It really is great to see many major artistic and cultural movements from a theatrical perspective.",
    "If you really want to learn theater history, this is the way to do it in a year. But if you're not that interested, look at some other classes. This one's just a lot of reading.",
    "Definitely; not just a major requirement, but an interesting survey of theatre history, theory, literature, and performance that really changed a lot about how I watch and create theater.",
    "You will leave this class being able to discuss theatre in a much more intelligent manner. Take it.",
    "I mean, if you're taking this class, it's PROBABLY because you either want to major in theater or you want to take more advanced theater courses. SO, anything I say probably won't have THAT much of an effect on your decision to take it or not to take it. I'll say that the second semester course was (in many ways, not all) better than the first semester version. Second semester, each unit built on the previous one (whereas we jumped all over the world in the first half). The readings are interesting and important (especially if you want to go into theater). It exposes you to a lot of theory (some of which you might not really WANTto be exposed to) and definitely broadens your conception of \"theater.\" I liked the cohesion. Overall, I would say it was a good course and was worth taking (especially if you want to continue with theater studies, because you HAVE to take it).",
    "Survey of theatre literature, history, and theory--tons of reading but its worth it. You approach the theatre from many sides, and it's just a really fun class.",
    "This course is good for learning the basic artistic movements that have defined theatrical explorations throughout history. I enjoyed reading the different plays and essays that show how they fit into the movements we were studying. I'd certainly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about theatrical history, and of course (since it's a requirement) for anyone interested in the major.",
    "Yes definitely as long as you know you're interested in theatre. I think if you're not it can get a little dull. I found it very interestingbecause as an aspiring actor it's so important to know these great works of theatre. It's really a great prerequisite",
    "If you plan on taking acting classes, you have to take this class. Otherwise, only take this class if you're very interested in both theater and history. Some of the plays are interesting, some are difficult, and lectures can be boring at times. However, completing the course is rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I even recommended it to a non-theater major and she enjoyed it.",
    "I do not plan to become a Theater Studies major, and will probably end up as only an occasional actor. However, taking this course expanded my theatrical knowledge extensively, and this was possibly one of the best lecture courses I've taken at Yale. Professor McGinley is an excellent lecturer, and the teaching fellows very enthusiastic about their subject matter.",
    "This course is required as a pre-req for certain other Theatre Studies courses - in that way, I would recommend this course to students interested in taking acting classes, etc. Because you have to. Other students who are simply interested in a broad survey of theatre history would enjoy this class. However, I sincerely hope that the course is reorganized and restructured soon.",
    "Tremendously effective and worthwhile not only as the pre-req for the Theater Studies major, but also as an artistic and historical education. After the course, I feel much more able to discuss student and professional work through the lens of dramatic precedent. Some of the more modern plays studied in 111 are rather difficult to trudge through, but these are more than made up for by the real masterpieces that you'd be reading for enjoyment anyway.Since Paige McGinley is on break next year, the professor is up in the air, so be mindful that the replacement could make or break this course. If at all possible, try Miriam or Jacob as TAs; I found them both to be phenomenal."
