   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of knowledge about bird anatomy, behavior, and ornament. I also surprisingly gained a lot of insight into experimental evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned a lot of obscure information about birds that I will never be able to use, but which will be interesting to whip out at parties. I learned a lot of cool things about birds, and really enjoyed going on one of the three birding field trips.",
    "This class is amazing and I learned so much about birds.",
    "I learned various different topics relating to the study of birds (breeding systems, mating, anatomy), but more broadly about evolutionary biology and ecology.",
    "This course provides a good insight in how birds function and many of the unique characteristics of birds as a whole. It's interesting and you learn a lot about the way birds' bodies function.",
    "Ornithology taught me a copious amount of information about bird biology; by the end of the course I felt as if I had a real grasp on the material being covered. We covered a plethora of topics, each of which retained my interest.",
    "So much fascinating information about birds, evolution, and ecology in general.",
    "I learned everything I never knew I needed to know about birds! Seriously amazing stuff!",
    "I gained a heightened awareness and appreciation of the vast diversity of the bird world.",
    "I learned a lot about birds!! I knew almost nothing and now I feel like I definitely have a good grasp on major topics in ornithology which is pretty cool. I also have now written a science lit review, which I never had before so I have some familiarity with that form.",
    "So much about birds. More than any human needs, and most humans want, to know. But also, some valuable insight into animals, nature, beauty, and life, which involve but also transcend the avian aspect of things.",
    "I know a lot more about birds! I came in knowing a lot about a specific group of birds and came out with broad general knowledge.",
    "I learnt all about birds I could ever hope to! This class really helped satisfy a long-standing love of ornithology that I had never been able to fulfill until now. I learnt a lot of different ways of thinking about evolutionary biology, and how different concepts from physics, chemistry, physiology, and behvioural science apply to the study of avian biology.",
    "I was at first going to write that this course taught me a ton about birds with the caveat that that knowledge was wholly confined to birds, but I actually don't think that's true. Birds seeped into my essays for three other classes, covering topics from classical Japanese literature to contemporary world cinema. I found the last unit of the course (on sexual selection and sexual autonomy) to be especially applicable to many broader topics, and those were the lectures that interested me the most.",
    "I learned SO MUCH about birds, even though I already knew a lot.",
    "I learned a lot about birds, about things I never knew I never knew. I think most importantly this class taught me how to approach scientific papers and analysis. The final paper was helpful for that, if somewhat challenging.",
    "I took it as a science credit. It is a great class even though science credits are always a wash. I know a lot more about birds now than I ever anticipated, especially about bird aesthetics.",
    "I'm a humanities major, so I spend most of my time at school studying human artistic and intellectual endeavors. Little did I expect that taking ornithology would change the way I thought about everything from sexual autonomy to the definition of beauty! Taking this class taught me that humans are not the only creatures who make cognitive and creative choices.",
    "I learned about a wide breadth of topics relate to birds--much greater than I was expecting when I signed up for the course. Professor Prum's approach is very multidisciplinary, touching at times topics physics and chemistry to paleontology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are by far the biggest strength, as Professor Prum's energy is astounding. It was a joy to show up to class three times a week. The only weakness is that the final paper is somewhat unguided. I would have preferred checkpoints throughout the semester.",
    "The powerpoints should be re-structured to be easier to follow which information is important. A lot of info was dumped on us without any sort of clarification or elaboration, so it was unclear what we needed to know for exams. As someone without a background in the physical sciences, there were things I was not familiar with that were never elaborated on.",
    "The lectures are incredible and I loved them. The tests are hard but fair, but I wish they were slightly shorter so I had enough time to complete them.",
    "The course material is interesting but I think that the scientific terms and explanations in it could be explained a bit better, considering that many of the students in the course have a more solid understanding of the themesI found myself doing a lot of outside learning just to keep up.",
    "The course's strengths are numerous: the material is fascinating, Prum is a superb lecturer, and the pacing is excellent. These strengths did not, however, make up for what I saw as a major disadvantage to the course: a grading regimen that was as pedantic as it was arbitrary. I studied hours for each midterm, only to receive low grades on each that reflected an absurdly stringent grading criteria. (Cases in point: docked two points for giving the *textbook definition* of a term; docked five points for \"not answering\" a non-existent part of an exam questions; docked a single point for not including the word \"migratory\" in a paragraph for which the word was not needed. I compared my scores with those of my classmates, and noticed that my exams seem to have been disproportionately docked. Nonetheless, there were numerous students whose scores were worse than mine.",
    "The course centered around Professor Prum's lectures and this was a major strength -- his lectures were fantastic and it was always a joy to come to class.",
    "The strengths include lectures that go into a great deal of detail about birds in an exciting way. One possible improvement could be to include more details in the lectures as sometimes it was necessary to review notes or the internet when going over the slides.",
    "I think it was a slightly tough adjustment coming from a non-STEM background, so the midterms took me kind of by surprise in the rote memorization aspect and in how harshly they were graded. That being said the lectures were extremely engaging, which was great.",
    "Prum is a great lecturer, and has this course down to a science. I wish there were better mechanisms in place by which to better regulate the cram-style learning this class seems most conducive to. I would spend a week before each test learning all the information from the whole class, and in between tests felt like I was retaining nothing. Maybe more review in the class itself, or changing the system with the powerpoints (i.e. posting them earlier to give people chance to review in-between each test) would help with this issue.",
    "The lectures were engaging. They could be improved by briefly outlining the topic of the day at the beginning - that would give a framework for each lecture to fit within.",
    "Strengths - wonderfully structured, and covers a remarkable variety of topics in avian evolution and biology. Not too much work, and taught by a wonderful, wonderful professor! Richard Prum is awesome. :) Weaknesses - honestly, I feel like weekly homework would have helped me learn things better for the exams. But no major weaknesses as far as I can tell!",
    "Professor Prum was what made this course; I can't imagine anyone else teaching it. That said, his main weakness was sometimes omitting -- or assuming we could deduce -- the big picture.",
    "Professor Prum is a brilliant researcher and also makes the time to meet with students to answer questions or provide advice. He's an engaging lecturer. The class moves through material at a fast pace.",
    "This course had no weaknesses. Its strengths were its broad span, its very reasonable exams and paper assignment, and its absolutely fascinating content. No prior knowledge of the content was required, and any content that drew on concepts from physics, biology, or chemistry was explained to an extent that rendered prior knowledge of these subjects unnecessary. Every lecture presented fascinating material, and I came away from every single one feeling like I had learned something profound.",
    "This course is very well taught. Professor Prum is clearly an expert in his field and is passionate about the subject. Tests are thorough, but not unfair. I think the best way to improve the course would be to have an example paper that students unfamiliar with scientific papers could look at as an example. The Auk is helpful, but only to a degree.",
    "I think that the powerpoints were not that helpful in preparing for the tests. Sometimes there would be small things on the powerpoints that were later made questions on the tests. However, I do not know if this is a characteristic of stem classes. I found the course fairly challenging to follow, but it the professor is willing to explain. The most helpful thing in the class is to make friends with someone in the lab and study with them. The textbook is not helpful because all the the studies are so recent. I also didn't know who the TAs were.",
    "The strengths are the teaching, the material, and the format. Emphasis on the teaching! The weaknesses were very few--I wish there had been a more clear TA system (we didn't have them for the first few weeks, and we were never introduced and there were never TA office hours we could go to). I also wish that there had been more information given about the first test, as the professor was a little too rigid about not explaining what kind of information would be useful to know. I also think the TA grading was slightly inconsistent (sometimes the critiques of our answers included information not covered in the course)."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend Ornithology to anyone with a passing interest in birds or wildlife in general. Take this course for Professor Prum, who is entertaining, kind, and very knowledgable. The lectures are at 9:25 AM near the SOM, so keep that in mind. The workload is very low (i.e., zero assignments) until the final paper.",
    "No, I would not recommend this class. Professor Prum is clearly an expert in the field, and is a really nice man, but the lecture style made it difficult to absorb information and study for the exams. The exams asked for a high level of detail, and the powerpoints and lectures did not always emphasize the parts that were actually important. If you had to miss a lecture for whatever reason, there was no way to catch up what you missed from the powerpoints posted. You also have to write a term paper about a topic of your choice, so it helps if you're passionate about science and thinking about birds from a science point of view (rather than just thinking they're cool animals).",
    "100% YES this class is incredible. It is not a gut, so be prepared to work at the end of the semester but I can not recommend this course enough. Take it without a doubt.",
    "Only take this class if you are really ready to dive into birds. Prum is a great lecturer but if you're not super invested, it can come to be a drag. If you're a bird fanatic or detail-oriented humanities major, this is the class for you but otherwise, it could be tough. Learning how feathers grow can get a bit tedious... Good class but not easy!!",
    "I would recommend this if you have a good understanding of basic biology first, which would allow you to grasp a lot the concepts. Prof. Prum makes the lectures interesting but I do not believe he explains things in the most simple wayswhich was a big challenge for me. I liked the material but really grasping it was difficult. A good science credit if you're up for rigorous exams.",
    "No. The material is excellent, but do not put yourself in a position where you will be penalized for pedantic reasons.",
    "Absolutely. This course was a phenomenal experience from start to finish, with very engaging lectures and material. Recommended for everyone.",
    "Yes. This class was great",
    "Yes I would without a doubt recommend this course. It'll make you look at birds and the world completely differently. This is one of those extremely rare opportunities you get at Yale where the professor teaching you the material is also one of the most brilliant minds of the field. It was really fascinating being, as a student in this course, one of the first people to learn about Prof. Prum's newest ideas on avian evolution.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures are fascinating, the professor is engaging, and the workload is definitely manageable. Even if birds aren't necessarily your thing, you are bound to come across many topics that resonant and surprise you.",
    "E&EB is a wonderful class--if you are interested in birds. I am interested in birds. I had fun. But the first 2\/3 of the class would dry out anyone not fascinated by the subject matter (whereas the last 1\/3 was, I suspect, almost universally compelling). Because the readings are optional, you might be fooled into thinking that this is a gut. This is not a gut. The 3 exams are challenging and require substantial review. The final paper is a doozy--a quite rewarding doozy, provided you begin early enough. But I felt I got out what I put in to the class, and I am armed with an arsenal of bird jokes that will surely be deployed on unwitting cocktail party guests, that is, once I get invited to a cocktail party. Here's an example: Me: What drinks are served at duck cock(tail) parties? Well-Adjusted Other Person: What? Me: Corkscrews! *quacking in the distance*",
    "This was a fascinating class! I came into fairly neutral\/apathetic about birds, but Professor Prum has definitely moved me firmly into the pro-bird camp. Most of the material is super interesting, especially once you get through the physiology and molecular stuff (imo) and move onto all of the diverse and interesting bird behavior topics.The workload is not too bad: 2 midterms, a final paper, and a final (which is basically a 3rd cumulative midterm). The paper was a challenge as someone who has never done any science writing before, but getting enough of a head start on it made it doable. Also, the midterms were graded pretty severely and I don't know what the curve is so I truly have no idea what my grade is going to be. Great class, though.",
    "Yes...and no. If you're a bird freak, by all means, take the course, you'll love it. I am not; I took it because Prum is a great lecturer, because it offers a glimpse into a lot of different kinds of science, and because sometimes the material was interesting for its own sake (a lot of the time it was not). I stand by those reasons. BUT THIS IS NOT A GUT. DO NOT TAKE IT FOR THE SCIENCE CREDIT. There definitely exist reasons to take this course if you're not a total bird freak, but that is not one of them. The last month or two, in which we talked about bird songs and Prum's wacko theory about beauty in nature were particularly revelatory. But beware: you will be miserable for exactly one week before each exam. Or maybe not. I was.",
    "YES!",
    "100% would recommend this class to anyone and everyone!!! Professor Prum is an absolutely amazing lecturer, and the class covers an absolute smorgasbord of exciting topics in avian biology: evolution, feathers, colours, physiology, flight, nesting and breeding, sexual reproduction, neurobiology, navigation, and so much more! If you are looking for a gut science credit, then be warned that this class is not a gut! But if you are willing to put in effort, this class will be an absolutely wonderful experience.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student -- but with the warning that it is not for someone who wants a gut science credit.",
    "yes",
    "I took this course as a freshman with little science experience and loved it. Prum's knowledge of and enthusiasm for the material is incredible. The workload comes in three big bursts. If you can stay on top of things, the class is manageable and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The lecture content was broad-ranging and intensely interesting. There were a lot of those \"aha\" moments where some natural phenomenon that you had observed many times before was finally explained, which feels amazing. Professor Prum is a very good lecturer, and the material is presented very clearly and explained well. The exams are fair and not too challenging, and the final paper gives a lot of flexibility. Take this class if you already love birds and want to learn more, or if you don't know much at all about birds and are ready to have your mind blown many times over.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was fun, engaging, and you learn a lot of really cool stuff! There's no homework, but you must, MUST take good notes and start reviewing them early on. Also, if you haven't written a scientific research paper before, that can be a little tricky, so start that early, and ask Professor Prum for help. I really loved this class, and if you have any interest in birds or dinosaurs, I'd recommend this class. Maybe take it Credit\/D so you can really just enjoy it, but it's worth taking.",
    "Take this class if you can! It is a chill science credit and the professor is funny and has a great sense of humor. However, this is not a gut. Study for a few days for the tests, but also be careful because the grading can be harsh.",
    "Take this course if you are a human being willing to accept that non-human life forms are capable of making creative choices. Actually, take this course if you are a human being. Everyone at Yale should take this course to learn that the planet is not about humans.",
    "Great course for EEB and non-EEB students alike. The tests are quite challenging, but it's worth the work."
