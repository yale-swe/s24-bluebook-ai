    "Assigned 50-100 lines every night to translate, go over them in class. Same every time, but it's nice to know exactly what to expect. In class we just read through what we'd translated, went over any syntax\/grammar points anyone had trouble with, and then talked about more literary things if there was time or they came up. Doesn't sound very exciting but it's really an enjoyable class and perfect for mid-level Homer. I came into it as a freshman with 2 years of Greek in high school, so I had more experience with Homer than the others but was more shaky on the grammar. It worked out perfectly for me though. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "You should definitely take this class. For the first time I really felt like my knowledge of Greek was paying off, and I got so much better at it in such little time. Professor LeVen is wonderful, and it's a pity she'll be away next year!",
    "The course title sums it up. You'll familiarize yourself with the homeric dialect, characteristics of oral and epic poetry, and have a great time doing it.",
    "This was a fun way to round off the introductory Greek sequence. Many of the rules you learned to follow while reading Attic Greek will be bent or replaced, but with a little perseverance, you'll catch on quickly. Homer is repetitive enough that you will notice yourself picking up speed as the semester goes on.",
    "Yes! It's Homer!"
