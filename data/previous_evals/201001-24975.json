    "Not enough can be said about the Experimental Techniques \/ Experimental Strategies in Cellular Biology laboratory sequence with Professor Wolenski. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to enroll in these courses, do not hesitate. Professor Wolenski is by far the best professor that I have had at Yale -- his ability to instruct students is exceptional, but more importantly, he truly cares about each and every one of his students. Overall an amazing experience.",
    "You should definitely try to take MCDB 345L along with MCDB 344L. It is a great way to fulfill the year long bio lab requirement for medical school in only one semester. The most independent work you will have to do is the scientific article presentation you will have to make at the beginning of the course, but afterwords most\/all work is done in lab. Wolenski is great and enthusiastic to teach. It is probably one of the best bio labs you can take here at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "MCDB 345 is essentially an extension of the first half of the semester. I came in thinking we would conduct individual experiments, but it's really more that the class as a whole conducts slightly more complicated experiment modules than what we did in 344.",
    "DEFINITELY. Take this! If you can!",
    "I loved this lab. The students walked away from it having learned a lot and appreciating the time spent in lab. I thought one of the most important learning experiences was going through the discussion papers and then presenting one on our own. Focusing on these presentations instead of on lab reports which are not helpful was a much better use of time and resources - and expanded our knowledge. I also love the fact that we got to go to a job lecture to see what a presentation is really supposed to be like. This course was certainly different than other lab courses, and I absolutely loved every difference. The mice dissection was a pretty amazing experience as well. Professor Wolenski is one of the best professors I have ever had. He certainly cares more about his students than any other. From joking around to feeding us and making us t-shirts, Professor Wolenski was everyone's favorite professor and friend. He was always available and really cared about what we learned, and yet he managed to teach us and allow us to have fun at the same time. Usually a professor is either fun or good, but Professor Wolenski manages to handle both sides perfectly and the class was a real learning experience while being entertaining.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students who are thinking about doing research in a biology lab. I took the course after I had already done a lot of research but wished I had taken it earlier in my Yale career because many of the things I learned in the course would have been very useful in lab. The course is not very time consuming as there is not much work outside of lab, but lab hours themselves are fairly long.",
    "This lab was cool for all the reasons that 344 was, but also because we got to work with plants! I thought that was really fun. They look awesome under the microscope - so different from other organisms! - and it was fun to study them for a change. If you are enthusiastic you will be greatly rewarded.",
    "This is one of the best labs one can take at Yale. While the time commitment seems overwhelming, the lab rarely goes all the way to 6:30 (this happened maybe 4 times) and there isn't a ton of work outside of lab. The experiment you'll do are real science, not busy work, and the Wolenski is one of the most enthusiastic, engaged, and caring professors I've ever encountered.",
    "I think you should take both 344L and 345L if possible so you can get to know Prof. Wolenski, the TAs, and your fellow students better. 345L wasn't that much different for me than 344, though I think the 344-only students didn't have to do a paper presentation (which was a good exercise to do)."
