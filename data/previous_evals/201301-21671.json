   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you are genuinely interested in learning about quantum physics and the Big Bang theory, without wanting to do all of the math. I learned a lot of very interesting things, and overall did enjoy the content of the course (despite some of the readings being a little confusing). Lectures, at 2 hours a sitting, would get boring, but were also not a huge time commitment given they were only once a week. PSETs are not too difficult-- just do the readings. No final exam-- a paper, instead.",
    "I would recommend reading about and studying quantum physics, but I am not sure that this lecture-formatted class is the best way to do that.",
    "Im sure that different people took this class for many different reasons. It seems like this class would make a decent gut, if thats what someone needed. However, I took it because I have a strong interest in modern physics, but don't really the appropriate math background (and it is not the quantitative side of physics that I am interested in anyways). From this perspective this class was good and bad.To start with the good -- the material is absolutely fascinating. It doesn't get much weirder that some of the conclusion of Quantum Mechanics or Relativity, but one is forced to live with them since they are, in fact, reality. The class is great simply in that you get to set aside a chunk of time in which to learn this material. And I reallydo feel like one can learn this material in an adequate way while mostly ignoring the math side.That being said, a lot of aspects of the class were frustrating. The lectures were all over the place, and I almost never came out of them feeling like I understood anything better. Professor Caines was decent, but Professor Harris, who lectured most of the time, was really really unclear. And they record attendance in lecture. Section is alright. My TA Clarke was pretty helpful, but still not as helpful as just doing the readings. Also the class is way up on Whitney which is a pain. The tests are doable, but a lot of the time I felt like they were unnecessarily tricky, and often unclear. They also sometimes included material that we never really covered. There are weekly homeworks which are kind of a pain because they take a long time, but I think they were useful to an extent because they made sure I was keeping up.So if you are like me and are interested in the material, then definitely take this class. However, expect to have to put up with some stuff. I would recommend just sucking it up, then really investing in the readings, which are the most rewarding part.",
    "Don't take it unless you HAVE TO. Try to find other science classes to fill your distributional requirements. The material is interesting, the class was bad.",
    "Don't take this. You can find a much better course to fulfill you Science credit. You're gonna leave this class without having gained any real knowledge. You might be able to spout a couple of terms to make it sounds like you know something, but you really won't learn anything. Waste of time. Painfully boring.",
    "Yikes, yikes, yikes... I regret taking this class. Very disorganized and random. And my TA was really bad at leading a section. Tests are badly worded and graded rather arbitrarily. Prof. Caines is slightly better than Prof. Harris, so if she teaches the course the next year, you might as well shop it. If Prof. Harris teaches it, then don't take it. If both of them teach together, then don't take it. I don't think it would be worth it.",
    "I would recommend Physics 120 to a student looking to understand the concepts of Quantum Mechanics. A very good science class for non-science majors.",
    "A bit more difficult in grading than anticipated. Gives good exposure to an interesting subject. Vision may be greater than what is able to be practically executed.",
    "This is a class torn between pop physics and the desire to provide a real conceptual background. It is fun at times, but often very boring and poorly managed.",
    "Don't take it. There has to be a better science credit for non-majors at Yale.",
    "I would not really recommend this class to most people. No math might sound enticing, but that means a lot of hazy concepts without really knowing what is the right answer. The format is a littledisconcerting and the lectures and section not that helpful. If you are really interested in quantum physics but not a science major, give it a shot. Otherwise, this is probably not the class for you.",
    "It's a science credit for non-science majors. There is nearly no math involved. There is, however, a lot of interesting reading. Sometimes, readings can be hard to follow since they cover obscure concepts, but they are generally quite enjoyable.",
    "This course will give you a basic understanding of modern physics topics such as the Big Bang, the Standard Model, and relativity. It's not too technical and there isn't much math, which makes it doable for a non-science major but means that your understanding will be somewhat superficial. The professors are accomplished scientists who are passionate about physics, but they aren't the greatest teachers and they are only somewhat interested in teaching the class. Don't expect this to be a gut, but if you put in the work, then you should be able to do well. Predictable workload, and nice to have a final paper rather than an exam. Overall, I give it a neutral recommendation.",
    "This course was deeply frustrating. Both professors did a poor job making the subject accessible, and Professor Harris in particular seemed out of it most of the time. The readings were for the most part appalling and were assembled in a pretty ramshackle fashion, and the curve is honestly not great either. Take Galaxies instead.",
    "No. Don't take it. Compared to the time put in, you're not even learning actual science.",
    "YES! If you want to be able to understand quantum physics on a basic level and be able to talk about it with other.",
    "This is a great class. I have been wanting to take it ever since freshman year, and it was exactly what I had hoped for and more. You get a great overview of quantum-mechanics and by the end of the course you will get the basics. I think it should be mandatory for everybody to understand at least these basics since it has such wide implications on our thinking about the world. I enjoyed the setting of this class in the TEAL classroom. This class is a fair amount of work though, due to the weekly reading questions. They take up more time than one might think. Even though they are mostly straight forward, they can be tricky as well. Also there is quizzes and then a final paper. You will enjoy it. The quizzes are good so that you actually memorize the information and the final paper is fun to write. Take this course, you will be grateful to have an understanding of this.",
    "I would only suggest this course to someone else if the class were smaller or if the discussion sessions were longer.",
    "This is an interesting and engaging course. It used to be a seminar and they attempt to create the intimate environment of a seminar in a lecture course with class polls and round table seating but it doesn't really work. I was also surprised by the work load. This course will definitely take a chunk of your time.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to earn a science credit and learn about some really amazing concepts.",
    "Pretty interesting topic, weekly homework can take some time but it is not hard and not absolutely necessary to read all the material. Exams and quizzes are not too bad if you prepare well for them.",
    "Underwhelming. If you were a nerdy child, you will know all of this already (black holes, Einstein). Otherwise you will come out with only a shallow knowledge of it. Fascinating subject matter but some of the most boring lectures I've had to attend. Some good readings, some readings from Wikipedia. Disorganized professors. Low to moderate workload.",
    "Never, like crack not even once. Not worth the credit, you don't learn anything because the professors are terrible. Just NO.",
    "Quantum Physics is a very unique science class. You explore a field that is still developing, which leaves a lot of room for questions and critical thinking. There's no math, and it's mostly conceptual, which was challenging yet rewarding.",
    "To say that this class was a joke would connote a certain joy and fun that couldn't have been further from the truth. My excitement at the prospect of studying such fascinating topics was quickly overtaken by my deep frustration at the poor teaching, lack of explanations, long and tedious homework assignments, and completely useless sections. If you are interested in putting in a lot of time in order to get credit for sitting through horrible lectures and doing some occasionally interesting but often bad reading (e.g., we were assigned a wikipedia article to read...), then maybe it is worth it.It is less work than most classes, but definitely more than other \"gutty\" science classes I've taken. While old reviews suggest otherwise, this was a BAD class!",
    "Wouldn't recommend it. Material is pretty interesting but the lectures are boring and disorganized and the assessments were often frustratingly ambiguous and unclear (with errors in them). Seemed like it was much better when it was a seminar. Wait for them to work out the kinks before taking it.",
    "It is a typical course for non-science majors, which means most of the students taking it are not necessarily very interested in the subject. On the other hand, even if you have very little background on physics, you will probably not feel like the course is too advanced. It requires almost no math and the homework assignments and tests are mostly conceptual. However, the assignments can take up a lot of time, and the questions on the homework are not always related to the reading, which means you need to look up concepts online in order to answer them. I personally found the in-class tests to be excessively long and not very efficient in assessing our understanding of the subject, as we had to answer the questions very quickly in order to be able to complete it. I would probably not recommend this course for another student, because even though the material did interest me from the beginning, I felt that the approach used to teach it made the learning experience much less enjoyable than it should have been.",
    "AWESOME material, the problem sets helped me study and didn't take too long, and the reading was never too much. Lecture was two whole hours, but only one day a week, pretty chill, and the TEAL learning center was great with all those TV screens to help us see and tables to help us engage with the ideas.",
    "This class is a great science credit because you do almost no math andlearn all the cutting-edge and interesting concepts of quantum physics. The reading is great (mostly Scientific American articles, etc.), but the classes themselves are totally disorganized. It's not clear what you need to learn from the reading each week, or what will be covered in quizzes. The final research paper at the end is also so open-ended that it's hard to know what exactly the professors \/ TAs are looking for. Weekly homeworks can be tough. Essentially, this is a class with excellent material and absurdly poor execution (so bad that sometimes it borders on the ridiculous).",
    "Quantum physics and beyond provides an interesting introduction to quantum mechanics, string theory and other current topics in physics. If you have always wanted to know what the Higgs Boson is than this is the class for you. That said, it is a fair amount of work (weekly homework sets that are pretty time consuming, 2 quizzes, a midterm and a final paper)."
