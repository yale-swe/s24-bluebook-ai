   "comments": [
    "People tend to zone out during lecture rather than paying attention because there is no workload or accountability. This class was more like a disjointed guest lecture series with mandatory attendance than a real class where we actually learned anything. The course should work to make students more engaged and accountable, e.g. through the design workshop which was very successful. Perhaps a small reading response prior to class would ensure that we are accountable for doing our readings.",
    "not engaging and very boring.",
    "Really learned a lot, and got me thinking, without putting pressure on me.",
    "The lectures for this seminar are usually pretty hit or miss. A lot of the speakers brought up very interesting topics, but the presentation style was often not engaging. Part way through the semester laptops were banned from the class, which was particularly disappointing for those who wanted to take notes. I do not agree with this policy.",
    "Strengths: Variety of guest lecturers (came from multiple backgrounds\/disciplines) Weaknesses: Sometimes unclear how the lectures fit into the theme of global health (they were all health-related, but some - e.g. social innovation - did not have a global focus). I thought the social enterprise activity was ill-conceived. There was not enough time for the activity, and I found it offensive that we were expected to come up with a solution to a major problem without significant background on the social\/cultural context.",
    "this semester was so much better than last semester! much more active... we should try to incorporate more discussion and hands on work\/learning into next semester.",
    "Strengths: Allows for students to hear from experts in the area. Weakness: It would be great to impose a rule such that no laptops are allowed or that students must sit in the first 10 rows (for example). It was very distracting to see people working on papers or homework assignments while trying to listen to the guest speaker and trying to pay attention to the slides. I believe there should also be more organization in the way the speakers are scheduled to present to the class. Sometimes it seemed like we would jump from one topic to another without any clear link between the lectures.",
    "I think the seminar was much better this semester. I liked that the topics of the presentations were grouped and that there was a mixture of academic and applied public health speakers. I also loved the innovation session! I think this model should be continued in future semesters and even expanded if possible. I also think a panel session here and there would add richness to the material presented.",
    "It came at the end of a very long day which made it difficult to stay engaged. Also the huge room we are in is not conducive to paying attention.",
    "The seminar topics were highly relevant to current global health issues. Most of the speakers were with rich experience on the topic they were presenting. I wish we could shift to web conferences when it was impossible to hold the seminars because of snow instead of cancelling them.",
    "The design workshop was the best because it had us being active and thinking. The format of the course could be revisited in more interactive ways.",
    "I would like to learn more from a global health seminar. Many lectures felt like a waste of time. Then there was the design module. It was out of place. I am trying to get a grasp of the issues so that I can design innovative solutions in the future. The very first lecture last semester made me painstakingly aware how many more health issues there are in the world that I could not effectively identify or discuss. This course did nothing to close that gap.",
    "The course was great. However, the speaker that presented on \"Physician Advocacy\" and showed us youtube videos was really disheartening. A student disagreed with her and she publicly \"mocked\" her. Please don't invite her back. Instead invite somebody who will be respectful to students.",
    "Can we please eat before seminar starts or as it's going on? I know that the idea is to continue the conversation with the speaker once over dinner, but a lot of the time, the speaker leaves soon after or they only talk with a few people at dinner. Also, while the module idea is interesting, I think that I might have enjoyed speakers on a more diverse area of topics.",
    "It was better this semester but still pretty boring. It would be greatly improved if they brought in people that actually have experience instead of just people that sit at their desks and think about the problems.",
    "I liked the modules in public health, and specifically enjoyed the innovation model. The best seminar was the interactive one in innovation. Most of the speakers were interesting. The course provides a well rounded perspective of public health.",
    "Good variety of topics and speakers, though the interactivity and quality of presentations varied. Also felt that limiting the use of laptops\/tablets during the seminar could have been more strictly enforced - it was incredibly distracting.",
    "I am moderately satisfied with the GH seminar. They were successful in planning lectures that would address a variety of issues in global health. I was impressed with some speakers and unimpressed by others. My only complaint would be assuring that the quality of the speakers is kept to a the graduate student level. I also wanted to add that I was really impressed with Urs and Gabby as new GH leaders. They have shown great leadership throughout the semester and are very friendly and helpful to speak with. However, Courtney has a tendency to be very rude with students and I donn't appreciate her hostility.",
    "I didn't like the modules at all this semester. Overall, the lectures last semester were much more interesting. This semester was too heavily focused on maternal and childhood health & environmental health.",
    "Great lectures - I especially liked the last unit on social innovation. I would further enforce the policy of no laptops out during lecture....many people ignored that request and would just be doing other things during lecture, which is not only rude but very distracting to other students. I would suggest a no phone, no computer policy.",
    "Less than what I had expected.",
    "Strengths: presents a variety of perspectives not offered in our classes from practioners and researchers Improvements: Could have more applied discussions",
    "The women's secroon this semester was very strong! Enjoyed it more than other sections of the seminar",
    "This semester was quite interesting and I enjoyed the portion focused on social enterprise."

    "Though the topics are interesting in theory, this class was more like a disjointed guest lecture series with mandatory attendance than a real class where we actually learned anything.",
    "You hear a bunch of different speakers talk about certain global health fields. It is good to see if you like global health and what kind of global health you want to get into.",
    "Great course to make you think and challenge you as to new ways to think about global health!",
    "This is a required course for the global health concentration. It is two semesters long. Engaging speakers make for great seminars, but otherwise this course is not enjoyable. Many of the topics are irrelevant to students' interests. I also dislike the fact that the only requirement for the course is attendance. The course design and\/or layout should be substantially changed before being offered again.",
    "I would recommend it for those in the global health concentration, as it is a requirement. It will provide you with background in several global health topics.",
    "required. it was better than the fall. some very interesting speakers.",
    "Weekly seminar with speakers from various global health topic areas. On Monday evenings, so sometimes difficult to be engaged, but overall I recommend it if you are interested in global health work or research.",
    "if you have a passion for GH issues, then this is the right course for you.",
    "Not a great use of time. Great in theory. I hope lectures improve.",
    "I recommend for students interested in global health. A lot of interesting speakers in varied subjects.",
    "Great opportunity to get a survey view of a variety of current topics related to global health",
    "Worth the requirememt"
