    "Yes yes yes. A must-take at Yale. Hands down, you will walk away bewildered. Definitely take this class.",
    "The Concept of the Problem Child is a fantastic class. A lot of your assumptions about children will be challenged and you'll see parenting and teaching from new perspectives. You'll also never again look at \"problem children\" in the same way. The best part of the class is Erika. She's an amazing instructor and is so sweet and caring. She made each meeting a pleasure and was extremely supportive. She was also always eager to chat over dinner or coffee about the class or about Yale. I definitely recommend applying to the class. If you get in, don't hesitate to take it. You'll be forced to think about some challenging ideas, you'll learn a lot about yourself, and you'll have a great time in the process.",
    "YES! Please take this course! It will change your life.",
    "The Concept of the Problem Child is great course. You discuss a range of topics that are sometimes or often associated with being problematic in children: teenage pregnancy, being queer, having a disability like being a little person or deaf, and even being a child prodigy. These topics are fascinating to discuss from a psychological and sociological perspective. One of the themes of the course was where exactly does the problem lie: the child, or rather the parent, the teacher, the government? How do we define what is problematic? This class made me a much more caring person and I highly recommend it. It's also not too much work: 5-7 page paper, 8-10 page paper, a short op ed, and some blog posts. Professor Christakis cares alot about her students and giving them tools to improve their writing and arguing. I wish we would have tired to come up with some more interesting conclusions at the end of more classes. It sometimes felt like we had talked about some interesting things back and forth for a while but left with nothing decisive. I know that is the case a lot in psychology and sociology but it would have been nice to have some more summarizing points. We also did not go in depth in many psychology or neuroscience journal articles, which I was expecting more of in a seminar. Even if you dont get to take the course, I highly recommend reading Far From the Tree by Andrew Solomon. We read from it quite a bit, and it changed my outlook on identity and made me a more empathetic person.",
    "Yes. If this class is ever offered again, you should take it just because it forces you to think about people who you otherwise wouldn't give a second look at in real life.",
    "Amazing opportunity to think about how we define 'problem children' and be challenged to think about these children in new ways.",
    "It is extremely unfortunate that Erika will no longer be teaching at Yale. It is a huge loss to students. I would have definitely recommended this course to my peers.",
    "It's a fun and pretty chill seminar. If it's taught again, you are very very lucky and should try to take it!",
    "A child development course that explores those children who deviate from \"normal.\"",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone because I got to learn many things about the society and how they treat problem children - who is really problematic? Children? Parents? Families? Government? or, Society? It gave me many different perspectives on such issues.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Our whole seminar got very close and had interesting, meaningful discussions. Erika makes the experience really fun and interactive--we did all-class discussions, broke into pairs, shared our favorite childhood books, and played with toys and pretended to be in preschool. It's a lot of reading, but genuinely interesting and generates many perspectives and opinions. If you get in, definitely take it!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. There is a reason a million people shop this class and it lives up to the hype. The material is interesting and engaging, it's not too much work, and you learn a lot. Erika is the best, most caring professors I have ever had and she alone is reason to take this class.",
    "Absolutely recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The readings and class discussion really make you think, and I found myself continuing to talk about the topics and themes with my suitemates after I'd get back from class each Wednesday. The small seminar style is key to making the class a success, but it is too bad that it's so difficult to get in to the course!",
    "PSYC 132 questions the notion of the \"problem child\" in modern society. Whom do we consider a problem and why? What do these \"problem children\" say about those who label them and the society in which they exist? This course facilitates discussion based around these and similar questions by drawing on sources from literature, history, anthropology, psychology, etc in order to analyze the concept of the problem child in the multi-faceted context in which it exists.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in children at all. The class is extremely varied; the concepts are diverse and interesting but also tie together nicely. The assignments are interesting--Professor Christakis gives great feedback and really cares about students. Classroom discussions are always interesting; it's exciting to hear different people's points of view about a wide range of issues. The readings are really good for the most part, but they are pretty long. Don't take the class if you don't like reading."
