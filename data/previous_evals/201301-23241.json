   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you are interested in American Literature and are willing to devote a lot of time to reading. Moby Dick is the longest piece, but not necessarily the most difficult to read. Browse through each professor's syllabus, because different instructors pick a few different books for the semester. I highly recommend Merve Emre-- she is a great professor, and chose a wonderful syllabus (Lolita was amazing). I looked forward to this class each week. Papers can be challenging to those unfamiliar with literary analysis, but working with a writing tutor is very helpful, and Merve is always available for office hours or Skype. Overall, great course.",
    "In general, I would recommend English 127. I'm pretty sure the only things that all of the sections of 127 have in common are Moby Dick, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. Beyond that, it is at the professor's discretion what to have the students read and write about. In this section, we read a lot of really good literature - like Nabokov's Lolita and Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 - and some modern projects - most notably, Chris Ware's Building Stories. I liked this section because Merve is really enthusiastic about the class and knows what she's talking about, but the writing prompts tend to be very vague and up for interpretation. So I would recommend taking this section after having taken a more instructive writing credit.",
    "Excellent course. A really nice overview of American lit that doesn't sacrifice depth. Discussions were great. And Merve is just the best.",
    "Take this class. I am a science major, but I enjoyed every second of this class. It's not an easy writing credit, like many science majors try to find, but if you want a class that is a true \"Yale class\" that you cantalk about the ideas and books in future conversations and discussions, then this is a class you should take.",
    "A tough class that is worth it.",
    "This class covers such a wide breadth of literature that you're guaranteed to love at least one new book. If you want a writing credit without a huge emphasis on grammar and editing, but you love reading, this is the class for you. Take it from Merve!",
    "English 127 is reading and writing intensive. I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to do the reading, because that's the only way to get everything out of the course that you possibly can.",
    "I have nothing but good things to say about ENGL 127 with Merve Emre. The syllabus (or at least the one that Merve put together\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the 127 professors create their own) is near-perfect, and manages to give a broad overview of the American canon while also avoiding uniformly stuffy old-white-men literature (we read Whitman and Emerson alongside Junot Diaz and Djuna Barnes). I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say enough positive things about Merve. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so engaging, ALWAYS keeps discussions interesting and entertaining, and seems to genuinely care a lot about the well-being of her students. Case in point: she was always willing to communicate outside of class, whether in person, over email or even on Skype, when students needed help working through a paper, and her consistently helpful and thorough feedback was returned to us quickly after papers were submitted, sometimes within a day. The workload itself was extremely fair: approximately a book a week, plus four papers over the duration of the course. We had the opportunity to revise two of these papers using Merve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feedback to improve our grade. I think this is the course I'm most happy to have taken, both because it was a genuinely enjoyable one\u00e2\u0080\u0094I looked forward to seminar every week, thanks to Merve and my fellow students!!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and because it gave me the opportunity to finally delve into some of the American classics that we all long to read in a critical, academic setting.",
    "This class was seriously awesome. I chose this 127 section among others in part because I heard from multiple sources that Merve was worth it and in part because of the exceptional reading list; aside from Whitman, Dickinson and Melville - authors common to all 127 syllabi - Merve assigned Barnes, Eliot, Nabokov, Baldwin, Pynchon, Diaz, and Ware (a graphic artist). Under Merve's auspices, our class problematized most of the important tropes and themes in American literature as well as some important ones in modern and postmodern literary theory, making this 127 section an excellent introduction to a variety of disciplines including English, Literature, Media Studies, and American Studies. Merve's relaxed brilliance, her clear mastery of the material, and her generally chill, anything-productive-goes approach to teaching made the class' content even more vibrant and fun to take. With respect to papers, Merve allowed and encouraged a significant amount of individual autonomy in topic choice (she emphasized that she wanted us to pursue the texts from angles relative to our own academic and personal interests - and that doing would make it more interesting for everyone involved) and provided quite a few opportunities for writing improvement, including appointments with her, extensive comments and feedback on final work, and the option to rewrite one major paper for a better grade."
