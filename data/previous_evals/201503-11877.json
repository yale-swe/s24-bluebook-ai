   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student, regardless of whether or not they see themselves pursuing creative writing in the future. The readings were good, the assignments were fun, and class was always interactive and enjoyable. My writing certainly improved over the course of the semester, and it was fun to see how my classmates' did as well by hearing them read work aloud at different points in the class.",
    "Incredible. Structure is perfect, assignments are perfect, lectures are sometimes a little too loose and not helpful. Deming gives supreme feedback and is awesome to meet with outside of class and will help you grow as a writer. Other lecturers are probably great too, but Deming is THE MAN. Great class for freshmen and STEM upperclassmen looking for something different (I'm in latter camp). Workload is very manageable, though I do wish I'd started earlier on some assignments... Also, why isn't this a WR? I need one D:",
    "Absolutely! Even if you aren't majoring in English, if you like reading or writing, this is a great course to take.",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in creative writing, I don't know if I would take it for fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, with certain caveats. In general, I really like the structure and syllabus of the class and think thought that the writing exercises were well-designed. Professor Deming was excellent 1-on-1 and gave extensive, helpful feedback on all work. However, I did have some reservations about the diversity syllabus-- especially for the drama unity, it skewed pretty heavily white and male. Unfortunately, that's pretty true of the Yale English department in general, so it's not a particularly unique criticism. Also, I didn't always love seminar. Obviously, this is an intro level class, so many of the students are underclassmen without extensive writing experience, which reflects in class discussion. However, I thought that sometimes discussion would get a little bogged down (we would regularly spend 30 minutes analyzing the syntax of a single sentence, which is not particularly useful in survey creative writing class). I would have appreciated a little more direction from Professor Deming to help the conversation move along. I'd recommend going to the first class and seeing if you like Deming and the general tone of seminar before taking it.",
    "I'd recommend it for someone looking for a relaxed class to take. You still do a fair amount of reading and writing, but it isn't overwhelming and it's enjoyable.",
    "Would recommend",
    "Really fun class! Just know that creative writing is something that takes a lot more time and energy than you probably think. I wish that going into the class I had been mentally prepared to spend hours on certain assignments, because sometimes that is what it takes to finish a piece. Great class that equips you with important writing skills that I found very useful in other classes--especially history, where the \"show, don't tell\" strategy makes for an effective essay."
