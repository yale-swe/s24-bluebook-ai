   "comments": [
    "An introductory science course that focuses on making high level concepts in physics very approachable. I would recommend this to any student interested in learning more about science fiction or looking for an intro science class that is fun.",
    "Take if you need a science credit and don't mind not really learning anything concrete but touching upon a lot of cool topics! That being said midterm and final are hard but luckily homework is 40% and you can get all 40% easy!!",
    "Decent way to get a science credit, but may not come away from the class feeling like you have gained an understanding of many topics.",
    "Best science credit ever. You will not regret taking it.",
    "Gutty as hell but still interesting. Take for an easy science credit.",
    "Sure, if you want to get an easier Sc credit.",
    "Science for non-science people but also not as easy on tests (like most gut sciences).",
    "To be frank, this wasn't as much of a gut as I thought it was going to be, and I didn't find it compelling enough to truly inspire more effort.",
    "Not as easy as it seems, but not hard if you go to office hours and keep up with material.",
    "YES! Great science credit! Fun and real world examples of important concepts in physics!",
    "A gut class.",
    "Take it if you need a SC cr or if you need cr to graduate. But don't expect to learn too much.",
    "Definitely not a gut. Take it if you're genuinely interested in Science Fiction. But if you're just trying to get a distribution requirement out of the way, there are definitely better options.",
    "Not a hard class..the material itself is actually pretty easy. But, the course is poorly organized and the information is not communicated very well. It is a relatively easy science credit, but not a good class overall.",
    "This is a cursory glance at a bunch of concepts in science and technology through science fiction novels. You will learn a variety of interesting things, but only on a very basic level. The class expectations are very straight forward and professor Reed is a good professor. Overall, would recommend for someone who really doesn't like science or wants to learn a large range of information rather than something specific at a deeper level.",
    "Its a good science credit! There's a p-set every week but its short - you get to bring notes to midterms and final and you don't really need to go to lecture! It's also fun to brush over many science concepts and get an idea of different fields.",
    "Definitely interesting, but sometimes challenging. Would definitely recommend to anyone, especially non-STEM majors.",
    "I appreciated how I walked away from the class more knowledgeable on scientific concepts. I thought the class could have been organized better, though. It didn't seem like there was a lot of coordination among the TF's and between the TF's and the professor.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT. You can replicate the experience by googling \"high school science concepts\" and then beating your head against the wall for 50 minutes. Get your science credit elsewhere.",
    "It is a very easy science credit that surveys some sci fi books (which you do not have to read) and evaluates the scientific concepts within those stories.",
    "Awesome class!",
    "Its a gut! It's still pretty hard though. Material on test has NOTHING to do with what we learned. I found the assessments unfair.",
    "This is the worst and perhaps the hardest class I've taken at Yale. Don't do it. Mark Reed is a very nice man but the course is very difficult and no one offers help",
    "Definitely.",
    "If you're interested in physics and never took AP Physics in high school or any other physics \/ astrophysics related class, this one might be interesting. Otherwise, it's slightly repetitive.",
    "Occasionally fascinating, occasionally boring. Not a very clearly defined syllabusthe point of the class is somewhat elusive. Homeworks are easy and TAs very accessible, but the final was incredibly difficult. Take this if you want a somewhat easy, often interesting classbut be prepared to work at the end.",
    "Overall, sweet class for non-STEM majors with a good overview of cool scifi topics.",
    "No. Not unless they are really good at science.",
    "This is an entertaining way to work through the science requirement. Somewhat more difficult than it appears.",
    "A survey of physics. Not difficult if you go to office hours and very interesting.",
    "Harder than expected sometimes, confusing, and frustrating. Only take it if you can't find another science credit.",
    "I would totally recommend this class if you want an easy science credit! Weekly problem sets are only 3-5 questions long and are worth 50% of the grade. You're allowed a page of notes for the midterm and two pages for the final. There's really no reason not to learn in this class.",
    "EENG 111 is meant to be a fun class that teaches and expands on some of the most popular and relevant scientific concepts employed in science fiction. Its success at the above is limited; some parts of the material were covered well while others were glossed over and confusingly taught. The course becomes more electrical engineering-y in its second half, and I think that was probably the best part of it. The scientific concepts covered are very complex, but the professor does his best to simplify them to be non-science-major-friendly, though that sometimes entailed glossing over certain things which only made the explanation of the concepts more confusing. You should know that even though this course is a science credit it is basically a QR credit, as most of the actual work done in the psets and exams was mathematics. The math is all high school level, but that doesn't necessarily mean the course is a gut. If you have a really strong science\/math background it will be incredibly easy, but if you don't parts of it could be really tough. Office hours are absolutely CRUCIAL if you want to ace the psets, as the TAs explain the concepts involved and what is expected of you at great length (the psets are vaguely worded and it can be hard to figure out if what you're doing is accurate without outside help). The psets are worth 40% of your grade, so doing well on them matters if you want to score well (and fortunately the TAs are very helpful, though they occasionally contradict each other). The professor is really friendly, the material covered is cool, and the workload totally reasonable, though the psets and exams could be tricky. You also have to write a science fiction story outline at the end of class, which was a lot of fun and a cool touch (and something I wish there had been more of in the course; the science fiction reading isn't really required and not really integrated in the course, serving as a quick way to introduce scientific concepts but not much else; if you want to get into a course that actually explores science fiction, and not scientific concepts, at length, this isn't the one).",
    "A course that seems geared toward non-STEM majors but could really use work in making the material more accessible toward students without a strong science background. Material wasn't really presented in very cohesive segments and it was sort of just jumping from story to story and learning completely different concepts in each even though you could tell Prof. Reed was really trying. A doable science credit but if you don't have a strong STEM background it's not going to be as \"gutty\" as you might be looking for.",
    "Gut science class, and a great one at that. If you need a science credit, I recommend.",
    "Harder than you would think. Lectures are a bit boring. No one went toward the end of the semester. Wouldn't take it unless super excited for this class and\/or you REALLY needed it",
    "Do not recommend",
    "Lousy class.",
    "Best science credit",
    "This is a gut only if you cram well before the midterm and the final, and have well-prepared formula sheets. Otherwise the questions can be quite out-of-nowhere.",
    "It's a decent class, but sometimes I wish I was in the library or doing something else instead of going to the lectures because they could get boring. I would recommend the class to someone who doesn't like science because it is a straightforward science credit. However, I actually like science and felt that this class didn't live up to my expectations. It seemed like Professor Reed would talk about a book, and then some science concept explored in the book and then give a basic example and\/or equation. And then the next lecture was either a continuation of that topic or a new topic. I feel like we skimmed a lot of topics, but never went in depth into any of them.",
    "\"The Science of Science Fiction\" is an enjoyable and not particularly demanding course with a misleading title. If you want to gain a science credit while discussing the particularities of Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick for a semester, then you are, quite understandably out of luck. The course counts as a science credit because it is almost entirely focused on actual scientific subject matter, and really the science fiction angle only as an introduction to various scientific subjects. The good news is that those subjects are often quite interesting, and sometimes fascinating. Professor Reed is not the most electrifying lecturer on the face of the Earth, but he will bring everything from special relativity to nanotechnology to life in a way that most other science courses, both at Yale and elsewhere, cannot well achieve. The class will allow you, as it allowed me, to engage with this broad range of scientific topics without having to use any quantitative skills beyond algebra and some basic probability and statistics. The course will likely be less difficult than others you take at Yale, but more difficult than one would expect given the course title, and ultimately a quite refreshing an interesting experience. If you want to learn more about a very wide range of topics in modern pure and applied science, while gaining a science area distributional requirement, not bending yourself out of shape over the stress of a great deal of quantitative work, listening to an enjoyable but not electrifying lecturer in Professor Reed, and spending plenty of time imagining the amazing future of humankind, then I would in fact recommend that you take \"The Science of Science Fiction.\"",
    "A good science survey course for people who don't like science.",
    "This course gives you a very brief, semi-memorable overview of a lot of mixed topics. You might get an idea of what each topic is about but you won't really understand any of them. For example, I now sort of know what special relativity, time dilation, the drake equation and computer logic systems are. This class sort of teaches you things. This class has a very low work load. Exams are graded on a curve. If you're looking for a gut science class to take, think carefully before signing up for this one. It briefly touches on a lot of topics, but if you're even vaguely interested in learning about another topic more in depth, there are other classes you should look at.",
    "A class which you can probably get a lot out of if you do the work, but fairly easy to not do the work and survive if you need to.",
    "If you are good at math or science like, legitimately proficient in numbers and quantitative thought and taking in scientific concepts you may find yourself wanting more date. But I am not that, and I have looked my whole yale career for a course that doesn't make me feel like an idiot but is sympathetic to my shortcomings. Black holes, A.I., transistors, Schrodinger's cat it was all there in a delightfully comprehensive way. Also when else are you going to read the sci-fi novels by people other than Asimov or Philip K. Dick? Go for it. Schrodinger's cat and quantum uncertainty is actually such a beautiful thing, and everyone shouls know about it. Poets and artists included.",
    "Great course, especially for those non-science majors looking to fulfill a SC credit. While going to each lecture is not necessary to do alright, it is certainly worth it.",
    "It's not a difficult course. It's not intended to be a difficult course. If you take it, you're probably taking it because you're a science-clueless-y humanities-type such as myself. It's a fun, easy class covering material that you probably should learn before going out into the real world. I know people are going to write \"gut\" in the evals, but that's not quite fair. Guts are generally pointless. This class is smart, but easy. In my opinion, there's a difference.",
    "Highly recommend! Broad coverage of a lot of interesting topics in modern science and some sweet books if you want to read them!",
    "If you took anything like AP Physics, this course will be very easy for you and perhaps the more modern physics will be interesting.",
    "I would summarize this class as a cursory survey of topics in science. I would recommend this class to classmates who are humanities majors or are just not very interested in delving deep into one field of science, or to someone who enjoys science fiction. If this describes you, then this is an easy way to fulfill a Science credit.",
    "Good for a simple science, easy enough if you take with a group of friends and study together.",
    "This class is great. If you need a science credit and aren't a science person then definitely take this class. I am a science\/STEM person but I took this class anyway just because the topics covered were so interested. We learn about space, relativity, black holes, quantum mechanics, electronics, and more. We learn what can and can't be done with what we have in terms of technology and the laws of physics, and with what we know about the world and the universe. Professor Reed is an acclaimed physicist and I learned a lot from him, and he was extremely funny too. The problem sets are not bad at all (usually one page) and they can be done with basic arithmetic and algebra. The homework load is close to none, and the homework you do have is reading a sci-fi novel which is fun! I would definitely recommend this class if you aren't a science person and need a science credit, or if you are science\/STEM person and want to see if this stuff really interests you!",
    "A good course for non-science majors looking to get a small taste of the different sciences as expanded upon from popular science fiction works. Not too difficult if you understand the topics already, as he does not go too in depth. Make sure to go to lecture if you don't understand something he will be talking about because you will only need to know certain aspects of it and sometimes the internet makes it super complex.",
    "Low risk class that will brighten up your schedule. Great to take if you are not a STEM person.",
    "This class doesnt know whether or not it wants to be a gut. I was beguiled by the premise of this class: How do books grow out of existing science, and how is existing science extended by the most imaginative of those books? I was also beguiled by how easy the problem sets were. But this class turned out to be an intellectual let-down: if I took it too seriously, then the easy problem sets mocked the time that I spent trying to understand. But if I shrugged off the class as a gut, then the exams punished me for the time I devoted to my other classes. Professor Reed is kind but not captivating, and if you intend to learn from the classesv2 slides alone, I dont think theyll inspire -- let alone satisfy -- real curiosity.",
    "Not as gutty as you might think. The workload is low but the material covered is quickly serious and vast. Problem sets will be okay but exams were a bit tough for me as a non-STEM major. Reed is laid back and charismatic. The readings are interesting and fun and each lecture really does have a connection to Science Fiction, it's not just a catchy title to draw you in."
