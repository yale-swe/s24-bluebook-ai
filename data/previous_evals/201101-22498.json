    "8\/10. Moderate amount of work, interesting but a bit depressing.",
    "PSYC 330 is a very interesting course, especially if you're interested in the role of psychology within the justice system. The course brings up many interesting interactions between psychology and the justice system, and it is easy to find the materials engaging because the issues dealt with are rather commonly known ones. (Of course, the specifics can be very surprising and enlightening, which makes the course really worth taking.) I feel that I really learned a lot from this course. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if Kristi Lockhart is teaching it. In fact I would recommend any of Professor Lockhart's classes, she is simply an engaging teacher that it is fun to take a class from.",
    "I'd recommend it to a psych major for sure but maybe not someone really interested in law because the material is heavily weighted with psychological studies. if you have never taken any class about the law then its a great start",
    "This class was average. There is NO overlap between section and lecture, so it feels like you are taking two separate classes--there's and entirely different set of assignments and grades for section. Lecture is ok--Kristi Lockhart is good, but she gets monotonous at times, rambles a bit. It's difficult to pay attention to her for 75 minutes straight. She's very knowledgeable, but the course isn't set up great. The tests are very long, detailed and difficult. She gives review sessions, but they aren't that helpful--she basically just read us the review sheet. If your interested more in the law side of this course, don't take it--this is more psychology geared. Not my favorite class.",
    "dont take this class",
    "Take it!!",
    "Very good psych class and very interesting even if you're not a psych major. Lots of memorization for the midterm and final, but otherwise the workload is pretty reasonable.",
    "I took this class Credit\/D\/Fail and I'm really happy I did. The readings were kind of pointless and a lot of the information was pretty straightforward, so it was better to just relax and learn how the legal system works and what its strengths and weaknesses are. If you're interested in the course material, take it. I recommend looking at the syllabus first and shopping the class. It's a good credit\/D.",
    "GREAT course. You'll learn a ton about the criminal justice system. Very straightforward and interesting.",
    "Ok, I would recommend it, but do not believe all the reviews that you may read that said this is the best class ever. I read so many of those before taking the class, and they definitely set me up for disappointment. Sure, the actual issues are interesting and applicable to modern life and current events, but a lot of it is pure common sense. It focuses on many psychological phenomena that anyone could intuit. Also Professor Lockhart is quite possibly the one of the worst lecturers I have ever had. If you cannot stand disorganization, rambling, repetition, and lectures full of extraneous detail, do not take this class. If you do take this class, the workload is light. You do not have to do any of the readings as long as you go to lecture and pay attention. Take notes because if you don't Lockhart's slides will not make any sense when you are preparing for the midterm and final. The section papers are short and easy, and section is a very worthwhile part of this class. If you are looking for a mentally stimulating class, this is not it. But it is mildly interesting if you want to know more about our perceptions and attitudes toward the legal system and psychology's role in its workings.",
    "So much material to learn for the exams, but an interesting class. Take it if you're good at exam memorization.",
    "its not as good as I thought it would be, but a solid course.",
    "I would recommend it, but I would caution students to question the opinions that Professor Lockhart delivers in class. She basically led everyone in the class to believe that interrogations always lead to false confessions, memories of sex abuse are rarely true, and criminals are barely culpable.Work load is a little more than in other psych classes, and the tests are pretty in-depth.",
    "Yes, really interesting.",
    "This course provides you with SO MUCH psychological perspective on the justice system. This is a really practical course for future law students or for psychology students who simply want to see how their course of study could actually help better theworld. Because each lecture includes so much information, the lectures can be boring and a little arduous to sit through. The midterm and final are insanely long and intimidating, but I guess that's what expected from a 300-level course. The material is definitely approachable, useful, and relevant, however--so much so that you even get the change to do a sort of field project in an area related to law for the final paper.",
    "Psych 330 is a course that covers pretty interesting material (if you're into Law and Order and crazy cases and some psychology) and can be very entertaining. Prof. Lockhart is clearly a very enthusiastic professor, and she is the complete opposite of a boring, monotonous lecturer. The course covers a wide range of material, not always in the most organized or logical way, and the exams can pretty much be aced if you have a good memory. Section was a considerable amount of work (the class itself was hardly anything) but was in my opinion the most valuable part of the course. The final paper is kind of a joke since it is so open, so there is a lot of room for you to take with it. All in all, I think I enjoyed the class, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the material and looking for a class that doesn't require too much effort.",
    "Psych and the law was a very easy class. You basically need to do no work because both the midterm and the final have very comphrehsive study guides which if you study you will do well. Only the lectures actually matter. The readings are pointless, don't do them",
    "I would not recommend this class. I really enjoyed it at times becasue I am fascinated by the subject matter. Criminology is AWESOME. however, prof lockhart is not very interesting and not a very good lecturer. there is not too much work, but enough that it's annoying. and the weekly reading responses are graded difficulty. but they are really great at making you think moe in depth about the subject. section was the best part.",
    "Best class I have taken at yale. Definitely take it. It isnt the easiest class ever but its very informative, interesting, and section is the best thing ever if you get a good TA",
    "GREAT CLASS!",
    "Yes, there is very little work and the tests were not very difficult because the material is not very difficult (commonsense). Good for an easy A.",
    "PSYC330 is a broad overview of the cross between psychology and the law. You basically just discuss the tension between the two fields, some interesting cases and studies, and the fairness and efficiency of the legal system. It's definitely different to most other courses at Yale. You'll learn a lot about things you probably wouldn't have otherwise. That being said, there's a lot of memorizing required for exams. The final paper is pretty short and flexible and weekly responses aren't graded harshly at all. Lockhart's a character and lectures are 75 minutes. I would recommend it if you're interested in the subject matter and are willing to study a lot for exams.",
    "Psych and the Law is a great course; you'll learn lots of cool stuff about the law and geneally have a better understandning of how it works. The two tests are pretty hard, so really prepare for those, and otherwise, the weekly section responses are painless because the prompts are really interesting aka what do you think about the death penalty? Throw in a short paper, running a section, and weekly readings for section (which you should do) and weekly readings for lectures (which you don't have to do), and well, this course keeps you pretty busy. You'll get out of it what you put in, but overall, it's a great course.",
    "Sure. You'll get more out of section than the actual class.",
    "A good psych course. The material can be quite repetitive sometimes but it's not a terribly difficult course. Professor Lockhart's exam review sessions basically tell you everything.",
    "Graet",
    "Do not. There are many other psychology classes that are better.",
    "Psych and the Law is a great class for both psych and non-psych majors. You will learn a lot and sections are really fun because you get to talk about interesting topics like the death penalty and the felony-murder law. The reading looks intimidating, but you really only need to read the stuff for section.",
    "It's a great class for anyone interested in psychology or the legal system. Prof. Lockhart does a great job explaining the material, and her insights into the legal system were terrific. Really fun class, and depending on your TA sections are awesome. Debate-based, and the work isn't too bad. A very fun class.",
    "Psychology and the Law was a mediocre course. I happened to get a great TA (Nila Bala) and so section discussion was fantastic, but I often found the lectures to be too long and over stuffed with information. Professor Lockhart often moves through the information quite quickly, and I found it hard to differentiate which issues were the most important in the course. Also, the final reviews sessions literally just repeated everything that was taught, so it was hard to figure out what I needed to study.",
    "This course was not very interesting. The lectures were all very boring, and the material was not interesting. Lectures just consisted of study after study, some of them barely relevant to the topic, none of them explored in depth and then forced to be regurgitated on the exams. I did not find the material to be anywhere near as interesting as it could have been. The course was also unorganized, and the topics dragged on and on. Professor Lockhart would ramble about material that was obvious or irrelevant, dragging the lectures on forever. The course was not organized in a helpful way, and she would basically just mention random studies in a continuous list, without ever integrating any ideas or other material into them. Lectures were just a laundry list of studies that she read from a powerpoint. Section is the only worthwhile part of this course. I would not recommend this course. It does not integrate psych and the law in an interesting or useful way.",
    "Not a bad class, but you won't get a ton out of it.",
    "Really, really interesting course that has made me even more critical of the legal system than I was before. I'd recommend it, but I must say that it does require a decent amount of work. Reading response every week and lengthy, dense readings become a bit much. And the final sucks.",
    "Great class if you want to find out about how psychology is used in the legal system. There is not too much work, though you will want to keep up with the lectures if you don't want to panic by exam time. Lectures are interesting but disorganized.",
    "I loved this class. Interestig material and you can do well if you do the work. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because I found it to be very interesting and informative- especially since I have an interest in legal issues. It was not too difficult, and though we covered a lot of material, it was very manageable.",
    "yes, it is a great intro to abnormal psychology as well as to the legal system",
    "This was a general survey of the intersection of law and psychology. I thought it was a decent class, but definitely wasn't my favorite this semester. Her slides are not the most organized so sometimes it's difficult knowing what's important and what isn't. Overall, though, I'd probably recommend it to a student.",
    "Good class, interesting readings, fine workload (although way too much reading to realistically finish). Take it if you have an interest in the legal system in general (don't take it if you're only into psychology).",
    "Lots of psychology and little law.",
    "Lockhart speaks really quickly. At first I was amused and enthralled by her enthusiasm, but I quickly grew to find it tiring and irksome. Not only do words fall out of her mouth at the speed of water at Niagara Falls, she presents an obscene amount of material in her dreadfully long 75 minute classes. Despite how incredibly interesting the material is, her presentation and organization make this course more tortuous than intriguing.Pros:Interesting materialVaried grade distribution (complete separation of section and lecture)Cons:Section is 50 minutes on top of two 75-minute weekly lecturesMidterm was hard, final was manageable but CUMULATIVEWhat\u0092s covered in section is not covered on the midterm or final, yet you have to write reading responses for sectionSection leading (19\/20) and reading responses rarely get 10\/10 or 20\/20 (generally 9\/10 is highest)Poorly organized lectures (Lockhart eventually posts 4 PPTs consisting of over 100 slides each)Difficult to obtain an A*****Make sure to start off Credit\/D\/Fail to see how you do on the midterm before you decide to take it for a grade. She does not do curves, and despite what she says, her study guides do little to separate the wheat from the chaff.Unless Lockhart changes the structure of this class, I give it 2 out of 4 stars. She has to change the structure of PPTs (preferably shortening lectures) and the way the midterm and final are conducted before I would really recommend it to someone.",
    "I would recommend this course in terms of the material \u0096 it is very interesting and there is a lot of cool stuff that people who are interested in either psychology or law should know. However, I think it might be better with a different professor or perhaps a better overall structure.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and would definitely recommend it, with the caveat that between the lectures, paper, sections, and extremely comprehensive final and midterm, it is definitely not a gut.",
    "Absolutely, this was a great class. Very interesting and not too difficult as long as you study. Take this class for sure.",
    "Yes. Great class. Gives you some idea of the legal system while still being a great psych class",
    "Psych 330 is a good course for anyone interested in the different aspects in which psychology influences the law, and a variety of topics are covered. Such topics include child witness testimonies, the death penalty and factors influencing violent behavior. Professor Lockhart is a very engaging lecturer, but occasionally can be repetitive. There is a LOT of reading for the class, and more reading + reading responses for section, which makes the workload of the class quite a lot. The material covered on the midterm and final requires very detailed knowledge of theory and empirical outcomes, which can make studying a little overwhelming.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow student if they are really interested in the material. It is a lot of work, especially in section as I said already. Professor Lockhart is often very distracting but if you can learn to ignore this the class is well worth the effort",
    "yea i'd take it if you enjoy the psychology behind law processes and the legal system",
    "Take it if you're interested in the law or psych (pretty self explanatory) because your interest in the material will carry you through the class. Go to lecture, skim (or don't do) the readings for section. It's not the best class in the world, but it's good\/okay.",
    "I'd take it, just be aware it's really easy to skip class\/not pay attention.",
    "PSYC 330 was a wonderful course! All of the information that was covered was fun, interesting, and insightful. It's actually the kind of information that you can use in real life. Although Professor Lockhart was slightly disorganized and almost always cited too many studies and examples during lecture, she's a fun speaker and she's really enthusiastic about what she's saying. Section is a lot of work, entailing a lengthy weekly response and a one time section presentation, but it's super fun and engaging because you get to discuss controversial topics. The grading isn't too hard, and if you take good notes during lecture you'll do excellent on the tests. Overall, I would highly recommend Psych and the Law to a fellow student."
