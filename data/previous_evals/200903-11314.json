    "MUSI 220 presents a fantastic opportunity to work with other students toward a chamber music performance. It presents the opportunity to lead rehearsals outside of class, as well as be coached by professors\/TFs. All of the ensembles grew tremendously, and the final performance was a highly rewarding experience. I highly recommend the class - audition with friends, or get placed with a group - either way, it's a lot of fun and a great experience.",
    "Definitely. Playing in chamber is great and we also get lots of helpful feedback from various perspectives.",
    "If you want to play in a small ensemble and meet new musicians this class is fantastic.",
    "Music 220 01 is a great course, and a great community of some of Yale's most thoughtful musicians. Your ability to set your own hours with your group is nice, and makes it so that the course is as serious an endeavor as you wish it to be. It really is a must for anyone who is serious about music and not entirely antisocial.",
    "Yes. Chamber music is awesome!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all classical musicians. The performance of chamber music is one of the most enriching experiences I have ever had. To be able to receive coachings and credit for such an amazing experience is a blessing.",
    "This class is a coaching and performance based chamber music group. It's a great class - you get a chance to perform with the same group all year and work up a piece. I have really enjoyed this class.",
    "Chamber music, in my opinion, is a lot more collegial than orchestra and allows for a much wider range of artistic autonomy on the students' parts. The members of the Jasper Quartet are excellent coaches, as are the Music Department faculty, and they generally avoid the pitfall of imposing their own musical views on the group. My major piece of advice would be to choose your group carefully -- one flakey or consistently late person can easily ruin a coaching, and there definitely needs to be a sense that everyone is making equal effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Summary - 2 hours of rehearsal a week, one hour of coaching a week. Only take it if you are willing to rehearse at least the required amount. You will get out of this course what you put in. You can make it as worth it as you want to.",
    "I would recommend the class to any musician interested in chamber music, really. However, you do need to understand that the class IS a serious commitment to your chamber group, but, since it is chamber music, it's usually fun!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who loves playing chamber music and is willing to put in the effort to learn the music and show up for rehearsals (otherwise it just sucks for the group). I had a fabulous time and there's really no better class if you want to be involved in chamber music at Yale."
