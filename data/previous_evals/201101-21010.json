    "The syllabus is wonderful and will provide a good grounding in thematerials of the Reformation and various methodological stances from which to approach it. Most of you learning, however, will take place on your own, as the meetings of the seminar are inefficiently run by other students who lack a framework for saying anything meaningful about the material.The Professor is very knowledgeable and easily accessible via email and for meetings. He can provide great help, but you have to take the time to do this outside of class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It managed to thread the needle between broadness and specificity, and allowed students to follow their own interests."
