    "Learned the some more of the Russian language.",
    "This course was the first russian course where I have felt relaxed and confident in conversational russian.",

   "comments": [
    "There is a LOT of work that goes into this course, but to be fair, you ARE learning a new language. Prof Dolgova does a good job in making sure that there is a lot of actual speaking in class, but also includes grammar exercises that she balances with readings and translations. The readings are often selections from real Russian literature instead of \"cheesy\" stories written just for textbooks, which is a great insight into grammar in context of real Russian writings. The class is very difficult, but I can't think of a way for it to be improved. Languages are just difficult (which is why the course is 1.5 credits).",
    "The in-class experience was quite good, with both Professor Dolgova and the TA leading class effectively every day. I thought that more speaking opportunities could have been helpful in making grammar more routine parts of our speech patterns. Additionally, some accountability on vocabulary might be helpful as well, as I often found that despite best intentions, I often slacked on that part of my out-of-class routine.",
    "Great course! I wish the course was structured to give us more speaking practice but I do not think that was feasible with the number of students in the class.",
    "This course is taught very well and is very well structured. One weakness may be the amount of examinations you have to take. They seem so often that you are tempted not to study for them all because individually they dont seem to matter",
    "I think there could be different kinds of homework than the daily worksheet. Perhaps ways to encourage vocabulary mastery."

   "comments": [
    "If you need to meet the language requirement or want to learn Russian, I recommend continuing on from L2 into this course, as it is not too big of a jump from L2 while still adding on to the past material.",
    "Yes, Dr. Dolgova is an engaged and effective professor who cares deeply about sharing Russian with students and encouraging them to improve their language abilities.",
    "Yes if you genuinely want to learn Russian. This is not an easy language class. If you put in work you will do well. Professor Dolgova is great. Take it if you want to learn Russian.",
    "Yes! This course was really fulfilling and well taught",
    "Yes! The Russian department is fabulous and Irina is the best. She really cares about her students and that they understand the concepts, and doesn't focus on the grades.",
    "Yes. For students looking to continue Russian language study this is a good course with a fair pace and hands on instructors."
