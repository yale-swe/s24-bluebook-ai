    "In Professor Marcus's course, I learned how to approach the complexity of the Decameron through a close reading and in-depth discussion of each of its Days. The course emphasized various types of narrative types within the frame story; this provided an incredible introduction to medieval literature more broadly. Having studied Dante previously, it was really incredible to compare Boccaccio's interventions in prose. Moreover, thinking through Professor Marcus's discussion topics provided a concrete methodology to understand the text and to make connections between this work and other literary and visual output of the period."
