    "Great class! Prof. Fink is an amazing lecturer. The reading for this class is great--you get to read a lot of famous works but also find some novels\/short stories you probably wouldn't have heard about. And the work load isn't horrible--short response before each class, take home midterm, and final paper--definitely worth it!",
    "A great exploration of twentieth century Russian lit, including lots of authors you probably wouldn't have discovered otherwise.",
    "GREAT CLASS. Best class I've ever taken here. A really good survey course on Russian literature from the late 1800s through the modern era. The pacing was great for a class that ran through so many works, but I still wish we had had more time to discuss some of them. But that's a problem that plagues all literature survey classes. In any case, Professor Fink is AMAZING. Really the best professor I have ever had at Yale. I would take all of her classes just because she was teaching them.",
    "This is a survey of 20th century Russian lit. The texts vary greatly due to the turbulent nature of the 20th century. All of the readings were fascinating though and Hilary Fink did a great job providing context for them. Discussions were also good although it would have been nice to go into them more deeply. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "You read many of the great works in modern Russian literature. Great course.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Whether you are completely foreign to russian lit or lull your self to sleep every night with Nabokov's words humming in you ears, this class is fantastic.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS CLASS.This is the best class I have taken at Yale. The readings are a pleasure, some more so than others, but its an overall great syllabus. This class gives you a good introduction to the literature of Russia and how it was affected by changing politics over the years.And, Professor Fink is amazing. She makes class very enjoyable and helps you see the connections between the readings and your life.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great course to take if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Yes, it's an enjoyable class.",
    "This was a fantastic course and the structure, teaching style, and booklist were all fabulous. There is a lot of reading, but it's definitely worth it, and the class discussion with Professor Fink are great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone. You don't have to have any prior knowledge of Russian lit, just some excitement about the subject, which will come just from listening to one of Professor Fink's lectures. Take it!"
