   "comments": [
    "Good class. Not my favorite seminar, but fun and interesting.",
    "YES take it, but only if you're ready to work.",
    "Course about the shaping of New York culture up through the early 20th century, focusing on incidents of violence, tension and paranoia. Great class to take if you have any interest in New York and its history.",
    "It's not an easy class, you have to do most, if not all, the reading. The reason for this is that the class is entirely discussion based, with the discussions following each weeks reading. That said, the discussion is casual, so, it's tough to recommend for or against, but it is definitely a lot of work.",
    "A really good social history course. All the readings are great, and if you're worried at all about being prepared for the senior essay (some courses do prepare you better than others), take this course. Professor Lui structures it so that you have to start the final paper early and then gives you feedback at each of the stages, so that you really learn how to research and write. Also, the course material is quite simply entertaining, without being intellectually vapid.",
    "A good class, although not nearly as exciting as the title. Professor Lui structures the class really well - making sure that you are preparing each step of your paper as you go, not letting you fall behind by always having things due. This ends up being a decent amount of work, but it's not overwhelming and it's worth it to feel like you're on top of everything. A LOT of reading each week, generally, but they were all very interesting - good books, interesting articles. Overall, a fun class with a lot of work.",
    "It is a very interesting seminar, but be warned in advance that there is a considerable amount of work. With four 3 page papers, presentations, and multiple assignments for the final 20 page paper, it takes up more time than you expect. It's definitely worthwhile, but just make sure to balance it with other classes. Professor Lui is great!",
    "A lot of work and a lot of reading, but fun",
    "Yes-- great class. but be prepared for a lot of hard work, because the professor has very high expectations. Take this if you need a junior seminar class and is willing to work hard to get a good grade.",
    "This class is an overview of murders, riots, and terrorism in New York from the colonial period up to 1920. Most weeks' readings focus on a single instance of violence, and relate it to issues of class, gender, and race. The class is VERY heavy on social history, so don't take it unless you're interested in WGSS and ER&M themes. Do take it if you want a very detailed and in-depth look at the lives of 19th century New Yorkers.The class has a pretty hefty workload, including 4 4-page reading response essays and a 20-page final paper with a lot of preparatory work. Professor Lui does a great job of guiding you through the paper-writing process, and she runs class discussions smoothly. However, be wary that the class may get somewhat repetitive toward the end.",
    "The title is certainly seductive. But be forewarned: while the reading material may plunge you into the grimy streets of New York, the section discussions will veer into more clinical pathways of historical methods.If you enjoy examining the distinctions between \"social\" and \"cultural\" history, and freely throwing around words like \"agency\" and \"narrative,\" then you will thrive in this course."
