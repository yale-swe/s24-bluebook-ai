    "A great way to get your writing credit. The journals seem daunting, but turn out to be (once you get the hang of how she wants them) not that difficult and actually interesting. The topics can get repetitive as soon as the very constant theme of the class arises, but you get to make collages and play with blocks so not too bad. The work load is entirely manageable and the practicum is fun. The worst part is getting there 2 times a week. Further than you have ever been up science hill.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning the basics of early childhood development and education. The classes are at Calvin Hill Daycare, which is a 10-minute shuttle ride away, and you go up there once a week outside of class for observation. The course work is light, and you learn a ton about how children think and grow during your observations. The one caveat I would offer is that learning about early childhood education at Calvin Hill gives you a very narrow perspective what early childhood education in this country looks like. This is a course about how, ideally, early childhood education, should be; it is NOT a course about what is true in the majority of cases, nor is it a course about how to implement child development theory in resource-limited classrooms.",
    "This class was fun! It's far away though, so if you don't like walking I guess that might be a bad thing.",
    "An interesting course with a hands-on component. I hadn't expected the focus to be so heavy on the curricular component, but I ended up enjoying it tremendously even though I don't plan on going into early childhood education. Working with the classroom materials in seminar and observing the kids during my practicum really helped make the material we were learning more tangible -- I felt like I learned it better for having experienced it directly.",
    "The class is an extremely easy and moderately interesting introduction to theories of early childhood education. You pretty much know everything you're going to learn by the third week, but the observations are fun (playing with blocks for two hours once a week...amazing break). Good fifth class. Weekly journal entries and a final 10-12 page paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "You're assigned a bunch of readings and you discuss them the next time you meet for class. Each week there is a specific area of early childhood education\/ development that you're supposed to pay attention to during your ~2.5-3 hour observation and then write about in 2-5 pages. These \"journal entries\" are collected in sets twice during the semester. Finally, there is the 10-15 page paper on an early childhood education topic to finish off the semester.Overall, I would recommend this course. A lot of interesting material that once you learn, you will probably think everyone should learn. Very useful for thinking about how your own childhood has affected you and for being a good parent.As far as how overwhelming the workload is, you really have to judge for yourself based on the description I gave above. I personally found it hard to come up with much to write for the weekly entries but some people didn't and the final paper is not really presented by the professor as a very vigorous paper.If you're time-pressed, note that this class requires traveling to and from the Calvin Hill Center, located past the Divinity School, twice a week.",
    "A fun class with a manageable workload and an opportunity to teach young children and learn from an expert in early education."
