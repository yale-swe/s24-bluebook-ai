    "This was a great class, and very well taught by Professor Bakker too. We read around 150 lines each lesson, had four relatively straightforward quizzes and wrote a 10 page commentary essay. I found that the weekly preparation took rather a lot of time (perhaps a little bit more than is required in other Greek classes here), but the material was always enjoyable. Everyone who reads Greek ought to take this class.",
    "You read about 200-300 line of Homer each week and go over as much of the translation as is possible in class. Quizzes are biweekly. The rest of the grade comes from a midterm, a final, and a commentary paper. Overall this class was a good experience. We did not discuss in any great detail theories of Homeric composition or much of the history of Homer scholarship, but the class greatly improved my fluency at reading.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Take it. If you get the chance to take it with Prof. Bakker, it will blow your mind. There is nothing like reading Homer in the original.",
    "Iliad with Dr Bakker is a great way to improve your knowledge of Homer and your Greek generally. He spends a lot of time on linguistic and metrical issues (both particular to Homer and more general). On these he is an authority, and if you have any interest in prosody or diachronic study of Greek, you shouldn't miss the opportunity to learn from him. On the other hand, there is very little literary criticism or history in this class. You might still enjoy the class if that is your interest area, but you should be aware that Bakker really focuses more on the language of Homer than on the \"big picture.\"Workload: Reading is about 120 lines per class meeting, but there were assignments as low as 90 lines and as high as 150. There are biweekly quizzes, sometimes on tricky passages and sometimes more straightforward. We had a 10-page commentary due at the last class meeting (not called a final paper, but that's what it was). Midterm was very tough, final was reasonable. Also, Bakker may only assign the first 16 books in English, but you shouldreally read the entire poem in English early in the semester, especially if you have not read it recently.Majors\/non-majors: All Greek and Greek\/Latin majors should take this class - I'm surprised that it (and Virgil) are not required. Non-majors, be aware that it is not a seminar and is about Greek language, not Homer as literature. Also not a good first, or probably even second, L5 Greek class.",
    "See answer to question 1",
    "Great course. Egbert is a great professor and has a great sense of humor. The final project, a commentary on about 15 lines, seemed odd at first, but ended up being very interesting. And obviously, the material is great."
