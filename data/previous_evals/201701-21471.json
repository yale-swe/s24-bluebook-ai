    "I further developed my understanding of major theatrical trends in France across the 20th Century. The course was a great exercise in theatrical analysis.",
    "Given that I had minimal exposure to French for three years (prior to this semester), my writing and reading skills improved significantly. Due to the nature of the plays and the class's pace, managing the readings was always realistic. I found the essay assignments and the final monologue the most intellectually stimulating parts of the course.",
    "The course was an opportunity to learn a great deal about how to read and understand drama of an unconventional kind, and how then to translate it effectively onto the stage."

   "comments": [
    "I would venture to say that the course is inadequately named. It ought to be called \"20th Century Absurdist French Theater.\" I feel that the course as it stands doesn't entirely portray all of 20th century French theater and instead chooses to focus entirely on absurdist theater. That said, reading all absurdist pieces and engaging in a course devoted to absurdist french theater was really enjoyable.",
    "I found the class most engaging when Professor Semk lectured on the history of French theatre and the biography of the twentieth-century playwrights. I would have loved to hear more about his take on the plays and to have discussion questions to work off of (to diminish some aimless commentary)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to any French speaker interested in theater. The content of the course was great even if the discussion sometimes fell flat.",
    "Yes, if student is serious about theatre and has a good grasp of the French language. It was very difficult for some of my classmates who did not speak the language comfortably enough, and so I would not recommend it if this is the case.",
    "Even though the discussions sometimes felt rather slow-paced, I would encourage students to take French 245 if they would like to polish their speaking and writing skills, or if they would like to delve into the French absurdist movement. The material is certainly thought-provoking.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great little survey of absurdist drama in French, at a measured, more than reasonable pace."
