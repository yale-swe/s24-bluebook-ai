   "comments": [
    "DEFINITELY take this class. You will learn so much about filmmaking, and having a SHORT FILM at the end of senior year is the most satisfying feeling you could have. I would definitely recommend it over the Advanced Screenwriting class (which I took one semester of). I think you'll learn more about screenwriting and what works and what doesn't from making a film than you will by just writing a screenplay. And after school, people might not particularly want to read your screenplay, but they'll definitely want to see your short film. It's a lot of work though, and you can't half-assedly make a film -- so commit! It's totally worth it. Best choice I made all year.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it - it's a great learning experience even if it can feel a little overwhelming.",
    "This class is the most rewarding class for people who want to make films, direct, write, produce. It is the only class where you truly come out with an understanding in how films are made and what kind of emotional, intellectual and physical journey they entail.",
    "If you have any interest in entering the film profession as a director, take this course if you possibly can. The ability to cultivate a project over the course of one year, see that project grow and evolve, adapt to challenges, and at the end still emerge with a 20 minute film--a substantial short film and a critical part of any filmmakers portfolio--is a very inspiring and practical experience. The other people in the workshop are wonderful critics and supporters, and Jon is phenomenal."
