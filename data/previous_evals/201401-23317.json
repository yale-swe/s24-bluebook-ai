    "Definitely take nature writing with Dean Loge if it's offered in the fall! It's a gem of a course. The readings are wonderful, I'm far more conscious of my natural surroundings now, and I think I'm a better writer too. I loved it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Dean Loge is an amazing professor, and you'll learn so much about the genre of nature writing. So much of this course is also about exploring yourself and how nature may reflect your thoughts and feelings. I found it to be a very engaging course, and I throughly enjoyed it. The class has a few writing assignments and journal writings, and it's very nice to freely write about the nature around us.",
    "Nature Writing is an awesome class. Dean Loge is fantastic, the readings are interesting, and you get to keep a nature journal and go on nature walks!",
    "See Question 1.",
    "It is a shame that Dean is retiring. I don't know whether that means he'll never teach this class again or if he will just stop being a Dean. If it is the latter, TAKE NATURE WRITING. You will read some of the most beautiful essays, and seriously grow as a writer. I took 120 in the fall, and loved it, but 121 was my first time writing in a genre. It takes some time to get used to it, but by the end of the second essay, most people get it. Writing in a genre is a great way to think differently as a writer and improve your skills in general, all while meeting twice a week with one of the most awesome people on campus. He will engage in thought provoking discussions, and give you the best feedback on a paper you've ever gotten. He invests time in this class because he hopes you do too, and sees it as an equal partnership. Dean Loge is a genuine man.",
    "Think tree-hugging, granola-crunching hippy course, then remove any and all negative connotations, and add in valuable life lessons and legitimate college caliber writing and instruction. Voila. You can now write about trees and rocks and rivers without sounding like a hippy. Happy writing in the genre. Under the assumption that Dean Loge is leaving after next semester (Fall 14) I refer to the words of the poet Eminem: \"You've only got one shot, do not miss your chance to blow, opportunity comes once in a life time. Oh.\"",
    "Good class, good syllabus, good way to get to know the genre. Unfortunately, how much you get from the class is not determined by the professor, but the students-- so it's hit or miss.",
    "This class is part reading some of the best writers you won't read in any other class, part thinking about nature and our relationship to it, and part reflection on life at Yale. If you're only interested in nature or only interested in reading\/writing you might find it frustrating, and if you're coming from a background of seriously studying literature you might find it a little disorienting, but it makes the class incredibly unique, valuable, and rewarding. The syllabus is uniformly fantastic, full of incredible writers. The quality of class discussion tended to vary day to day because of the different backgrounds and goals of everyone in the class, but Dean was always there to steer us onto a fruitful track. Even if you're not sure if you're a \"writer,\" if you like the look of the syllabus take the chance--it's really cool to learn to write within a genre as complex, broad, and literary as nature writing is, and it was always interesting to read other students' pieces. Dean is a fascinating and remarkable teacher and a discerning reader. He is extremely helpful with papers and made our class environment unique and welcoming. I recommend the class especially if you're an upperclassman; be open to both its joyful eccentricity and its genuine rigor and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "We would have readings and journal entries due for out nature writing journals every day and would spend class period discussing those and often the papers we wrote (3) were inspired by such discussions. all papers were about our own individual experiences in nature.",
    "English 121 (Nature Writing) is a must-take class at Yale. It was by far the best class I\u2019ve taken at Yale so far. Dean Loge is a wonderful man who really understands students\u2019 feelings and conflicts and adapts the course accordingly. He is also witty and humorous and makes both the readings and the writings fun. Through this class I not only felt like I grew as a writer, but also that I achieved a better understanding of myself. The readings are great and comprehensive, and while there is a lot of them and they take a considerable amount of time to complete sometimes, they are extremely interesting and a great way to get away from the stress and bustle of Yale. The class as a whole is a great way to relax and forget about everything else on your mind. The writing assignments vary and there are not very many of them. I actually found myself wishing there had been more by the end of the semester as I had learned many things I wished to include in my writing but didn\u2019t get a chance to. Keeping a journal about nature is fun and a good way to observe small things that you may not notice otherwise. Also, the class discussions are great, and involve reading other students\u2019 journals and essays as well as discussing the readings and discerning important themes and concepts about nature writing from these discussions. I was extremely impressed with the breadth of the class and how well it was conducted and I really have nothing negative to say about it. Please take it. You will grow as a writer and a person and will be surrounded by super cool people. You even get to take a few nature field trips! Also, Dean Loge may be leaving soon, so take this class NOW! It would not be the same without him."
