   "comments": [
    "If you read the textbook you will have a great base of the lingo of accounting. I recommend it.",
    "Just what you'd expect.",
    "Practical-- take it because you will need it no matter what profession you enter. Good basic knowledge stuff.",
    "Only if you want to learn it for practical reasons.",
    "I recommend taking Accounting 170. It provides a lot of very useful, real world information about companies and their financial statements. Especially relevant for those interested in a career in finance.",
    "Not much work, but be ready to muster a mandatory-attendance 9am class.",
    "Yes. The material is interesting",
    "Straight forward. Study hard tho.",
    "Material and the class itself is very practical.Lecture is quite boring since it goes over the material that you are forced to learn the night before (assignments are due the night before each lecture).Take it if you feel it might help you with your summer\/post-graduation job and you can't force yourself to learn the material alone.",
    "It's a good class if you want to learn the basics of accounting but you'd probably need more than this to do things like DCF.",
    "The material is useful if you need to learn accounting for a job, and thr textbook is great. However the lectures are very dry and don't add anything, and the mandatory attendence for a 9am class is awful. If you have the discipline to just buy the textbook and read it on your own, then there is no reason to suffer though this class.",
    "If you have to know financial accounting for job etc., this is a painful way to have to read the book and somewhat learn the material.",
    "Yes I recommend",
    "Financial accounting is a course that teaches the basics of accounting. It is grounded in practicality, not theory. I would not recommend this class unless you are willing to learn 100% from the text book (but you have to go to class since he takes attendance). Also, the learnsmart modules are just tedious and dont aid tolearning much at all, Id prefer real problem sets where the professor and TF have to actually be engaged with course material instead of relying on technology and algorithms for grading.",
    "only if you're going into finance",
    "Yes, i would recommend accounting to anyone interested in getting a good grasp of accounting principles."
