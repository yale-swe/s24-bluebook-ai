   "comments": [
    "Chose interesting topics. Could slow down the pace of the course. One chapter per course is very fast paced and not enough time to absorb such a complex topic.",
    "This course is great, but it really is a lot of material. I'm not sure if there's a way to make it more engaging, though.",
    "Strengths: Covers broad range of material in accessible manner with public health focus. Also includes current research material and topics that were very interesting. General course structure was solid and well planned out. Fair and comprehensive tests.Weaknesses: Slides should be posted before lecture.",
    "Very interesting look at the intersection of microbial disease and the human immune system. Lots of interesting topics covered. Course was a little fast in the beginning and slowed at the end with all of the guest lectures. Maybe putting some of the guest lectures in the middle of the course would make the course feel a little more like a full class and less like a shortened class with end of course seminars",
    "A lot of material, covered in not a lot of time. The course felt rushed, though I don't really know how it could have been paced much better given how much material there was. A few suggestions: maybe try to integrate guest speakers better into the course instead of having all of the guest lectures at the end. They provide some perspective as far as how immunology is applied and considered in real public health work. The final exam could then be given at the end of the course, and the paper better integrated throughout the entire semester.",
    "Tough at first, but very rewarding. I really liked the textbook--easy to read and really helpful figures. Dr. Krause and Greg were both very helpful and approachable. Section was a fun way to learn more material. I enjoyed having the midterm and final before most other classes.",
    "It's a good intro to immunology, it's a little challenging at first, but it all comes together at the end and I think it will be useful for the future.",
    "The course is quit useful and the content is interesting. However, the first half was quite packed while the second half was relaxed. Some of the articles were quite complex. The multiple choice questions on the exams were a bit tricky. I am not sure that they were the best way to test our knowledge of the content. The lectures were a bit mundane at times.",
    "A good introduction into immunology. Difficult and lots of memorization, but I learned a lot"

    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Fair. Could slow down the pace of the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Adorable!",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Strengths: Knowledgeable and enthusiastic about course material! Very mindful of students feedback and concerns. Easy to communicate with. Slides were assembled in a comprehensive and easy to read manner with helpful diagrams. Enjoyed guest lecturers also.Weaknesses: Obviously a very knowledgeable lecturer would have have preferred more casual lecturing rather that reading off slides. Occasionally lectures were very fast.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very knowledgeable and easy to follow during class. Doing a little bit less reading directly from the slides would make the course much more enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very nice, very supportive, but talks too fast! I wish that he could have spent more of class time covering the general concepts of immunology to allow them to sink in, and save the specifics for homework assignments or for the paper. I got very little out of hearing about specific pathway components for many immunological processes which were, unfortunately, impossible to fully memorize in the short time of thecourse. A few case studies through homework assignments or the paper would have been more effective.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great teacher and always available to his students",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was very approachable and found a great way to teach a ton of material. Was very willing to help students do well in the course, through section, the tests, and the final paper.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very helpful and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is very helpful and wants everyone to do well. He is willing to give you individual help and he is open to opinions on how to make the course better.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a caring professor. He is genuinely interested in the well being of his students. And really took extra efforts to make sure we understood the content. I really enjoyed the fact that he took the time and effort to invite guest lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Excellent- he was always responsive to student suggestions and willing to work with the students to help them learn as much as they could."

    "Interesting and important.",

    "Yes this a good course and I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in immunology for the reasons given above.",
    "If you're taking this class, you most likely have to take this class. That said, you learn a lot even if you struggle to remember the specifics. The general concepts are the ones that matter. The relevance of the class to epidemiology is pretty weak (more or less one lecture at the end), but the relevance to infectious diseases is obvious. If you make use of your paper, you can start to understand just how fundamental the relationship is between the body and different causes of disease.",
    "Immunology is useful for an MPH student and they do learn a lot of immunology from this class.",
    "Tough but highly recommended!",
    "a must for epidemiologists!",
    "I say take it, you might be able to opt out, but it's an interesting course and not as hard as it seems. Dr. Krause is a great teacher and the guest lecturers at the end were FANTASTIC!",
    "Yes, I would because the content is good and the instructor is also good. I would warn them to be prepared to keep up with the readings."
