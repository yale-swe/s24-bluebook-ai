    "LOVED THIS CLASS. The subject is so very interesting and Professor Ana de La O is so devoted to the topic and the material that it makes each class worth going to. The readings and Professor de la O's enthusiasm were definite strengths. The syllabus was seamless and each reading built-on\/transitioned into each new topic with ease. Although it was technically a lecture, professor de La O's style is more seminar-based so class was always a conversation rather than her just talking at us. There is a TON of reading every week and you really have to be on top of it because she asks questions and it is more of a discussion than a lecture but the articles\/research papers are all current and interesting. Other than reading there isn't much work: a midterm, presentation and final. You'll get more out of the class if you have a background in statistics but it isn't necessary to understand the material and to do well.",

    "Yes! Great introduction to the myriad of challenges facing young democracies.",
    "This was a great class, a good overview of the challenges that face young democracies. Not very much work, and Professor de la O is a great lecturer. The readings are quite statistics-heavy, however, so it might be beneficial to have some basic background in statistics in order to get the most out of the class.",
    "Global Affairs 263 is a class that requires a very good understanding of the course readings in order to perform well in class. The more a student engages the readings and her fellow students in class discussions, the more she will understand what is being taught."
