   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class, we did a huge range of assignments and I learned a lot about fonts and their history as well as about design.",
    "I would recommend it so long as you are willing to do a lot of work. Unless you plan on doing Graphic Design or Book Design in the future, some of the projects can seem a little useless.",
    "I am now in love with typography. I had always been interested in it but now I have a much greater appreciation of the topic. Alice is extremely informative and a fantastic professor, and her projects allow you to explore a number of different aspects to typography. Highly recommended.",
    "Type I was one of my favorite classes taken at Yale. The class is about so much more than just \"fonts\" - it works with type as a visual language. There are many of assignments (which often overlap) but you learn something tangible from each. I can't recommend it enough!Also, Professor Chung is amazing.",
    "Definitely. If you want to learn how to make a good poster with type or a book, you have to take this class.",
    "Yes, if you have any, even vague, interest in typography, take this class. Professor Chung is excellent, and you will improve SO MUCH at putting words on a page and making them look beautiful. It's hard to think of a profession where this wouldn't come in handy.",
    "If you're into typography or graphic design, or even if you think you might be but you're not sure, I'd definitely recommend this class. Alice is a wonderful teacher, the assignments are really fun, and you will never look at printed matter the same way again."
