    "The course is a survey in biological topics and reserach that have either informed treatment or diagnosis in the clinic or whose understanding was advanced by studies from clinical medicine. We covered a wide array of topics, including influenza virus, the spliceosome, non-coding RNAs, EBV, HPV vaccination, telomerase, various blood cancers, immunology, laminopathies, etc. The course is structured so that on Mondays, a different MB&B faculty member who is an expert in that week's topic gives a lecture on the biological and medical aspects of the topic and on Wednesdays, students are placed into groups of 3 and complete a group quiz. Quizzes are based on primary literature that is assigned after the Monday lecture (usually 2-3 reviews and 2-3 research papers). The course also has students complete a mini-literature review on a disease of the spliceosome and then a final paper (literature review + research proposal) on a disease of their choosing.",
    "I learned how to better read scientific literature and how to synthesize an experiment proposal.",
    "This course has a heavy focus on reading primary literature in biochemical fields, so you definitely get used to reading a lot of research papers and reviews. We also wrote a mini-review as well as a grant proposal for a potential research project.",
    "I became far more comfortable with reading, understanding, and studying scientific literature. I also thought more about how to be precise and clear in my writing about scientific literature; I didnt get to practice this much on the group quizzes due to time constraints, but I was able to do it more when we wrote our research papers. The papers, especially the final paper, gave me more respect for the materials and methodology section of research papers (since we had to write one) and also was a great practice in comprehensively reviewing scientific literature in order to propose and answer a scientific question. The final paper was probably the most helpful part of the class for me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are the wide variety of topics and the work-load. I liked having a different faculty member lecture each week. It felt like a great way to meet many of the MB&B faculty and I also enjoyed learning topics from experts in the field. We also read a wide variety of primary literature and I definitely feel like my confidence in reading and understanding papers has increased. Because of the structure of the course, you really only have to care about it between Monday and Wednesday as there is no prep for the Monday lecture. While you definitely need to read the papers for the Wednesday quiz, overall I felt that the workload was very manageble (especially for a 400 level MB&B seminar). The weaknesses of the course are the lack of discussion and stressful nature of the quizzes. Although we read primary literature every week, we almost never actually discussed the papers. The weekly quizzes on the papers were usually composed of hyper-specific questions about a certain part from one figure. There was certainly much more to read than was asked on the quiz, and you could probably get away with not understanding 90% of the papers and still do well on the quiz. The quizzes are also a little stressful because they are timed quizzes. You and your random 2 partners have to come up with full answers by the end of class. Because the questions tended to ask hyper-specific things, sometimes you could spend a lot of time with your group digging through the 4+ papers to find that one specific line you needed to answer the question. I wish that instead of a weekly quiz, maybe every other week instead of a group quiz we had a group discussion of just one paper (but more in-depth). I think I would have benefited greatly from going through a whole paper start-to-finish with Dr. Steitz and the rest of the class.",
    "I sometimes felt like the lectures were not very related to the material asked on the quizzes. I also felt like more guidance would have been helpful in writing the final paper. Going over abstract was very helpful but I felt like the end of the course was a bit rushed.",
    "I was REALLY looking forward to this course, and it was a huge disappointment. The way this class works, you are unable to actually understand a lot about the papers you read. Instead, there's a focus on answering hyper-specific questions in a limited period of time. I was hoping for a more relaxed seminar where we actually get to discuss the papers, but that's not at all what happens. Instead, those with a lot of past research and bio-class experience dominate answering the questions, leaving others sometimes with little contribution and confused. The TAs were generally helpful in helping out, but the structure of the class is really not for actually understanding or learning much about the research. I found that, when asking questions before our group question-answering began, the TAs were somewhat upset whenever someone actually had a question. Also, the fact that a different professor teaches every week has its positives but also a lot of drawbacks. It means there's very little consistency between the ways both lectures and question sets work.",
    "A strength of the course is that it forces you to read scientific literature quickly while still understanding it well, a skill that is difficult to hone but essential. The class also encourages group work since we have group discussions (basically quizzes) almost every week. The papers, especially the final paper, gave me more respect for the materials and methodology section of research papers (since we had to write one) and also was a great practice in comprehensively reviewing scientific literature in order to propose and answer a scientific question. I also appreciated how, for the final paper, we were given benchmarks to hit each week (have an abstract by this date, have an outline by this date, etc.) to make sure we didnt put it off until the last second. Lastly, the abstract discussion for the final paper was enjoyable and helpful, and it was during that time that I most felt like a scientist discussing research with other scientists (probably because, in that case, it was our own research we were discussing). A weakness of the course is that, unlike when reading literature for the sake of doing your own research, you dont know what in a paper is important (i.e., you dont know what will be assessed and what wont be). The study questions provided for papers helped with narrowing the focus of our studies, but the utility of them varied with the guest lecturer, so maybe streamlining these questions would be helpful. I also think it would be nice to, in addition to teaching fellow providing comments on group quizzes, also provide model answers for the quizzes, so that students understand what kinds of things theyre expected to say and how they can say them concisely. Throughout the semester, I felt like I was being told to be more concise in answers without being shown how to do that, and I think that model answers would help a lot. Regarding the course having almost entirely guest lecturers, I dont see this as a weakness or a strength; that is, it didnt lower the courses quality, but I also dont think it contributed much, apart from the fact that it allowed us to see a diversity of topics (if Professor Steitz had lectured on all of these same topics on her own, I think I would have liked the class just as well). That being said, some lecturers, especially Professors Strobel and Schatz, were spectacular lecturers who give some justification to the guest lecture idea. Professor Changs attempt to make his lecture very medically-oriented was also laudable."

    "I would encourage someone who is thinking about taking this course to shop it and see if it is right for them. In general, I think this is one of the better upper-level MB&B electives. The workload is not overly high, Dr. Steitz is cool, and it is refreshing to finally see how the things that you've spent so many long semesters learning are relevant to what you want to do (assuming the average person that takes this course is premed). However, don't come into this thinking that it will be stress-free or that you will engage very deeply with the primary literature. The course is kind of like a whirlwind of lectures and papers I feel like I spent most of the course trying to drink from a fire hydrant (but only for three days of the week). The timed weekly quizzes tend to test on hyper-specific things and can be a little stressful, especially if there is a conflict in your group over what the answer should be (or, more commonly, if nobody in the group knows what the answer should be). The final paper was also fairly challenging and required a lot of thinking and experimental design that I don't feel like the course adequately prepared us for. It was also due in the middle of reading period, so keep that in mind for your semester planning. Overall I feel like I got to engage with clinically relevant biochemistry at a fairly high level and met some cool faculty and would recommend the course to someone looking for an upper-level elective where you read quite a bit a of literature (but understand only a small portion of it).",
    "Yes, this is a great MB&B elective. Lectures are super interesting and you usually get to hear about the topic directly from the person who did some of the work they are talking about. Working in groups to do the quizzes is collaborative and low stress.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. It's a lot of work and you don't get a lot out of it. It's a class that favors folks who have a strong research background and a lot of experience in other bio classes, so it's not super accessible to everyone.",
    "Sure. Its a great way to dive into scientific literature more deeply, which is great especially if youre a senior getting ready to do your senior essay. I think that the medical part of this class wasnt as present as I would have liked, but the basic science was definitely there and could be really interesting. Also, to pre-meds who are taking the class while applying to medical school: the professors and TFs will work with you regarding having to miss class for interviews. As a heads-up, if you miss a Monday class, you have to read the papers for that week without the benefit of the lecturer explaining the topic to you and showing you whats important, and if you miss a Wednesday class, you dont miss any content but you have to do the group quiz on your own. So, when scheduling interviews, you kind of have to pick your poison (but its honestly fine in the end, they dont grade harshly and, again, they get the struggle)."
