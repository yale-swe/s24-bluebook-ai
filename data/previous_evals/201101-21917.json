   "comments": [
    "Excellent survey of chromatic harmony....gives you the tools to understand late Chopin, Wagner, late Liszt, etc. once Roman numerals and traditional analyses fail you. Very intense workload, but worth it in the end.",
    "Good theory course. Beware, it's a lot of work. But if you get into it then it can be extremely rewarding.",
    "This course presents an excellent fresh (at least to me) approach towards late romantic harmony. The focus is heavily on analysis, but as a composer, I have found many uses for the concepts and techniques covered in this class.",
    "Any music major should take this course. The material is difficult, but it is also incredibly useful for understanding the music of the 19th century and beyond.",
    "Intensive discussions of very specific moments in Romantic compositions. Really cool if you're interested in the intersection of harmony with voice leading or if you just like the repertoire. A major focus of the class concerns the grey areas between traditional functional harmony and harmony based on other constructs- diminished 7th chords, augmented chords, Weitzmann regions, and the like. Take this class if you're a music major, especially if you're a composer who could use some brushing up on this stuff.",
    "If you are wiling to do a large, very large amount of work, I would recommend this course without any reservation whatsoever to any music student. It was incredible.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a great way to get to know some of the music that significantly changed harmonic rules in the 19th century.",
    "One of the absolute best music courses at Yale. Professor Cohn is the ideal seminar leader, thoughtful and patient with all his students. The class takes the form of a discussion each class of a piece or section of a piece of music that you have been asked to look at, often with the introduction of a couple of new theoretical concepts to help you understand the piece. Workload is very consistent: a medium-length analysis of a section of piece of music is due each week, and you are expected to prepare for discussion. Nothing beyond that except a big presentation and paper at the end of the semester. Basically, if you enjoy sitting down and taking apart wonderful pieces of music that you probably don't know too well in group discussion and\/or learning an entirely different way of looking at Romantic harmonic syntax, apart from the standard functional\/tonal way, this class is definitely for you."
