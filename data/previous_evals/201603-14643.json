    "I learned not only about the historical aspects of photography, I learned about its place within society as a utility and an art form. This class taught me to look at all photographic works skeptically and allowed me a greater understanding of the photographic process as a whole.",

    "The discussions in class were always interesting as were the readings. My only suggestion would be to incorporate just a bit more lecturing into the daily class schedule and follow up with discussion.",
    "It was very interesting to analyze photographs and be able to experience history ourselves through them, but the class itself was definitely a little long for the material that we covered."

    "I would definitely recommend it. The class was rewarding and interesting without being overbearing and allowed for more focus on the material and learning rather than stressing about assignments. Before taking this class I had never thought about or considered the way our society interacts with photography and it has granted me new perspectives regarding the art form so commonly used today.",
    "Yes! I loved the course. I thought the material was really interesting and I loved the teacher."
