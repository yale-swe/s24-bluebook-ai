    "Dense readings.",
    "Overview of some major works and concepts in contemporary social theory. Average workload.",
    "SOCY 152 offers a good base line of contemporary sociologist and social issues. I would recommend this class if you are going into sociology and want to know about basic theories in the field, and how they are applied to the real world.",
    "If your interested in philosophy of sociology and theory, it is definitely a great course with a manageable, reasonable amount of work.",
    "Not for beginners but take if daring. I would recommend this to people looking to really dive into sociology. Good theories course. Be prepared to read a lot and study the works on your own.",
    "I thought it was a good course. I am glad to have had the chance to read the works on the syllabus. Sometimes class discussion was a little frustrating because it seemed that not everyone had helpful things to contribute. There is a fair amount of reading for this class and I found the essays challenging, but it was manageable.",
    "A good introductory course to sociological theory, which will give an important basic repertoire of thinkers encountered over and over again - even in other field such as anthropology, political science, philosophy, history etc."
