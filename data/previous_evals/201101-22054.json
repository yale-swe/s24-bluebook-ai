   "comments": [
    "I would have liked to spend more time on MatLab and Mathematica. I also would have liked to cover more diverse applications of the programming languages we covered; I feel like we did a lot of data-shuffling and calculations, where it would have been cool to do some graphics and maybe some statistical stuff. However, by the end you are quite fluent in both Fortran and C++. The workload is easy--one problem set per week, and two midterms, with an optional final (to replace a midterm you'd like to improve the score on--but this can only help you!)Overall, a friendly and useful class.",
    "A good class. Be sure to read the textbooks, though -- otherwise if you're like me and new to programming the learning curve is steep and lecture alone will not cut it.",
    "130 is a good intro course to Fortran77 and C++. I recommend it, but know that as a lecture, some of the material is inherently self-taught once you get started.",
    "Testing the waters of computer programming.",
    "This class will give you a good understanding and skill in Fortran and C++, as well as just improving your abilities in computer programming in general. Working through the homework problems, which can sometimes be challenging, is the best and most effective part of this course. I would recommend this class to anyone who is not experienced with computer programming, or only slightly experienced, and would like to learn it well.",
    "Yes, ENAS 130 absolutely rocked. It is a wonderful introduction to C++ and Fortran. Although both languages are slowly becoming outdated, it is important that you get an idea of how programming originated to a get full perspective of what you can do in programming as you take on next-generation languages like Python and Pearl.",
    "Fair class. If you already know the basics of c++ I would recommend taking a higher level though.",
    "For MechEs, required, but not a bad class by any means.",
    "Compy for Engies helped me go from pro to nub in one semester flat. Half-semester on FORTRAN 77, the other on C++. FORTRAN is great place to start, and C++ is incredibly relevant\u0097even past science. I'm an art major, and this class was a blast. I'd put it in my top five classes at Yale (probably for Prof. O'Hern). He has worked out the kinks since 2008, and the material is really solid. I imagine the ten problem sets took an average of seven hours\/week for the class. There were two midterms, and the final was optional (replaced lower of the two midterms).This class is a gem. It's better than Intro to Programming or CS if you can hold your own.",
    "I do not, under any circumstances, recommend this course. If you've programmed before (i.e. AP Comp Sci or similar), you'll find it useless, tedious, and annoying. If you haven't, you'll likely be terrified and confused. WHY WOULD YOU EVER INTRODUCE FORTRAN 77 AS A FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE?!",
    "ENAS 130 was a great course. I thought it was fairly graded and I learned a lot. Be aware that the problem sets take much, much longer than normal, and are pretty challenging at times.",
    "i'd try to take it with marshall long. the prof's lectures are tbh not very helpful at all and (even though he said not to say this in the evals) for a couple of lectures only showed up for ~15min each lecture because another one of his lectures overlapped (whether it is his fault or not, i think it is fair to point this out, it was the students' loss in receiving less instruction regardless). the promised lectures in matlab\/mathematica never really happened, since he was also gone for a week for a conference. the grading policy is pretty awesome, so take advantage of that as you will, but expect to be teaching yourself the languages from the books (which is what a lot of people do with programming languages anyway).",
    "Not so good. Professor O'Hern's teaching was difficult to follow at times. During the second half of the semester for around three weeks, Professor O'Hern showed up 25 minutes late every Monday and Wednesday because he was scheduled to teach another class at the time. It's surprising that such a conflict could occur, and he should have been aware of it at the beginning of the semester. We did not complete the syllabus (mathematic and matlab).",
    "Honestly, it's useful to know how to program. It will come in handy. But don't take it for fun, and don't take it with O'Hern.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in prorgamming. The curve is generous and the final is optional.",
    "really good for Scientists and Engineers -- this is NOT a computer science course.",
    "Take CPSC 112 instead, especially if you have no programming experience. You will cover half of what CPSC 112 covers in 2 weeks. I took both CPSC 112 and ENAS 130, and I can say that you go in much more depth and really learn to program well in CPSC 112. In this class, the professor just throws out all these topics and expects you to be familiar with them. Plus, it was disorganized.",
    "I would not recommend this class to other students. If you are interested in learning the basics of programming and have no prior experience, this class will be unnecessarily difficult. The problem sets are frustrating if you're a newcomer to the world of coding and the class isn't very helpful in teaching the material. The professor is a great guy, yet you may find yourself looking for more instruction.",
    "I actually liked this class. The problem sets were ridiculously long, at least for me (like, 15 hours would be good time) because I'd never programmed before and the class isn't really well taught. The prof did tell us, though, that if a problem took more than 3 hours to do, we should email him and he'd let us stop. I learned to program, but class was just a guide, the internet is what really taught me (although problem sets\/exams were more motivation than I would normally be able to give). Corey is funny and tells random stories. He's kinda like a native speaker teaching a language: he knows what works, but not really why or other ways, and sometimes doesn't teach the little things because he assumes they're known.If you have to take this class, do it with Corey, his grading policy can't be beat. If you need to learn C++ and Fortran, take it. If you just want to learn programming, this class is decent.",
    "This class is exactly what it promises. You will learn the basics of c++ and fortran.This class will be useful if you've done a little programming in these languages, but not if you've done a whole lot - for example, I understand classes in c++ much better than I did before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The psets are doable and the course is fun!",
    "Most people that take this course are required to take it, but either way it's helpful and not much of a burden.",
    "Programming is fun, but this class isn't great. Professor O'Hern is a great person but not a good lecturer; his lectures were confusing and sometimes inconsistent. Also somehow he managed to double-book himself teaching another class at the same time during the second half of the semester; not very organized. I did most of my learning from the textbooks. C++ is a very good language to know; Fortran is a pain. We didn't get to Mathematica or Matlab, but I'm not surprised as I don't know how anyone thought it was possible to teach four languages in one semester.",
    "You do learn stuff, though it might not be the most interesting, engaging course you take at Yale. Workload is medium, and tests are reasonable.",
    "Take it because you have to, but if Corey O'Hern is teaching this class again, DO NOT TAKE IT. Worst class experience I have had so far at Yale. Also: you will not learn MatLab or Mathematica even though it is listed that you will do them for a week each on the syllabus. This class was alright for the first half, but once we got to C++, Prof. O'Hern only used examples listed in the text book and simply seemed not to care at all. Do not take this class for a fun programming experience because it is all about applications and most of the programs ended up being data analysis from files (which is useful in science and engineering)but take an intro class from the computer science department if you want to have fun.",
    "It's a requirement so if you're taking it you probably have to. No problem anyway.",
    "This class gave a quick introduction to a couple different programming languages. I left the class feeling like I could program enough to accomplish basic tasks, but by no means as an adept programmer.Prof. O'Hern was a really fun guy! He wasn't always the best with scheduling, and we didn't get through all the material he promised we would at the the beginning of the semester, but he tried his best to make up for the shortcomings of the class. His exam structure was unbeatable -- two midterms and an optional final.",
    "The course may motivate you to do what you could do on your own--read a book or two on programming. People didn't pay much attention in class itself because it was in the book. The workload was low. Professor O'Hern digresses in lecture, and we covered things relatively slowly.",
    "Good class on Fortran and C++ with a limited amount of Mathematica\/Matlab. Problem sets are very easy except for the last few which take a tick more time, exams are very simple. Professor is kind and eccentric, very willing to help. Take if you have little to no programming background and want to learn programming with a bent towards scientific research.",
    "Rough course. Concepts not always presented clearly in class; most of the learning came from reading the textbooks. That said, Professor O'Hern made himself very available outside of class to set up appointments to go over material. Strengths: optional final - you know your grade going into the final, and the final can only improve it. Still, the final is really long. Weaknesses: hard to follow lectures, psets had little correlation with midterms, class time was cut short during second half (I know that wasn't Prof. O'Hern's fault, but perhaps he could have come up with a better solution to gain back time lost). Do well on the first two midterms so you don't have to take the final. This would have been an easy C\/D\/F course.",
    "It's a programming class for those who haven't programmed before. I did a little bit of TI-83 programming, so the first week or so was easy. Then it got interesting.It's a little weird learning 2 languages at once. Lecture style of the professor wasn't very helpful, but I learn via problem sets anyway (Problem sets are pretty managable)",
    "Do not take this class with Professor O'Hern. If you already know c++ you will spend class time doing your homework. If you don't know c++ you will be completely lost. Either way, you will be in agony during the fortran unit. If you do take this class, it probably will not be worth your time to go to lecture.Professor O'Hern is a nice guy to talk to individually but his lectures are incomprehensible and filled with stories about how he likes to yell at ambulance drivers. Most of his examples are pulled from the textbook (although several editions old) and the book does a much better job of explaining them then he does. Also, he got himself double booked to teach two courses at the same time for about a month, so many classes were only 20 minutes in length.",
    "Unless you have to take this class for your major (like me), or already have some programming knowledge, then this class is not for you. Many students already know how to program in one language or another, giving them a huge advantage over the inexperienced students (isn't this an intro class?). I paid attention in class, read the textbook thoroughly and went to the review sessions, but this was not enough to succeed on the assignments (presumably due to the fault of the professor).Speaking of the professor, due to a scheduling conflict (it is unclear whether this was his fault or that of the department), for part of the semester Professor O'Hern only showed up to class for 100 minutes per week, instead of the normal 150. This, quite honestly, was ridiculous. Unfortunately, this ridiculous feeling was not uncommon in this class. I would often walk out of lecture with absolutely no knowledge of what I had just \"learned,\" nor any clue of how to even start that week's homework assignment.Have fun :) (P.S. we were not taught MATLAB)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in learning to program. It's a really helpful skill to have and it's fun to learn. You learn Fortran 77 (which no one uses anymore) and C++ and have gained a basic understanding of how all programming languages work, so learning new ones will be comparatively easy.",
    "I would recommend this class based purely on utility. If you already know c++ you'll be wasting your time, but if you want to get a good grounding in the basics this is a relatively painless way to do it. I found that going to lecture was optional -- Corey posts all his notes on classesv2 and it's kind of pointless to sit there and listen to him read them. I did AP in high school so I came in with some basic knowledge which made things easier, but even without that it's not a huge time commitment -- I spent about 5 hours a week on psets. Not the best course ever, but solid.",
    "This class was a good introduction to Fortran and C++. Professor O\u0092Hern is extremely chill and very helpful one on one. His grading policy is also excellent: 33% for the homework and each midterm, plus an optional final to replace one of the midterms if you want it. Lectures are sometimes a bit disorganized, but everything you need to know is on the notes he posts to the server, and like with any programming class, most of the learning takes place when you do the problem sets. Not a bad class though.",
    "The course gives a good overview of fortran and c++, though it's sometimes required to figure things out on your own. Homework assignments take a lot of time, just keep that in mind.",
    "Good programming class--take this instead of a comp sci course as it focuses on application instead of theory.",
    "Pros:1. Exposes you to multiple programming languages (Fortran and C++), giving you a wider understanding of the comp sci field.2. Pretty fun, as coming up with code to solve a problem is a bit like solving a puzzle.Cons:1. Since it does teach multiple languages, this course doesn't allow you to take your knowledge to any super cool heights, keeping you solving numerical methods problems and the like.2. Teaching style: May vary by professor, but my prof tried to move too quickly in lectures, not giving us enough time to analyze example code, keeping us from really understanding a good number of the topics.",
    "This class taught the basics of Fortran and C++. It is a good start to programming, but it definitely helps if one has a basic knowledge of programming. The professor is very helpful and always responds to emails quickly. If you want to do engineering, it is a required class, but it is definitely helpful and worth it."
