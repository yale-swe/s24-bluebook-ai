    "I understand the basics of why the economy works the way it does. I got a lot more practice on economic thoughts and how countries interact.",
    "A solid overview of macroeconomic concepts, and much better understanding of macroeconomic debates that I read about in the news on a daily basis.",
    "This course is invaluable for anyone wishing to enter public policy or understand how markets work. Of all the \"hard-skill\" courses I have taken at Yale, Macroeconomics is perhaps the most important.",
    "Great working knowledge of macroeconomics. I found much what I learned to be applicable in other courses, such as political economy. Also, helped deepen understanding of arguments I come across on a daily basis in the news.",
    "Macro is hard, man! I think the intuition for Macro is really tough to understand. I gained a lot of language and insight about very basic economic principles, but it made me feel like the more you know, the less you know--you know?",
    "I learnt a lot about macroeconomic concepts underlying inflation, unemployment and the relevant fiscal and monetary policy responses under the ISLMFE model. I also understood a lot more about the foreign exchange market and how exchange rates were determined across countries.",
    "Understanding of the role of macro-economics in current affairs and non-quantitative understanding of the macroeconomics as related to public policy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - instructor was great - the class moved at a good pace and the group work was good. Would it be possible to have a TF for this class?",
    "Strengths: Every class was fun and engaging, and the pace was neither too fast nor too slow. Weaknesses: None for me, although the course will likely not be rigorous enough for those who want to use economics extensively in their careers post-Jackson.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was Prof. Caliendo's instruction. One of the better instructors I have ever had; very engaging and always made sure everyone understood what was being taught before moving on to the next topic. The only weakness is that I wish we had more time to spend on open economies. However, given the length of the semester and \"newness\" of economics to many of the Jackson students, I'm not sure if this would have been possible this semester.",
    "Great course. I think it would be possible to move quicker at the beginning. Math (some) could also be useful at times. I would not change the course to make this a heavy requirement, but present it as a supplement. Sometimes it helps clarify the intuition.",
    "I think the course, honestly, could be improved with more problem sets. Especially since there was no reading for the course, the workload was pretty light (except the day before psets were due). There's a couple of other things too: 1. Sometimes course material wasn't strengthened through psets and then appeared on the exam 2. Some material was covered too quickly to be made reasonable sense of (exchange rates)",
    "It was well organised so that we could gradually build upon our knowledge instead of being overwhelmed with a load of concepts all at the same time. Some lessons spent on revision were slightly repetitive in order to reinforce our understanding; we could have spent time on related additional material and examples instead.",
    "The course was fantastic. The only thing I would ask for is more in class analysis of articles in order to relate them to the models. This was excellent practice, and deepened my understanding of the models in every case."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to another student. I'm not a macro or micro person - but this helped me understand basic macro economic principles.",
    "Highly. It was fun, engaging, and I learned a lot. I wasn't looking for a high-workload course, though.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes! I think this should be a requirement for all MA students. Micro provides a great foundation, but Macro is much more important for future policy-makers.",
    "Yes. This should become a core requirement for Jackson students.",
    "Yes--Lorenzo was great and is patient with students about Macro intuition. He is a dynamic teacher and fun to be in class with--even at 9 am!",
    "It was very useful to gain an understanding of macroeconomic policies used by the government and the relevant implications which are directly relevant to the world today.",
    "Yes. Good introduction to macroeconomics for public policy."
