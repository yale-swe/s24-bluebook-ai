    "I found this class somewhat challenging, and I'm pretty sure I didn't get a very good grade in it, but it was definitely worth it. It's probably the first writing class I had that I've really enjoyed, and Professor Longmire was a very good teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a student who wants to improve his or her writing. The writing is what takes up most of your time, because the readings are very short and interesting essays.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who needs to work on their nonfiction writing or who enjoys writing. However, it wasn't my favorite class, and I am someone who writes a lot.",
    "Yes! It is a good class to get the feeling of college writing and understand how your writing will be evaluated. There is not much reading, and the writing topics are pretty broad, so if that is something you are looking for, then I definitely recommend this class.",
    "English 120 is a class for the writer who feels confident in their ability to write typical expository papers and who wants to explore his\/her personal voice through nonfictional essays. I took this class because I wanted to try a different style of writing than I the kind I did in high school and this class definitely met my expectations. I would recommend it to other students. It made me feel more comfortable with my writing and also changed the way I approach writing and revisions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to any other student-- the readings are fun, and so is the writing. It's a different type of writing than you'll do in most other classes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I feel that this course has helped me grow as a writer. It has taken me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to try writing in a new style. I also enjoyed the material that we read for class and consistently looked forward to our class discussions.",
    "Definitely take the course",
    "English 120 is unlike any English course I've ever taken in high school and I loved it! The broad prompts for essays give you so much stylistic freedom and elbow room as a writer. I found myself taking risks in my writing in ways that I never have before. The readings were always enjoyable and very manageable (Professor Longmire does this so we have the opportunity to read them twice). Professor Longmire also does a great job of facilitating discussion, though I wish we (the students) would have faced each other rather than saying our responses to the professor. Workshops (peer editing essays) and Professor Longmire's comments on drafts helped me improve my writing a lot. Overall, I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend it. It's useful to develop better writing skills regardless of what field you enter."
