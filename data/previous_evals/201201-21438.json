    "I would recommend this course. If you haven't read the Iliad or the odyssey, now's the time. This approach--studying everything from archeology to contemporary art history in the form of a daily slide presentation--makes your reading a visual experience.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in the Trojan War and\/or ancient art. The reading load may seem a bit intimidating at points, but it's spread over a completely manageable timeline. And the lectures are very interesting! Take this course-",
    "This class involves reading the major works of Homer, and then studying archaeological evidence that either matches descriptions by Homer or came from the geographic areas where the cultures of Homer were located. I really enjoyed taking this class, and strongly recommend it to those interested. Studying the archaeological evidence of the Trojan War is a different way to approach these epics, and I found it not only enjoyable but also an enlightening experience."
