   "comments": [
    "I would not take this course unless you want to be in inorganic chemistry. If you are interested in organic chemistry you see a couple of interesting examples, but the focus is really very much on the mechanism of organometallic reactions. If you like physical chemistry there is absolutely no relevance to that interest in the material presented.",
    "No problem sets, so you really have to go to lecture and take good notes. You end up teaching yourself a lot of the material.",
    "Very low workload class but you won't get a ton out of it if you've already taken 252. In fact, I would say don't take this class unless you're likely to work with organometallic compounds in your research (unless you're just looking for the easiest chem elective, of which this is one of the best).",
    "This course covers an important subset of inorganic chemistry, mostly molecular rather than materials science. Closely follows professor Crabtree's book, though there is not quite a 1:1 correlation. Many specific cases from industry and academia covered with real-world uses of the material emphasized.",
    "Organometallic's is a tricky subject but interesting. Professor Crabtree's book is really useful and staying on top of the course is important because there aren't any problem sets. If you liked Chem 252 and are interested in building on the second half of that course, then you'll like this class."
