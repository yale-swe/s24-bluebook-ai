    "Yes but they were not well utilized by this course, even though they could have been for testing and fabrication. Also Josh Rowley needs to change his attitude and be more helpful to students. He calls himself an instructor so it\u0092s about time he start acting like one instead always acting irritated and moody.",

    "The resources have been excellent for the class.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes.hopefully the fabrication shop will continue to be equally accommodating as we embark on the construction of the pavilion.",
