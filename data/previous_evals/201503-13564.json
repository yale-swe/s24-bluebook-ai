    "This course provided a solid and rigorous grounding in the EPA's clean power plan (CPP). Prof Sussman did a good job of making the material available to students with different levels of background knowledge. The assignment to write a memo for state implementation was very useful - it forced me to look at the CPP in a new light and really understand the challenges of implementation for certain states."

I think the classes on the CPP itself were much more useful that the some of the initial background classes, but Prof Sussman was very accommodating - accelerating launch into main material in response to students' requests."
