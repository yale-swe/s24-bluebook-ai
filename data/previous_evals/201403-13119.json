   "comments": [
    "This class comes down to two words. Writing and reading. Every week a draft of a paper is due, so it's nonstop writing and editing. Also, the readings can be extremely time consuming. Putting forth this much effort to becoming a better writer, however, certainly will help you write better, much better. Its up to you to decide if the workload is worth the payoff.",
    "It's okay. If you have to take an english class this isn't a terrible one, but I didn't love it or anything. Prof. McCabe is cool, but her comments can be really confusing and she isn't always helpful. Also sometimes she'll change her mind about where she wanted you to go in a paper which can be super frustrating after you've tried really hard. Also she grades very harshly, so don't take this if you want an A.",
    "Really great way to earn a writing credit and also learn something extremely valuable in the process. The range of writing styles and prompts we cover are useful for any type of writing that we have to do (eg. personal essays, journalistic-style pieces, interviews)",
    "Awesome class for developing a genuine voice in your writing. The readings are short and very fun (a lot of New Yorker essays), the five papers are very manageable, and the revision process allows you to grow a lot as a writer. Even if you think that personal essay writing won't apply in your future life (I'm a bio major--I used to think that too), it actually will, because English 120 allows you to find your voice and deliver your message in a way that makes people actually want to listen to you. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would say it is learning how to write a creative non-fiction essay, with a lot of emphasis on techniques. I would recommend it if the student was interesting in creative writing, but not if he wasn't.",
    "I would recommend - it is a fairly good course - I feel like I learned a lot about how to improve my writing. The readings for the course are interesting and fun to read, but can be too much at a time. The grading is very, very strict, and considering the limited time we have to spend writing our essays, it's very difficult to get a good grade on a paper. I felt like the grading was subjective sometimes too, as if you had to write to fit the professor's taste for it to be acceptable. Good course overall. I learned a lot.",
    "English 120 is hyped up to be a must-take course, and it is certainly a great course that provides opportunities to learn about yourself while writing about yourself, but the quality of the course really depends on the charisma of your instructor and the participation of the class. The course is not very \"academic\" in that most, if not all the readings consist of New Yorker-style essays. Good English course for non-English majors, and a good course to take credit-D.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for a WR or to take a fun class.",
    "English 120 is a writing intensive class that focuses on developing your narrative and journalistic writing, requiring more introspection and storytelling than typical analytical writing. I definitely think the class helps you grow as a writer, but while I would definitely recommend taking English 120, I would strongly discourage taking this section with this professor. Professor McCabe was unclear about what she wanted from students in their essays, but simultaneously had a very definite idea of what was good and bad writing, with little openness to writing styles and approaches different from her own. She raises many irrelevant questions in the first draft, but when you address these, she raises similar, equally irrelevant questions in the final draft. Her grading is not at all transparent, and even if she suggests that you have a strong first draft, this is often not reflected in your final grade for that essay. Still, the topics you write about and the essays you read are fascinating and enjoyable. The class is fast-paced, but the workload is manageable. If you like to write and want to grow as a writer, I recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it really does improve your writing skills overall. It is not an easy course, but it is worth putting the effort in to strive for the higher grades because you will learn something different each draft of each essay.",
    "Professor McCabe is down-to-earth, funny, and an expert at what she teaches. She does spend most of the lesson talking instead of giving students a chance to discuss things, but honestly, I prefer this, as she is the only one who really knows what she's talking about. The workload isn't too intense. But if you don't put the time and effort in (and see a writing tutor!) your grades will definitely suffer. One note: you really have to like the specific type of writing to enjoy this course. It's in the style of a short, non-fiction, thoughtful essay, like you'd find in the New Yorker. If that's not your thing, this class won't be enjoyable for you."
