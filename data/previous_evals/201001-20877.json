   "comments": [
    "Sure.",
    "This class provides useful background knowledge of statistic analysis.",
    "I would recommend strongly. I would say that it teaches a practical skill set and that it is taught by one of the best teachers I've ever met.",
    "This course is a great way to work through your personal data-set while also learning multiple multivariate techniques. You walk away with a highly valuable set of statistical code. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "It is very useful. The course covers a lot of statistic techniques and provide appropriate practices covering these techniques in several software packages.",
    "This course is highly recommended. It is great for those who would like to know how to do statistical analysis but do not cares much about the underlying principles.",
    "yes",
    "to stat padawans:good for both a young stat padawan or a stat jedi, this class is!",
    "Highly recommend",
    "I would for sure recommend it. They will use it later.",
    "Sure. It's a very interesting and useful class for non-stats students.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone because it was able to meet a diverse range of student needs.I would not recommend the course to someone who wants mathematical proofs rather than a focus on practical research statistics. However, that was made clear in the beginning of the course",
    "I would recommend it for someone interested in a survey of multivariate statistical applications. Not appropriate for someone who expects to do complex analysis without supervision -- but don't think that is the end-goal of this course anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course to just about anyone in the environmental field for one simple reason: Multivariate statistics are becoming ever more common in today's scientific literature and having some exposure to terms, methods, etc. is quite valuable. This is an introductory course so don't expect more than an overview of the various methodologies. Look to the stats department if you want more detail.",
    "Useful",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has taken math in college (I hadn't) and can absorb math quickly."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me to gain a better understanding of my data. It also showed how expected data-sets can be evaluated using multivariate techniques.",
    "I leart multivariate aspect of statistics",
    "yes i learned alot from the professor and enjoyed it very much!",
    "I've already used some techniques in my research. It helps a lot.",
    "This course helped me write the methods section of my disseration proposal.It forced me to start writing it - and this was not as easy as I had anticipated.Jonathan's final was either a paper or an oral discussion. I decided to write the paper in prep of writing my disseration proposal.Just having to think, organize and write it with a time limitation was a challenge.I am now writing my prospectus, and Jonathan's final served as a \"rough draft\" of my methods section.",
    "Very relevant for anyone in the sciences. Should serve as a jumping off point for further statistical studies.",
    "n\/a",
    "I took this class because I need to better understand statistics for my dissertation and the research I am conducting now. This course gave me an idea of what I need to really understand for my future in research, although I didn't understand a lot of the course."
