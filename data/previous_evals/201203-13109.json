    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested not only in European history but also in European current affairs. You gain a comprehensive knowledge of the formation of the European Union and understand the underlying problems that surround the Organization today from their roots.",
    "Yes. It's an interesting course.",
    "This subject may sound boring, but thanks to Irene Karamouzis it's one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale! Not only is she hilarious and super charismatic, but also a fabulous teacher! It's especially interesting if you've taken Cold War or 20th century European history."
