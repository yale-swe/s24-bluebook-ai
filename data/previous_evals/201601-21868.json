   "comments": [
    "This is an AMAZING course; definitely take it. The material offers a cursory taste of several different human body systems, and the different units tie together through several key subjects. 5 Units, 5 exams, no final. The professors all seem like they actually want to be there and want to teach, which is refreshing for a Yale science course.",
    "Pretty standard biology courses. Some of the modules might be more interesting than others, depending on your own interests, but I overall found the class very enjoyable. The test difficulty varies based on professor but are generally very manageable. And you get to drop your lowest test grade! It seems like Professor Hudnall also uses a curve where he adds the amount of points it would take for the highest score to be a 100 to everyone's grades.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the material, organized and motivated. The lectures are very interesting and are in general a great supplement to Physiological Systems. Be warned that some of the lectures are super organized.",
    "Highly recommend if you are premed and\/or interested in clinical biology. Because of the frequent tests, the work load is relatively intense, but the questions are all extremely fair. If you put in the work and go to class, you'll do great! One test is dropped which is very helpful if something comes up and you bomb a test.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, particularly those going to medical school. The material is extremely interesting and each professor has a great understanding of their respective specialty. I would recommend using the TA's to there fullest, as in have your questions ready before section to ask. There isn't a large amount of textbook reading, which I was very fond of, but it does mean attending lectures is vital. There is a fair amount of memorization involved in the course, but everything they teach you is highly relevant to the medical profession which was enough of a motivator for me to get through the memorization. Previous understanding of immunology and systems within the body is extremely helpful.",
    "It was somewhat difficult to switch between each of the sections throughout this course, although it was interesting when you took the broader picture and say all the says that the body can react. If you are looking for a survey course on this topic then this is the class for you. Very interesting, but wishing we had more time to study each of the sections. Be prepared for a test every two weeks.",
    "A great course, with interesting material especially if you're considering medicine. Taught by MD\/PhDs, the instructors are all knowledgeable, interesting and enthusiastic. Grading is ambiguous at times, and preparation for the tests is difficult as lectures often don't follow the textbook.Since the lectures are all in different fields, the class can feel disjointed and unorganized. Overall however, the class was very similar to what's expected in medical school, and was one of my favorite classes of the semester.",
    "This course provides an in depth look at pathology and inflammation. By the end of the course, you'll know about gross anatomy, the varying inflammatory response, the processes behind cancer, etc. It can seem a bit disjointed at times, but flows well once you step back. All of the professors are highly informed and passionate about their specialty, so I encourage you to reach out to them - it may be daunting since they each only teach 4-5 courses, but it's well worth it. Also, don't let the \"non-cumulative exams\" convince you that you don't have to keep up with the material. Four days of material in this course are on par with what's expected over twice that much time and the information is dense. If you study, you'll be fine. I strongly recommend taking this course if you are interested in medicine."
