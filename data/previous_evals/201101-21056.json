    "I would only recommend it if it a dept requirement",
    "Advanced Immunology is a required course for the immunology department. However, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the current questions and trends in immunology.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. I would summarize the course as part lecture and part discussion focused on assigned readings.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for future students, not only in immunology. Great instructors that touched on a large number of current hot topics in immunology.",
    "There are a multitude of topics covered, just like in IBIO530a however, each topic is associated with one or two core concepts that are discussed in depth and at length. It excels over the introductory class because there is a greater emphasis on reading\/discussing the literature and writing responses instead of being strictly a lecture course.",
    "I would recommend IBIO 531 to any student in Immunobiology or anyone interesting in immunology. It is a great opportunity to learn current trends in the field directly from the experts.",
    "The current state of the field of immunology, what is known and what is not known, and what the field is pushing for.",
    "I would recommend the class as long as all the instructors make sure to make the second session for each topic more discussion based instead of lecture based.",
    "See response to Question 1. I would recommend it, but only to those students whose work may be in immunology."

   "comments": [
    "I did learn a lot about the recent advances in immuno. You won't get this stuff from textbooks, and you have the professors from the best immuno dept in the country teaching this course.",
    "This course has definitely deepened my knowledge of my discipline. I now have knowledge of the current trends and questions in immunology. This will benefit me when I am completing my dissertation research.",
    "This course helped to broaden my understanding of the field and will be helpful throughout my research.",
    "Provided primary literature and topical discussions on a broad variety of subfields in immunology, which deepens myunderstanding of the complexity of the immune system.",
    "I think that the course provided a nice glimpse into areas of immunology we have not extensively discussed in the intro immunology course. Specific facts from the course will not likely contribute to my thesis, but discussing unresolved or controversial areas of research I believe is beneficial for developing critical thinking skills.",
    "Mainly, I believe this course helped me in improving my skills in critical reading of scientific papers."
