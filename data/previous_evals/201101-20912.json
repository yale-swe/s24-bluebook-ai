    "An overview of basic system control. Recommended if relevant to research.",
    "Good intro course for first year grad students. Definitely recommended for students who have to deal with controls in any format",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who had an appropriate background. I would warn them that the material is difficult and that the structure of the class is such that there is no real way to get assistance other than to approach the Professor or TA (i.e. no website, no \"hint\" pages, etc. At times when the professor is working on certain things it may be difficult\/impossible to get that assistance from the Professor or TA.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in control systems or interested in learning in advanced controls.",
    "I would recommend this class to incoming mechanical or electrical engineering students with a solid grasp of signals and systems, and basic ODE's."

   "comments": [
    "Course was moderately related to my research, should be useful in the future.",
    "Certainly introduced me to some more niche and detailed areas of control theory that I wasn't familiar with before.",
    "The course added to my knowledge of linear algebra. In addition I made sense of the physical interpretations of the controllability\/observability and other ideas. This course has given me insight into my own research and shown how to tackle dynamics mathematically.",
    "The topics in this course are important to my current area research, and I hope to apply what I have learned to my future work."
