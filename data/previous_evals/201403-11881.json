    "No. If you can write lyrics just set aside 2 hours a week to do so and you'll produce more work that you'll be happier with. If you can't, I'd recommend not taking it. Do take it if you want an easy A, though.",
    "This is a great practical class for Lyric Writing. It offers the basics of form and function. It is a little bit more difficult if you don't already read music, but isn't impossible. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a forum for criticism on their lyrics and an opportunity to write every week with a different structured prompt.",
    "A+. As someone who has a great love of musical theater but who has never really done any lyric writing (or any other creative writing, for that matter), this class taught me so much not only about lyrics, but storytelling. Michael Korie is a phenomenal instructor and an incredible lyricist (he wrote Grey Gardens!) and he is very good at teaching and explaining different types of songs and structure. Writing a song each week is very fun, and then we also get to write lyrics to a song written by an actual Broadway composer, which is a wonderful opportunity! The composer comes in and listens to our lyrics and critiques them! It's a blast. I learned so much in the class while having so much fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes musical theater, creative writing, or just learning a new skill!",
    "This course was incredibly helpful and so much fun! The work is unlike any other class I have taken at Yale and after a semester I can truly say I feel like a better and more confident lyricist. It is the perfect fifth class and requires no previous lyric writing experience. Would definitely recommend!",
    "THST 414 is a great class for anybody looking to improve their lyric-writing ability. It is appropriate for songwriters, playwrights, writers, poets, musicians, or anybody who is simply interested in trying out a new type of writing. Michael Korie is brilliant and his flat sense of humor makes every class a pleasure. In this class, you will learn how to structure your lyrics just like you would structure a paper or a musical composition. You learn the basics of comedy writing, dramatic writing, and also how to format lyrics in a standard way, and you get experience writing lyrics for existing music as well as for music that hasn't been written yet! A wonderful, low-stress, high fun class for musicians, writers, composers, and playwrights alike!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you are already working on a musical because you will not be able to produce hardly anything usable outside of the class. If you haven't really written any lyrics before, this might be really good opportunity to start.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. There's a lot to learn about this line of work.",
    "A wonderful course! An engaging and fun introduction to the surprisingly tricky craft of musical theater lyric-writing. Professor Korie has selected a great string of exercises that help you develop skills over the course of the semester, culminating in two big assignments."
