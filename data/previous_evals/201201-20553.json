    "It got me thinking about ethical issues but wasn't rigorous enough to get a firm grasp on exactly what an ethical scientist in current society is.",
    "This course gave me a context to think about many issues relating to doing science in a lab environment and a wide range of other topics that I think will be generally helpful in the years to come.",
    "Yes, it did deepen my knowledge of my discipline.To be a good scientist is not just about doing good research. To be a 'ethically' qualified person is essentially important as well.This class gave us a general ethical guidance in science. It will be very helpful for our future career in scientific research.",
    "Stealing people's work is bad.",
    "My scope of the field broadened and I learned important information regarding the current state of neuroscience ethics.",
    "I get the impression from the course that everything is heavily regulated in CT. This is both good and bad for me so I have a mixed feeling towards it. I would love to keep my research under proper regulation and I do not want to cause any trouble. So this is a very helpful class on that perspective."
