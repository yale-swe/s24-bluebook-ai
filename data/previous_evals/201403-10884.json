   "comments": [
    "Piers Plowman is the greatest Middle English poem - a challenge and a pleasure to study.",
    "It's an in-depth study of \"Piers Plowman\". I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to study \"Piers Plowman\" in depth. I would probably add that it's more fun than it sounds.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially with Ian Cornelius teaching it. I would summarize it thus: this class is an intensive study of a single, fascinating, difficult medieval poem that professional critics struggle with. If that sounds good, take it!",
    "The course was a survey of Piers Plowman C-Text. In addition, the course considered the different editions of the text and their respective merits and limitations. As a result, the course was engaged with how we have received the text that we read as well considering how other versions might offer other readings. I would recommend ENGL 534 to another student and I would take another course taught by Ian Cornelius.",
    "ENGL 534 01 is a study of the C text of Piers Plowman, with an emphasis placed on secondary scholarship of the A, B, and C texts. A solid foundation in Middle English is extremely useful, as is a knowledge of Latin or Anglo-Saxon. An excellent study of the poem and various critical approaches of many well-respected scholars. I would recommend this class to another student--the course material and syllabus were thorough without being overwhelming. I feel I have a much deeper working knowledge of the poem after taking this class. A must for scholars of Middle English poetry.",
    "Yes, definitely... Ian is brilliant and cares a lot about contemporary scholarship... will help you learn a lot about the discipline also even while the focus is exclusively on piers plowman"

   "comments": [
    "Piers Plowman will figure in my dissertation, as will much of the criticism we read.",
    "I knew pretty much nothing about \"Piers Plowman\" starting out. I don't focus on the fourteenth century but I'm close enough that it's worth my knowing about Langland and Langland scholarship. I found the course inspiring. Goodness knows what my research will look like though.",
    "This course filled a major gap in my knowledge of the period. I am not yet sure how it will contribute to my larger research agenda, but it very well might.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of a canonical Middle English poem and gave me the opportunity to read a great deal of impeccable research, much of which I will use in my own future research. I was able to explore the different critical approaches to a Medieval text. This course contributed to my research by giving me a strong foundation in an extremely difficult Middle English poem. Additionally, simply reading such a difficult poem gives me a very helpful skill which I can apply to many other areas of study and close textual analysis.",
    "cool to see the way that ideas migrate across subfields... definitely enjoyed the stuff a lot by Middleton and Hanna"
