   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend Spanish 515 for my fellow students. It was one of my favorite courses I have ever taken. That said, I do have an interest in religious themes to begin with. Someone who had absolutely no interest in religion whatsoever might not enjoy the class, although I think the reading selection was varied enough that it could capture the interest of everyone.",
    "This class is a study of religious texts of the Middle Ages, although we actually only read Christian texts and most were from the 13th century. I would recommend this class certainly.",
    "This is the best class I've taken so far from the Spanish Department. I would definitely recommended it, and the professor, to any student.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class for future students. The course facilitates a comprehensive study of religious medieval texts spanning the thirteenth through the fifteenth centuries. The course encourages students to reformulate their preconceived notions of what constitutes a literary text while simultaneously fostering an in-depth analysis of specific medieval texts.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in Middle Ages and\/or religion. It is also interesting for anyone looking to improve textual analysis."

   "comments": [
    "Even though I'm not a medievalist, I find it extremely useful (and essential!) to have a solid understanding of the earliest texts of Spanish literature, as they are the foundation for everything else that follows. I also felt like this course was very helpful as I start to prepare for my comprehensive exams.",
    "Religious texts are a fundamental part of Medieval literary production. This class studied many major themes of literature from this time.",
    "I had no knowledge of medieval literature before this course; now, I not only have acquired knowledge on the subject but also curiosity and a desire to learn more.",
    "At the same time that the course provided me with important historical background for understanding the lineage of the more contemporary texts that interest me, it caused me to appreciate how we hone our analytical \/ critical abilities by learning to read and respond to literature quite removed in time and circumstances. Profesor Poole's affirmation of the value of close textual analysis was also encouraging and empowering in the sense that I gained confidence in my own analysis.",
    "All the readings on the syllabus were helpful in preparing for the comprehensive exams, even if they weren't necessarily on the list asrequired readings. I anticipate that my work from this course will also be relevant to my dissertation in the future."
