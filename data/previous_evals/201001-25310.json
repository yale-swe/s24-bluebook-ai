   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work, but you learn a lot. I recommend it to other students who are seriously willing to work hard to improve their Spanish writing skills.",
    "The class helped me improve my Spanish writing, and the peer-editing technique actually worked very well. Tortora was very helpful and encouraging.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your writing, because you definitely will!",
    "It's great, please do yourself a favor and take this course with Pfe. Tortora. It's a great way to learn, improve your writing, and connect with other students.",
    "I would recommend Writing in Spanish for another student because it is a good class. The readings were interesting, as were the assignments. I really improved in my Spanish writing and speaking skills. Though sometimes some of the work (i.e. peer editing) felt like a drag, once you got into it, you really saw the importance of practices like that. Professor Tortora is very understanding and a great teacher--she'll really work with you if you're having trouble.",
    "Spanish 244 strengthens writing, peer-revision, and analytical skills. It also strengthens vocabulary and grammar. I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to improve his\/her language skills."
