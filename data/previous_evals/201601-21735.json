    "Highly recommended for any interested in the subject matter.",
    "A good class if you're serious about learnign english and invested in theory, as well as read some really cool books",
    "This class was a little intimidating, as this year the class was combined with graduate students, but I felt like I learned a lot and a very unique perspective on some classic as well as modern literature. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared! The reading is a lot (a novel a week, usually pretty long), but manageable.",
    "Solid course. Professor Dimock is great and engaging, and the subject matter is generally interesting. My only criticism is that I think he course lost some steam towards the end--I felt like the class was uninspired by a bunch of the books down the stretch. Class discussion was still interesting, but I think could be made better by looking at the reading list at the end of the course."
