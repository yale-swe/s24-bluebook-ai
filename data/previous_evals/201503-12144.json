    "It can be a really fun experience. Just don't be annoying, and don't be a load and you'll find yourself with a new group of friends by the end of the semester, and lots and lots of random knowledge on your topic area.",
    "Take your capstone with Sean.",
    "The capstone project provides students with an opportunity to learn more in depth about a topic that they might not be familiar with at the beginning of the semester. Over the course of the semester you will get an extremely in depth sense of the topic. The course also teaches you how to work in a group setting with a client which is super beneficial before graduation. Would definitely recommend the capstone with Sean Smith!",
    "Of course, you've got to do this. And honestly, even if you didn't have to, why wouldn't you? It's a really cool project (since you have some say in picking your own), the people are generally great -- our group was especially awesome, even though most of us hardly knew any of the others from before, and the organization you work for will probably be something very interesting and well known. We worked with Small Arms Survey on small arms trafficking in Central America, and it was difficult at first for us to know where to start, so one major piece of advice I'd give is to find out your scope and focus very clearly. We mostly only got that down after fall break, at which point we really started working and getting all the research, but which rendered a lot of the preliminary things we had done useless. Sean and Julie were a good combination, with one being more hands off and the other giving more direction. They were generally one of the more hands off teams, and were more helpful in giving us feedback on our work. This worked out for our team, and will probably be a good thing for the next people working on this too, because we got to set our own deadlines and plans, and split up the work on our own. I enjoyed the time we spent in our group, and though the work was difficult and sometimes pretty tedious, it was interesting and I learned a lot."
