The only thing that I have in mind to improve his teaching skill is to ask him paying attention not only on the brightest students, but also to the quiet ones.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Generally, Tim helped balance Susan and was a great asset. He could benefit from not cutting students off. Someone told me they scheduled an appointment with him, and he ended up speaking for most of the time. He could work on his listening skills.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Good at leading discussion and a good compliment to Susan's teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Very engaged and committed. He was very responsive to student questions and adapted material to each individual. Tim is an incredible teaching fellow and truly co-instructed the class. I think he could improve by making the discussion part of the class more student driven or led rather than just a summary of journals.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was a very helpful teaching assistant for the course. I believe that Susan Clark and Tim complemented each other very well for the material and appreciated both of their outlooks on the subject. He always made himself available and was open to helping all of us.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was a very strong teaching assistant. He in fact held the class together and could be considered the most crucial part to the course's success.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim essentially co-taught the class with Susan, and was often able to articulate concepts even more clearly and with more explicit examples than Susan. I think the only comment I would make about Tim is that he often takes an academic perspective, which is understandable given his current role at FES - but he is at least quick to critique the academic institutions that he is a part of.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Class is very well organized, and conducted in an organized manner. The only genuinely interdisciplinary course available at FES. The learning environment is open and very cooperative and attuned to students' pace and needs. Not suited for students not prepared to engage in very self-reflective activities or to have their worldview brought into analysis.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was a fantastic facilitator for our discussions and great at clarifying concepts."

    "If you consistently battle between you and your thoughts, this class will definitely give you a skill set to structure your thoughts with policy science framework. For me, this class does not only offer me a skill set, but it has opened my eyes and my mind on how the world evolves in multidimensional aspect. Throughout the semester, we talked a lot on issues that are not commonly or normally discussed in every day conversation, but we know how important they are, and we realize their existences around us, such as human dignity, common interest, values, etc. For me, this class also gave valuable opportunities through its exercises to understand my own self, and to increase my awareness on my surrounding. For me, this class was also a part of spiritual journey for myself.",
    "Its a very different course. It will make you think about yourself and your other courses in a new light - which I found valuable. It was also frustrating. Susan is a little bit out there, Tim helped bring her back down to earth. But still, they spent a little too much time talking - the class would have benefited a lot from more open discussion.",
    "While Susan is not always the most engaging lecturer, she really mentors students and makes course content relevant to everyone. She challenges and nurtures students in a very effective way. This means that in class, she can be a little hard to follow because her lectures are a bit tangential, but in her office hours she is very clear and insightful.",
    "Excellent course, my favorite of this semester. It's a valuable tool for professionals interested in policy issues.",
    "The structure of this class, particularly in the first 1-3 meetings, is a bit off-putting or at least disconcerting, which I think turns many students away - I didn't feel like I really understood the angle of the class until the third or fourth meeting. Once things started to click, though, I realized that this will probably be the most valuable class I take as a student interested in natural resource policy issues. I think Tim and Susan run a risk of turning students away by not being more basically clear about what the class is about up front - but on the other hand, if the class had more than 15 or so students in it, I believe it would be less effective, so I wouldn't necessarily encourage an approach that caused the class to be bigger.",
    "Incredible class. Very likely the best, most worthwhile experience available at FES."

    "The best aspect of this course was that you would learn on something that you did not expect you would gain from this class, and they were extremely valuable things.",
    "self reflection was incredibly valuable. most classes there is no space for that. but we are all humans - and thats very important to remember. but we dont always and most courses dont even acknowledge or seem to understand that.",
    "gaining a well-versed understanding of the policy sciences.",
    "I really enjoyed almost all of the course. The journals, reading, exercises, and small discussion groups were very engaging and stimulating. The course is very holistic and covers a lot of ground. The case study aspect allowed me to put the theory into practice and I got a lot out of the process of applying the policy sciences framework. The subject of my case is now much clearer. I also enjoyed that nothing is off the table for discussion and course content--the course structure is consistent with the content.",
    "Students could participate and lead the discussions. Susan and Tim really care about the students.",
    "This course should be a requirement in the curriculum because it is able to integrate all aspects of environmental management and 'specializes' in integration. Although the course material can be a little overwhelming at first, it is a very good class. I would highly recommend it.",
    "The best aspect of this course was Tim leadership and the contributions of my classmates in class and in discussion. I felt there was a lot to be learned from the subject matter, and being exposed to the policy sciences but I did not feel that it was actually the course structure or professor's efforts that lead to the success of the class. I believe my classmates interest and commitment to listen to each other and offer thoughtful feedback was what made the course worthwhile.",
    "It provides an extremely outside-the-box perspective - one that I understand is not available in other courses at FES. Encourages the type of critical thinking and evaluation that is needed in natural resource management.",

    "The weekly reading materials were way too much!",
    "Let the students talk more. I would strongly suggest having drafts of the paper due earlier - I am working on it now...I only just started a couple days ago. This is how most students are...we have other priorities. And we are only going to learn the framework if we apply it! It would be good to talk about some of the questions I have no with the class! This is of course partly my fault.",
    "This course could use a real world component. It would have been great to have created our policy process paper and then gone out to use it in some way with guidance by Tim and Susan.",
    "I think it would be helpful to have a few more \"assignments\" where we either apply the policy sciences framework to a given prompt or to our case. With a new framework and lexicon I think it would be very helpful to apply parts of it earlier to really get practice earlier on in the course. I know that we are graduate students should be responsible for managing our workloads, but some structure for reviewing and practicing the policy sciences prior to the final project would be helpful.",
    "The only aspect of this course that I would improve would be to have more 'hands-on' opportunities to practice the policy sciences framework in a real-time setting. I think that either having a class trip to a conference or a requirement to critique a few meetings would be a great way to practice different aspects of the framework. Additionally, I believe that the first few classes should be spent less on justifying the framework.",
    "The presentations given by Professor Clark were not valuable. There were impossible to follow and rarely offered useful conclusions. While i believe she has a lot to offer the school as an adviser her lecture style is disjointed and unclear.",
    "The course has a weird cadence, for lack of a better word, in large part due to the somewhat wandering nature of the discussions we would have during each meeting. I think this type of pacing and structure made for a more interesting form of self-discovery than other more structured classes, though, so I wouldn't necessarily suggest anything changes here. Just an observation.",
    "It can be difficult to find a good balance between lecture\/etc. and discussion. I would suggest continuing to fine-tune this balance. I always felt like discussion was cut short, especially at the beginning of the course."

I think it would be great to have groups do report-backs each week to go over some of the points they discussed with the whole class. Or to have one or two students lead a short discussion every class in addition to Tim's discussion time. A few people didn't participate as much as others. I don't think that it was because some hogged the time, but perhaps their learning styles were different. Maybe if they were required to lead a discussion or activity of their choosing there could be more widespread participation.",
