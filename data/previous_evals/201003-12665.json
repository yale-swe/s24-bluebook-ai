    "Yes, a lot of time is spent going over the material that was raced through in L2.",
    "Russian 130 with Irina is a treat. Easy going class environment that touches on all the exercises you need to effectively learn Russian. Regarding coursework it is a steady stream of significant work, but Irina is understand and if you are the type to have a routine, then this class is great for you. However, if you have trouble going to class everyday, this is a hard class to sustain for the entire semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Chances are most students entering L3 will have already taken two semesters of Russian at Yale, so they already know that the department is excellent, and this course is no exception. Although the workload seems slightly heavier than first year, the effort definitely pays off.",
    "L3 Russian is a really nice progression from the first year of the course; it really solidifies all the concepts that I felt shaky about last year so that I feel much more comfortable with them now."
