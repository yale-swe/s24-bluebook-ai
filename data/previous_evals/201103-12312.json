    "TAKE THIS CLASS! drawing live models every class means you're guaranteed to improve your figure drawing and professor Villalongo gives good criticism and is encouraging. There is minimal work outside of class so you really only have to factor the length of time in class into your schedule. this class is great to take after basic drawing",
    "It is an interesting class, much practice, not too much critique and less homework than other class.",
    "This class was fun. You need a good amount of supplies, and you'll probably get sick of the gesture drawings by week 2. But if you stick out, it's a neat opportunity to produce something other than 20-page papers on the fiscal history of Argentina during your time at Yale. As a note, the professor really likes creativity and \"new ways of seeing the figure\", so make sure you're willing to do some weird crap after you go over the basics of proportion and value. Homework was mostly two hand and two feet drawings a week.Oh, and there ARE naked people. Just FYI.",
    "Yes, take it! It is a laid back class but you'll learn how to capture the human figure in many different ways. You'll also get to experiment with different mark makings which was really fun for and rewarding for me.",
    "This is a good class for those interested in learning more about drawing the figure, but want a stress-free enviroment. However, if you are interested in improving your figure drawing through harsh constructive criticism, Villalongo may not be as helpful.",
    "Take this class, you won't regret it and the work load is very light.",
    "Yes. This is a challenging course, but a great experience for both beginners and art majors. It is exciting to track artistic growth in such a focussed environment. It can get tedious, but if you know what you are getting yourself into, and are willing to put in the effort, it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "This was the worst class I ever took at Yale, SERIOUSLY! If William is teaching it, you might as well google figure drawing and learn from that. At least then you can save yourself from his awful coffee breath and poor disposition.",
    "YES. nude models. lot's of different medium. fun and effective."
