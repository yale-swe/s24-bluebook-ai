    "My senior essay is an exciting culmination of my interdisciplinary work in the Humanities department. The topic and it's research have required extensive exploration in the fields of philosophy, history, literature, architecture, and urban studies. My essay advisor, Elihu Rubin, is very engaged and helpful, providing both broad research tips and extensive writing edits. I am very thankful to have a program like this at Yale.",
    "The capstone of your Yale College career. Find a topic you love and give it your all. You won't regret it!(That being said, don't stress too much. It's just another essay [albeit more substantial than most].)"
