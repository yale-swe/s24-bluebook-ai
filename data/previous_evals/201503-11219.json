    "Undoubtedly!",
    "this class centered the literature and lived experience of natives through organic dialogue. there was less in-depth literary discussion, and more consciousness-raising around native issues. there was a fair amount of reading and writing, all of which was worthwhile effort. birgit is an incredible ally and teacher of students of color. it is a shame that yale is not supporting and retaining her, which strips students of support and knowledge.",
    "It is truly saddening that this class will likely not be offered next year because I would absolutely tell ANY student to take this class. Professor Rasmussen is amazing and she will teach you so much about Native American literature and history and life in general. The work load was very reasonable. We read a book per week and submitted a reflection every week, watched native films, and wrote a final paper and creative project. It's one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Native American and Indigenous Literature was a fantastic class. The readings are amazing, ranging from fiction to memoir to poetry to theory. The classroom experience made the texts come alive. This was the class I wanted to do work for first each week. Highly, highly recommend. Couldn't recommend high enough.",
    "An incredible intro to Native American literature that every student who wants to know anything about this country's literary tradition.",
    "I highly recommend taking this course. The syllabus includes books that most students have never heard of, let alone read. The discussions are incredibly enlightening. One's education would be incomplete without this course.",
    "Yes. One hundred percent yes. You will learn so much about this crucial subject, your peers, and yourself. You will be challenged to think in ways you had not previously. You will attempt to decolonize your brain, and learn how to be a better, more compassionate human being. You will write reading responses that baffle you, and then come to a place of deeper understanding about the literature during the two hour seminar. You will flourish when you realize what real teaching looks like. In an environment where your education and humanity and health are being valued simultaneously, you will learn and grow. This is class reminded me why I should stay in college.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I loved going to class every thursday morning. It was so worth it. I learned so many new things about Native American history and culture, as well as literature theory.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class. It is extremely interesting and we learned a lot about Native culture. The books we read are very interesting and informative!",
    "This is an introductory course on Native American literature in which one will learn how to critically analyze literature as well as how to think about and engage with Native American topics in literature.",
    "Fall semester 2015 will definitely be remembered as a time during which Yale was in a state of turmoil. With long, long over-looked issues on campus confronted and addressed, emotions were almost constantly high and people were almost constantly vulnerable. For me, structure during this time was provided by conversations with my suite, and by conversations with my master, Master Pitti of Ezra Stiles College, who held a discussion for our college which helped me better understand where to stand and how to stand and where to feel and how to feel. But structure was also provided by my Native American Literature class. The class, in which we sat on the floor, is on the very top floor of the Native American cultural center in a beautiful room with light streaming in from five sides. In addition to windows on every wall, the sky-light provided light from above. So we sat on the floor and every Thursday we discussed a different book, a non-translated work by a native author. Everyone in the class brought something different to the floor. I brought an ignorance of the topics at hand. Well, not a complete ignorance. I guess that doesnt give me or my education enough credit. I didnt bring complete ignorance. I was educated by schools that considered the confrontation of inequity and injustice important above most all else. While my schools were not pioneers of a program of study of native issues, I did have exposure to some native work (specifically by Sherman Alexi) in high school and I came to Yale incredibly well-versed in dealing with racial tension and advocating for a better American system. So I came to class every week and I learned not only from the texts that we read, but from the students, students who approached the books in a different way than I did, and, in most cases, understood the books better than I did. And I learned from our amazing professor, Professor Brander-Rasmussen, who showed us that we could have intellectual discussions that were also emotionally charged. I am incredibly glad that I was in this class this semester, and Im thankful that Professor Brander-Rasmussen allowed the conversation to be held wherever the students needed it to be held, including off-topic. But I am also thankful for the curriculum that she wrote and taught us. I am thankful that Professor Brander-Rasmussen was so well-versed in what we could tell was an incredibly long academic career researching the questions that we were dealing with in class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course. If you are interested in engaging literature and the history of America this is great. With a particular focus on Native Americans and how they are perceived in different narratives (many of them written or created by Native people) this course offers a much more in-depth look at the current state of Native American livelihood. This information is important to know especially for the most underrepresented minority in America. It's gripping and slightly depressing at times, but necessary information to hold and we examine it through many texts and media. The reading and workload is manageable, especially because many of the texts you engage with are enthralling and its easy to have a lot of thoughts to write about in your weekly reading responses. The final project is a combination of a literary analysis and a creative project which balance out perfectly.",
    "This class focused on the culture of native literature, exploring the nature of storytelling as well as the historical\/political issues at stake in such texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Best course I've taken at Yale. Students in the seminar read a book a week and turn in 1-2 page reading responses the day before class. Professor Rasmussen will work the responses into discussion in class, which is mostly student-led. Discussion is usually about reactions to the text, critiques, and political and social relevance of the texts. At the end of the semester you turn in a creative project and a paper.",
    "Take American Studies 335 if you want to broaden your understanding of Indigenous issues and theories. The class discussions allow you to understand what you've read and how it applies to your life. It is a great class and will change your perceptions of identity, race, politics, etc.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I wish Professor Brander-Rasmussen wasn't leaving, but the course material was engaging, class discussions were dynamic and included discussions of the literature, as well as Native American history and current events. I am a better, more informed person for having taken this class as my first ethnic studies course, it helped me understand JUST how important ethnic studies is.",
    "This was a wonderful class. I thoroughly enjoyed coming every week, and I walked away from every class with new ideas floating around my mind. The seminar style was incredibly useful in learning from different perspectives. The readings were also always enjoyable and thought provoking. I would highly recommend this class to another student. However, without Professor Rasmussen I do not know if it will be comparable."
