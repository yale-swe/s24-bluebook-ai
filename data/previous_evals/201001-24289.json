   "comments": [
    "It's a tough course but you'll learn a lot.",
    "Great course if you are a heritage speaker who wants to improve their writing and reading. Believe me, you will work for it, but all in all the course is fair. The teacher is extremely caring and most people I know never regret taking this class. Be prepared for the time commitment.",
    "This course is definitely more manageable after a semester of CHNS 132. The ease of the course depends on self-discipline and keeping up with daily work.",
    "You should definitely take this class if you are native Chinese speaker who can carry a conversation, but cannot read or write Chinese well. My Chinese definitely improved tremendously. Xu Lao Shi is the best instructor you can ever ask for!",
    "Take this class. You will hate yourself as you take it and you have at least an hour of work every night, but you will also notice a tremendous amount of improvement in your Chinese. My parents often commented on just how much my Chinese improved within the last year because rather than simple colloquial speech, I started talking to my parents about politics, business, Chinese history, and more. Also, don't expect an easy A. You need to work and keep up. Xu laoshi does give you many opportunities to boost your grade through lots of assignments, but if you don't do them (and actually work on them), don't expect her to hand you an A.",
    "This was actually one of my favorite classes this term, even though I hated Chinese school as a kid. Go figure. It can be a fair amount of work, but it comes in a regular stream, and the characters aren't hard to learn. The steady pace of it can be refreshing, and it's definitely rewarding to see yourself making palpable progress.",
    "Good class for native speakers to improve their Chinese grammar and vocabulary. One drawback is that you don't have as much time to speak, but that's a drawback to any language class that meets only an hour a day.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone interested in strengthening their Chinese skills. This is a very thorough class for learning grammar structures, and the vocabulary is occasionally very useful. It does prepare the student to articulate serious and important issues and themes. However, if you're just looking to improve conversational skills, this is not the class for you.",
    "I would recommend it if you are trying to improve your Chinese. However, even as a native speaker with a solid foundation in Chinese, it was not an easy class.",
    "Chinese 142 is a great class for a native speaker who wants to work on his or her reading and writing skills. This semester focused on formal vocabulary and grammar, making it a lot more difficult than the L3 class. I really enjoyed it and my Chinese has improved by a lot.",
    "You learn a lot of specific Chinese phrases that you might not use in the future in conversational Chinese. A lot of it is formal speaking Chinese, so it depends on how much Chinese you think you will be using in the future.",
    "Yes! If you're a native speaker who's relatively fluent but doesn't have strong reading or writing skills, this class is for you! It is somewhat of a time commitment, but if you do all the work, it's very easy to do well.",
    "CHNS142 was a very fulfilling and interesting course that allows students to greatly improve their Chinese language ability (especially in reading and writing), while simultaneously enjoying the material. The workload is very reasonable and most of the homework assignments are very relevant for the class. I highly recommend the course to Native Chinese speakers.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are willing to put in the time for this class almost every day. A lot of the class involves just memorizing lots of Chinese, so be prepared to do a lot of that.",
    "Chinese 142 was a great intermediate level language course. The pace of the course was pretty fast, but the starting level was very reasonable and at the end,there is definitely a large sense of accomplishment. Also, the professors are really great - well-prepared and very understanding.",
    "I took Chinese in middle and high school, and was placed in CHNS 132 at the beginning of the year, continuing to CHNS 142 for spring semester. I do not consider myself to be a heritage speaker (my parents speak Cantonese, but not to me). This course was very helpful in improving my Chinese listening and writing skills. I was happy to find that in our listening exercises, which consisted of selected clips from CCTV news, I could recognize vocabulary words and grammar patterns in the news broadcasts. Professor Xu is great and though people say the class is intense, I didn't find it unmanageable at all. Put in the work during the year (small daily quizzes, unit tests every four chapters - so about 4 per semester) and the final isn't bad at all (more like a unit test). You do need to put in the effort and time during the semester for quizzes, homework, etc. (and during class it is especially important to pay close attention) but I found the class very worthwhile and appropriately challenging without being excessively hard or time consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is a lot of work, especially when you have to write essays, but I felt like I got a lot out of it!",
    "This class is a significant increase in difficulty compared to 132. Although the textbook is the same, the teacher expects much more of you in terms of writing and listening. It is initially challenging, but once you get used to the shift, your Chinese skills do significantly improve. The tests are similar to 132 with a few small changes in format, but there are more essays and harder listening exercises for homework.",
    "It's a great class. How much you put into it is usually how much you get out of it. I highly recommend this class to native speakers who want to work on their Chinese beyond the bare requirements of everyday life.",
    "Chinese 142 is a great class, although a pretty difficult one. If you took the previous fall class, then you will pretty much know what to expect. By the end of Chinese 142, you will feel a lot more confident about your Chinese, especially if you take it with Xu Laoshi.",
    "I definitely recommend it. It is very time-consuming, but it provides a thorough grasp of formal Chinese."
