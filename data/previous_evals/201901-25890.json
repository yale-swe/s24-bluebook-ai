    "strengths: see question 1; weaknesses: more guidance should be provided concerning secondary literature reading; secondary literature was assigned without being discussed or mentioned in class.",
    "The lectures were really great, but I felt like we went over the same material too much. I felt like we didn't ever really get into the second division of Being and Time because we kept just going over the same basic foundations of Heidegger's philosophy. That was helpful and was good for really getting Heidegger's project into my head, but I felt like the second half of the semester was kind of slow for that reason.",
