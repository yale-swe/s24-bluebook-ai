   "comments": [
    "I learned general linear algebra topics (vector spaces, linear dependence\/independence, linear transformations, matrix representations of transformations, systems of linear equations, determinants, eigenvalues\/vectors, inner product spaces) through a theoretical approach. Beyond content, this course requires you to think hard about your problem sets (not just plug and chug like other math courses), and I believe that I developed a much deeper understanding of mathematical logic.",
    "I gained a rigorous foundation in linear algebra. There wasnt as much emphasis on computation and problem-solving. Instead, I learned how to make strong mathematical arguments.",
    "General knowledge of linear systems and how to solve them. Familiarity with mathematical terms like fields, vector spaces, etc. How to approach proof-based problems.",
    "I believe the most important insight I developed through Math 225 was writing mathematical proofs. This was my first proof-based class and allowed me to learn a little more about how to logically structure a proof.",
    "Learned linear algebra, and how to write proofs.",
    "I learned about vector spaces, fields, linear transformations, matrix operations and theory, inner product spaces, and various theorems from Linear Algebra. I also got an introduction to proof writing. I learned to think more critically and how to proof things mathematically.",
    "You learn proof-based linear algebra. Transformations, matrices, etc",
    "This course was the most instructive one I had this semester. It was my first proof-based class, basically my first exposure to a kind of math entirely different to high school math. This class taught me how to develop mathematical intuition through the psets and the practice examples in the TA sessions. I further learned basic proof writing and proof techniques that can be used to show linear algebra concepts. It also taught me about eigen values and the concept of sets and functions, which was really interesting.",
    "This is a very important course whether you are thinking about doing S&DS, math or even CS. Highly recommend understanding these concepts thoroughly as these ideas will definitely come back in future courses.",
    "Learned linear algebra theorems and proofs. Improved proof skills and learned basis of linear algebra.",
    "I learned how to better approach theoretical questions in mathematics. Before, my experience was usually limited to memorizing equations\/processes and going from there. This course helped to lay the foundation for really understanding the basis of axioms, and going beyond rote processing.",
    "I'm so glad I chose to take this class; as a science major, I've developed appreciations for a fundamental part of mathematics I hadn't really explored before, and it's helped me understand the intuition behind determinants, matrix multiplication etc. which I see a lot in my major classes.",
    "Vector spaces, matrices, gaussian elimination, reduced row echelon form, Gram Schmidt Orthonormalization process (the basics of linear algebra covered in Linear Algebra 4th ed by Friedberg)",
    "I learned about the basic theory behind vector spaces and matrix computations."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The obvious strength of the course was Professor Mincheva. This course was grueling, time-consuming, and incredibly difficult by nature. I could not imagine taking it without the patience and support that Professor Mincheva provided. The Yale Math Department needs more professors like her (we had a substitute for literally one class and everyone was lost for two weeks). My only suggestion for improvement would be additional practice problems to prepare for exams.",
    "This course covered the material in-depth and was well-structured. The lectures were important, and Id recommend attending all of them. The end of the course was a little less organized than the first half. I also wish there were more resources to refer to besides the textbook.",
    "Strengths: Syllabus is organized in a logical manner. Weakness: The lectures could be more engaging. The problem set questions tend to deviate from the material learned in class.",
    "Strengths: Structure, clarity of classes Weaknesses: Not a lot of examples and lack of instruction on how to write proofs",
    "Strengths: I thought this was a fantastic course that really introduced us to mathematical sophisticated at a higher level with very few weaknesses. I learnt how to write proofs and how to understand more abstract mathematical concepts relating to linear algebra at a university level. Both Kalina and the peer tutor was also brilliant and really helped us out when it came down to Psets.",
    "Strengths are that Kalina organizes the course very well, and it is a very satisfying course. Weaknesses are that you are never really taught HOW to write proofs, you just kinda learn as you go, which is very challenging at first. I wish there had been more office hours and peer tutor hours.",
    "I found the pace of the second half of the class to be much faster than that of the first half. This, along with denser materials, made it more difficult to follow. But overall this was a great class and Kalina is an amazing professor who really cares for the class and her students.",
    "The strengths are the textbook; it is exceptionally written. Also the TA hours were very helpful. Class was probably the biggest weakness, I was often confused in class and later had to teach myself later from the textbook at home. Another weakness is probably that the instructors don't understand how non trivial some of the problems or concepts can be for students and often dismiss certain parts because they think they are trivial.",
    "Strengths: I thought it was taught really well. The material's interesting, and the psets are fair. There's a lot of support Weaknesses: You're kinda thrown into proofs, so it's tough at first. Also there's only one midterm and it was difficult",
    "The strengths are that the class is taught well by Kalina. She is patient with the explanations while being efficient with the teaching. She is always available in office hours for further questions. The TA discussion sections and the peer tutor office hours are great for walkthroughs for pset problems and review for the exam, including proof-writing tips. The weaknesses involve the amount of material that has to be covered in the lapse of only 1 semester. Often the number of practice examples that can be ran through during class time is limited since there is a lot of ground to cover. There is further little time to understand the concepts taught at the end of the semester such as spectral decomposition, which is arguably a more conceptual topic.",
    "The course feels very fast, but this is no fault of anyone - theres just a lot of material to cover. Given that, however, I thought the course was taught well overall. Sometimes, I would get confused with Kalinas proofs or explanations, but rereading the textbook or redoing the proof helped me understand.",
    "The course was engaging, but the introduction to proof writing wasn't that greata lot of figuring out how to write in the math language from trial and error. In that respect, it could be more formalized.",
    "Strengths: The instructor is very patient, and lectures were well-planned. She is patient in explaining all of the concepts that we don't understand. Weaknesses: The course content sped up wildly after the midterm; we covered three chapters in what seemed like two to three weeks. Some material was glossed over. Prepare to do a lot of self-learning if you want to be successful in this class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course depending on the professor. I can truly say that I got much more out of this course than I would have if I took 222. However, it sucked up so much of my time this semester and I can see how having a bad prof would make the workload practically undoable. Also, be ready to feel frustrated. Unlike the intro calculus sequence, almost exclusively STEM majors take the class. So competition is steep even though there isn't too much of an emphasis on grades.",
    "Yes. If you are planning on moving to higher-level math or stats, this course is probably the best one to take. Dont worry about your grade in the class either. I found that even though I made mistakes on problem sets, they were helpful for learning the material. Just make sure you stay on top of it, and youll be fine.",
    "Unless you need it for your major, no.",
    "Yes, given that it both introduces you to proofs and useful concepts in linear algebra.",
    "Yes! Dont be scared to take it. Prepare for the work and the time you will have to put into it, but you will e glad you took it in the future.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes take this course over 222! You will come out actually understanding what is going on in linear algebra on a more theoretical level. If you have never done proofs before than this is a challenging introduction (It probably will not be taught) but you will come being way more comfortable with proving and doing linear algebra at the end. This is also a great segway into the higher level math classes at Yale or just a goodway to improve your critical thinking",
    "Yes I would, I really enjoyed linear. There are tons of theorems and proofs, but because of it, I think you really get to see how everything builds on each other. It really is cumulative, with everything building upon itself, which I thought was super cool",
    "I would definitely recommend to another student for the insights into mathematics that they would gain from the course. It is a fun environment where students often bond over the novelty of writing proofs and thinking logically. It is fascinating and a truly great class.",
    "Many people will choose between 225 (this course, proof focused) and 222 (applied problem solving focused). I went with this course because I believe proofs will force me to actually understand the concepts behind what I am doing as opposed to the \"plug and chug\" where it is easier to get by without fully comprehending all the underlying motivations\/justifications behind each step.",
    "Take this only if you like proofs. If so, then its a great class where you learn a lot. The homeworks are fair, the tests are challenging but doable, and Kalina is pretty good (most of the time) at explaining concepts. If you dont like proofs, the class wont be enjoyable for you. 222 might be a better option.",
    "Only if they are willing to put in the time. It can get pretty frustrating, especially for the weekly problem sets, but hard work will be rewarded.",
    "I would recommend this to any student majoring in the sciences; I think linear algebra should be a requirement for those majors, and I think this class really solidified my knowledge of the principles of linear algebra for quantum chemistry\/physics classes in a way my friends in 222 didn't observe.",
    "I would recommend 225 to math majors who know that they are prepared for a course in pure math. Otherwise, take 222 instead. 222 has the benefit of being based on the Linear Algebra textbook by Gilbert Strang, and has a course on MIT OpenCourseWare that parallels it.",
    "Yes. I found the stuff we learned to be interesting and writing proofs was somewhat fun. But I must say that this course requires that you practice regularly and not lag behind in the material.",
    "Yes. It's a great class that introduces you to proofs and helps you think through difficult problems. That said, it's a hard class, so make sure you have enough time to spend on this course and the psets in order to get the most out of it."
