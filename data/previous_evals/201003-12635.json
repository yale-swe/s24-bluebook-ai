    "Class is thoughtfully split between readings by professional writers, and a workshop of a student piece. The entirety of class is spent critiquing these two items.",
    "YES TAKE IT ABSOLUTELY",
    "Best class at Yale. Best teacher at Yale. This is why we came to this school. This is what makes $200K in tuition worth it. Anne will care more about you than the parents who brought you into this world. Your writing will improve tenfold. Doesn't matter if you're a fiction writer, a journalist or a physics major. If you get into this class, then Anne has seen something in you and has a plan. And you must take it. Why are you still reading this? Go get your writing samples ready.",
    "Not that you need to hear it, but this was by far the best class I've taken at Yale. Anne is the most generous teacher I know. She cares deeply about your progress as a writer and will put in the one-on-one time to show it. She's also one of the most organized teachers out there: even though this class is a ton of work, her detailed syllabus will keep you on track.So yes, I put more time into this class than my next two classes combined, but it was worth it. I'm a better writer than when I started, and, crucially, a much better editor. That's something Anne teaches that you don't find in most other classes. If you like writing, you should apply. Don't worry if you have no journalistic experience, because Anne explains reporting as the intuitive process it is.",
    "If you get in you would be an idiot not to take this course. It creates an incredible community of writers, and more than any other course at Yale teaches you how to write. If you can do it Credit\/D like Anne asks.",
    "Roses are redviolets are bluei loved Anne Fadiman's classand you will tooI think Anne is possibly the most endeared professor on these course evaluations, so whatever I'm going to say--she changed my life, she's made Yale>Harvard worth it, she can leap over the Empire State building in a single bound--is already a platitude. There are only 3 pieces of advice that haven't been emphasized enough that I'll address here:1. If you don't consider yourself a writer, or have only taken English 120, apply regardless. Anne doesn't care about how much experience you have. Seriously.2. She'll spend 5 hours of one-on-one time editing your essays. Come prepared for the sessions; it really is your loss if you don't.3. Anne cares for all her students, and it rubs off--the class starts to care about her as well. If you end up taking her class, be prepared to write a sappy, genuine course evaluation much like this one.",
    "?At Home in America\u0094 demands that students participate as full persons. Its potential to be formative is far greater than most courses at Yale College because students are held accountable to themselves, their peers, and their professor with full-hearted expectation. The weekly class, bi-weekly personal writing conferences with Anne Fadiman, and many blog-postings from peers develop a more trusting community than exists in most classes. The people around the table share personal details that strengthen the content and style of their writing, and maintain confidence even through writing critiques that sometimes suggest radical revisions. The course's substance is essay assignments and readings that develop the students\u0092 attention to the settings, characters, and significances of what happens \u0093At Home in America.\u0094 Though student essays and the readings may pertain to general problems or other individuals in America, they most often address the author's own experiences, or her \"slant truth\" of any given subject told in a peronsal narrative. The assignments are three short essays (1,000 words each on the topics of Place, House, Object), one longer essay (~3,000 words profiling a character chosen from the New Haven Yellow Pages), and two thorough revisions (one of a short piece and of the Yellow Pages piece). Students are paired for writing critiques of each assignment, and for camaraderie and support during the writing of the Yellow Pages piece. The readings are generally from the canon of narrative journalists and New Journalists, including John McPhee, Ian Frazier, Gay Talese, and Adrian Nicole LeBlanc. Some are short (one or two magazine-length articles) and some are long (most of a book). The short readings provide models for students, and the long readings provide inspiration for future work outside the bounds of the course. The best part of the course was the personal attention from peers and Anne. This made the course a common, disciplined undertaking. Writing conferences and revisions were also generative. I had never before so vigorously re-imagined a work of my writing before I did so for a revision in this class (the revision process is of course also concerns technical and grammatical matters). I would recommend this class for a student with the gumption to become a good writer and the generosity to help others do the same.",
    "This will be the best class that you take at Yale. If you get in, TAKE IT. And try to get in. Anne is absolutely incredible and has perfected her syllabus such that all students have a fast-paced, but never too overwhelming, semester of coursework. In this class you will write about parts of yourself that you never thought you could write about. You will explore parts of New Haven that you never knew existed. If you have never done any reporting, Anne will teach you; if youhave, you'll get better at it. This class changes the way that you write--makes you think about each and every word in each and every sentence. Finally, the individual conferences that you get to have with Anne are simply invaluable. She is a remarkable teacher but also wonderfully kind. My only word of advice would be not to overload your schedule the semester that you take this course. Not because it's not possible to take it in a heavy semester or because the workload is unreasonable, which it never is--only because you are going to WANT to devote a ton of time to this class. Anne makes you want to spend hours thinking about individual words and sentences and you'll want to have carved out the time to do that.",
    "A very rigorous writing class. If you want to take it, it must be your highest priority. You will want it to be your highest priority."
