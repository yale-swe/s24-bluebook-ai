    "A great continuation of 3rd year Chinese. Compared to CHNS 150, this semester's texts were much more engaging and involved more relevant topics. We discussed China-Taiwan relations from an economic standpoint, read a Lu Xun text, and also began reading news articles.",
    "It's a difficult course, but you'll get a lot out of it if you put in the work. That being said, I wish we focused more on real-life applications than just focusing on the chapter text each week, e.g. watching movies, reading articles, doing discussion practice.",
    "It's the exact same thing as 150. It's a lot of work but if you want to maintain your language skills, it's totally worth it.",
    "This class is only worthwhile if you are an underclassman who already speaks Chinese and needs the class to advance into more rigorous Chinese studies.",
    "Yes, they will know if it is right for them. Great class, but lots of work",
    "If you want to keep up your listening and reading comprehension, this class is for you. Wang Laoshi and Chan Laoshi are great -- they are both caring and passionate about teaching Chinese. They both keep the class interesting. The workload is pretty heavy -- there is homework pretty much every night that consists of memorizing lessons, writing essays, doing online homework, reading newspapers, doing listening homework, etc. It takes a lot of time and devotion, but it's a great class overall.",
    "CHNS151 is an advanced course that covers a variety of modern topics ranging from economics to the movie industry, contemporary Chinese literature and formal news vocabulary. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to solidify their foundation of Mandarin language."
