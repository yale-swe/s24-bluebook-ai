   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: nice professor, consistent assignments, a lot of feedback provided Weakness: the Excel workbooks are not what are seen on the job in investment banking",
    "Among the many strengths, the primary one is that Professor Antle lists out the levels of confusion we should have through the course, how they should be diminishing (what we should be mastering), and ultimately brings the foundational concepts of accounting together fluidly at the end. He also thrives in making the study of accounting rather interesting as opposed what many believe to be a dry subject. I would take this course again just for the sake of repetition being the father of learning because the information is dense but the way it is presented is at a steady pace and does not leave any details out.",
    "The problem sets and assignments are very useful and well-structured, and I enjoyed having useful links and videos available online to help with assignments. X-Prep was a useful learning tool. It could be improved by more feedback throughout the course. It would have been nice to have feedback on the problem sets, for example.",
    "I really liked the excel assignments and ExPrep. They were very practical to real world accounting. I also was impress with Professor Antle. He really cares about his students and loves his work.",
    "Prof Antle built the class really well and tried to engage everyone. Also, it built upon itself and Prof Antle was always willing to help you better understand the material.",
    "I know that this class has been taught for many years and follows a specific grading rubric. However, I think the class would be significantly improved by a standardized grading approach that has students show their understanding of course material over the course of the semester. It was unclear what was being graded and what wasn't all semester.",
    "Strengths: Rick Antle, the subject material, and the structure\/workload Weaknesses: 8:45am, unorganized (unclear what assignments are due\/when)",
    "I loved the accounting problem set software we used.",
    "Course would be greatly improved by giving more hands-on experience with real companies rather than toy models. The in-class final was actually a super interesting assignment that I wish we got more of. This course absolutely needs superior organization. Professor Antle needs to upload all assignments into one central location in a timely manner so we can see them. The homework assignments also would be significantly improved with solutions released either with the assignment or a day later. You also have basically zero idea of how you're really doing in the course. We didn't get a single grade on an assignment until the in-class final. Keep up on the homework and talk to Professor Antle regularly when doing the homework and assessments. He's more than willing to help and is a pretty cool dude.",
    "Rick is an amazing professor. He was very clear, helpful, and understanding. He made a boring topic really fun and engaging and always kept the class interested.",
    "He doesnt check or grade any of your assignemnts. I have no idea what grades I got on anything. The strength is that knowing accounting is useful.",
    "This course is a good step-by-step for learning how to do accounting, and the course really does also try to make the student understand not just how accounting is done but why certain things are done the way they are. Given that this is an accounting course, there's not much that can be improved to make it a better accounting course. One improvement could be a more straightforward and understandable grading system; there were many \"assignments\" that the professor said wouldn't be graded except for in certain circumstances, which made it a little difficult to understand how exactly the final grade would be calculated, and also made it more difficult to engage with each assignment.",
    "Too much work on journal entries and not enough on analyzing financial statements",
    "Although this being an accounting course, it was not a very organized course. Rick needs to improve with the ExPrep. It was often not working very well and made learning a bit difficult.",
    "This course was structured so as to induce an environment in which there is as much freedom as possible to learn the basics of accounting at your own pace. One of the drawbacks of this is that if you take too much advantage of this freedom, you may become lost in the lectures, but that's on you to catch up.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are entertaining. Class is recorded, so it helps to watch as refreshers. Weaknesses: Some parts of the class is disorganized. *New implementation and use of an Excel add-on called ExPrep that helps grade your answers to homework problems is helpful, but also felt very incomplete--I think it can be a lot more useful to students, once the feedback\/scoring, etc. is fleshed out.",
    "Professor Antle is very fun but the course kinda just leaves you behind. He says not to worry about it but even on the last week of classes he says you could still be super confused and personally I think a course should be designed such that by the last week of it you're no longer confused.",
    "Overall, this was a very good introduction to accounting and the exercises were helpful for learning. The only thing was that the way the canvas was organized, with all of the classes listed as assignments even if nothing was due was very confusing.",
    "The strengths of this course were the problem sets and the exercises that helped you learn well for the final. Professor Antle was a good lecturer and made accounting more accessible to students that were new to the field."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, the professor is amazing and it is always fun to take a class at SOM.",
    "I recommend this course to any student that believes practical knowledge will help them out in the future, so just about all students out there.",
    "Do you need to know how to make or read ledgers, balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements? If so, this course is a great start. The assignments are useful to work through. However, lecture is a bit dry (it's largely just the subject - the professor makes it as interesting as possible).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in finance. For those students, accounting is invaluable.",
    "Definitely. Professor Antle is awesome and I learned basic accounting skills which are really important to know. I would recommend especially if you're interested in finance\/accounting or want to learn excel better.",
    "As the only accounting course available to undergraduates, it could be a good course to take if you have the extra space in your schedule. However, to be honest, I think that students might otherwise be better served by learning accounting on their own and taking other courses that are more unique to Yale.",
    "Absolutely! Accounting is a very practical, tangible skill and Rick Antle is a wonderful professor. If you're willing to go to class every M-W at 8:45 it is worth it",
    "Yes, if you have any desire to actually run a company and make money this class is a must.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's not that hard if you keep up on the work, and the in-class final is fairly straightforward if you really study for it.",
    "Yes. It's an early class but so worth it and it gets you out of bed in the morning.",
    "I would recommend it i guess. Only if youre comfortable learnign ALL of the material in the last two weeks of the course. He never graded anythign and only posted any solutions to assignments after thanksgiving break.",
    "If you really want to learn accounting in a class setting, take this course. If you just want to learn accounting, it shouldn't be that difficult to learn it on your own.",
    "I would recommend this course to almost anyone as it's a great environment to learn about the purpose of accounting, and everything you're taught can be easily applied outside of the classroom.",
    "Take it credit\/d.",
    "For anyone that wants to learn and practice accounting, but the basic principles are introduced in other courses, like Corporate Finance in the ECON department.",
    "Not really no",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student that is interested in learning the basic skills and knowledge of accounting."
