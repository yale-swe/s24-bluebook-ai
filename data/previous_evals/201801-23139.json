    "I think that this was a great review of modern art.",
    "This was an excellent course that provided both a grounding overview of art since 1945, as well as a thorough dive into certain topics.",
    "Greater conceptual understanding of post-war and contemporary art, also now can recognize many of the works we looked at in class",
    "Knowledge of modern art",
    "Main art movements after 1945. General modern\/ contemporary art concepts",
    "I learned a great deal about modern art, art movements and the theoretical framework underlying 20th century art",
    "Survey of contemporary art and the status quo of the art community.",
    "An overview of (subjectively) important movements and artists after 1945. Sort of a survey of this period, but reaches into contemporary art which is pretty interesting. However, the end result feels like we touched on a good number of pieces without really delving into more detail about them, which was a bit disappointing.",
    "I learned a great deal about post WW2 American contemporary art, which has proven to be useful in my own studies as an American Studies major.",
    "Overview of art since 1945"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was definitely a little dry.",
    "The lectures are engaging and informative but very dense. Section should be held in the museum and focus on close looking, instead of discussing readings.",
    "Great speed",
    "Key topics and flows were generally logical and easy to follow. However, the more recent topics\/ movements seemed less chronicle and not as straightforward to understand as the earlier movements (e.g. abstract or pop).",
    "The course does a good job at introducing major movements in modern art in the U.S. post-WWII. It is engaging and the readings were helpful and interesting. I do wish that it focused a little more on the modern art movements outside the U.S. so that it is not that US-centric.",
    "The class is pretty comprehensive and covers topics that include various issues and agendas in the contemporary art community in addition to specific art works. However, I felt the lectures often lacked a overarching framework that tied everything together. There were lots of description and interpretation of individual art works and movements but not much explanation in how they stand in relation to other works and their place in the larger timeline.",
    "Strengths: -Visits to the YUAG during section -Section deep engagement with pieces that we were not able to spend a ton of time on in lecture. -Organized lecture schedule Weaknesses: -Unclear expectations for major assignments -\"Brain Dump\" assessments -Rote memorization of hundreds of paintings for midterm and cumulative final exam",
    "Lecture language was too esoteric - seemed like every sentence had to have at least a four syllable word! Made it hard to grasp material when it was spoken and it was easier to just try to copy down exactly what was said. Pace very fast. Strength, though, is Rosenberg's deliberate inclusion of minorities in the overall art narrative and the thematic aspect of the lectures. His feedback was also good."

   "comments": [
    "I think it is a great course for understanding, but definitely was boring at times.",
    "Yes - particularly if they are genuinely interested in contemporary art.",
    "Definitely. Anyone who likes Art History classes or who just likes contemporary art. This was also a great class to take after an initial HSAR intro like 115, which is what I did.",
    "Absolutely - great course!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about post-WWII American art. I came out knowing a lot more about the different art movements and artists than I did going into the course and I can finally not feel like such a fool in modern art museums.",
    "If you want a general survey of contemporary art it's not a bad class to take but I wouldn't actively recommend it.",
    "Interesting if you want to hear about relevant pieces, but also felt like I could have just read a textbook about this period. The course was heavily supplemented by its well-selected readings, which provided a lot of the background that Professor Rosenberg brushed over in class. Without the readings, I would not have gotten nearly as much out of the course as Professor Rosenberg tends to ramble a lot and doesn't always seems to have a point when he discusses a piece. If you're willing to a least skim the weekly readings, then its worth taking - otherwise, you can just read selections from the class textbook.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially with Professor Rosenberg. This was one of the best classes I took in my four years at Yale!",
    "This course is great for students who excel at rote memorization. If you can memorize hundreds of paintings and their date and creator before a high stakes midterm and cumulative final exam, this is the course for you. If you are like me, and you are horrible at rote memorization and \"brain dump\" assessments, find another course to take.",
    "Yes if they have an interest"
