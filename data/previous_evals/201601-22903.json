    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in IR theory and in gaining practical experience with social science research methods.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student. Even though I am much more qualitative-oriented than quantitative-oriented, this class really helped me understand how to choose the most useful and appropriate methods in light of the research question. I feel more confident critically evaluating research designs after taking this class.",
    "I really liked the class overall, but I did feel that Prof. Lyall was not really as engaged as he should have been. If you're interested in IR\/plan to have IR be one of your qualifying fields, then you need to take it. If you're not interested in current debates in IR OR you aren't interested in the methodologies being used in the field, then you probably should skip this class."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of both methods and substance, introducing me to new theoretical perspectives as well as innovative research designs.",
    "As above, I think this was the most useful class I took all semester. Learning how to think critically about research design is very valuable and I think Professor Lyall's approach was very effective. The replication assignment allowed me to do a deep dive into a dataset and understand exactly how it was constructed, which will be very useful in evaluating datasets going forward. Thanks for a great semester!"
