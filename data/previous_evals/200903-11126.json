    "The course involves listening to speakers and reading papers in a particular area of neuroscience, critically evaluating the papers, and participating in a discussion with students and instructors about the papers. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "It's a course where you read about many different areas of Neuroscience research, discuss how you felt about them, and propose experiments to refine or extend the scientific questions they asked. I would definitely recommend this class because not only is it a good time, it helps you think and write like a real scientist.",
    "Yes",
    "A highly interactive survey of major research paradigms in Neuroscience. Covers neuroscience research over diverse levels of anatomical organization, from molecules to systems.Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "The course exposed me to many areas of neuroscience with whichI had only a vague familiarity before. The course helped me think of other techniques and methods I could use to conduct my own research.",
    "It helped me be better at critically reading papers. It also helped me plan experiments to address a question and then be able to write about it in a manner that was straight forward and concise.",
    "This course contributed substantially to my research goals and dissertation",
    "The course introduced me to diverse paradigms of modern neuroscience research.The course sharpened my analytical skills in reading and thinking about primary research literature, especially my ability to identify outstanding questions in a field of research and to design experiments to address those questions."
