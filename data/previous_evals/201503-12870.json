   "comments": [
    "Take it. If you're a senior undergraduate planning to go to graduate school, this is a great preparation.",
    "A difficult course that can be frustrating at times, but very rewarding due to how much I feel I have learned in the end. I would recommend the course.",
    "PHYS 506 goes through intermediate mathematical methods useful in theoretical physics. It thoroughly goes over many of the mathematical underpinnings of quantum and classical mechanics that will make both of those subjects make a lot more sense. It also goes over approximation techniques for solving integrals and differential equations, which are very useful since most problems can't be solved analytically. I highly recommend this course if you are not already familiar with all the topics in the course.",
    "PHYS 506 is a useful survey of several disparate mathematical topics that are important in higher-level graduate physics classes. For undergraduates excited about physics and looking for a challenge, it may not be the most intrinsically interesting course, but it is certainly useful preparation for later courses.",
    "A good course to help understand mathematical concepts necessary for theoretical work in physics, especially linear algebra and approximation techniques. I would recommend this to any would-be theorist, but be prepared for some challenging problem sets.",
    "Many important concepts that you might encounter later on; more focus on theory than practical use.",
    "The pacing of the course is perhaps a little heavy on the beginning theory and light on the end application.",
    "Emphasis on the linear vector spaces and more practice on differential equations, but lack of at least some introduction to group theory, Lie algebra. Recommend if one feels inexperienced on mathematical methods in general."

   "comments": [
    "It introduced me to vital mathematical concepts.",
    "I am now more mathematically sophisticated, a trait I intend to continue to foster as I continue my work as a theoretical physicist.",
    "This course was a great review and extension on topics that many students had seen in their undergraduate curriculum, but the topics were not covered well if you were seeing it for the first time. That may just be the nature of this type of course, though.",
    "As an experimentalist, the methods learned in this course may not be ultimately applicable, but the critical thinking required to complete some of the problem sets speaks for itself."
