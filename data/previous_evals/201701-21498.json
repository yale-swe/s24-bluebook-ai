   "comments": [
    "I definitely learned a lot more about how to properly approach decoding Roman sculpture, as well as how to identify Roman periods and figures. I also was ignorant women's roles in Roman culture, so to have a class specifically designated to discuss their importance was extremely interesting. If nothing else, it promoted a lot of discussion, leading me to be more critical of textual and visual sources.",
    "Professor Kleiner showed us how to look at discuss art in a high-level, nuanced way.",
    "This course taught me how to read a portrait, understand Roman art in its context, and appreciate the narrative associated with historical artefacts. I also gained a much better understanding of the role played by women in ancient societies- something which often goes unnoticed."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the \"inverted classroom\" technique in which we watched lectures and read sources in preparation for class discussion worked particularly well in this course as it promoted disputation and thoughtful arguments. I also thought Prof. Kleiner's additional powerpoints were helpful to offer case studies. Having only seven people in the class was challenging at times, because when one was missing, the amount of discussion decreased exponentially, but at the same time, the small class size forced discussion in that no one could be silent.",
    "The best aspect of this course is the incorporation of visual media: whether through videos, images in class, or even museum visits. These different modes of teaching make this class very interesting. I look forward to every single session."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any who want a highly specialized view of Roman history. It is intensive and fast paced, organized intuitively through themes, many of which are surprising and interesting.",
    "Yes, take it! Prof. Kleiner is so knowledgable, kind, and receptive to different ways of thinking about\/looking at art and history. It's not too much weekly work, and most of the readings\/class discussions are pretty fun. One midterm paper (close looking\/research for an object) and one final exhibition project which is low-key a lot of work, but enjoyable at least.",
    "Women in Roman Art is a very interesting thematic course that delves into the world of Rome. Professor Kleiner has a wealth of information - she has \"written the book\" on Roman art. That being said, I felt I benefited from taking another course on Rome before having taken this class. The class's thematic approach could be challenging if one has not been very much exposed to Rome before. Kleiner will lead discussion and speaks a lot. I found this enjoyable, as seminars can be frustrating when the professor takes a back seat.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The opportunity of taking a class with Prof. Kleiner, along with the enjoyable coursework, makes this class great."
