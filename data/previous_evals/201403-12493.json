    "Thst 224 is a class you can easily not work hard for, but it shows. This class challenges you to self work, which is what one must do after college when there are no classwork deadlines. The constant self improvement and obvious improvement through other people's performances inspired you to work hard! I would recommend this class to many, for experience, and to build up stamina and confidence.",
    "If you want to hone your MT acting skills, this is the class for you. It's not a voice class or a movement class, but develops your relationship with song material. If you put in the work, you'll certainly grow as a performer over the course of the semester: you get out of the class what you put into it. Make sure you keep on top of the journal\/readings\/viewings or you'll be in a tight spot at the end of the semester. For a New York professional with a whole other career, Annette shows incredible dedication to her students, always answers email thoroughly, and is a great resource when planning your songs for class or writing papers.",
    "This class gives you a conservatory-style master class to work on musical theatre song-work each week. Each class is three hours long, and six people will be workshopped, taking about half an hour each. The person performs their song, everyone critiques them, and they perform again. The class is really about performance -- making the audience understand and believe the story of your song -- rather than about singing.",
    "THST 224 is a performance class with an academic component. If you are at all interested in performing this material, even just during college, take the class. Annette is wonderful and she cares so much about the class. This is a class where you get out twice what you put into it.",
    "A masterclass in musical theater performance. Definitely take it if that appeals to you. Annette is really smart, and has a lot of great insights that will stick with you.",
    "Weekly performances, a new group of friends interested in theater, and a lot of reading. I would most definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in musical theater performance. It expanded my knowledge not only of musical theater performance, but of the history and business of musical theater.",
    "Highly recommended, one of my favorite courses this semester!!!",
    "If you're a musical theater actor and want to get credit for practicing your performance skills, definitely take this class! It might be a little intimidating to take this class if you're not enmeshed in the theater community, but don't let that deter you if you want to take it!",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning more about musical theater and the performance of musical theater. Not just a performance class by any means--there are readings and viewings, and two analytical papers. Don't worry if you don't know much to begin with about how to write about musical theater songs--in the course of the semester, you'll learn by hearing Annette and your classmates discuss the pieces and doing the readings. Don't underestimate the importance of the journal. Don't get caught at the midterm or the end of the semester doing all of your reading and performance notes at once. Performance-wise, PREPARE as best you can each week. You will be stopped mid-line over and over again and you'll need to take (very constructive) criticism, so prepare for that too. It's a great class if you're interested and really put in the effort, particularly in your performances. In terms of the workload, the readings are short and the papers are too, but the work you'll have to do in preparation for your performances is significant."
