   "comments": [
    "I expanded my musical theater knowledge and performance repertoire, increased my understanding of musical text and how to approach a text for performance, how to use musical cues to inform performance of a piece, and increased my ability to take and use critique in a short amount of time.",
    "I learned a lot of ways to improve my own personal performance of pieces. I learned about different habits that I have in performance so that I can try to overcome them. I learned a lot of history of musical theater as well.",
    "As a performer, I think I've grown in so many ways this semester. I've developed the skills to properly approach a musical theater work with both an academic\/analytical lens and an actor\/singer lens - what insights can I gain from what's written by a composer and how can I embody it and make it my own. The research\/readings we did also gave me a broader historical\/cultural context for the performing work we were doing because it deepened my understanding of the material.",
    "I gained a large increase in preparation for performances, as well as developing a better critical view on Musical Theatre.",
    "I gained a much better sense of how to approach a song and how to break a song into its appropriate complexity. Watching my classmates work through their own songs gave me a greater sense of which approaches worked and the relationship between the performer and an audience.",
    "As someone who has never performed in a musical theater show, developed skills of acting and performance through watching others and performing myself."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has many strengths; the small class size makes it a very personal experience and everyone gets plenty of time to workshop their performances. This also lends to a tight class bond, which makes performances far more comfortable. Annette is incredibly helpful in her critiques and her advice when choosing songs to perform; she always goes above and beyond to help students. My only criticism of the course was that it felt like the readings and in-class performance study weren't very integrated. I enjoyed both, but it would have been nice to have some more performance-oriented readings as well.",
    "This course is great to learn some history of musical theater and to polish up your own work on performances. I think the course has two overall weaknesses: since the class is set up like a masterclass, the only time when I'm truly engaged is when we're working on my own piece, which accounts for only about a fifth of the actual class time. It is difficult to stay focused and to not fall asleep on Friday when I am not actively engaged in the class for a large portion of it. The other weakness of the class is that it is not totally focused on performance, as it claims to be. Though I understand the importance of learning the history behind musical theater, I found the readings disappointing because they weren't about performance. Sometimes it felt like this was the merger of a history and performance class. I would've been a lot more engaged in the class if I had readings about performance: how to approach a piece of musical theater, how to analyze the musical qualities of songs, etc. This is what I hoped to learn about in the course, and while I did get snippets of that through performance in class and my own research for papers, the class wasn't solely focused on this and I wish it had.",
    "One of the best parts of the class is getting to watch your classmates perform, giving them feedback, listening to Annette's feedback, and then seeing how their performances evolve as they respond to the feedback. You learn just as much, if not more, from watching your classmates perform as you do when you perform yourself.",
    "Only suggestion would be that essay prompts were often nebulous, I didn't always know what Annette was looking for. I loved how we broke down musical theater by era and how the readings were so appropriate for each thing we studied.",
    "The course is structured very well, with performances being flexible but mostly every other week. You learn lots from watching others. I personally think my performances would've benifited from some way to communicate with Prof. Jolles before Friday performances, to get some ideas down as to how it should be done. Perhaps have more time to bring songs back."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their song performance. The time Annette spends with each student is invaluable, and you learn so much about yourself and how to improve your own performance from her critiques and by watching other students perform. It's such a supportive environment for performance and you get so much out of the class. It forces you to be prepared, if you haven't fully prepared a song it will be very obvious, but as a performer you should take the time to be prepared in order to get everything out of the class that you can. The readings are fun and interesting, and the midterm and final papers aren't bad. The main focus of the course is on performance.",
    "This class is really helpful to polish up work that you've done in practicing musical theater pieces, and Annette is a really brilliant professor who knows what she's doing when it comes to analyzing characters. The class isn't totally based around performance, though -- you have to do lots of readings of musical theater history which don't always seem the most applicable or helpful to what you're focusing on in the class. Additionally, the class is set up like a masterclass, so while it is helpful, it doesn't start from the beginning in teaching ways to approach a musical theater piece. You have to perform in front of the class and then it gets worked on (via critique from the prof and other students). While it may seem scary at first, this is super helpful to improving your craft. Albeit, because the class is set up in this way, it means that there is a lot of time when you are not performing, which may be a little disengaging. Overall, I would say that you should take this class if you would like to workshop some musical theater pieces and learn about different habits you have in performance and try to overcome them. I'm not sure if there is a lot of growth to come out of this class, but it is certainly helpful in more subtle ways, like forcing you to pick repertoire and memorize pieces.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone passionate about performing--even if they don't necessarily love musical theater--because you learn so much about yourself as a performer and get the opportunity to work on those skills with your classmates and a seasoned professional. The Shen curriculum provides amazing opportunities in the field of musical theater like this course that allow you to develop an academic and analytical perspective in addition to a strong personal, performance-based perspective. If you're passionate about musical theater, it's an opportunity you can't pass up.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they wanted to hone their craft of singing. If they are unsure that it is something they would like to do, then I would not.",
    "Definitely, especially if you have future aspirations to be a performer. Amazing one-on-one work to make songs more complex and performance ready.",
    "Definitely take it, no matter your level of experience! Annette tailors her responses to your needs!",
    "If you are at all interested in theatre, musical theatre, or any kind of performance really, take this class. You will learn so much from watching your peers work on material, and you will think critically about what makes a performance effective and truthful."
