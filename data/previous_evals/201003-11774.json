   "comments": [
    "Spanish 140 is an excellent next step for anyone learning Spanish. Remember that it's L4, and still meets every day. If you can, take it with Ame Cividanes. She's an excellent instructor, cares very much about her students, and is a master of the Spanish language.",
    "It's a great way to fill your language requirement.",
    "Spanish 4 is a considerably harder course than Spanish 3. There are a lot more projects for the class - the homeworks are longer and graded harder, there are more oral presentations, and you read a short novel at the end. That being said, you learn a lot of grammar and will definitely improve your speaking abilities.",
    "I would recommend it because you learn a lot of useful words and syntactical formations that aid in communication",
    "I would recommend Span 140 to any student looking to improve their spanish skills.",
    "Spanish 140 is a good refresher course. I didn't take Spanish my senior year of high school and I wanted a class to help me remember and improve my Spanish. The class starts out extremely slow with present subjunctive. When it begins to pick up, you analyze novels and movies. Overall, it was a great class; I remembered my Spanish and improved dramatically. If you can get into Ame Cividanes' section, do it because she was amazing. Also, make sure you shop this class right away because it was almost impossible getting into an L4 Spanish class because these classes fill up fast and they have a cap on the number of students.",
    "The class is exactly what you would expect. I would highly recommend Cividanes if you can get into her section.",
    "I think it's a good class to take to improve your spanish. It's not very much work and it reviews all the important grammatical topics. If you can get a small class do it because having a big class was I think the only downside to the class.",
    "Spanish 140 continues the sometimes-fascinating, sometimes-monotonous curriculum of L3. The classes are very similar in format, perhaps with a bit less grammar in L4 and more focus on oral presentations and discussions. If you're in this class for the right reasons (truly wanting to learn the language), Profesora Cividanes does a fantastic job of teaching L4.She does a wonderful job of bringing energy and focus to the class, really striking the balance between accessible friendliness and the professionalism that demands respect and strong work from her students.",
    "I thought Cividanes was a great teacher for this course. Definitely take her section. She grades fairly and isn't too hard on people for the most part. Pretty forgiving too. She really wants you to improve your Spanish skills and will let you know how you are doing, especially on the written compositions throughout the course. Presentations can be a bit intimidating at first, especially the 30 minute one at the end, but I thought it all worked out in the end. Everything is geared to help you get better."
