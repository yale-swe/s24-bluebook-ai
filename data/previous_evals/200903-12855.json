    "The advanced China studio allows you to build off your culminated knowledge from previous courses and past professional work. It's a phenomenal studio experience that should continue in different formats with each passing year (i.e. studio project in the US, final in Hong Kong, studio project in Beijing, final at Yale, etc.) Plus, one of the greatest aspects of the studio is seeing how different schools in different cities and countries formulate varying ideas based on the same information.",
    "This studio may have benefited with a higher degree of collaboration with landscape. We met unofficially with Alex Felson, and an official collaboration may have been great.",
    "should include alex felson from the beginning. they did a good job of stressing the landscape and planning, obviously."

   "comments": [
    "Most valuable...international pinups, travel, and mixed china-us teams",
    "I think we could have used more\/better pin-ups with outside critics. Our midterm review was vastly a disaster considering we pinned up a plan which none of us could stand behind. As a result, we never really presented our individual projects to any outside critics before the final review. The final review would have made a great midterm review - but did not feel terribly final. I guess this means I wish we had started individual work sooner.",
    "desk crits were great -- could have used more pin ups earlier in the semester; outside feedback was really helpful, but mostly came at the end."

   "comments": [
    "The international collaboration opportunities were the major academic strength of the studio",
    "I think the studio did a good job of letting us make a lot of our own decisions regarding program, schedule, and production, but a little more guidance\/friction might have been helpful",
    "the group master plan was kind of iffy -- hard to work with 7 people in an advanced studio. everyone is out to get what they want and therefore unwilling to compromise. in the future, i would stick to pairs."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations matched the outcome. A strong urban design studio without any restraint or bias.",
    "I had expected to complete a solid urbanism studio and to learn about China. I think I did get a solid urbanism education, but I wish we had learned more about China. Our trip was super short and vastly political in terms of what we did. I feel like we didn't really get to know our site or the city as well as we might have. Much of that has to do with the nature of concealing information in China, but I do think we could have gotten deeper into some of the bigger issues - like the culture of housing, work, and public space in Chinese cities.",
    "high - and they were."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of your Studio Head and if there was one, the Assistant Teacher.",
   "comments": [
    "Alan Plattus is the perfect teacher for this type of studio, a middle-of-the-road designer and urbanist who appreciates both sides of the architectural spectrum. With his wide range of knowledge, ability to inspire, and lack of bias, he\u0092s one of the greatest teachers at Yale if not the best. In addition, Andrei Harwell as Alan\u0092s assistant filled in the coordination gaps throughout the studio and provided some good secondary insight.",
    "Although I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Alan and Andrei, I wish sometimes that they had been more critical. Their feedback was primarily positive and rarely did they challenge anything we proposed. While this was refreshing given the typically negative tone of the school, I think we could have been challenged further to produce better work.",
    "alan knows everything, so that's a strength.andrei is great on the front and back ends -- could be more positive during reviews and crits. but was great about giving advice."
