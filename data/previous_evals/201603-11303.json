   "comments": [
    "I learned some very basic skills in all the modules that this class covered. I have a bit more confidence now to be able to ask the right questions for help on these topics if I were to ever use them in my own research. I think that was the point of this class, so that's good!",
    "The most important insight in gained in this course was an intuiative understanding of quantative methods including things like stats, fourier transform, and most important to me fitting\/machine learning, and modeling. As a biologist, I do not aim to gain develop \"math\" skills in which I crunch out mathproblems. Instead I needed a class to learn how math\/physics\/stats is used as a tool to gain insight in biology. This is the ONLY class that can offer something like this to me. I have tried to do this on my own via reading in books\/online lectures but this course was actually succesful in giving me an intuitive understanding of quantative methods. Most importantly for me, I learned how to use simulink in matlab which plan to continue to use my research. This is an EXTREMELY valuable tool for me because it will allow me to model my own research. I cannot emphasize, how CRUCIAL this course was for my own developement as a grad student. I might not be able to achieve my goal of modeling in my PhD without the modeling project at the end of the course. IT was also really really great to model the previous work of the professor (Julien Berro) because he of course could guide us along the way. We learned how he modeled the cytoskeleton. Julien was able to teach us modeling with the perfect balance of challenge as well as guidance when needed.",
    "I learned different ways and techniques that can be used to represent data. I learned a lot about Matlab, as I had never used it before, and also a lot about Fourier transforms and statistics that will definitely be useful when thinking about how to set up future studies.",
    "I learnt a lot matlab skills.",
    "I learned a lot of practical skills that I will be able to use in my future as a researcher.",
    "I acquired a basic familiarity with MATLAB and a high-level understanding of how one might distill meaningful information from a large dataset. Additionally, I have a somewhat fuzzy understanding of how one makes sense of structural data."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Having the fourier transform section at the same time as the X-ray crystallography section in Macro was very useful.",
    "The strengths are discussed above. Again in summary, intuitive understanding of quantative methods (an essential skill in the future), a very broad sample of methods which are essential as a biophycsists. This training will help me for the rest of my career for sure. I think this course could be improved via additional resources for students to follow up on for each topic. PDFs of text books, links to videos, etc. This is important because I will probably forget some material that I don't work with everyday. But, it is important that I have resources to reference when I need the material.",
    "I liked how each block were different, yet important, ways to analyze data common in biochemistry and molecular biology. I thought Matlab was an important tool to learn and to use, though I wish we had more time with it in an introductory\/ relevant problems way. I liked how the topics matched up well with Macro, as having them simultaneously but with slightly different focuses really improved my understanding of the topics.",
    "I think the course is built to give us a sample of everything, which is great that it tries to cover a lot of bases. I also really liked how this course sort of complemented the Macromolecular Structure course.",
    "The projects were the strength of the course, since they required us to apply new material to real-world problems. They helped me synthesize the information and identify gaps in my understanding. The Fourier Transformation homeworks were somewhat obnoxious, since they required a low-level understanding that we really hadn't gotten from the lectures. Given the level of detail required for the homeworks, I would have expected a more in-depth exploration of each subject."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course is 10000000% essential to ALL graduate students in MBB, unless if your training was physics\/math. Biologists MUST take this course to become biophysists. Let me further emphasize, this is the potentially the only \"true\" biophysics course in the MBB department for graduate students. Our training as graduate students is lacking in general for quantative methods. In addition, the professors who teach this course are excellent and have the correct mind set. Yong can clearly explain how\/why\/when to use FT. His lectures are super clear and easy to follow. His review of previous lectures, is ideal and all professor should follow his methods. Nikhil did an excellent job presenting stats. He balanced details\/intuition in a way that was actually help to students unlike many other stats courses. His take home message and resources he provided will be in my pocket for all of my PhD. Julien is an excellent scientist, and learning from his experiences is a real treat. His unique experiences really give students a different perspective to biology. Julien did an excellent job presenting machine learning\/PCA\/fitting\/stats\/numerical methods in which I finnaly able to understand. His teachings have allowed me to explore new methods in quantitative biology I wouldn't have been able to achieve easily. It is clear he put alot of thought\/time\/effort into his lectures, and the students were pleased to learn from him. From the project which was based on his work as a post-doc, I will know apply directly to my own research. In fact I have plans to do this now. This has opened up doors that were potentially unreachable before. Lastly, all professors have excellent\/engaging\/ and humorous personabilities that make class fun. I would take this class again and would recommend it to all.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot of useful things about Matlab, statistics, and Fourier transforms that could be relevant to any science problems or questions. The statistics module was especially helpful, and it was nice to get an introduction to Matlab.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is it helps me cooperate with my team members.",
    "I think this is a course to take to sample ideas to approach quantitative biology problems so that later you can focus on a more specific area."
