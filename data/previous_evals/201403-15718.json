    "I would definitely recommend this class. I loved it and I think it is the best research methods class Yale has. It isn't just boring research methods topics, but the game theory aspect brings so much more to it. There are only a few psets, a midterm, and a final project. Overall, I thought it was a great class, although challenging at times.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class to any psych major who is interested in how people make decisions and why people do not act rationally. Also, if you have any interest in game theory at all but don't want to take a full-fledged game theory class, you should take this! Not too much work outside of class - biweekly psets in the beginning, a midterm, a research paper, weekly reading responses for the first half of the class only.",
    "I would if you're looking for a psych class that's a bit different than other psych classes at yale. The workload is lighter (in terms of reading), and you get to do p-sets and study an aspect of psychology that you probably otherwise won't touch on in other classes.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, no but its not the worst decision if you choose to take it",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Social Decision Making was a really great course. It was a really interesting way to learn about game theory. I took it to fulfill my research methods requirement for the psych major, but the class is so interesting and relevant that I would recommend to students regardless of whether they are a psych major. The class was so interesting because it was a combination of social psychology and behavioral economics. The work was very manageable; there were three problem sets, a few readings and reading responses, a midterm, and a final research paper. The midterm was half-calculations and half conceptual, and was extremely long, though people ended up doing well with the curve. The research paper allowed us to design an online study, integrating one of the ideas we learned about in the first half of the course.",
    "Phenomenal course! Professor Rand has so many fascinating things to say. Not too much work and I learned a ton.",
    "Great course with an amazingly enthusiastic professor. The course only meets once a week for three hours, with a 10-15 minute break in between. First half of the course is structured with lectures on economic game theory and corresponding problem sets - we did three total. The lectures are a combination of powerpoint slides, lots of encouraged interaction\/ participation\/ questions, and modeling the game theory principles being covered through playing such games with other classmates online using Moblab. It's a great format that really helps to immediately reinforce each concept. The problem sets can be a bit tedious, and require more in depth computations than covered in lecture. Professor Rand really stresses the understanding of concepts over the crunching of numbers, so it is important to take the \"what does this mean?\" questions that follow each series of computations seriously. It's also advisable to attend office hours just to check over those answers - not only can you lose points for getting them wrong, it will also prevent you from gaining the required understanding needed for the midterm and possibly for data analysis in your paper. Midterm is very long - basically takes the full three hours. It is structured as half problem set type questions (computations and explanations), and half short answer questions. The second half of the course focuses on designing, running, analyzing, and writing up your research study. Designing one's study is pretty open ended - keep an ear out for things that you may want to pursue further while learning about the different types of games and phenomena in the first half of the term. If you are stuck, go to office hours to brainstorm\/ bounce ideas off of the TA. There will be one lecture on research methods, one class session where you learn how to use Qualtrics and design your study in class so that you can receive help if stuck. The study goes live, and in the next class session Professor Rand walks everyone through how to obtain your data and do basic analysis. He then goes around to each person suggesting which further tests you should run and include in your Results section of your paper. The paper is conveniently broken up into sections and you are forced to start early, at the start of the second half of term. A non-graded one page paper proposal is due one week, then the Introduction\/ Lit Review section is due the following week, then the Methods section is due the following week. This is a great way to get a head start on your paper so that you aren't pulling all nighters writing the research paper from scratch during the last week of class. It's also helpful because you get feedback on each section and can do major revisions even before your data is in and analyzed.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's very long and a little hard to get through the 3 hours without drifting off but the material was interesting enough. There was more econ material than expected in the first half of the course but it wasn't too bad. Professor Rand is also very nice and office hours are really helpful for the psets."
