   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class! I learned so much, and the level of rigor to which we treated Micro was wonderful. If you aren't comfortable the first few days with the mathematical arguments, i would recommend taking intermediate, but 125 provides a beautiful level of rigor.",
    "A very good, but very challenging class. Prepare to work like crazy, but the reward is there in the knowledge you will gain.",
    "This is a very challenging class, but at the same time very enjoyable if you like math and problem solving. Take it if you have a strong background in calculus and mathematical proofs.",
    "An excellent and challenging course - you will be better for having taken it! I would definitely recommend this course as it is well-taught and well-structured. It is very theory-based and definitely has strong mathematical components at the start but the lectures are clear and the problem sets, if at first difficult, do become clear with practice.",
    "While this class required much more work than Intermediate Micro, it was quite rewarding and if you are at all interested in math, it's nice to know the theory behind the concepts.",
    "Would definitely recommend it. I felt like I learnt a good amount without being challenged too much, which is a good way to introduce Economics. Should have an okay Math background but that will do.",
    "If you want to take a Micro class that focuses a lot on math, take this class. It overlaps well with a lot of the work that we did in Math 250. The mathematical language was a bit confusing at first, but it gets a lot better. Hard problem sets, and challenging but doable tests if you study.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it who considers themself an econperson who has an interest in how econ actually works, rather than just the theory that you get in the more basic classes.",
    "It's a good class for math-oriented, competitive minded people. People are all hard working and intelligent, so it might be a little difficult to ace the tests all the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those who are really interested in economics, not those who are just planning to sell out.",
    "Guys it's a lot of math, proof-based. Do not take it if you struggle with Math 120 or whatever. But it's rewarding at the end. I really learned a lot. For Intro to Micro, I only learned to do the problems, but after this class, I actually understand things, how we arrived at the solutions and formula.",
    "A good balance of both the derivation of microeconomic theories as well as their application.You should take this course if:1. You like a big serving of math with your economics; possibly with some proofs2. You want to learn why microeconomic formulae work the way they doYou shouldn't take this course if:1. You want a really thought-inspiring, issue-filled lecture2. You want an easy credit with a easy curve; intermediate micro is betterProfessor Rozen is good at explaining things fairly clearly, if you can hold your attention, which is difficult at times, as this isn't exactly a course on a hugely stimulating topic.The course starts out hard, as you aren't used to how it uses math. It gradually gets easier. We cover consumer theory (lots of lagrangians to maximize for variables), firm theory (consumer theory with different names), competition (Cournot, Bertrand, competititve, monopoly), general equilibria (two people, two goods economies, plus firms; prices are arbitrary), and finally game theory (easy)Don't get scared by the Lagrangians. The formulation used is not the same as in MATH 120, but you can get through it if you do one or two problem sets and work with friends. It basically involves maximizing variables, putting equations together and solving for the variables.There is lots of math. This is a mathclass disguised as econ, so don't take it if you don't like math.",
    "Econ 125 - Microeconomic Theory is a fairly advanced course, one that with a quick pace delves into all major regions of microeconomics. It is quite abstract, especially at the beginning, and there are areas, like the Math behind most of the operations that I wish we had time to explain in class in a clearer fashion.I would recommend this course to a fellow student, if she\/he is really keen on microeconomics, has time to commit to do the problem sets, and if enjoys intellectual challenges in class - students in this class tend to be very very smart and passionate about what is being taught.",
    "If you have decent background in math, and have an appetite for deductive reasoning and logical thought you should definitely take this course. It's nearly not as intimidating as it sounds. If anything, you'll learn the intermediate level material well because this class is small, and is taught by a great professor. Don't let the first few days of class turn you off. In the beginning we go through some boring but necessary material about consumer theory. But after that it's pretty much uphill all the way to the end.",
    "This class is heavily math based and a lot of material is covered, outside work on understand concepts is necessary.",
    "ECON 125 covers lots of different mathematical models in microeconomics. I wouldn't say this was the most exciting course ever - it was LOTS of math and equations, and I didn't feel that what we were learning had a lot of relevance to the real world. Nevertheless, chances are, if you're looking at this, you probably need to take either Intermediate Micro or this one. From what I've heard, this is a much better option. Professor Rozen is a great instructor, her lectures were very clear, and her notes very helpful. Some of the concepts were pretty challenging at first, but overall the workload for this class wasn't too bad at all and the exams were pretty fair."
