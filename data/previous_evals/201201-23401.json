    "This class is very ambiguous and I don't think I really learned much of anything. Mendhlson came to Gillingham's Economics class in the fall and I don't think I learned more in the entire semester than I did in the two days he came to Gillingham's class. Kind of a waste of time.",
    "N\/A",
    "The concepts taught in the course are interesting, engaging, and useful, but we didn't really explore them to the extent that a 3 credit course should warrant. Professor M never used the entire time (1-4, Mondays) to lecture, and he was often repeating himself- useful in drilling in the ideas, but I really wanted more information about each topic. Professor M is a otherwise a fantastic lecturer, and I would have appreciated more time listening to him talk - more examples, more discussion, etc. So much of it was overview. The pieces where he goes into the math behind the calculations was so surface, and we didn't need to know it for the exam - he should either fully explain it or not bother with formulas at all.",

    "valuation methods are very useful",
    "The readings do a great job of solidifying material discussed in class.",
    "Covered interested, practical and very helpful set of topics and tools. Gave a good idea about to value the environment",
    "The readings are very comprehensive, the professor has a ton of experience in the techniques (indeed, invented some of them), and students get to actually apply the techniques by conducting their own valuation. Being able to conduct a new valuation is definitely the highlight, as the hands-on work of empirically investigating the theory is great experience.",
    "A good overview of the methods for valuing the environment from a professor who thinks and speaks very clearly.",
    "Economic way of thinking pollution management issues",
    "A real survey research by youself. Also the worst part...",
    "The use of publications that were relevant and important gave a good sense for the evolution of the topic.",

    "The instructor broke down the concept very well, and explained them clearly, with ample examples. Great to learn from someone who has actually developed those techniques."

   "comments": [
    "The way the midterm was designed. It did not reflect our understanding of the course material nor valuation techniques.",
    "Structure of lectures and project.",
    "N\/A",
    "This course needs to have problem sets. The theories were great, but it would be much more valuable if we could try applying them. The instructor's handwriting is very illegible, which is frustrating when you're trying to write down equations.",
    "A more thorough review of methodologies - functional forms, controls, etc.",
    "In general, more work - more guided opportunity to understand the methods and ideas. Practicing a CV was great - but the guidance behind writing the paper and implementing was barely there - even in pursuing feedback, I didn't get a robust response. I would have appreciated the opportunity to find out what other students did, discuss the methods and readings with other students, peak into a more complete picture of the methods.More importantly, I would have liked to better understand what is happening currently with these valuation methods. How are academics, the government, NGOs implementing these ideas? How are they effecting policy? Most\/all of the readings and examples were old, and focused on a narrow set of topics - would have been interesting to understand how these techniques are used with more issues, and how they might fit into broader social science\/psychology survey techniques.Also, Professor M is often somewhat dismissive of student comments and questions - he sometimes doesn't really listen to what someone is saying, but makes assumptions about what that person is saying and replies based on on the assumption as opposed to what the person is trying to communicate.",
    "Needs to be taught over multiple days, one day for 3 hours is brutal",
    "Better instrucion and guideline to contents of every classes.",
    "There were no guiding books (texts, chapters) or documents (slides, summaries). All that was provided was a syllabus and the publications. It would have been nice to have some sort of guiding document that put all of the methodologies presented into context in order to understand how I might be ready to use these in future in a real sense, rather than occasional asides in lectures and feeling uncertain how these might be useful to me if I do not pursue further studies in economics.",
    "The readings are a big outdated. Some of them date back more than 10 years and the there is more recent information out there.",
    "More consistent practice assignments would be helpful for making sure that all students understand the concepts."

Professor M's office hours are always completely swamped, and he doesn't use a sign in sheet. Laura was very responsive to email, however, and I really appreciated that.",
    "TA is really nice.",

The TA proceeded very linearly through the material and summarized very clearly aspects of the different methodologies and what the key takeaways are about each one. She was enthusiastic, and her grasp and presentation were confidence-inspiring.",
    "TA and professor were available and provided good support!",
