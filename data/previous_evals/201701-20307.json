    "I developed skills associated with researching and synthesizing historical sources.",
    "I learned a lot about the alternative history of American colonization and Spanish borderlands exploration.",
    "Class material was interesting, but Professor Blackhawk only had plans for the first ~six weeks of class. I understand it's a research seminar, but still, actually having guided readings and subjects for a full semester would have been great. Also, like any expectations for any of the work. Blackhawk is knowledgeable and asks good discussion questions, but is ridiculously vague and difficult to get straight answers out of.",
    "I learned how to write an extended 18+ page history paper and developed the skill of managing my time so that I would complete research over an extended period of several months. I also developed knowledge of how to find and use pre-1800 primary sources. Most of the knowledge that I gained about Spanish Colonialism in the borderlands is less specific (I know very few names and dates besides the info for my specific final paper) but more centered around general themes of Spanish Colonialism and its legacy in the United States today."

   "comments": [
    "This course could be strengthened if there was new content taught in the second half of the semester.",
    "During discussions for this course, we almost never engaged with the reading we had done for it. Class discussions were extremely limited, although Professor Blackhawk was obviously excited about the material, the discussions felt limited largely because he seemed very unprepared for the class. He had no topics of discussion for us to focus on, and did not point us to them in the text. The reading was very interesting but the seminar meetings were mediocre at best.",
    "I wish this had been a lecture. The class was most interesting when Professor Blackhawk was just teaching us the history.",
    "More structured discussion time. Often, it would feel like Professor Blackhawk would not come prepared with specific points he wanted to discuss in relation to the texts we read or generally. This made for meandering conversation.",
    "The readings were great and organized. Professor Blackhawk was very helpful and knowledgeable. My only feedback is that class conversation among students was not always as interesting or in depth as it could have been.",
    "Class material was interesting, but Professor Blackhawk only had plans for the first ~six weeks of class. I understand it's a research seminar, but still, actually having guided readings and subjects for a full semester would have been great. Also, like any expectations for any of the work. Blackhawk is knowledgeable and asks good discussion questions, but is ridiculously vague and difficult to get straight answers out of.",
    "The course readings for this class were strong and generally very interesting. I specifically enjoyed reading Anaya's \"Alburquerque\" and the essays in \"Contested Eden.\" I do wish, however, that we had had more rigorous reading assignments and that we had had more assigned reading for the second half of the course. I understand that the lighter reading was likely intended to give us time to work on our paper research, but I think having some reading in common would have aided class discussions in the final weeks. Also, many of the students in the class had a very fast learning curve regarding the history of Spanish colonialism and I feel as though it would be helpful next year to have at least one class that is more of a lecture on the history of Spaniards and Indigenous people in the New Mexico \/ California territories. Although the class usually functions well as a discussion-based seminar, I think that it would help to teach all of the participants this history more directly-- this semester, I think many students kind of had to self-teach themselves the basic history outside of class and then still felt uneasy discussing certain periods in class because the chronology was still unclear."

    "If you are very dedicated to learning about this topic, then sure, take this course. But if you are simply interested, you might do some independent research, or maybe just come to Prof. Blackhawk's office hours once or twice. We didn't have any readings for the final five weeks of the course, which might seem appealing, but I think it just led to minimal engagement.",
    "The course material is very interesting but the course itself offers very little. Discussions are quite slow and can be almost nonexistent.",
    "Yes, the untold history of the Spanish borderlands in North America is an important and under-taught subject.",
    "Yes, but hopefully you'll have a livelier group than I did, or hopefully, Professor Blackhawk will choose to teach it as a lecture.",
    "I don't think I would. While I understand the lack of work was, in part, to give us free time to do independent research, I think that time could have been supplemented with tips for research methods other texts to discuss. And as I mentioned above more specific and directed discussion.",
    "Through this course you will learn an important history that is purposefully erased in United States history books.",
    "Yes",
    "Class material was interesting, but Professor Blackhawk only had plans for the first ~six weeks of class.

    "This class is a good option for people who are interested in taking an intimate history seminar with a professor that will make time to discuss their personal ideas. The course covers material that is barely touched on in most high school history classes, and for this reason, students are likely to be very interested by this part of continental U.S. history that is too often ignored. One should know, however, that much of this class focuses primarily on Spanish Colonialism and less on Indigenous individuals and communities. The class is interesting without being too stressful so it's also a great option for people who need to complete a pre-civil war requirement. If you take the class, pick a final paper subject that you are passionate about and take the time to meet with Professor Blackhawk to discuss your ideas. This way, you will get the most out of the process of writing the paper!"
