    "A better conception for the different types of circuits and their behavior, especially ones with multiple energy storage elements. Strong ability with Laplacian and Fourier mathematical tools, especially for circuit analysis, circumventing the need for fancy differential equation solving.",
    "Things about circuits.",
    "Learn about circuits in terms of RLC, Laplace, Fourier",
    "got a more in-depth knowledge about circuit operation, design and application",
    "Better understood frequency response in RLC circuits, Laplace and Fourier series treatment.",
    "Basically a review of EENG 200 but with Fourier and Laplace Transforms",
    "Learned a ton about Fourier and Laplace transforms\/analysis, with pretty solid application in the labs.",
    "I learned a lot about working with AC signals in circuits.",
    "Learnt how to analyze circuits in frequency domain, and about Fourier and Laplace Transforms.",
    "Expansion on EE200 and EE202, with more in depth analyses of circuits and signals",
    "Good extension of EE200 on circuitry. You learn more about fourier transforms and laplace transforms.",
    "I learned more about circuits.",
    "Circuit analysis for capacitors and inductors (first- and second-order circuits). Laplace and Fourier math."

   "comments": [
    "This course feels as if it could almost be two courses (though the dividing line would be hard to draw). It covers a TON of material and is good in the respect that it really gets the student up to speed with second-year circuit analysis techniques and skills. That being said, I felt that much of the time, because the course covered so much, I lacked a true understanding of the concepts and was just forced to \"accept the equations and do the math\" so that I could complete the assignments. There are still areas where I don't feel very confident because of this lack of depth, and I think that's one area where this course lacks.",
    "Generally quite boring, but Hong tries to make it fun.",
    "Organized, follows book, labs are fun, very low commitment",
    "I would sometimes get lost in lecture very quickly, especially toward the end of the semester for the more difficult concepts, it would definitely help to go through less examples in class but go through them more in-depth",
    "The lab portion was excellent, although very disconnected from the rest of the course. The course spends too much time on Laplace and Fourier series, spending the entire second half of the semester.",
    "This class is challenging but essential to electrical engineering. Labs are time consuming and mostly pertinent to class material. Exams are fair and homeworks are helpful. Overall pretty solid.",
    "Great professor, great online resources \/ textbook, but the feedback on the labs was basically non-existent.",
    "The weakness of this course is that all the labs are fairly boring until the last two or three labs. They were basically \"hey, I got a Bode plot,\" until the last two labs. The strength of this course is that the professor is highly knowledgeable and we have a good textbook for the course.",
    "Very well taught and the material is very interesting. Learn how mathematical concepts like Fourier and Laplace transform can be used to analyse circuits.",
    "Professor Hong was great, but I felt that we went over a wide range of topics while failing to go truly in depth enough to understand a lot of the topics",
    "Needs to be refreshed. Our labs literally had 2014 as the date. We did get new tools though for the lab, which is great.",
    "I think this was a great course. The labs were relevant, the HW was not too hard, and the exams were pretty easy - all these contributed to actual learning without the usual useless Yale engineering grind.",
    "The course knows what it is doing and wastes no time. It doesn't cover too much material, which is nice, and also covers enough material to keep us from getting bored of being on the same topic (a new concept or skill per overarching subject every class, perhaps, but related enough that it was a manageable pace). However for those unfamiliar with differential equations (EECS majors do not have to take the diff eq class and most opt not to) the first part of the class was difficult at times. Additionally I am dissatisfied with the homework: there were too few problems for me to feel comfortable enacting the skills, but the problems we DID have (usually two per class, on occasion four) took an extraordinary amount of time. It wasn't that the lectures poorly taught the skills, but there did seem to be some disconnect somewhere between what we learned and then what we were expected to enact, and the textbook could ask very arbitrary and frequently difficult questions in and of itself irrelevant to the quality of the class material. A final note is that (particularly in the second half of the class) the homeworks sometimes did not match the class - for instance I remember doing convolution problems a month before we studied convolutions in class. This was perhaps due to schedule revision from last year without checking the nature of the problems. Labs were good at being connected to class although I thought they (material-wise) should have stopped around the midway point (when we stopped doing first- and second-order circuits) and the initial labs were repetitive from EENG200."

   "comments": [
    "I would not suggest this course to anyone who doesn't have a serious interest in electrical engineering, mostly because it is quite difficult and fairly abstract (though Prof. Tang does a good job of relating most of the concepts to real-world phenomena). That being said, it's a fast-paced, jam-packed course full of tools and techniques of circuit analysis that will not only leave you with a much greater depth of knowledge about the types of circuits humans have devised, but also how they work and how one goes about analyzing them. This course is definitely geared more towards giving a breadth of knowledge rather than any kind of depth, so I'd recc=ommend saving some free time to go over concepts you don't really understand, as you won't have class time to do so.",
    "If you're an EE major, then you have to take it. It's not the most exciting course (at least for me) but it was very routine.",
    "Pretty fun class, loved the labs, and the homeworks are easy.",
    "If you're EE you have to take it. There were some people who took it for fun, but definitely was something they took Credit\/D because of the content of the coursework",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interesting in learning more about circuits. The lectures were interesting, and professor Tang was able to cover material efficiently and thoroughly.",
    "I recommend this course with reservation. I took this course C\/D\/F to learn some basics of electrical engineering as a physics major. I found that I got a much better understanding of electrical circuits, especially under frequency response, as well as a good introductory lab that reviewed filters, Operational Amplifiers, and other essential components. However, the course itself spent a lot of time reviewing the mathematics of Laplacian and Fourier series, which was not very useful, especially in the second half of the course.",
    "I recommend it if you like circuits! It gives you a lot more tools to work with them.",
    "Yes. Material is very interesting and Professor Tang is a great teacher.",
    "Yes, labs are chill, psets are doable, tests are reasonable.",
    "Take it if you have to (as with most of the EE intro classes). This is not a very inspiring class by any stretch of the imagination, but it's the first class that gives you some experience soldering.",
    "Tough class, but Prof Tang is a good lecturer.",
    "Great course about circuits. Pretty low key. Labs are cool, HW is light, exams are easy.",
    "Hong Tang is a good professor with on-board handwriting that ranks among the clearest. Do not be afraid to email him! He is very responsive by that method, particularly regarding syllabus or schedule issues. You will learn first- and second-order circuits (best done immediately following EENG200 rather than forgetting it) and you will do Laplace and Fourier math (Fourier math may be repetitive from EENG202 but expands on the concept)."
