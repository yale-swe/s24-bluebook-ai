    "Definitely! It is an awesome, smoothly run course, with good labs!",
    "Second semester orgo lab is a very good course. Unlike first semester, where you are learning techniques, in this class you get to do syntheses for the entire semester. This is much more interesting and also means that you get out of lab a lot earlier! (I often left by 3:30.) There is only one full lab report and plenty of time to do it, so don't stress about this class. It's pretty enjoyable and you get to do some of the cool reactions you talk about in class (if you're in freshman orgo). Also, Dr. DiMeglio is wonderful and very organized.",
    "This is an excellent lab and very enjoyable.",
    "it is fun to see the reactions that you talk about in theory in class happening right in front of you.",
    "It's a lot of synthesis labs and I would recommend it for people who needed to take an organic chemistry lab.",
    "A great class.",
    "A very chill class that you're probably only going to take if you have to. Easy lab reports. Similar to the first semester of orgo lab. Really nothing to be afraid of.",
    "Probably a required lab but very enjoyable; you listen to music while performing pretty short experiments and you learn many important techniques. Dr. DiMeglio and my TA (Kelly) were both wonderful.",
    "You're probably taking it as a pre-req, but it's a good class. I really enjoyed it!",
    "Take it for the lab credit if you're premed.",
    "Chem 223L is the second half of orgo lab. It was pretty much a continuation of the first semester but with a lot more synthesis as opposed to technique labs. Professor DiMeglio is a gem and most of the TAs seem pretty competent in their ability to run section. Grading varies from section to section but I think grades are normalized across the course so don't worry if your TA grades \"harder\" than another. The labs vary in time from 204 hours and can start to wear on you, but as far as science labs go 223 is definitely one of the better ones. Take it if you want to or (more likely) if you have to.",
    "I mean I think you're only taking this if you have to so...",
    "I think this is an excellent lab to accompany the lecture.",
    "A great way to connect chemistry from lecture into lab. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It's a time commitment, but not super boring.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It takes up an annoying amount of time which should only be necessary as a requirement.",
    "A continuation of Chem 22L, but with a stronger emphasis on reactions rather than learning the skills. It was actually an enjoyable lab and I truly felt competent in an organic chemistry lab by the end of the semester.",
    "Chem 223L is your second semester orgo lab. If you're premed or need orgo for your major, you're going to take it, and it won't be as bad as other chemistry labs.",
    "CHEM 223L is not a hard course, but you'll definitely have more workload compared to CHEM 222L. It is important to keep track of all the instructions about the assignments. You should ask the professor or the TA questions if you don't understand the postlab questions or the exam prep questions. The course packet does not always give you the answer.",
    "CHEM 223L is a good course overall, and I liked it better than CHEM 222L. I took it concurrently with CHEM 125 (Freshman Organic Chemistry II), so the experiments closely coincided with what we did in lecture. The experiments were probably less related to the material in CHEM 230. The experiments in CHEM 223L are more named reactions, with less emphasis on exploring different techniques; in general, there was a greater emphasis on reaction yields. There are post-lab assignments for every lab, but only one full report, and since you pretty much learn how to do all of the parts in the first semester, putting it all together is easy. I do not think I spent any more time on work for this course than I did the first semester, even if there was more of it. Professor DiMeglio is great, but your experience pretty much depends on your TA. I had a great one, and most of them are pretty good. Overall, this course is pretty good, and even if it is required for a lot of things, it is not too burdensome.",
    "It's the chillest lab you'll take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not that much work and it's interesting.",
    "A necessary course in the chemistry curriculum, you'll find yourself performing experiments that mainly consist of synthesizing, collecting and analyzing. Pretty good in terms of learning general laboratory techniques, but unfortunately a bit tedious towards the end. All in all, a good course.",
    "Its a good lab course. Much better than the other chem labs from what I hear. If you want a chem lab credit for premed, do this one. If you like chem, do this one too.",
    "Basically the same as the previous lab, but a bit more focused on new mechanisms rather than techniques. Not much work at all.",
    "As far as Orgo labs go it's really not that bad, you even learn a few reactions not explicitly covered in CHEM 230.",
    "A continuation of the first semester of orgo lab, focused on synthesis rather than technique labs. You get to work with a partner for a lot of the labs, which is nice, and class generally finishes early. One of my favorite labs at Yale.",
    "Basic orgo 2 lab. Well thought out, interesting experiments, not too much work (for a lab)--definitely better than gen chem lab!",
    "You're only taking it because either your major requires it or you're pre-med.",
    "I would recommend Chem 223L to another student, for the reactions are cool, you get to see them happen in real life, and it's mostly DIY, following the steps given from the course packet.",
    "If you have to do it, you have to do it. And you'll learn a lot! Approaching lab with a positive attitude will make it much more pleasant.",
    "Better than Chem 222L. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's a natural continuation of CHEM 222L. It is by far the best organized lab I have taken at Yale.",
    "CHEM 223L is actually pretty chill. It is a lot shorter than the previous orgo labs, since you already know the basic skills and its mostly just applications. You might even enjoy it!",
    "CHEM 223L is better than CHEM 222L. Second time around, things go more smoothly and lab time overall seemed to be less than 222L",
    "Chem 223L is a well-organized organic chemistry lab course. Professor DeMeglio makes the course very enjoyable.",
    "It's fine. I hate lab and I survived. Easier than the first semester.",
    "I would only recommend it if they need it for a requirement.",
    "Absolutely. CHEM 223L is such a great lab to take at Yale. It's low-stress and you learn a decent amount of organic chemistry outside that which you might learn in CHEM 230, which is very helpful for future applications of organic chemistry.",
    "Necessary for premed kids. Awesome, non-stressful lab.",
    "If you need to take it, you'll take it, and it'll be fine. I'm not sure why anyone would take it just for fun. But definitely a lot better than 222L.",
    "You might have to take it, but it's not a bad class at all.",
    "Basically like the first term. Typical lab stuff - EPs, 1 full lab report, a couple of Post Lab Assignments, a multiple choice final, and of course, weekly labs. Don't sweat it, premeds!",
    "Pretty good lab, not too hard as long as you come prepared.",
    "My guess is that if you're taking this class, you probably have to. You will be pleasantly surprised that this is actually an enjoyable class (waaaay better than gen chem lab).",
    "A great lab that is fun and not a huge amount of work.",
    "As far as labs go, this one isn't bad at all. You're probably taking it because you have to, but don't worry -- this is not a pre-req to dread. It's very similar to the first semester of orgo lab, and I thought the workload was pretty manageable... there was only one full lab write-up. As with the first semester of orgo lab, the grading was very picky, and there definitely were times when I was very surprised by the kinds of things they took points off for. But if you put in the effort, check your lab reports carefully (follow the instructions to the letter, and make sure to consult the scientific writing handout that DiMeglio posts), and study for the lab final (it's not horrible, but it's no joke either), you should do just fine.",
    "Never.",
    "You are probably taking it due to pre-med reqs, but it really isnt bad at all. Labs are usually done in 2 or 2 1\/2 hours so it isnt even that great of a time commitment.",
    "Chem 223L is much like a continuation of Chem 222L, with EPs and PLs. The experiments we did were fun and interesting.",
    "Definitely take this lab course! The experiments are actually really fun and the lab reports are due at reasonable times. I enjoyed being in this lab course and am glad the orgo lab sequence was really not that bad!",
    "Similar to CHEM 222L, but a bit easier. You'll be able to get out of lab by 4PM at the latest. You learn a few lab techniques, but none of the labs are too difficult to understand. The workload is similar to CHEM 222L- weekly Experimental Plans, five postlab assignments, one full lab report, and a final exam.",
    "Generally the same as CHEM 222L. In some ways easier since at this point you have already learned all the techniques of orgo lab and are just applying them over and over to different reactions. Not going to be a huge time commitment as lab reports and writeups are reasonable. Not graded on reaction yields which is super great. Yes, take it if you have to otherwise take a cooler lab.",
    "Wonderful instructive course: you learn lots about how compounds are synthesized, purified, and analyzed This course even made me a better cook ;D",
    "Orgo Lab II is neat in that you find that you are a proficient lab student after a full semester of Orgo Lab I. However, the focus is more on the concepts involved in the reaction mechanisms than in the experiment protocols themselves. Because of this, sometimes the labs do not vary much. Nevertheless, this lab was a good course and paired well with Orgo II.",
    "Chem 223L is amazing. There are more post-labs than last semester, but the lab work itself is so cool and rewarding. You basically zip through all the things that took you forever last time around, and that allows you to apply all the techniques you learned. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, since Professor DiMeglio is awesome and this lab is awesome.",
    "An extremely enjoyable lab! There is never too much stress, however you always leave feeling as if you have accomplished something. Try and study along and along for the lab final so that you don't have to cram for it. The final is a tad tricky, but the lab reports are not too labor intensive.",
    "An excellent lab class. I think this is the chillest pre-med lab out of all of them. Since we've already learned most of the techniques in first semester lab, in the second semester we have a lot of fun doing synthesis labs (the best type) most of the time. I also found the lab exam at the end to be easier. Would most definitely recommend to another student, pre-med or otherwise.",
    "A well-taught, interesting lab that reflects the lecture course well.",
    "A lot like 222L -- very chill and nothing to worry about, ever.",
    "I would recommend this course. Dr. DiMeglio has a great enthusiasm about organic chemistry that makes this lab enjoyable.",
    "Great and fun lab course! I definitely wouldn't hesitate to take it if you need it for pre-med\/your major--I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Definitely take it if you're taking lecture, it is a nice counterpart to what can be a difficult and discouraging class and shows you a much better side of organic chemistry",
    "CHEM 223L is a pretty easy lab. You get out at around 3:00pm every day which means that the protocols don't take as long as you might think. It is kind of repetitive though. If you have to take ORGO II, don't sweat about this lab. It definitely won't take too much of your time.",
    "If you have to take it, it's definitely a class that isn't a pain in the butt to take. The labs are fun (especially if you have good partners), and you synthesize a lot of cool compounds.",
    "Your typical lab class. Just do your work properly - don't get lazy with the pre-labs. They could help with your final grade overall.",
    "You're probably taking this since you have to, and it will be ok! Even if you're in Fri lab, which is kinda nice !",
    "I think it's slightly easier than 222 because you now know all of the stuff\/procedures that you use, and most of it is just reflux, so the procedures are not as hard. It is tedious though, sometimes to have to do things over and over again like TLC. If you have to take this class, don't be afraid of taking it. I found this class a better experience than 222 and the TAs are pretty nice. The final is not hard, although the post-lab assignments take a while.",
    "CHEM 223L is a good lab course. You learn a lot in a non-stressful environment. The professor and TAs are great and all very helpful. You do have to put in a lot of work but it is all worth it, very rewarding. I would definitely recommend CHEM 223L to another student, it is the best lab course I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Take it, you probably have to anyway",
    "Orgo lab is a very enjoyable lab. It's easy, useful, and you feel very accomplished when you synthesize actual compounds. I definitely recommend it.",
    "It was a good lab. You often get out early. Lab-reports are never really challenging. You just need to stay on top of your experimental plans, short procedural reports before the lab, and you're golden.",
    "Orgo Lab II is probably the best lab course offered at Yale. Take it!",
    "YES! For Premeds, you have to take it, but even if you're not, it's still a fantastic course!",
    "A must-take if you're taking orgo class as well. Very well-organized lab, and it'll probably be the best one you take at Yale.",
    "Great lab course--definitely take it! You learn a lot, and the labs are not designed to be stressful at all.",
    "CHEM 223L is required, but honestly, not a bad continuation of 222L. You acquire greater familiarity with the techniques and definitely come away with a better understanding of chemical mechanisms and reactions.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but if you can see it as a learning experience and opportunity to get closer to students you probably wouldn't have otherwise met, you will end up getting a lot out of it, possibly the most of any pre-medical requirement to date.",
    "Awesome lab.",
    "It's orgo lab, you're premed, you have to take it.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise there isn't anything really interesting about this lab.",
    "Good continuation of the first semester of orgo lab, and it's nice that the experiments really build upon the same techniques and procedures, so you can feel pretty confident in your abilities. There's only a few full lab reports, and just keep up with the end of lab questions in order to help prepare for the final exam.",
    "Really great lab course that if you are taking, you probably need to take but it is one of the best.",
    "Definitely take this lab, it is a good build on to 222L and compliments orgo II well. It's not anymore rigorous than 222L - on the contrary, because you've already gotten the techniques down, it's less stressful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially for those who are also taking CHEM 230.",
    "CHEM 223L was very similar to CHEM 222L. Pretty straightforward and relaxed. Take it!",
    "Orgo 2 lab is just as great as and perhaps even better than first semester orgo lab. The basics are pretty much all the same: EPs, a couple postlabs, and relatively easy experiments. The reactions are for the most part pretty interesting and actually teach you useful mechanisms.",
    "A typical lab course. Unlike some lab courses at Yale, there's not a pointless busywork; the work that is assigned is definitely doable, not extremely challenging, and does a nice job of preparing you for working in an actual lab.",
    "Relatively painless and well organized. Labs are shorter than in 222 and you always get out way early. Lab reports are quick and easy.",
    "This lab is very chill and doable!",
    "You probably have to take it, but it's pretty similar to CHEM 222L: good teaching, straightforward labs, not too much work. Dr. DiMeglio is great when you have questions or concerns, while I've found both of my TAs in Orgo lab to be excellent at helping and creating a positive lab atmosphere. You don't have to dread lab; it's fun and interesting, and the post-lab assignments are usually fairly relaxed.",
    "Chem 223L may seem scary because it goes with organic chemistry, but it's actually an enjoyable class. I would recommend it to another student, but I would suggest that they not sign up for the Friday afternoon section because it's sometimes a bit of a slog to get through at the end of a long and tiring week.",
    "Great course! Interesting labs that reinforced concepts from lecture and were fun to do.",
    "It's a typical Chem lab course: meet once a week, have to prepare a pre-lab for each experiment and then complete post-lab reports as assigned. Generally, I wouldn't say that the work is super interesting, but it's not unpleasant either. On the whole, this particular course is better than most other Chem labs."
