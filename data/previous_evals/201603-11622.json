   "comments": [
    "My vocabulary, especially when speaking of abstract subjects, greatly expanded and my understanding of sentence structure and grammar principles deepened. In addition, I learned about literature in Russia during the 20th century.",
    "I was able to expand my vocabulary to many political, social and economic concepts, which have allowed me to talk more freely about abstract topics such as the rhetoric used by a particular author, the value of nomadic life vs. settled life, the quandaries behind censorship, etc.",
    "This is a basic language course. I took a higher-level course last year, but, because this was the highest level course in Russian that was offered this semester, I took it. It was mostly stuff I had already learned, but it did help me keep up my Russian, I guess.",
    "I received the best Russian grammar instruction I have received at Yale or anywhere else. My speaking, writing, comprehension, and especially reading improved noticeably.",
    "useful language skills and proper use of vocabularies",
    "Well I suppose I learned some Russian... The grammar tasks are super useful and I personally think correct grammar is the most important thing in any language. Sometimes the vocab was a little overwhelming, but only when the readings had a lot of it and maybe overlapped with a busy time with other classes, but all in all it was a really good mesh of the vocab and grammar together.",
    "I learned advanced grammar constructions, increased my vocabulary, and learned more about Russian literary history and canon formation.",
    "My spoken, and especially my written Russian, improved considerably."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Because this course is the highest language course available, there are many different levels of speaking and understanding among the students, as well as differences in background knowledge of Russian history and culture. This can sometimes make discussion challenging, although I don't think there is really any way to fix that. It was also a fairly large class for language-based discussion.",
    "Half the class was focused on one text and in-class discussions helped little. Had there been readings of a wide variety in time periods, the content of the class would've been more engaging.",
    "I think the main problem with the class was unfortunately something that Professor Dolgova herself could not have solved: we simply had way too many people in the class, as well as too many different levels. The main issue though was definitely the sheer number of people, because I think that if we had had half that number of people, it would have been easier for people with lower levels to catch up with the rest. But in effect, with 20 people in the class, each person had barely any chance to speak up and practice their oral skills (if you had five minutes of speaking per class, you were very lucky). I thought the syllabus was very interesting and brought many different topics together. The only thing that I would have changed is the structure of the \"textbook.\" They were essentially leaflets and hand-outs that were delivered piece-meal, and the content was very often times confusing to follow with the schedule. Therefore, a large part of my semester was focused on trying to figure out what was due on what day, and what would be required in this exam, etc. More structure in the \"textbook\" and schedules would have been appreciated. Also, one last thing that I felt noteworthy was the sheer amount of work we had to put in. I was honestly surprised by the fact that this was no longer a 1.5 credit course, because even though we no longer meet every single morning as before, we had enormous amounts of homework during the week that required a lot of time to finish, if one wanted to do it properly and learn from it. The amount of work was quite honestly comparable to the work that we had to do last summer in Saint Petersburg - except that we were studying *only* Russian at that time, and there were no other classes, on-campus jobs, extracurriculars that complicated things. So I would highly recommend either changing the course credits to 1.5, or *slightly* lowering the amount of work. That would also honestly allow students to focus more on each new thing they learn.",
    "I don't really know how valuable my feedback is, as this course was not really at my level. I personally wished I had more opportunities to speak extensively in a more formal setting. The class should be kept smaller than it was. Irina is an amazing professor, though. Shame that so many were disrespectful in class.",
    "For an L5 class, there were too many students in the section. Ironically, it was very difficult to practice speaking and have fruitful discussions. Even with a whole semester, not everyone felt comfortable speaking in front of the group. It stymied progress, which is super important for Russian language learners.",
    "The course is excellent overall. The class size, however, is too large.",
    "I overall thought it was really well organized. The only thing I can think of here is that some of the readings were short and some were long, and while we could always count on having some reading work to do, it was sometimes frustrating when I planned on x amount of time to finish the work, and it turned out to be a much longer piece.",
    "I generally think the class was very well-taught--we all received a lot of feedback and Professor Dolgova made sure to go over areas where people had difficulty. The only weakness was the large amount of students in the class, but that wasn't Professor Dolgova's fault.",
    "The extended written assignments for each homework, along with extensive individualized feedback, allowed me to very quickly improve my written Russian."

    "If you really enjoy Russian and want to improve your language skills while learning about some Soviet history and literature, take this course. You pretty much get what you put into this course - it can require a lot of personal motivation. It is discussion based, so be ready to talk about readings (excerpts from Russian novels) and about any knowledge you have of Russia. It is an interesting mix of people so you get to hear lots of different perspectives.",
    "This is a basic Russian class. It's not as interesting as upper-level offerings, but the curriculum is solid and Irina is an amazing professor.",
    "Yes. The caliber of instruction is excellent. The class is also effectively geared toward different levels of Russian ability.",
    "Absolutely! If anyone is between taking this course or going straight into another Russian course (ie. skipping year 4) I would definitely say take this. The high level and nuance grammar and vocab was extremely useful and I can't imagine going into another advanced Russian class without it.",
    "Yes, if you want to continue with Russian absolutely take it! Professor Dolgova is wonderful.",
    "As usual, Yale's Russian department is excellent. Strongly recommend."
