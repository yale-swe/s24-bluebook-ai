   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in field methods, definitely take this course. The readings can be a bit dull, but you really don't have to suffer over them, scan them and you will be fine. The professor goes over everything you need to know to complete the assignments and with a great TA, you don't have to do the readings at all. Don't waste the money on the books.",
    "I would not really recommend this class. The professor was not really very enthused about being there and class was cancelled a lot which seemed nice at the time but make-up classes are not so nice.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student because it is both practical and interesting. The methods learned in this course apply to other fields in addition to anthropology (observation, event analysis, interviewing, and surveying). The workload is manageable, especially for a writing credit, and the freedom with the assignment topics is great.",
    "ANTH 303 focuses on anthropological methods that can be used across disciplines to capture detailed qualitative data. The class requires that students learn about the techniques and then actually try them out. There is a lot of autonomy and freedom to pursue your individual interest, and this a great way to learn about these research methods. It's fun and gratifying to get to try what you learn and then discuss it in detail in the class.",
    "ANTH 303 was not all that I had hoped it to be. While Prof. Clarke is clearly an amazing anthropologist, the course was poorly run. The syllabus was altered at least four times throughout the semester, such that deadlines were changed and even the most conscientious students rarely knew when papers were actually due. Little guidance was given as to how to write the paper assignments. The T.A. was the most helpful throughout the course. If the course became more organized, I would recommend the class, as the field assignments were quite interesting.",
    "This is a great overview of various research methods. In particular, I found the technique assignments to be extremely beneficial and educational when it came to learning about these research methods. However, I felt that there was hardly enough in-class discussion-- despite the fact that this is a seminar, classes are conducted very much like a lecture. Additionally, I was troubled by how vaguely assignments are described in the syllabus and by Professor Clarke-- basic yet important things, such as how long the assignments should be, what they should look like, and how they are being graded, were left unsaid, and this made completing the assignments very confusing."
