   "comments": [
    "If you are okay with having two assignments due every week and lots of small deadlines, take it. If that is not conducive to your lifestyle, best to skip it.",
    "Recommend. Very pleasant experience. The final project (composition) was very meaningful. I learned a lot from this course.",
    "It's a great course for someone who has done music-related things before but wants to learn the theory behind composition\/analysis.",
    "Whether a student should take this class depends on their previous musical background and the amount of time they have to spend on the class. I came in having experience reading and playing music, which is a huge leg up on students who have to learn notes and rhythms from scratch. For those students, the course is an intensive introduction to music theory, going from reading notes to harmonic and thematic analysis in one semester, and if they can put the time in, I highly recommend it. For students with a similar background as myself, a class like 205 or 210 is probably more appropriate (even if you placed into MUSIC 110 on the placement test). A couple hours researching figured bass notation, roman numeral analysis, and basic thematic structures is probably enough to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, and you won't have to slog through notes, rhythms, and major\/minor scales with students who are seeing these things for the first time. But otherwise, you'll get a GPA boost and get to chill for the first half of the semester. Your call.",
    "This is a class that goes over music theory basics such as rhythm, notes, time signatures, key signatures, major and all minor scales, intervals, triads (open, closed, diminished, augmented, inversions, seventh-chords), and cadences. We also do aural awareness and analyze musical pieces by looking at overall thematic structures in songs and progression of cadences within a song. You also have a chance to create your own melodies and song as your final assessment. This class is great because you really learn a lot more about music basics and listening to music. However, this class is fast-paced, and some students already have a lot of experience with music and should actually be in a higher music theory class (E.g. in YSO\/Concert Band\/ Dpops etc.). There is also a substantial amount of work that needs to be completed each class."
