   "comments": [
    "Great history seminar especially if you need a writing credit (lots of support and workshopping). Some readings are heavy but overall enjoyable. Great professor and engaging discussions.",
    "Great way to gain research experience and do original research. Prof. Sabin is really knowledgable and knows how to choose great readings",
    "Definitely. I would say that I recommend this class to anyone interested in energy, but honestly, the discussions and topics about energy covered in this class affect us all, and anyone could benefit from these lessons.",
    "Yes! Especially as a junior because the set up is a lot like a short version of the thesis plus Sabin is awesome",
    "A great course on the importance of energy and it's sources in American history, effectively the title of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in energy, history, politics, culture, or economics. Though course covers a range of topics, and it is possible to take any angle when approaching the history. It is definitely reading and writing intensive, so be prepared for that.",
    "EVST 443 is a great course and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in energy, environmental studies, or history. The reading is heavy and important to class discussion so only take this course if you can commit to doing most if not all the reading. In addition there is an approx. 25 page term paper for this class which is very time consuming. There is a lot of work in this class but if you invest the time you will learn a lot and it will be a well worth it.",
    "Great course on how the United States has used and developed energy through history. You learn about the foundational types of energy, like man and animal power, to nuclear power. Awesome take on different perspectives, great class if you enjoy history",
    "Definitely take this if you can. Professor Sabin is incredibly knowledgeable, accessible, and well-prepared. The feedback was always helpful, and the grading was always fair."
