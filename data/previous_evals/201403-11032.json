    "I would recommend the class, because it covers all the basic and main topics in Historical Linguistics, although it also makes focus on some subfields that are not always included in these kinds of courses (such as semantic change). I think it prepares you very well for following courses in the area.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
    "A strong and holistic introduction to historical methods in linguistics.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, it is excellent for anyone interested in Historical Linguistics, but also excellent for any student of ancient languages. it is important to understand language families, relationships, and genealogy."

   "comments": [
    "The class allowed me to strengthen skills and concepts that will feature in my research and possibly my dissertation. My background in diachronic studies was somewhat limited to sociolinguistic variables, so the more theoretical and analytic focus of tis course was extremely helpul for me.",
    "The final components of the course (esp. syntactic and semantic change) and some of the readings, both generally and for sections opened new areas and avenues for potential research and will certainly inform my understanding of the discipline and influence future work."
