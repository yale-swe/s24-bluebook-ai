    "French 946 is a very good course for people who want to be introduce to postcolonial theory. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "Postcolonial Theory is essential for anyone interested in the 20th century and\/or Francophone literature. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and takes it in some interesting directions. It felt very relevant for the most part.",
    "For summary, see question one. I would recommend FREN 941 to anyone with an interest in: literary theory, French and Francophone literature, history and literature, literature and politics, psychoanalysis and literature, Caribbean studies",
    "Yes; a deep and comprehensive introduction to postcolonial theory. Well-paced. Sane workload. Focused on developing useful professional skills (writing reviews, giving talks). Having a background in continental philosophy of the last forty or fifty years is pretty necessary, however."

   "comments": [
    "Writing the final paper was indeed a useful exercise for me going forward.",
    "As I am considering doing my PhD thesis on Francophone literature, this course was of a great help. It introduces me to postcolonial theory, which was an unknown subject before.",
    "My discipline is French literature. Not having any background whatsoever in postcolonial theory, and very little in Francophone literatures this course helped me fill an important lacuna. I would hope that everyone in a PhD program in French would have some background in postcolonial theory before completing a dissertation. In that sense, this course is essential, in my opinion.",
    "The breadth of the course means it provides a helpful grounding in the field.",
    "I really needed someone to explain Spivak to me; for this, I am grateful."
