   "comments": [
    "The Chinese Tradition is a fantastic class. I left it with a general grasp of the literary, philosophical, and historical themes running through the past thousands of years in China. This tradition of thought is very useful in understanding modern China.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, you get a \"greatest hits\" overview of major works of the Chinese civilisation. It's good for those who have never ventured to think outside the Western model of civilisation. Especially enjoyed the earlier works on philosophy and the idea of the life force. Professors are really great and really helpful, though section could have been run much better. 3 x 4pg papers, 1 midterm and a final. Paper grades aren't the most lenient, but midterm grades are fair.",
    "Great course, highly recommend. You get guided through some of the world's most influential literature by excellent professors; I feel like I engage wth history and even modern China in a whole new way now.",
    "One of the greatest classes I've taken at Yale so far. I knew nothing about Chinese history, literature or philosophy going in, and I feel like I have a good understanding of it now. TAKE IT!",
    "The Chinese Tradition is a class that gives a broad overview of Chinese history, from ~2000-1500 BCE to the events leading up to the early 1900s CE. If you are at all interested in beginning to understand the several thousand years' worth of cultural history that has formed the foundation of modern Chinese sociocultural beliefs, then this is a must-take class. You'll learn about how the 'Chinese' identity, both of the people and of the state, has changed over these many many centuries. Of course, since there's so much stuff--sometimes the content of one class could easily be a PhD dissertation, or an entire seminar on its own--you probably won't be as satisfied in terms of depth. But it's a really great introduction and foundation, from which you can then begin exploring further a topic\/dynasty\/philosophy\/religion\/person on your own.",
    "Yes - an excellent review of Chinese literature and history for those without much background.",
    "A survey course of key literary texts and trends in the Chinese dynastic history from the Shang up until the fall of the Qing, with emphasis on close reading. Some discussion of very general historical trends. Focus on evaluating the continuity and discontinuity within the so-called \"Chinese Tradition.\""
