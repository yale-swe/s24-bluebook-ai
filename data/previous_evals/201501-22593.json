   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class, and I took it as a fifth Cr\/D. You go to lecture and hear about interesting cases. If you're thinking about law at all, this class is a great way to try it out. And it gives you practice with issue spotters, which is never a bad thing.",
    "I would take the class 1) Credit\/D\/Fail or 2) If you have a background in law (have taken legal history classes, did mock trial etc). Otherwise, the pace of the class and some of the legal jargon could be overwhelming.",
    "If you like America or care about America (which I'm aware, doesn't apply to everyone), take this class (also you should probably have some interest in reading the occasionally pedantic, antiquated, but sometimes entertaining opinions of nine overly educated folks). The course includes (often, by the end of the semester) inordinately massive amount of reading a week, that you really should do if you want to get the most out of the class - but if you find even an iota of joy in reading such things, it'll be completely worth it in the end.",
    "I am an international student and went in with almost zero knowledge of US history so it was a struggle for me initially. Yet, I also learnt so much out of this class even if I could only attend the lectures and wasn't able to do 90% of the readings. I recommend taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail unless you are absolutely sure you want to put in the immense amount of effort required to gain the most out of the class. If you do however, I can see that it will be an extremely fulfilling class at Yale.",
    "Con Law is an interesting class with great material. You learn about many of the cases that changed history and that are still affecting current events and debates. There is unfortunately a lot of reading though so be prepared to spend time on it. My recommendations to a prospective student are that you MUST take the section as it allows you to understand lecture better, take other classes with this class that aren't as reading heavy, and take it in a year besides freshman year.",
    "This is an important course for any Yale student to take, and I highly recommend it. Professor Amar is a character and his style is not for everyone, although he is a very engaging lecturer. The work is not too hard at all, but at the end of it, you feel like you've covered a lot; it's certainly a rewarding course to take.",
    "Take it if you can! Really amazing class if you like American history, law, or the Constitution. Professor Amar definitely has his opinions, but he's also a great lecturer and a bona-fide expert on the Constitution.",
    "Lots of reading but most of it can be skimmeD",
    "Great overview of con law. A class yale course. Take it!",
    "Excellent political science course (wish it were cross listed History because we learn a lot of history too!). Greatest strength is that it introduces students to ways of thinking about the law and its implications - instead of learning cases, we think about the philosophy of how the law should work. Your grade will reflect he amount of effort you put into the class",
    "From the perspective of a senior who just wanted to take this class credit\/d and just enjoy it as a fifth class, I would recommend it. Just midterm, 5 page paper, and a final. Oh and the exam's can be take home so that's a plus.",
    "Take it if you've ever wanted to learn more about law and the constitution. Super easy class to take credit\/D, but really it's not bad if you take it for a grade. Lectures are unstructured, but that's Amar's way. Section was fantastic--I had Sundeep, though I've heard all of the sections are good. Definitely take one because I learned so much more in section than lecture. Lots of readings--you probably won't finish them all, but that's okay",
    "Yes. You will learn so much and become a generally more informed citizen. If you do take it, go to section. It will help you keep up and get your thoughts organized as you wade through a pretty hefty amount of material.",
    "Con Law covers really interesting material and the readings, while hard to get into, are often worth the payoff. Professor Amar is an engaging lecturer with a lot of original arguments about the Constitution (most of them are really insightful, but take them with a grain of salt!). The first half of the semester is the better half -- you have a smaller number of cases and you spend lectures going over the constitutional reasoning in depth. In the second half of the semester, the amount of reading explodes. This itself wasn't a problem; the problem is that lectures became less substantive as material became more complicated. In the second half of the semester Amar's lectures were often repetitive and tangential, and discussion of the actual cases was extremely rushed, which wasn't super helpful for the final. Finally, the culture of the class is very much one of entitled white boys trying to get name recognition with Amar to get into law school; not only does this lead to a lot of BS participation in lecture, but it's an unwelcoming environment for other people. Amar, if he doesn't actively encourage this kind of culture, certainly does nothing to stop it.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's as much work as you want to make it (it's a great Cr\/D class as well). I started it Cr\/D and ended up switching it to a grade- my only regret is that I didn't pay enough attention in lecture at the beginning of the semester while I wasn't taking it for a grade. I would DEFINITELY recommend doing a section, it was the best part of the class for me.",
    "This is a Yale staple course. Your education is incomplete without it, especially for history majors like myself. I learned more than I ever thought I would need to know, but am better off for it. Take this course.",
    "I took this class for a grade and did a good number of the course readings, and i feel like i learned an absolute ton - both information and a new way to think logically and creatively. In that way, I got so much more out of it than a normal Yale lecture. strongly advise if you're into legal and social issues.",
    "I was so excited for this course - I had been waiting to take it for two years and this was finally the semester it worked in my schedule. It was very good. Great history and a new interesting way to think. It did not live up to the expectations. The first lecture is definitely the best, and it all is a little disappointing next to that. Also a ton of reading if you actually want to do it all.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS ONCE AT YALE. I promise you'll be able to handle the work. Just read the casebook. Amar does tend to ramble and lose track of time, but he's also brilliant and really cares about his undergrads. Take Travis's section. Don't listen to the haters.",
    "Con law definitely lives up to expectation. Take it to learn how to make arguements!",
    "Honestly, I would not take it. There must be other ways to learn about con law without spending so much time sitting in a jumbled lecture.",
    "A breakneck tour through American law, government, politics, and jurisprudence from the Revolutionary War to 2015. A good amount of background knowledge (think AP US history, and a decent understanding of contemporary US politics and current events) helps greatly. If you are willing to do the reading (or at least a substantial portion of it, i.e. 75% or more) this class has the potential to be one of the most rewarding, challenging, and thought-provoking at Yale. Strongly discourage taking this course Credit-D: the result will be doing none of the reading and getting only the thinnest surface-gloss understanding of the issues discussed. If you're willing to put in work and dig in, Prof. Amar's legal genius and the eager TFs will make this course amazing!",
    "It was a good overview of law and a chance for people to see if law school would be right for them",
    "Yes! Great course that helps you learn how to think like a lawyer.",
    "Highly recommended. Lectures are awesome, and section is more than worthwhile. There is not a lot of work to hand in, but there is an immense amount of reading. Everybody should experience Amar's lectures, so if the reading list looks too intimidating, definitely go for Credit\/D instead of forgoing the class altogether. It's actually a perfect class to take Credit\/D. Grades are based on a midterm, final, and (almost insignificant) short paper, and the two tests have a take-home option.",
    "A lot of reading, but worth it if you're interested at all in law or government",
    "Professor Amar is exciting, and his subject is at times electrifying, and certainly important for citizens of the United States (and international students!) to understand. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this to another student! I think this was a great class to take that helped me appreciate the law and the judicial system a lot more. You get SO much more out of the class when you do the readings, so I would do the readings.",
    "A dive into the history and politics of the American Constitution (including the Amendmentsespecially the 14th) and its interpretation throughout the past 200 years. It has a significant amount of casebook reading, but I always found it quite enjoyable. You will start with the basics of the Constitutionexamining how each of the branches have been treated in Supreme Court cases. It is heavy on casesthough Amar stresses the importance of both executive and legislative interpretations of the Constitution, too. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in the Constitution, law, American history, or how our government works. Professor Amar always gives interesting lectures, the reading is fascinating, and there are some great guest lecturers.",
    "One takes out of Constitutional Law what one puts into it. If one takes the time to do all the readings and pay close attention in each lecture, one will come away from the course with an understanding of the basics of constitutional law, an invaluable skill considering the mainstream media's (both the left and right wing) lack of tact in discussing constitutional decision-making. The course can get somewhat hectic towards the very end, as the syllabus is a bit more ambitious than time permits. But, should one optimize one's note-taking strategies and studying habits, the course could be one of the most rewarding experiences one has at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to a study of any course of study, as it will help them understand not just American politics and the Constitution but help develop a mindset of problem solving that is immensely valuable.",
    "This is a great class to take to learn about con law. You go over cases and learn how and why certain decisions were reached.",
    "You should take this course. It is difficult, there is an incredible amount of reading, and you will have to dedicate significant amounts of time to it, but it is a must-take at Yale for anyone, and everyone should have a foundational understanding of the Constitution."
