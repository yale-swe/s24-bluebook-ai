   "comments": [
    "This is the most difficult class I have taken at Yale. Problem sets take 10-15 hours per week, and the material is incredibly challenging. No one takes it who doesnt have to for their major and I seriously recommend trying to make sure you do not have any other really challenging classes at the same time. Some overlap with pchem so it is easier if you have either already taken pchem or are taking it at the same time.",
    "There's a lot of Matlab used in this class, so if another thermo is being offered and if you are not into coding, then maybe take that one. this is not a fun class. this is not a fun topic. no one will disagree with me. but you have to take it. that is why you are reading this evaluation. i'm sorry. good luck.",
    "A very unique course in that it was simultaneously one of the most challenging courses I have taken at Yale and one of my favorites. Professor Osuji is brilliant and awesome and understanding and even took time out of class to talk about campus racial tensions. Definitely your biggest workload of the semester.",
    "CENG 300 is a derivation intensive intro to thermodynamics course. It takes all preconceived notions of ideality and replaces them with real situation alternatives. I would recommend this course to a fellow student. I would recommend it because its subject matter is interesting and it is set up very well structurally.",
    "Ok, I mean, this is gonna be a hard class. You know that. You know what you're in for. I did find it interesting and rewarding, but I'm sure I missed out on many of the rewards because it was just so darn hard. I would sometimes pull 2+ all-nighters\/week finishing problem sets (definitely partly my own fault, but no one I knew in the class had finished before 3 or 4 am the night before they were due). It would have helped if I knew more programming and matlab, since matlab was expected to complete the problem sets but not really taught in class or in the book. Professor Osuji was wonderful and very helpful and articulate and kind and understanding and I wouldn't have wanted to go through this...erm...Heck with anyone but him.",
    "Very hard. Everything about it - the material, the weekly problem sets and the exams - is very hard. So definitely don't take it unless you have to, but I am guessing that you have to... So read the text book and just know from the start that you are going to have to dedicate a lot of time to this class.",
    "This class is painful. You will spend so much time doing Matlab on the psets and then will be tested on something totally different. You probably have to this class but you'll make it through:)",
    "Professor Osuji is an incredible professor. If you are taking this course, you probably have to. But, if you have the opportunity to take it with Osuji, I would not let it slip by. He is tough but fair. You will work hard, but it will pay off.",
    "The PSETs take and unreasonable amount of time (30+ hours for me with 8 psets in the semester) even when you have the answer key in front of you and the test averages hovered around a 50-60, which, although I think the course is curved, it still is not a fun test to take or study for. You will learn a lot of thermodynamics and problem solving skills though, if you put the work in. I recommend doing some of the conceptual work for each chapter before getting to class or else the derivations and symbols will just wash over you because you have nothing to root it in.",
    "A lot of work and make sure you know MATLAB! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class, even if it seems like your questions are stupid (TRUST ME, a lot of people are equally clueless\/confused!). Find some friends and you will (eventually) get through this class.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to, because it will eat up all your time. However, if you do have to take it, try to enjoy it and get as much as you can out of it. Prof Osuji is fun to learn from and the material really is interesting; you just need to spend a lot of time to understand it enough for it to be interesting. I wish that I had stayed caught up on reading and given myself more time for problem sets, because I feel like I could have learned way more.",
    "CENG 300 was one of the most challenging courses I've ever taken at Yale, but also one of the most rewarding. The problem sets are no joke, and the tests were somewhat harrowing as well, but I never felt like I wasn't able to keep my head above the surface. Chinedum Osuji is an excellent professor and really just a great guy in general. If you're an environmental engineering major trying to decide whether to take mech eng thermo or chem eng thermo, I highly recommend this one.",
    "One of the most difficult classes (if not the most) I have taken, yet a really rewarding experience. Professor Osuji is a great instructor who covers the necessary concepts in a clear and concise manner. The problem sets do contain a bit of MATLAB programming: while I didn't have MATLAB experience prior to taking the class, learning a bit of the basics before starting the class would certainly help to lower the learning curve a bit (and save some time!).",
    "Great class but an insane amount of work if Professor Osuji is teaching it. Very helpful to have taken ENAS 130 and to have a working knowledge of Matlab. If you put the work in I think you will come out with a solid foundation in thermodynamics."
