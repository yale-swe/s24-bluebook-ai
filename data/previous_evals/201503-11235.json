    "Really disorganized but useful for learning about topical matters. If you don't have a lot of experience reading papers but you do have a fair amount of geology background (i.e. you're a fourth-year undergrad or a first-year grad student), then maybe take it. I would say it was alright overall. Certainly chill on expectations but what you put in is what you get out.",
    "Take this course if you are prepared to do some thinking--most of it relies on your participation and willingness to dig into scientific papers.",
    "A good way to meet other LSP students and talk about broad and exciting issues. The discussions themselves are sometimes frustrating, but probably worth it overall."

    "The course improved my skills in paper reading and criticism, and taught me about the variety of ways in which earth scientists approach issues like carbon dioxide.",
    "Really good way to learn about topics that are otherwise outside my direct area of work. It definitely goes a lot way to inform how my somewhat different research could matter to the broader community."
