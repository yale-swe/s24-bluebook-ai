    "This class has taught me a great deal about the Russian and Post-Soviet regions. It was strongly based in argumentation and synthesis of broader information to help understand small aspects of the states. Because the course begins in the Soviet period, it is also possible to ascertain how events across a long time period impact each other.",
    "Understanding of the politics of Soviet and Post-Soviet Eurasia.",
    "so many valuable lessons about political science, history, and russian regional studies!",
    "I developed key insights into Russian history and politics from a comparative politics lens.",
    "This course was an amazing foray into Soviet history as well as modern Russian politics. It synthesized history and political science in a really amazing way, and helped to develop analytical thinking in terms of political science.",
    "A great overview of Russian history from the beginning of the 20th century as well as an insightful explanation of Russian politics today.",
    "Professor Hanson beautifully laid out the historical and political developments in Russia from the 19th century to present, interweaving different political science analysis frameworks to assess various turning points and how these have shaped the post-Soviet region today. One of the most thrilling lectures I have ever taken!",
    "I gained a deep knowledge of both Russian history and the issues currently facing Russias polity and society, both in itself and in its relation to the world. I also gained a great insight into how political science approaches those issues.",
    "I learned a lot about modern Russian politics, as well as ideology and political science theory. I definitely have a fuller view of eastern Europe and most certainly think this subject is worth studying more.",
    "Survey of Russian history from the 1917 revolution up to the present, especially focusing on the way that Leninism and Russia's history has affected the development of its political system and culture."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very interesting and engaging. I sometimes felt that the slides were too dense to remain focused on the lecture as well.",
    "Fascinating course taught by an excellent professor. I loved every minute of it and was very frustrated that I had to miss a few lectures for job interviews\/other commitments.",
    "all strengths. wonderful organization, lectures, and assessment structures.",
    "No real weaknesses, but the class does focus a bit too much on Russia. A bit more on the other Soviet-bloc states would be nice",
    "This course was incredible. I thought everything was amazing and each lecture was fun. The readings were interesting and varied.",
    "I found the lectures and readings to all be very relevant, although sometimes found the small details to be overwhelming.",
    "Each individual lecture was carefully planned to cover an immense amount of material in an easy to follow structure with the most hilarious stories from Professor Hanson's experiences in Russia. The slides could have been a little less dense and the readings trimmed, but otherwise the course was perfect!",
    "This course had great content, and a great assignment structure. Not sure anything could improve it, except maybe if it added a little more focus on post-soviet states other than Russia.",
    "Very interesting material",
    "I thought the course material and lectures were really interesting and engaging; Professor Hanson is a really good lecturer, and class was consistently really interesting and fast-paced. I did find some of the readings to be a little unrelated\/ less interesting (I think changing some of the things that were assigned would benefit the course) but other than that I really liked the class."

   "comments": [
    "If you are at all interested in international relations, or even domestic politics, you should take the class!",
    "Yes! This is an absolutely wonderful course that provides an incisive look at Russian history and politics! Interdisciplinary and thoughtfully structured",
    "100%",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course - essential for learning about Russia today from a political lens.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. I know Professor Hanson is a visiting professor, but something like this should be a class that is always offered at Yale.",
    "Yes, I learned an immense amount about Russia and why Russia is the way it is today and why that matters. The professor is great and makes lectures extremely interesting.",
    "Definitely - great way to get an insight into the history and culture of a part of the world most students don't know much about.",
    "Absolutely!! The most exciting lecture I have ever taken!",
    "Unfortunately, since professor Hanson is visiting, this course presumably wont be offered in the future. Nonetheless, I thought the course was utterly fantastic and would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Yes!! Professor Hanson is an amazing professor - so incredibly knowledgable and passionate. He really has a full understanding of Russia and related area studies, and really believes in the importance of the subject. He provides an honest, middle of the road understanding of Russia and post-Soviet politics.",
    "Yes I would. It's a shame Hanson is going back to William and Mary in the fall",
    "Yes! If you're interested in Russia (especially given all of the recent things that have been happening) this is a great class. It gives you a really solid knowledge of the country today and how it got to be that way, and lectures are really interesting."
