   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in watching a teacher work within his or her subject, then take this class. You will learn the philologist's language. Two hours a day is perfect for taking on the patterns of thought that Prof. Stern makes use of (poetic, grammatical, closely analytical)",
    "A great course on the fundamentals of German grammar. It covers pretty much most of the grammatical topics a serious student of German needs to know (I say \"most of\" because we will finish the grammar text book in during the first month of the spring semester), not only to speak correctly but also to tackle difficult literature. If you are looking for a class that allows you to speak German in class, then this class is not for you. But if you want to be able read Nietzsche in German one day, then look no further. I wouldn't say, though, that the most important thing I learned from the professor, Howard Stern, was German. That I did in my room each night, with the hefty German grammar textbook cracked open in front of me as I completed the everyday exercises. What I got from Herr Stern was more than just German. He completely changed the way how I look at literature, at learning, and at life. While some may find his going off tangent a little distracting, I have gathered so much from hearing his perspective on the world. It is a pity that he may stop teaching this class next year, and therefore I could only be grateful that I took this last chance to get to know such an erudite, insightful, humorous, and infinitely kind human being. Definitely sticking to the L3-L4 sequel next semester.",
    "I would recommend that any student seeking to learn German take this class with this teacher. Accept no substitute!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who wants an exhaustive understanding of German grammar and is wiling to put in a lot of time to make that happen. If you take this class, you will learn German. That is an ultimatum, not an assurance.This is an incredibly fun class, even if you spend most of the time feeling vaguely humiliated at your inability to pronounce things correctly. And if you're planning to use German for scholarly purposes, there is no better way to learn it than with Herr Stern.Also, don't be late! Ever."
