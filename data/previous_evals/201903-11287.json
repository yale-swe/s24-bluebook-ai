   "comments": [
    "I enjoy the PSET-based grading because it allows me to get consistent feedback, and it was useful to collaborate with others to learn the material. Class lectures were a little bit too fast for me, but the book and office hours were useful.",
    "Lectures are extraordinarily clear and well-planned, and Mathias is very knowledgeable. The material is inherently interesting and important. Problem sets reflect lecture material well and are usually good ways to cement our understanding of ideas, but the infrequency of the problem sets (4 psets+take-home final for the whole semester) meant that sometimes we would learn something in class and then not return to it on homework until 3 weeks later.",
    "I thought the problem sets were very challenging and I enjoyed tackling them. I thought that the lectures could have more constructive and more applicative rather than just going over proofs.",
    "This class was great",
    "The course was a series of proofs presented during lectures. It would have been nice to have some examples or perhaps discussion about how we would solve problems on our own.",
    "Strengths: subject material is very interesting, large breadth and depth of material, challenging work, but not an excessive amount of it. Weaknesses: if it is a weakness, the class went very quickly and I did not retain all of the information. That said, I think that the goal of the course is to cover interesting material - it's left to the student to make sure they learn things fully."

   "comments": [
    "This course definitely challenged me and resulted in a few sleepless nights but it was rewarding to complete.",
    "This course covers a different topic every year. If Mathias is teaching graph theory (or a related topic) again, I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has a high degree of mathematical maturity and wants to learn about an exciting new topic. Workload is quite manageable.",
    "I would if you are independent and self-motivated to learn the information on your own. A lot of the learning is done outside of the classroom trying to tackle the difficult problem sets.",
    "Yes, combinatorics is a fascinating area of math.",
    "This class is intense but rewarding.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting and challenging course. It'll be tough, but it's a nice challenge and you have to work with your peers, which is good."
