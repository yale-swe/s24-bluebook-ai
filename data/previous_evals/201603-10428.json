    "The two projects were great! The class structure could have allowed for a third project (smaller than the two). While individual critques were very helpful and efficient, group crits were much more of an educational experience, given the fact that students could compare work and process. Perhaps group crits of 5 or so students could combine the efficiency and educational value of the two critique formats."

The projects are much more open-ended and far larger-scale than those of preceding courses; therefore, I would recommend this course to students who feel comfortable with their design process and have a high level of design capability\/theory."
