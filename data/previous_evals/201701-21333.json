    "The homework is extremely important, most of the classes we were checking the contents of the homework. I hope we could have more time for free speech and discuss with topics named by students. It might be a new way to both learn Japanese language and also know more about studies in other schools of Yale."

    "If you are willing to improve your spoken Japanese in Yale, this class is high recommended. It is only a small portion of the official writing in this class. But, definitely best teachers with great sense of responsibility, they are committed to help your study with 100% effort."
