    "Big emphasis on speaking. If that's your cup of tea, you'll do really well. If it's not (not mine) you'll learn how to handle it.",
    "I think the Arabic department is improving, so take all of the negative things you've heard with a grain of salt. This class uses al-Kitaab much more than L1-L2 did in the past, which is great for grammar and vocabulary retention. I still think there's too much of a focus on grammar and not enough on vocabulary building and speaking fluency. (unfortunately, we still read the story books, which just get more difficult and seem to benefit us just as little). There's more homework than L1-L2, but in general it seems to be helping and not hurting you to do it (in terms of your improvement in the language). I honestly thought that one of the weakest parts of this class were some of the other students. I don't mean to sound like a snob, but some people in my class just did not get Arabic and definitely held us back. I understand that some people just need to suffer through L3 to fulfill that language requirement, but if you are really not a language person, then you'll be suffering a lot and also putting a burden on your teacher and classmates. So, take L3 Arabic if you're really interested in working hard and learning the language, but don't have unrealistic expectations about being fluent (or even proficient) after this semester.",
    "No. Take Arabic somewhere else.",
    "It has a lot less work than the first year of Arabic. It's generally a pretty fun class if you get a good teacher (make sure you get a good teacher). I would say take it if you have to finish your language requirement, but try to do a summer program if you get the opportunity to do so instead (a non-Yale summer program, that is).",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, then go ahead. It can be a bit intense at first, but the course lightens up as time goes by. Keep up with the vocab, keep up with the grammar, and you'll have fun."
