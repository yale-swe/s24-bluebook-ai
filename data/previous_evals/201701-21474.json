   "comments": [
    "I learned how to verbally represent visual representation",
    "Inlearned how to think about things in a different way",
    "This course was incredible in making me literally \"look closer\" at everything--right from literature to art to life. I developed useful skills in reading and writing as well as coming up with creative ideas for various projects, be it the midterm and final papers or the class presentation.",
    "An understanding of how to write compelling reading responses each week; how to figure out essential arguments in long readings; a comfort with niche upperclassman seminar work.",
    "I developed the ability to recognize ekphrasis in a variety of readings and media, learning also to question and not merely accept its presence in a work. I learned to engage with critical texts and original material, mapping theories of sense and knowledge onto the practice of ekphrasis in art. This class taught me to read a painting for its poem and a poem for its painting as well as inspire me to broaden my artistic and philosophical knowledge to achieve the breadth necessary to connect across these disciplines.",
    "I learned to examine more carefully the creative and limiting powers of different mediums\/ languages through close reading, looking, and listening. This enabled me to think about different sensory languages in a more integrated and rich way.",
    "This course taught me to question every belief I had previously held about art, communication, and aesthetic values--it turned out to be a much more radical and engaging semester than I could ever had hoped for!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It wasn't always super organized but I learned a lot",
    "A very creative and enlightening approach to the mostly unfamiliar and somewhat convoluted idea of ekphrasis--the themes and topics of the course are incredibly diverse and enable true engagement with the ideas they bring.",
    "This course was well-organized, clearly themed, and a pleasure to take. I appreciated the wide range of texts, and considering the breadth of the course, we were able to discuss each work deeply.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is structured as an exploration in which all the members are interested in approaching a question from different angles each week. The level of engagement from the students really drove the class in addition to Professor Connolly's thoughtful insights and selection of readings. Each student came in with a different background and really meaningfully contributed to the exploration, giving some of the most thought out presentations I have ever seen in any class at Yale. By the end of the course however, the topic did feel a little repetitive at times and the extensive weekly readings discouraged high levels of close readings of all texts. I also think I would have learned more had I received more feedback from Professor Connolly. I have yet to receive my presentation feedback from over a month ago. However, Professor Connolly did make himself extremely available to meet and discuss paper and project ideas. The meetings with him were always very productive as he invested himself in the questions we were interested in and pushed us to think of and consider other things as well.",
    "Strengths: Course material, teaching, size of the class, breadth of different artistic and cultural disciplines covered, the oral presentation and option for a creative final project Weaknesses: Prof.Connolly is brilliant and very kind (always available to chat about the course or projects), but he tends to dominate discussions, which is not what I have grown used to in humanities seminars. He will let students say whatever they want, but he selectively responds to comments. Additionally, he is sometimes over-confident about his expertise in different cultural fields--on separate occasions, he has \"mansplained\" my own interests to me. I also think the readings are sometimes too abstruse and long--less reading would have allowed me to read more closely, and some prefacing beforehand would have been helpful for the more ambiguous readings."

   "comments": [
    "This is an extremely strange course. It's really thirteen meditations on the main theme of Ekphrasis. It is such a strange expanse that you sometimes lose the forest for the trees but it's a real pleasure. I encourage people to take it with the expectation\/mindset to not engage it as a typical course.",
    "It was very interesting but repetitive",
    "Yes! It will teach you to literally \"look closer at everything--right from art and architecture to music and cinema! I If you are looking to explore your creative side through academic engagement, this is the course for you. Lovers of art, performance and literature--this one is a must take.",
    "Yes, this class set the standard for the kind of seminar work I look forward to pursuing in the future. Would recommend to any student for the way it forced me to think about representation (and re-representation). A wonderful, brilliant professor who is incredibly open to meeting with students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! Ekphrasis is such a relevant topic of study, and this class gives one the tools necessary to recognize it and analyze its effects. Anyone interested in crossovers in disciplines should definitely take this course, and I am definitely a better reader of art and theoretical texts for having taken it.",
    "If you are interested in the features and limits of different media, this is an important class to take. The one thing is also that this class definitely spends more time looking at poetry on art than the art that the poetry is based off of,",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to do the substantial readings and if you feel like you will benefit from a discussion-heavy course. If you are new to humanities seminars at Yale I would recommend a less challenging course."
