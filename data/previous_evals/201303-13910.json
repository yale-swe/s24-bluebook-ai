    "Take it!",
    "Yes",
    "The perfect blend of literature and modeling with the best economic professor I've had to date.",
    "The course was extremely interesting, particularly because I was interested in not only economics, but also in public policy and how different socio-economic factors also come into play. It was awesome to be taught by Nicoli Nattrass who is an expert in this field. I enjoyed the different texts we read and the papers we wrote responding to each of them. The final project was also a lot of fun to do, especially if you work with a partner or group. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's interested in public health and economics.",
    "I'd recommend to any seniors for their senior economics seminar and anyone interested in public health, especially in the context of the African AIDS epidemic.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Nattrass has a wealth of experience in the subject that makes the class incredibly interesting.",
    "take it!",
    "Excellent seminar with one of the leading minds in the field. Reasonable workload--3 essays, ~100 pages of reading per week, final project (and you can work in groups)--but you will get so much more out of the class by actually doing that work, of course. Take it if you can get in!",
    "I would because the workload is light and it's a good learning experience. If the student already has some background in studying the global AIDS epidemic, I might suggest s\/he take a different class as much of it was an introduction to the epidemic.",
    "Absolutely, if you're at all interested in the AIDS epidemic. This class really is quite unique, especially because you get to do some modeling of your own at the end.",
    "Yes take it if you're interested in this topic. Nattrass is genuinely helpful and the discussions are quite interesting too. Sometimes the discussions would get dry but most times she's also very funny and approachable.",
    "ECON 487 is a great seminar. The beginning of the course focuses on a broad overview of the AIDS epidemic, with the first of four books you read summarizing the history of the epidemic quite well for a<300 pg book. We read academic papers on social and behavioral drivers of the epidemic which offered a much more nuanced perspective of the disease- these were my favorites. Everything she assigns is highly relevant to the subject and makes for interesting discussion. Kind of like a book club at times, which was great. The modeling project at the end can seem really intimidating but just read her directions thoroughly and explore some outside resources to better explain it if you've never done demographic modeling before. Overall a great class. Take take take.",
    "If the topic interests you, you'll love this class. The reading list is really interesting, the papers are not too stressful but force you to dig in a little deeper into certain issues, and the final case study makes you feel like you've really accomplished something (especially with the modeling component). Since participation doesn't count towards your grade, you don't get any students talking just for the sake of \"participating,\" so the discussion is very real and engaging. Professor Nattrass is a really knowledgable and experienced person in her field, and a very upbeat and interesting person to lead a seminar.",
    "Highly recommended. Workload is very manageable and the book covered are well-written. Professor Nattrass is very helpful with the final modeling project on a country in Africa, so don't let that scare you off. We worked on the final project together in a computer cluster and it was fun!"
