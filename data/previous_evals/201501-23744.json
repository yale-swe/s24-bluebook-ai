    "A good, low stress CS credit. There is no coding. Instead, it is run as a seminar where everyone presents one class, plus a couple done by Professor Fischer or the TF, and then there is a discussion. I really enjoyed it. Plus, Professor Fischer and Ewa (if she TFs for the class again) are both awesome. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Very interesting class. Must take if you like debating privacy\/security issues.",
    "A very relaxed, low-stress discussion course on issues in privacy and security. If you believe CS students deserve a discussion-writing seminar as much as others, this course is for you."
