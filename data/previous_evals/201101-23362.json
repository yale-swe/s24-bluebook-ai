    "The readings were hit or miss. Some really interesting, some I didn't care for at all.",
    "Workload was heavy - 3 books through the semester plus multiple readings in other weeks but the readings were all really relevant and instructive. Just wish there was a way to reduce the volume for those of us who aren't fast readers (I do read fast, so it wasn't a problem for me, but even then it was a significant time commitment)",
    "Excellent course. Highly recommend it. Professor is excellent!",
    "This was a terrific, interesting, and inspiring course. I learned a great deal and it has made me more appreciative of environmental campaigns. I'd never considered working on a campaign before and now ... I will be disappointed if I don't work on a campaign when I graduate!",
    "I can imagine that all of the evaluations for the class are very good. Other students recommeded the class to me, and I'm sure the popularity will continue next year after the rave reviews."

    "The speakers were, on the whole, fantastic. The last evening, at the Lawn Club, where we presented, was actually fantastic as well. I learned a lot and the campaigns chosen were quite instructive; folks did a great job of inserting lessons learned from the semester in their analysis of how the campaigns moved forward.",
    "We heard real stories from practicer.",
    "Guest lectures, assigned readings, discussions with other students, dinner...it was all pretty awesome.",
    "The wide range of types of campaigns covered.Very interesting reading.Great guest lecturers.",
    "I loved having real life campaigners come talk to us about their successes. This is a refreshing class mode. It's very inspiring too.",
    "The variety of presenters.Food was much appreciated!",
    "The best thing was hearing a new speaker each week talk about their campaign experiences.",
    "It made me realize just how much I want advocacy to be a part of my future.",
    "Excellent guest speakers. Very inspiring. Covers material that no other class at Yale addresses, but is very important to policy-making.",
    "The incredible guest speakers and the ability to interview some of the most amazing leaders in the environmental activism community.",
    "The quality of the guest speakers.",
    "The best thing about this course was the guest speakers and the final paper. The guest speakers were fantastic and gave an incredible opportunity to hear the inside story behind many of the big campaigns for the past few decades. Hearing their insights was very valuable and revealed how campaigns work and how policy is made. The final paper was also a great opportunity to learn about a specific campaign and to talk to people who helped run the campaign. It's also a great chance to make connections with potential employers.",
    "The readers were terrific but the speakers were absolutely inspiring. The work load was light, which was really nice.",
    "It is turly a couse that alows the students to think, as opposed to some of our classes where we are expected to churn out grunt work. The speakers were all excellent. Michael is also a true gentlmen that treats the students as equals, without any superiority involved.",
    "The guest speakers were the best part of this course. Almost all the speakers were great presenters and story tellers. Their case studies really highlighted the elements of campaigning we learned from the prof. and from the readings. The books\/readings were great too.",
    "This was a great course, where we approached issues differently from any of my other FES classes. Really a refreshing new perspective to look at how change is made, by real people in real campaigns. Michael knows so many wonderful people to bring in and they were all a pleasure to hear from and talk with."

   "comments": [
    "It was kind of annoying having to do reading commentaries every week, particularly on those weeks when I was least interested on a subject. Maybe give student 1-2 free passes, or just request X out of Y commentaries for the semester.",
    "Need a bigger room that is conducive to conversation (not Burke).",
    "Not applicable.",
    "Would be great to have more discussion time to reflect on readings and speakers, perhaps every third or fourth lecture.",
    "Given the time constraints of having so many amazing speakers, I know this is difficult, but I would love to hear more commentary on each of the campaigns from Professor Northrop. His insights are invaluable.",
    "I can't really think of many, except that maybe there should be more campaign presentation days. The last few presentations were rushed and we couldn't ask questions, which was a shame. Loved the venue...",
    "A small collaborative work group project as a complement the other aspects of the class might have been interesting.",
    "The weekly written responses got tedious and felt like busy work some weeks (such as the week on Healthy Hospitals).",
    "All the guests were very openly liberal. It would have been really great to stimulate discussion in a different direction, by inviting a corporate campaigner or someone who had to defend against an environmental campaign or someone who campaigns from a different perspective or in a different field (maybe not even environmentalism). Also, Michael is really bad about respecting time limits for the important presentations we all give at the end--he doesn't cut off the early people and asks them lots of questions, which results in the later people needing to shorten their presentations and not get any feedback. And it's a pity the class was so big."

    "I wanted to learn how to work with and against corporations to make large change in business practices. I also wanted to learn more about environmental campaigns such as RAN\/CITI, Home Depot and old growth forests, etc.",
    "It was recommended by a friend so I sat in on the first few classes and I was just hooked. It was really a special class. Also the readers looked interesting.",
    "I have gotten some exposure to NGOs through other classes such as the Environmental Protection Clinic, and wanted to go deeper into these types of issues.",
    "To hear real-world case studies about campaigning.",
    "I heard it was great, and not very hard--a neat way to think through issues at the end of my time at FES."

This course engaged people consistently in a way a number of other courses I'm in don't. I would have liked time to debrief speakers, etc. however--perhaps for the first half-hour of each new class.
