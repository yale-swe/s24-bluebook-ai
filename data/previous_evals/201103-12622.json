    "One of the best classes ive taken at Yale. SO SO SO much better than the MCDB biochem; i almost changed my major to MBB&B. Most of the emphasis is on understanding rather than memorization. That being said, the midterms were hard and its really important to keep up with the class\/readings.",
    "Very interesting material",
    "MBB 300 is a tough but fair class. Grades are assigned to each quintile of students, so it may be hard to get anA. Grades aside, it is a good class to help you think like a biochemist and to introduce the \"language\" of biochemistry. If you have to take this class, be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
    "Really good, really fundamental. They're not joking when they say this class is about principles. You're in for a treat. Just make sure you get enough sleep, because class is long and sometimes fatigue-inducing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. I enjoyed it much more than my friends enjoyed the MCDB class.",
    "Interesting material, but certainly a difficult course with lots of detail. This course is much more conceptual (and relevant) than orgo, but with a similar level of mechanistic detail. Take it, but make sure you have a light courseload alongside it. The exams are challenging, so make sure to review the problem set answer keys to see how they want answers written.",
    "This course was a great intro to biochemistry. I really enjoyed each lecture and would absolutely recommend the course for interested students.",
    "Take it. Don't be discouraged by organic chemistry. Biochemistry is much better, and may give you some ideas of what you want to do in the future.",
    "This is the best science class I've taken at Yale! You will learn an unbelievable amount of information, but it is all very manageable and rewarding if you stay on top of things. There is a substantial amount of memorization, but in order to do well in the course you need to understand the rationale behind everything... which can be daunting but is ultimately so rewarding. It definitely helps to have some background in molecular or cell bio coming into the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because the material is interesting. But here's the thing: The lectures and concepts are readily understandable (after a good amount of textbook reading coupled with lecture note reviewing), but the problem set questions and exam questions are conceptually difficult. And even after you understand the concepts, they can still give you questions that manage to really stump you.Though it seemed like a broad, conceptual class at the start, it definitely also requires you to memorize a lot of facts. Like, A LOT. So it's really doubly difficult on that front--you have to know both concepts and details. It was really interesting material, though.For some reason, the grades aren't great in this class, with averages in the 70s, which is relatively low. They deduct a couple of points here and there on the exam, but it really adds up! I'd walk out of exams feeling really good, but those little errors here and there led to not-so-great grades.I like that all the info you needed to know was in the lecture slides. That made for easy studying--meaning not having to scramble around through the internet to find better explanations than what was given in class, which is often what happens with science at Yale. Sigh.",
    "Great course. This is one of those classes where you leave feeling like you have learned something in enough detail to really understand it, but to also comprehend how much there is still to know. Both Biederer and Kolle are awesome, the homework isn't too bad, and the exams, while hard, are fair.One note, the class is taught well enough and in enough detail, the book is completely unnecessary. A waste of $220, so don't buy it unless you decide you need it to supplement lectures.",
    "Take this course! Definitely the most interesting subject I have ever studied. Professors are great, it's not that hard... TAKE IT!",
    "yes but the test are very hard and the curve is not great. If bio major might want to consider taking the MCDB version. I did learn an amazing amount of very interesting stuff",
    "I really enjoyed this class but I also really enjoyed the material so I'm probably biased. There was quite a bit more memorization than I expected based on what people were saying about this class compared to the MCDB one. Still really good and the professors were really great.",
    "This is an excellent course. Probably one of the best science courses I've ever taken. It's interesting, not impossible, and well-taught. I feel like I've learned so much this semester. The course doesn't focus on memorization; rather it focuses on internalizing important concepts in biochemistry, meaning you don't have to spend countless hours memorizing things. Beware of the curve: most people in this class are very smart and motivated. You need to stay on top of the material in order to do well on the exams. Whether or not you're an MB&B major, you should take this great course.",
    "This is a pretty good course; I don't have very strong feelings either way. Be prepared for a LOT of information though. Also, the people in the class are pretty intense, so if you want to be at the top, you really have to work for it.",
    "Very challenging but interesting course about Biochemisty. I would recommend it but be prepared for a large workload (if you want to stay on top of things).",
    "I would recommend biochem if you're taking fewer than two other science lectures. It might be tough to balance with other hard classes, but it's a great choice! You learn SO MUCH about life and how the world works.",
    "Very rewarding class! The material is presented superbly and the subject matter is fascinating. The tests are challenging though and their is alot of material. Just keep up on the readings before and after lectture but rely on and study the lecture handouts for exams. There are two midterms, 10 problem sets, and final.",
    "MBB 300 covers extremely fascinating material, everything that you would expect from a great biochemistry course. The \"teaching\" wasn't really important, since the professors just lectured off of the powerpoints. I did fine sleeping through every class and just reading the lectures and the book before the tests. So yeah, I'm giving this class high scores not because of mind-blowing teaching but because of extremely fascinating material. Biochemistry is awesome! You'll drill down to the mechanisms of biology. Everything we learned was very fulfilling.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need it for your major or for med school. That said, it's not an awful experience and you might actually enjoy learning some of the material!",
    "Excellently taught, I feel like I learned a lot and actually enjoyed the material because of two great professors. Reasonable homework and fair tests.",
    "Really interesting course but beating the curve is difficult. A pretty difficult lecture course, but very applicable and engaging material.",
    "This course will probably end up being the best course I will ever take at Yale, because I can't imagine anything ever topping MBB300! The material is fascinating, well-taught, well-tested, and above all, supremely organized. Perhaps because they've taught the course for so long, but Biederer and Koelle knew exactly how the course should run, down to how many minutes each lecture takes. It was truly a pleasure to take this class, (I have definitely never said that about another class before) and I wish they were teaching next semester!It was challenging, to be sure, but if you studied then you were fine. There is a lot of material, and studying for the final was extremely intimidating but the material was just so interesting! I felt the grading was extremely fair, and the curve is really generous (they say the top 20% get A's, next 20% A-'s, etc). There were 2 midterms, 2 in-class quizzes, 10 problem sets, and a final.I cannot recommend this class enough! It is practically perfect, with my only complaint that they need to make sure all the reading matches what is being presented in the lectures. There were at least a few days when I felt we covered barely any of the assigned 30+ pages of reading (which might not sound like a lot but it took me, at least, a while to read). Also, the professors should have office hours.Also, they phrased questions in a really confusing way on the final, such that I don't think I answered what they were actually trying to ask, so they should have maybe the TAs look over the test before giving it to students to make sure that the questions are clear.In all, you probably won't be looking here unless you're an MB&B major or a premed, but you should definitely take this class! It was mostly juniors in it, and having orgo and bio before hand wouldhelp (probably cell bio, but I haven't taken that yet).",
    "Bravo! Michael Koelle said at one point, and I presume he's said it many times, that \"this is the most interesting material that man has ever studied\" (something like that). As a future MB&B major, I must agree. Not only that, but this course puts biochemistry into a wonderful perspective in relation tomedicine and everyday life, even if it did not always give all the details.If you want to start the path to the major or are interested in the great human achievement of biochemistry study, then I highly recommend you take this class. It's as painless as possible and terribly fascinating. Plus, you will learn more practical truths in this class than most other science classes. This class has a lot of time running, and it shows in the excellent teaching.",
    "The material is challenging but very rewarding. Lectures are well-organized and place everything into context (unlike classes like Cell Bio where it's hard to figure out what's going on or how material fits into a bigger picture). The professors are both wonderful and helpful. My only regret is that my final grade likely will not reflect accurately how well I've mastered the material because the exams were difficult and not always directly relevant to what was presented in class. You either needed prior knowledge or had to be really good at inferring something from basically nothing. Overall I enjoyed the class though and learned a lot!",
    "Every 75 minute Biochem lecture felt like the longest 75 minutes of my life. Not in a good way. Prof. Kolle, who teaches 1\/3 of the course, is good, but the course is so boring it's unbelievable. Basically, you just memorize qualitative aspects of biological molecules, reactions, and pathways. No fun at all, and you don't come out of the course feeling like you've learned anything important at all.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in biochemistry, it's a great lecture. The tests are pretty hard, but if you attend lecture\/study you should be fine.",
    "It takes the cool parts of cell bio with like three mechanisms from Orgo and explains how they happen in your body. It's really interesting and the professors are great. The curve is not the nicest (because everyone is really really smart although the professors try to give a lot of good grades) and the tests are challenging in their mixture of memorization and concept application. It's a rewarding class though.",
    "MB&B is a great course. It had more material than probably any other course I've taken in my four years at Yale, but it was very well taught and also interesting. Because there are a lot of pre-meds in the course, the curve is hard and you can't slack off. That said, it's definitely worth taking because the material is fascinating. You'll learn why we need to eat, why we get fat, and why we breathe, as well as awhole lot more.",
    "MB&B 300 is an absolutely incredible course. Professors Biederer and Koelle did a phenomenal job presenting the material in a manner that was easy to comprehend for the students, and their mastery of the material was impressive. They spoke to the students with an honesty and clarity about their understanding of the material that I have never observed before from any professor. The course material is very comprehensive, and a wide range of very essential topics are covered. Overall, this was easily one of the best science courses I have taken during my time at Yale. The course began with amino acids and ended up presenting how entire metabolic pathways are functionally integrated. MB&B 300 was a class that really taught the students the material so they could understand its conceptual workings, and I'm very glad I took it over the Spring semester version. The workload was quite low - weekly problem sets took less than an hour and a half, and the only work necessary to do well in the class was to pay close attention during lecture and then study the material closely before the exam.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and would definitely recommend it to another student. I wish that all pre-medical students, in particular, had to take this course. It gives you the tools and methods for understanding how different bodily processes, drugs, and other interventions work and a better appreciation for how interconnected everything is within an organism.",
    "As someone who recently switched from BME to MB&B as a junior, this class has convinced me that I made the right choice. Both professors (Koelle and Biederer) were great lecturers who were intimately knowledgeable about the material that they were covering, and interesting to listen to. The material itself was also fascinating for someone like me who has always been curious about how things in the body work at a really detailed level. Take this class if you are at all interested in biochemistry, even if you aren't a pre-med or biochem major.",
    "Not sure about the MCDB Biochem, but this Biochem is no cake, harder orgo is what I think.Take it at your own risk, maybe MCDB Biochem is better, not sure. When it comes to science classes, there are really limited options, you suffer\/die one way or another. So just hope for the best or hope that you are smarter than the others, but in this class, there are too many smarty pants, so perhaps take the other one.",
    "You might just wind up taking this because it's a requirement for the MB&B major. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT MB&B--it's a great elective for the chemistry major if you're interested in this side of chemistry. I really enjoyed it, and I learned a lot about biochemical processes that I hope to be able to apply in my future work in the field.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in how the human body works. Studying for the tests, you may have the rare experience of learning something and making new connections by looking back at older lectures (the sign of a well thought-out course). I would recommend credit\/D for all those who do not need the grade and do not want to worry about competing with the many pre-meds.",
    "Haven't taken the other Biochem course but definitely learned a lot from this one. This may be the way to take biochem for MCDB if they decide to not require the second semester. The curve is actually not as bad as people make it out to be with almost half of the people getting A range.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for a fellow student especially pre-med. It's a great course!",
    "This class was really difficult, but you learn a lot of information. The lectures are not particularly engaging, and I didn't find section particularly helpful. I found that reviewing the material by myself and with other classmates was the best way to learn the material in this course. If you plan on taking this course, make sure you set aside plenty of time to review the lecture material on your own.",
    "Biochem is a spectacular class. It is more fun than organic chemistry, and it meets at a normal time and in WLH, so from the outset there is a more laid-back vibe to the class. The material is immensely interesting and much more relevant to our lives than orgo is. The material is just so cool! The workload is not very intense, and the problem sets are a breeze compared to orgo problem sets. This class is fun, interesting, and will make you happy. I wish I could recommend it to people who don't already have to take it, but I don't know anyone who has taken orgo who isn't already required to take biochem.",
    "Most people take this class because they have to take this class, so what I'm gonna say probably doesn't matter. BUT, you do learn a lot of cool stuff in it. Good luck!!",
    "MB&B Biochem was a good course. It started off really easy with Biederer's lecture, especially if you have previous research experience working with proteins, but once Koelle's lectures began, the course ratcheted up in difficulty. In particular, the second exam (exclusively on metabolism) was quite tough. However, the final was manageable. You definitely learn a lot, and it's a nice synthesis of cell biology and organic chemistry, but the quality of the students in the class make it difficult to get an A. That shouldn't stop you, though, because MCDB Biochem is reportedly very boring and memorization-based.",
    "I took this class because I felt that biochemistry was a very important subject matter to know as a biomedical engineer. This course is, in my opinion, crucial for anyone going into any biology-oriented future. It is taught well, and with adequate study can easily yield good grades. Furthermore, the material is just fascinating. Take it! And DEFINITELY take it over the MBB biochem.",
    "Yes! This is a great course that covers a lot of important topics in biochemistry (protein folding, metabolism, membranes) in significant depth and the professors are engaging.",
    "Great course. Definitely the best science course I have taken at Yale. Both professors are fantastic, the material is interesting, and the workload is completely manageable.Definitely take this class! Its exciting to leave with a strong understanding in how the human body works.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to - there are better science classes. There are a lot of scary premeds in this class that make the curve difficult.",
    "This is one of the best taught science classes I have taken at Yale. Lectures are clear, interesting, and well organized. I took it after having taken orgo, physiology, cell bio, genetics, and a number of labs, and I found the material very straightforward, and much of it was review. That said, I still feel like I learned an enormous amount that will be applicable to future work in science and medicine.The problem sets require very little work, but studying for the exams takes time because there is so much material to learn. I stopped reading the book after the first couple weeks, and that seemed fine.",
    "No",
    "MB&B 300 was a very informative introduction to biochemistry. Make sure that you have a very solid background in general and organic chemistry (you need to be able to understand mechanisms) and be prepared to do some serious rote memorization, though.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone majoring in a related science field. It is deceivingly competitive and requires a lot of outside studying to do well. It is a good class, though, with enjoyable and engaging material.",
    "MB&B 300 is a great science class, perhaps one of the better ones I've had at Yale. The competition from the class of mostly high-achieving pre-med students is rough, but the teaching is so superb that you can't possibly fault the class. You must work diligently in the class - what Michael and Thomas say in the beginning on how to succeed in biochemistry is entirely true. To understand Biochem at the level they teach, you need to let the concepts simmer in your mind for a while - cramming won't work here. Great class.",
    "This is a great class! Be advised though, that the averages are much higher than those for orgo, so you really do need to know EVERYTHING for the midterms and final. Having said, it's a very interesting class, so even though it's a requirement, you will enjoy yourself. The weekly problem sets are pretty easy and quick to complete, so you have to take it upon yourself to keep up with understanding of the material. Definitely don't let it all slide until the exam, since most of it is memorization heavy, you will suffer.",
    "It is a very interesting course; take it but be warned. The course may seem easy at first, but you are in a class of people who will make a tough curve. Read the book and review the lectures so that you understand everything, then memorize things before the tests. This is a self driven course.",
    "Yes, I would. It gives you a great understanding of the underlying concepts governing the chemical processes occurring within biological organisms.",
    "It's work but definitely enjoyable",
    "Yes, absolutely take it. Best science class I have taken so far. Many of the sciences classes at Yale (such as organic chemistry) just feel like they are being taught to the top 10% of students in the class. No one, except those geniuses ever really master the material, and the other 90% of us just feel stupid and incompetent the whole semester. Biochemistry, on the other hand, was taught in a way that everyone had access too. They provided us with super clear lecture slides printed out, for each lecture. The TAs were also awesome, very clear and very reasonable. The course is also true to its name: it was truly about the \"principles\" of biochemistry. Not only did I leave the semester knowing a ton of examples of molecules and pathways, but I truly learned how to think from a biochemical perspective.",
    "Highly recommended. Extremely well taught, and you really feel like you're getting a detailed understanding of biology using the tools of biochemistry. Nice to bring together concepts from general chemistry, organic chemistry, and even physics to get a deeper understanding of life processes. Take this class!",
    "Great, but difficult course. I learned a ton about biology this semester and I hope to learn more in the next. Some keys to success:1. Don't just rely on the powerpoint handouts as \"notes.\" Write down what the professor is saying in the margins; the material will make a lot more sense when you look back at it days later.2. Get help from TA's. One of the best ways to gauge your biochemical understanding is to meet 1 on 1 with a TA and see if you can explain certain concepts to them. If you find yourself with a gap in knowledge, you've got some studying to do. While I never attended section, I did meet 1 on 1 and it was very helpful.3. Attend any review sessions offered. One that I went to before the final basically managed to predict all of the major topics covered on the test.4. Read the book. If you're crunched for time, just look at the diagrams and the captions and digest the material in there. That's where most of the important information is anyway.",
    "Take it. I obviously haven't taken the MCDB course. So I can't give you a fair comparison. But I'm glad I took this course.",
    "MB&B is a very broad intro to biochemistry. You will learn a lot, and you will need to spend a lot of time studying and keeping up with the material for the class. Luckily, there is only one very simple pset each week (2-3 old exam questions) and the hardest part is turning it in on time. The class however is also hard due to the curve - if you care about your GPA and don't need to take the course, then don't, because it is an extremely competitive class in terms of grades. If you want to learn biochemistry though, this is a good course to take!",
    "I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to other students. I feel like I came out of it with a good understanding of basic biochemical concepts and metabolism.",
    "You're probably taking this class because it's a requirement, so I guess there's no getting out of it. I'm a MCDB major and took it instead of the MCDB Biochem because I figured it would be taught better in its own department. I have no basis of comparison, but I can't really complain on how it was taught.",
    "Interesting, useful, and fun class if you want to major in MB&B or MCDB. I've been told that this is a better course than the MCDB version of biochemistry, and I wouldn't doubt it, considering this is the biochemistry department. keep up with he lecture notes and do the homework and you'll do well.",
    "MBB biochem is a difficult course with a rough curve and hard grading on exams, but if you're good at biochem and want to learn it, take it.",
    "This was a great course. I liked the lectures very much--I feel like the course was a useful way to round out my biology skill set. The only weakness is that the professors act like memorization doesn't play a big role in the class but it actually does. The test contains many questions that nitpick on 1 piece of info on a single slide. This class is probably more difficult than the mcdb version because it involves memorization (not of mechanisms) but also lots of application \/ critical thinking. It was unclear what we had to hardcore memorize and what we needed to skim.",
    "Yes. Cool information, great instructors, decent curve. Enriched my understanding of biology by going into detail about a lot of biological concepts that I may have been introduced to before, but didn't understand fully.",
    "Very difficult, but necessary for pre-med.",
    "This is a great class that covers a lot of useful information. Definitely worth it, but also a lot of work. Although there are underlying concepts that help you understand things, there is also a ton of just brute memorization. That's just the way it goes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. It is not easy, but if you just learn everything on the slides, you'll be golden. Not an easy class, but very fair.",
    "Professor Koelle's Principles of Metabolism, which constituted about one third of the course, gave you a chance tounderstand a system in an integrated way, and Professor Koelle's teaching style for this third of the material emphasized understanding.The remaining two thirds of the course contained some worthwhile information with some cohesion and also required you to memorize a bunch of random bits of dubious importance.",
    "Take it because you have to.",
    "Your standard biochem class. Lectures are straightforward, as well as exams and problem sets. Beware of the pre-meds in this class; somewhat oddly, the tests are tailored to their style of blind memorization and you'll have to study like a premed to beat the curve. The standard bio topics are covered again in this class so I don't feel like my mind wasexpanded or anything, but I did add depth to the breadth I already knew.",
    "MB&B 300 is one of the best science classes I took at Yale. It brought together concepts fromorganic chemistry and biology and made them relevant. I would certainly recommend this class for anyone pre-med or interested in biology. The emphasis was on understanding concepts rather than memorization, which was very refreshing.",
    "I'd recommend this if you're looking for a challenge grade-wise and want to learn biochemistry.",
    "It was a good course and very intersting. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I obviously do not know how the MCDB biochem is, but this one is fine. I do not think I have taken a class at Yale that I have had to study this much for. The final has so much info on it. Problem sets are easy- just plan to spend a week to study for each exam. The teaching wasn't as good as I expected based on past reviews, although still better than most big lecture science classes. The information learned in this course is incredible and really interesting-really makes you feel like you know how the human body works on a very basic level.",
    "This course is a very thorough introduction to biochemistry. It does focus more on the concepts and less on memorization than its MCDB counterpart. I think you need the amount time that this class gives to topics like metabolism (which is taught VERY well!) that the MCDB class does not allow you. Be warned: despite its supposed \"conceptually driven\" nature, you will still be expected to know almost every detail off of every slide in order to do well. Overall, a good class if you want to gain a fundamental understanding of biochemistry.",
    "The class is a great introduction to biochemistry for anyone who is interested (not just MBB majors). The material seems easy in the beginning, but it does pick up fairly quickly. But you should do fine if you do the readings: I found it to be more helpful to before each lecture take notes on the previous lecture, as the readings were oftentimes more comprehensive than the lectures and also the professors sometimes refer back to material from the previous lecture. Taking pretty detailed notes on the readings can be useful though, because some of the past exam questions are answered almost directly in the book. The weekly problem sets were very easy - use them as practise for the format of answers that they want, which can be a little difficult to get used to.",
    "This course is really hard once you hit metabolism (after the first midterm). Make sure to put aside enough time for it.",
    "Know it's not easy, have to put a lot of time into it.",
    "I can't really compare it to the MCDB biochem, but this course was both very interesting and very difficult.",
    "TAKE IT! TAKE IT NOW. You may get an A. You may not. This class really integrates all you've learned in chemistry and biology. But you can't understand biology without biochemistry."
