    "Yes, they are very helpful.",

    "Yes.",
    "The resources in school is more than enough and we also explored quite a bit of the online resources because of the open-source nature of the language.",
    "I believe that this course and the knowledge it gives to a contemporary architect is very important.I think that the course should be extended to at least two classes, taught consecutively: basics of computation, and advanced course. Those who already have some background can jump right into the advanced class, but those without any knowledge in this field will definitely benefit from the basic course. This is a kind of a field where it\u0092s really important to commit serious effort in the beginning and do more to form good foundation. Then one can move on to more advanced and project applied tasks.I think that for the weekly assignments and for final project there may be a library of sketches prepared and sorted by different topics. These sketches can be given by the professor as a part of assignments.Thus, prior to making his own sketch, a student will have to \u0093hack\u0094 some 10 given sketches dealing with the same topic, and see their structure. I\u0092d also limit the range of topics as well as freedomof interpreting and coding them for assignments in basic course, to make sure that a student just has a good command of a number of limited basic tools in Processing.",
    "Yes, however, I wish that there would have been an easier way to fabricate my project.",
    "All school resources were avilable to us upon our discression. Our instructor guided us to obtain resources that were outside the school.If there's anything that would be useful for future generations, I would recommend that this class receives a budget (even if little) to help some students to pursue their projects.",
