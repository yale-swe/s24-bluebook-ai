    "Vance is a good teacher who encourages participation and tries to give us applicable assignments. However, it was not that different from a more extended TSC, and I felt like the continuity got broken up a little by weather-related changes in the class.",

    "skills learned, well designed projects",

    "The introduction to simple but effective ways of improving communication at the professional level. Thegroup exercises were an excellent dynamic to foster learning, feedback between peers, and feedback from a professional instructor.",
    "William and Kristin (TA) taught very valuable topics in communications and provided great feedback!",
    "Learning tips and tricks for presentations and powerpoints - these are most relevant to what we do.",
    "The breakout sessions.",
    "Forcing you to actually practice giving a speech, a power point presentation, etc.",
    "Having the opportunity to see myself on film really highlighted things that I need to work on in my presentation style and presence. I learned the most from the first three weeks of the course.",
    "The readings given prior to class were very helpful.",
    "Personal attention and feedback for each student",
    "Super-practical, assignments involved actually doing these things, and were generally useful and fun. It's a good course to give you an overview of professionalism, and to give you some awareness of how you come off as a presenter. These are super-important skills and it's great to actually have a class in it.",

    "The workshop session with the coaches.",
    "I thought the most useful aspects of the class were the speech, and the powerpoint sessions. I liked working with the coaches and the direct feedback they gave. Learning about the communication coaches.",
    "The weekly exercises are very helpful, and provide an excellent opportunity to practice communication skills. In particular, the opportunity to watch video of yourself giving a speech or presentation, and to access feedback from students and TAs, was invaluable, and an opportunity that most of us don't get otherwise in our careers.",
    "Having taped presentations and feedback was valuable.",
    "Coverage of multiple aspects of communication.",
    "The course was very well organized and presented a lot of great tips.",
    "My favorite parts were the in-class exercises where we directly practiced speaking, presenting, and negotiating in front of our peers. The practice was helpful in and of itself, but the timing was extra useful because it gave us the chance to try out the skills Dr. Vance emphasized in the lectures while they were fresh in our minds. I also appreciate that we were allowed to use old presentations and speeches for the in-class exercises rather than creating new content. Since I was already familiar and comfortable with the material, I was able to concentrate more fully on my speaking and delivery.",

    "Some of the lessons, particularly towards the end of the semester, were really rudimentary and felt a little bit repetitive. I would focus this class more on presentation skills.",
    "It will be good to spend more time in practicing different skills. Limited time was the main aspect of this course that needs the most improvement.",
    "I would like to have talked more about Environmental Communication specifically, not just professionalism, and how to communicate concepts that are difficult or complicated to a larger audience. In addition, while the lectures are not too long, I do sometimes feel like that time could have been better spent actually applying the concept--writing a facebook post together, etc.",

    "The teaching style - it was a \"one size fits it all\" approach. In real life, inter-personal communication is rarely so.",
    "I wish we received more feedback at the end of the course.",
    "We were not provided with the course lecture materials, even after asking for them repeatedly. we got a hard copy handout of some of the PPT slides at the beginning of each class, which was unecessary as most of us would have preferred to access this digitally. However, this sheet was a summary of the key points only, and we never got access to the entire slide deck from each class. This is something I was expecting that we would get, and we were told we should get, so I did not try to take exhaustive notes each class. Now that the course is over, I would like to reference all the material we were given and re-read through it, however I cannot, as we did not get access to it.",
    "Faster pace and options for more advanced students. Would be nice to have some gender-specific training, as often times women face many more challenges and criticism as communicators. Also, more focus on international communication or communication with different (non corporate, american audiences) would be beneficial.",
    "More time to really improve on skills. In one class we'd be handed some tools and put something together to practice them. Then we'd get feedback and never touch them again.",
    "See question 20.It's inconvenient that no slides were shared with the computers, and information was shared with the class in the form of handouts rather than soft copy. That will make it difficult for our generation to organize and refer back to this information in the future.",
    "No specific areas spring to mind; overall a very solid course.",
    "The course is taught too late at night. It's hard to feel motivated at 9pm."

I was disappointed that communication skills specific to the needs of an environmental manager weren't taught.Environmentalists need special skills to communicate their agenda (the environment) with people who may not share that agenda (businesses, govt, etc). Environmentalists need strategies to communicate with the public about the environment. There are a large number of other situations in which environmentalists may need specialized communication skills. Specialized skills don't have to make up 100% of the course content, but at least 25-30% of the time. The content presented is good but it needs to be more targeted.
