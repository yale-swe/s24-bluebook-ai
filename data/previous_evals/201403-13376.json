   "comments": [
    "I would not reccomend this class unless you absolutely have to take it. I didn't learn a thing. I was always stressed thinking about having to go back to it.",
    "If you are looking for an easy science lab credit this isnt for you. If you dont mind working a lot for a half credit and you want to learn biochemistry lab techniques then this isnt necessarily a bad choice. Just make sure to start the lab reports early and not leave them until the night before.",
    "... I have very mixed feelings about this lab. Because it's no longer a half semester course, it's much more doable now (as opposed to reviews you'll see for previous years). I had excellent TAs, and labs themselves were acceptable. There were weekly quizzes (ok if you reviewed the labs beforehand, but sometimes with unpleasant surprise questions) and almost-weekly lectures (very hard to focus for). You'll certainly have an easier time if you've had prior lab experience, and you should, as everyone says, start your lab reports as soon as possible. The lowest grade you could get, if you put in at least some effort, is prob a B. That being said, I wish I didn't have to take this. The amount of stress at the end of the year really distorted my perception of the whole experience, and so I have very negative feelings about the lab.",
    "This was a frustrating course for me. I'm interested in biochemistry and really liked the experiments we pursued this semester (protein folding, enzyme activity, enzyme kinetics) but I have to admit I was pretty lost sometimes during lab. Not sure what it was, I read the manual carefully before class, but lab was always a \"oh I get it now\" after the fact and not during. The lab reports were long but actually quite rewarding (since that's when the \"Aha!\" comes.) In the future, having the backgrounds of the report due earlier than the rest of the report would have been helpful to solidifying understanding of the experiment.",
    "Pretty standard lab course. It's a good lab with not a lot regular work - essentially just two long lab reports in the second half."
