   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any one who is trying to fulfill their science requirement as easy as possible. The content can be very interesting and simple to understand.",
    "ANTH 116 teaches the origins of modern humans from prehistoric times, and then seeks to explain modern human behavior via evolution. If you are interested in that and want an easy class that you can sleep through and still get a good grade, take this class. If you want to stay awake and be challenged, don't take it. You'll dread going to this class everyday.",
    "It's like a light dose of science; I found all the material very interesting, while never finding myself encumbered with scientific terms I could not readily understand. I would recommend it to everyone, simply because the biology of evolution is so interesting.",
    "Good science class for people who aren't too interested in science. My experience was the class seemed so easy I stopped doing most of the work and then the midterm was much more difficult than I expected. That being said, if you do all the work I can't see the class being much of a struggle for anyone.",
    "DO IT. It's a great science credit (I am the least sciency person in the world) that teaches you a lot. I'm definitely taking another anthropology class after this one.",
    "I would certainly recommend Anthropology 116 to another student. The material is great. I think every Yalie should know this scientific history of our species. It's a class that combines scientific method and analysis with enduring questions about humanity.",
    "This is an interesting class. Lectures could sometimes get boring, but it is not a bad class to take to get a science credit.",
    "Lectures were sort-of boring (presented in a boring fashion), but the subject matter is rather interesting and the tests are pretty easy.",
    "It's a bit dry, but a good Sc if you aren't a hard-core science person. David Watts is very sweet and seems to really enjoy what he is teaching.",
    "For an easy science credit, yes, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you plan on majoring in anthropology or just need the science credit. The course material is interesting but covers too broad a spectrum and seems at times almost random. The midterm was very difficult but the final had a much better scope. The problem sets were easy and the class was a little boring, but the sectis were fun and overall the class was not too much work.",
    "Defiantly take this course. Professor Watts is the man and is extremely helpful. Can be boring at times but easiest and best science course your gonna get.",
    "I thought Bio Anthro was a great science for non majors. It didn't require much math or background knowledge in biology, so I would recommend it to any non major or anyone interested in human evolution.",
    "I would recommend this to any student in need of a so or sc credit. It is a good course but there is a lot of material that is covered.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good one. Interesting material, not too much work.",
    "Yes! I'm not a science-y person and found this class really interested and manageable. Don't take if you aren't interested in evolution, but I think that it's something everyone should know about. Painless way to fulfill the science requirement and you come out of it with a really solid understanding of human evolution!",
    "Definitely take this, even if you don't need a science requirement. The lab is quite interesting, and the only problem is that it is far away. You will not regret this class.",
    "I enjoyed Anth 116. The lectures were fact-based, which was good for students (like myself) who enjoy straight-forward science classes. The tests were fair and covered the material we focused on in class. I enjoyed labs; Tim was a great TA, and it was cool to play around with the bones. All in all, I liked the course, and I was inspired to look into more biological anthropology classes in the future.",
    "Anthro 116 covers a wide variety of topics from the behavior of different primates to comparing modern human diets to those of hunter gathers. The lectures are not very engaging, but the sections are useful and the Powerpoints are good material to study from. All in all, the class can get boring, but the material is very thought-provoking and the class can count as a science credit.",
    "Great course for someone looking for an easy, interesting science requirement.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. The professor is sometimes boring in his lectures but if you do all the work and put in a decent amount of effort, you will probably get a good grade. Sections are easy to handle and in general the course does not require a large amount of work to do averagely well. I personally really enjoyed the lectures because the professor really goes into detail about stuff, and I really appreciated that (although I also really appreciated the fact that he didn't test on as much detail as he'd go over)",
    "I found this course tremendously interesting and really enjoyed the subject. The first couple of weeks in this class covered concepts like the basics of evolution and Mendelian genetics. I found this part a bit tedious, already having a background in biology, but this may have been very necessary for the humanities majors who were taking the class to get a science credit, and Prof. Watts made everything nice and clear. The section for this class was probably the coolest part. Though lecture covered a lot of topics that are really fascinating if you're at all interested in human evolution it was neat to have the opportunity to spend time in the anthro teaching lab and get to handle casts of fossils. On top of it all this class was not difficult and I learned a lot. However, I know that a lot of students who take this class for an easy science credit don't enjoy it. Prof. Watts is not a flashy lecturer and although the class is easy, if you don't have a basic interesting in human origins and anthropology you'll probably just be very bored. On the other hand, if you'reactually interested in learning about creatures like australopithicus then I would definitely shop this class (if you don't mind sitting through the review of basic genetics and evolution)."
