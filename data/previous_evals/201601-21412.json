    "DEFINITELY take it!! It's hard, but if Asher is teaching it, 10000% worth it. This stuff is so abstract and probably will not be relevant unless you study something very specific, but Asher made it all seem so exciting and cool! And now I also think it's super exciting and cool!! Best math class I've ever taken. Only math class I've ever taken that I spent so much time voluntarily thinking about outside of class! I literally had dreams (not even nightmares) about this shit!",
    "A generally enjoyable course. What frustrated me was that much of the math we did was complicated but not rigorous. A lot of the work for the first half of the course relied on visualizing and \"seeing\" things, and I would have rather taken a more formal approach. The theory behind Coxeter groups was very interesting, and this is what the course ultimately built up to. (\"Finite Effective Reflection Groups\" would be a more accurate, albeit cumbersome name for the course). Those without exposure to group theory will likely find this course difficult and possibly frustrating, but those with abstract algebra under their belt won't break a sweat. With this being said, I'm not really sure who constitutes the ideal audience for this class.",
    "An fairly easy application of group theory that, in its present form, is a lot of classification and computation. The results at the end of the course are interesting though and I am glad I took it. Material- Classification of the finite subgroups of the orthogonal group in 3D and the finite reflection groups in nD. Very brief intro to group theory for those that have not had it. Honestly, the class was a bit slow for those that have taken 350 I am still undecided about whether I should have just self-studied Grades- Easy PSets and all questions for both the midterm and final are released 1-2 weeks before the exam. The only difficulty is finishing them all before the test, but it is totally doable. Fun and Easy (especially if you have taken 350) Professor- Auel is great. Second class with him and I still think he is one of the better teachers in the math department. I think he has some space to improve in teaching this course, but he fundamentally cares, gets back to e-mails quickly, and generally does office hours quite well.",
    "I was a physics student who was looking to get better at math. Math 235 fulfilled this goal. After taking Math 235 you will be more comfortable with algebra and group theory. If your math background is not as strong (i.e. you haven't taken Math 350) you will struggle at the beginning, but the course is front-loaded and gets easier.",
    "Reflection groups is a great class that allows students to practice what they've learned in linear algebra while being gently introduced to abstract algebra. Reflection groups is a beautiful subject, Professor Auel is great, and I wholeheartedly recommend the class to everyone!",
    "This was my favorite math course I have ever taken. The class was fantastic at introducing obscure topics in tangible and meaningful ways. Also, the format of the midterm and final (how preparation and tests were handled) is absolutely the ideal learning strategy for me. Professor Auel gave us 32 questions to prepare whose content spans the curriculum of the class, and the final consisted of 6 of them randomly selected from the group (we each chose 4 to do). The midterm was handled similarly. In general, to be able to guarantee getting an A while still learning the material (not just by rote) is objectively the Utopia of education. Unfortunately, it led to a huge amount of work for test preparation. My hope is that he will cut back on the number of preparatory problems for the midterm and final. This does not in any way diminish my recommendation of the class. If you are at all interested, do not be discouraged by the workload. It is very doable and worthwhile. Professor Auel is simply the greatest professor I have had at Yale. I learn so much from him, and he is wholly engaging and perceptive. Even when certain students argue with him practically continuously throughout every class, he manages to listen and respond totally in character. Never was there a more competent educator.",
    "The course was really good, I feel like I learned a lot from it. I learned how to think in a completely different way about math. Asher Auel is an absolutely amazing professor and he's very dedicated. His explanations are clear, he's a good lecturer and he's an approachable person (so people feel comfortable asking questions). He gives a lot of work though, and I mean A LOT. There are only two problems with the course in my opinion: 1. the textbook sucks, it's really really bad (compiling Auel's notes into a textbook would be more helpful than the textbook we used), and 2. 32 questions to solve before each exam is an absolute exaggeration. I feel like there were too many questions for the exam pool. Right before the midterm, it was alright, but extra 21 questions that we've never seen before in the final was bad, because it's not like we had spring break or anything to solve them, we actually had reading period only, when we also have to study for every single other final and submit a bunch of papers. Nonetheless, it's a very good course and I would totally recommend it to any student if they are looking for a math course to take.",
    "Great class, but make sure you can attend office hours because it's hard, but interesting, material.",
    "This is by far, without a doubt, the hardest class I have ever taken at Yale, and the class that gave the most amount of work in my life. If you are even considering taking this class, you are probably a math or physics major who needs some understanding of group theory, and you have to decide between MATH 235 and MATH 350 (abstract algebra). I have not taken abstract algebra, but I can only imagine that it is even more difficult than this. The material is dreadfully boring and nothing you will ever need or use outside of studying Coxeter groups for their own sake or advanced theoretical physics. I can honestly say that by the end of this course, I simply did not care about what we learned in lecture or arrived at in problem sets. I only wanted to get through it. The only cool thing we learned in this class was the Coxeter plane for E8, and this literally took an entire semester to understand and probably was not worth it in the end. Prof. Auel is smart and nice, but he straddles the line between enthusiastic and sadistic when assigning homework. His homeworks were enormous and required going to office hours to even be able to attempt to solve. He gave us absurd amounts of possible problems for the midterm and final that ruined my spring break and made my reading period and finals time even more difficult. While finishing all of the problems was not required, because there were people in this class that had already taken abstract algebra, doing all of the problems was required to be able to compete with people who would blow the curve. This class is pretty miserable, but don't let it alter your career or academic goals. It is just one class. I now understand all of my pre-med friends who suffered through organic chemistry, a class they hated, did not understand, and knew they would never use but took simply because they had to. At least this is only one semester. Find a good group of friends to work on the homework with (this is crucial), and good luck.",
    "If you like math, if you like geometry mixed with group theory, with some applications and some things that are as obscure as 8-dimensional platonic solids, this is the class for you.",
    "This class gives you the opportunity to completely solve one very large problem over the course of one semester. Its probably the most interesting math class I've ever taken, and I'd definitely recommend it especially with Asher Auel teaching it.",
    "Make sure to 3D print your polyhedra and get really lucky when pulling cards out of a deck. This was probably one of my more interesting courses of the semester. You'll get an introduction to groups and abstract algebra. The unique aspects of this class like pulling cards out of a deck for your midterm and final and having a close knit group to work with will made it a pleasure to take."
