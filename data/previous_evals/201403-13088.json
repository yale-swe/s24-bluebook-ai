   "comments": [
    "This is a really good introductory course for students who don't have previous experience in academic writing. There are interesting, challenging readings in every class that showed different aspects how we should write our papers. I could feel my writing improving as the class progressed. However, there was a lot of work; four papers are a lot. (2 drafts for each paper and a big 8-11 page research paper). It's all worth it though!",
    "Good class but a lot of work and rewriting. Be ready to rewrite your whole draft.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 if you want to have a good intro class on academic writing. Take it with Professor Jump.",
    "Professor Jump is an extremely cool guy, and his insights during discussions are amazing to listen to. Unfortunately, if you're in a class where only a few people contribute, it can get kind of boring. The workload is very lenient consisting of four moderately challenging essays and regular easy readings. I found the readings sort of dry and unrelated to the topic, but the discussions are still pretty cool. I'd say shop it and see how you like it.",
    "Engl 114 10 is a writing class based on philosophical inquiries into what makes up action. while that sounds quite strange it really is reading a series of writers concerned with action and activism and looking into how they relate to each other. this definitely changes my reading of writing along with analyzing how these writers write to add to our own writing. Taking an English 114 is great to improve one's essay writing capabilities and this class is a more philosophical approach."
