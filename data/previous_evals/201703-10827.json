    "This course strengthened my reading and writing abilities much more than I thought. I had the chance to review several easier grammar structures while also adopting more complex ones.",
    "A greater expansion of my Japanese vocabulary and grammar, as well as a deeper understanding of Japanese culture, including certain nuances that are apparent due to increased language ability.",
    "Building self-sufficiency in reading and understanding various materials in Japanese and discussing them with others. Many misunderstandings regarding the readings that arose were due to analysis of sub-text, authorial intent, etc. rather than misunderstandings of the Japanese used."

   "comments": [
    "This course definitely emphasizes reading and writing, which at times can be a lot of work. How much your discussion and actual speaking abilities improve is really up to you and your peers. If not many people speak up in the class it can be more difficult for the instructor, so try and participate!",
    "There is a lot of practice (homework due every class) and challenging readings as well as videos to keep engagement with the material high. There is exposure to all different kinds of media so one can learn the language in a multitude of contexts. One weakness was that I felt like speaking practice was lower than I would like, especially conversationally. There was a lot of question and response, but I feel like it would be beneficial to have more conversations (an out of class section meeting once a week).",
    "More transparent grading (i.e. keeping grades updated on canvas like the L1\/L2 courses) would be very helpful in gauging performance in the class. Format of class time was very good."

   "comments": [
    "You have to love Japanese but I would definitely recommend. Saito and Stever Sensei are absolutely fantastic and can answer any question you could possibly think of. They are also both very engaging and fun to be in class with!",
    "Definitely recommend for those who want to advance their Japanese language skills. Stever sensei and Saito sensei are wonderful and really work to keep the class engaged.",
    "Study for the kanji quizzes! They're worth much more of the grade than they seem. Be prepared to take the time to do the reading and the worksheets thoroughly.",
    "If a student is interested in learning Japanese at a high level, I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are interesting, and the professors' enthusiasm really motivates you to do your best."
