    "fun, very independent, rolls are expensive. 12 shots a roll, you need at least 40 rolls which will come out to about $160. but you need even more if you want to do something really awesome. the color part of the class if a pain. you pay double to get it processed. don't do this class for color, do digital instead.",
    "Continuation of intro where you use intermediate cameras. Take it! Definitely more work and harder than intro, but completely worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class. Recognize that it takes a lot of work -- film takes a lot of time and a decent amount of money, but it's so worth.",
    "I would recommend this. If you're thinking about the class then you've taken intro and you have some kind of interest. It's a class that allows you to pursue that interest and build on it. Your experience depends on what you want to get out of it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. You will get as much out of it as you put in. If you want to truly improve you do have to put the time into it, but it's very worth it. Lisa provides a certain amount of guidance but I also felt like I had a lot of freedom."
