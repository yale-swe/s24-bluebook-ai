    "course structure and content seemed to be determined primarily by the instructor's interests rather than a set of skills, topics, concepts that make up a foundation of knowledge in local land use planning.",
    "this class was just not that good. i want to give kooris some latitude, considering this was his first time teaching. but really, the class sessions just felt like a waste of time. we spent far too long discussing the arbitrary issues related to news stories each and every class member brought in. instead of feeling like rich learning time, this functioned mostly as a stretch of intermittent attention for the whole class, as if kooris was just trying to get through the 3 hours of class. his lectures were rushed, self-referential, largely a rundown of his opinions on whatever topic was being discussed that day. there was little sense of continuity, of accumulation of material, or that any of our readings were much related to what was discussed. this class needs a serious overhaul, because it is SO important that FES offers it. unfortunately, it suffers from the same lack of teaching standards that many other courses here suffer from.",
    "I do not believe the instructor prepared for class. In the event that he had prepared lecture slides, and allowed himself time to present them, which was not always the case, he frequently could not answer questions related to the content of the slides.Course teachings involved no conceptual framework, no tools, no theory, no methods, and very little content beyond the instructor's personal experience in the field, which was not only limited by his experience itself (having a relatively short career as he does), but also confined by the single geographic region of metropolitan New York (where he has spent his professional life). The myopic focus on New York was one area where students had provided input and requested a broadening of regional and international focus, but requests did not influence subsequent lessons. Class mostly consisted of the instructor sharing his opinion on matters, sometimes related to regional and local planning, and sometimes not related to the subject matter at all -- and often his opinions were misinformed.He had a casual attitude about managing class time. Often class would not start for ~15-30 minutes, break for ~15-30 minutes in the middle, and run over for ~15-30 minutes. It often felt like he was happy to waste time casually chatting about current events, rather than keeping to a lesson schedule or meeting goals of material to be covered. Again, the take-away after every class was that he had not prepared for it, had no objectives for the class in terms of a knowledge trajectory.In sum, I do not think this instructor is of FES or Yale caliber. I do not think he put time into the job, I do not think teaching interests him, I do not think he has a proclivity for it, and I do not think he had any meaningful objectives for the semester.I strongly recommend that FES not hire David Kooris again in a direct teaching position. His contribution might better fit as a guest lecturer.",
    "There was minimal material or curriculum prepared for the class. David is extremely knowledgeable about regional planning issues, but I don't think the class was able to take advantage of this because the class discussions were so haphazard.",
    "13. This was my first land use and planning course and was therefore extremely valuable. To be exposed to these concepts by an experienced practitioner was also an added value. My only suggestion is to add a little more theory and content in place of some of the discussions, and also to move those discussions to the latter half of the course to give more time for questions on the technical content. Also, a more technical assignment or two that would be comparable to a planning curriculum might also aid learning.",
    "I thought that this class has promise but needs some adjustments.Namely, the news-sharing component of each class was a waste of time. This just doesn't need to happen. I understand there is some value in this exercise as a discussion-generating one, but it ended up just turning into students playing on laptops while the professor opined on each article without asking students to think about or comment on their peers' articles. Either make this exercise mean something by generating actual discussion as a result, or just eliminate it entirely. Students can read newspapers and do book reports on their on time--not in class."

    "The field trip to Stamford was incredibly helpful in understanding the power and the weaknesses of planning.",
    "field trip and a few lectures were great. i appreciated that we had lots of time for discussion but see next question.",
    "David Kooris is knowledgable, articulate and inspiring.",
    "the group of students who were in it. this class was full of bright, imaginative, energetic people. that was squandered. most of class was us sitting there while the instructor talked at us.",
    "David's passion, the field trip, the final paper",
    "When we got more into the climate section, the sustainable communities section, and land use solutions and grants currently being used to create smart growth -- this was the more interesting and best part of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the field trip, but think it could have been more educational had there been models and dynamics of development first studied, then illustrated directly through the sites observed. No attention given to environmental justice issues despite the displacement of an entire low income neighborhood for the featured development project.",
    "learning about the perspective of a practitioner",
    "The field trip was very useful to highlight the techniques the professor identified for healthy cities. It would have been more helpful to have one or two more, particularly in New Haven since the class was 3 hours on a Thursday night, a little more interaction would have been helpful.Professor Kooris definitely has extensive experience in the urban planning field and his anecdotes and experiences were very interesting learning experiences.",
    "Professor Kooris' own experiences and his interest in student's own articles and opinions was remarkable.",
    "The range of topics and the technical details were fantastic, as was the application of them in the walking tour of Stamford.",
    "The professor truly had some amazing insight into the planned history of NYC and parts of CT. Unfortunately, this information was just thrown at students with little opportunity or prompts for feedback or critical thought.The professor's expertise is appreciated and valued as a strength of the course--but there was too much top-down pontificating.The readings were generally good, if a little redundant.The field trip was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "Overall course structure was lacking. Lack of reading assignments meant very little individual learning outside of class. Last minute changes to the syllabus meant I was never sure what subject matter we would be covering that day. Spent far too much class time discussing trending articles, and not enough on organized lecture. The course would have benefited from additional assignments or guided class discussion that incorporated readings.",
    "we spent too much time reviewing articles we'd each read. also room layout was not conducive to really engaged discussion and readings were not really incorporated into discussion so i doubt many people read them",
    "I would have liked more organized lectures, especially toward the second half of the class. I think the article portion of the class is great but should be limited to no more than an hour of class. Also, the lectures on climate change were more focused on projects David has done himself. I would have really enjoyed a more general \"this is land use planning for climate change\" lecture.",
    "time management.",
    "the structure of how time is spent in class. Entirely too much time is spent on the articles. Though it is interesting to hear about what everyone else read we can do that on our own time. I wanted to tap into David's knowledge and experience at a greater depth.",
    "The article sharing section was too long and should have been done with guided reading assigned to groups, maybe following a particular topic of interest throughout the semester.",
    "All aspects. Its obviously a rich and relevant field of study, with vast implications for environmental footprints esp. in the developing world, but it's difficult to imagine this instructor is the one to teach it.",
    "organization of lectures",
    "Sticking to a curriculum in order to make the most out of our time there.",
    "Some classes we spent the entire three hours going over current events articles. It would have been more helpful to have more interesting weekly topical readings that the class could have developed a more in depth discussion on. Our conversations about current events often just scratched the surface of important issues.",
    "More structure! Maybe even more assignments during the semester?",
    "The discussions were interesting but I felt like they took too much time away from the more technical and useful aspects of class in the lectures. I would suggest at minimum putting the lectures first and the discussions last.",
    "Format, structure of class time, and materials presented.While this class screams \"powerpoint!\" it wasn't totally necessary and ended up being more of an afterthought by the time students were done with book reports\/show-and-tell every week."

Nor did she offer any organizational assistance, i.e., helping to keep class on schedule, helping to make arrangements for the field trip, (she failed the first time, and had to be prompted the second time, to reserve a van for the field trip), helping to post reading assignments in time for class to read them, helping to relay student feedback to the instructor to help class improve over the semester, etc. TA did not attend the field trip herself.",
    "Instructor: Nikki Johnson Springer \u00a0While Nikki made some contributions to the course during discussions, there weren't many other occasions where we were able to learn from her experience. Perhaps using one of the course slots for a lecture in the future might be interesting."
