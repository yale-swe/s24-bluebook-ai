   "comments": [
    "Topics were very interesting and I actually liked having different speakers come in and discuss their specialties.",
    "I didn't like this PID section as much as PID I I think because the first course was more discussion based and the students seemed more engaged with Dr. Pettigrew. I think it would help if more questions about the materials were posed that allowed students to participate more. I always wish the readings were better incorporated into the lectures.",
    "The strengths of this course were that there were many guest speakers and that we learned a lot about a great deal of subjects and diseases. I also liked how the midterm and final were very big picture and made you look for common connections between all the diseases\/info we learned about and how it relates to public health. I also liked how the homework assignments were very open ended and allowed for our own outside research and a lot of creativity. The only thing I would improve is to make the lectures a little bit more interactive and ask questions of students throughout the lecture to 1. make sure we are paying attention and understating the info and 2. to challenge us to think critically about the subject. Melinda did a really good job of doing this in her lecture.",
    "Good course to review the basics of infectious disease.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and learned a great deal.",
    "Solid overview of infectious diseases. I wish that the cross-cutting themes were explicitly (and repeatedly) mentioned throughout the semester, rather than being implied in individual lectures.",
    "Guest lectures are awesome an so are the lectures done by Jamie. All the lecturers are clearly so passionate and knowledgable about the material-- it is a privilege to learn from them! Especially loved the evolution lectures by Paul Turner and Steve Stearns.",
    "Loved this course! I thought the exams were fair and to the point, as were the homework assignments. In particular, I loved that this was more of a lecture-style course; I learned the a lot more through this format compared to traditional didactic settings.",
    "I loved PID and the diversity of subjects we covered. I love the chance to have lecture with many different faculty members and have a discussion about their expert topics.",
    "Second semester PID was rather well structured, covering mostly zoonotic diseases, but after that we covered mostly things that I might consider \"special topics\" which seemed like filler material for the course. The topics we addressed had varying public health significance, often it was unclear what the public health issues were at stake. This course would benefit from less lecturing on the molecular or clinical details of disease and more time on class discussions. We were lectured at too much. The best classes were the the case study of Ebola which could have been multiple classes, the cryptococcus lecture where the speaker finished her slides earlier and we specifically discussed implications of her findings, the microbiome class where we talked about novel research.",
    "We didn't hear as much from Jamie as I was expecting. He brought in a lot of guest lecturers, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing (it was good to hear from other researchers at Yale). The class covers a lot of different information and I really liked the emphasis on the big picture. It was helpful to really dig into why we need to know the little details to make an impact on a population level.",
    "The course was great and we touched on several items relating to several diseases and external factors. I wish we would have had more hands on experience with learning as in the case studies"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He's very cool. Clearly he's had a very interesting life in public health and it's nice to hear his perspective.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great - he's a genius, knows the material, can answer any questions. His review session in the middle of course really helped me see how much I had learned up to that point. However I wish his lectures were less just a lecture and encouraged more class participation.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0having a little more structure to slides and presentations might allow for information to be presented more clearly. I appreciated his midterm and final review sessions. Jamie is very clear with what he expects you to know for the exams and what the important take away points are for each lecture. He is a very approachable professor.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great and very passionate about the subject. This is clear in the way he lectures and by the guest lecturers he brings in.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0James is a knowledgeable teacher, but I think he is not so good at delivering core concepts\/information. Many of the classes ended up with him reading the materials on the slides, which was not so interesting. However, guest lectures and discussion sections are great.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is awesome! He really injects his enthusiasm for the issues into the course and gets all the students excited. I'm pretty sure we all hope to have stories as awesome as his some day...",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Great! I love how enthusiastic Jamie is about the material. He's a constant reminder that you are forever a student in this world.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is a great professor. He has an engaging teaching style and is very approachable. I liked the flow of the class and the real life experiences Jamie shared to contextualize the topics we learned.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is incredibly passionate about the material and has excellent insight into these issues as someone who has tremendous applied work experience. I would like to see him spend less time on the biology of the diseases, fascinating as they are, and more time on public health issues pertaining to the disease.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is the best, so invested in his students and so passionate about his subject. I really enjoyed learning from him.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He did an excellent job with teaching the material and supplementing our learning with outside lecturers. His passion for the subject matter really came through."

   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend",
    "I would recommend PID to any student interested in learning about a variety of infectious pathogens in a very broad sense. This course is what you make of it - it's up to you to do outside readings and there are very few assignments, so you need to want to learn it.",
    "Great course! It isn't too much work but you really learn a lot and get to learn from a lot of different professors and experts in the field.",
    "This is a required EMD course, so most people will have to take it. However, it is enjoyable and the information is extremely useful for infectious diseases.",
    "You will hear about a bunch of different pathogens. There will be underlying themes that connect them (for example, immune system evasion). Unless the way this is taught changes, these themes will not be revealed to you until midterm\/final review session, which is unfortunate. It also means that review sessions are critical to understanding the point of the class.",
    "Very fun and you will learn a ton about all kinds of diseases!",
    "Great mid level introduction to Principles of Infectious Disease. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a better understanding of the dynamics and extent of infectious disease today.",
    "Second semester PID isn't as intriguing as the first semester; the topics are hit-or-miss when it comes to interesting. All-in-all an okay class.",
    "Awesome course, even if you aren't in EMD. But if you are (most are) then it's a great overview of infectious diseases and why they are still so important to study."
