    "Fun course. Not much work. Go to class, please. The material is very interesting, and Professor Greenwood and Caroline Stark make it worthwhile. I hope they change the syllabus up a bit, but as it stands it's still a cool course. It could be awesome, though, if a few more complete texts were added to the syllabus and if we spent less time talking about non-classical works of art.",
    "If you like the classics and humanities, go for it. Otherwise it can be very abstract and ungrounded compared to many other disciplines.",
    "Unsure. Definitely keep in mind that it is co-taught, which I did not find to be as wonderful an experience as the classes I've taken that were taught by only one professor.",
    "Take it if Professor Greenwood is teaching it alone. It's not much work on the plus side!",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in learning about a range of interesting and academically stimulating topics."
