    "So much - I learned a lot about writing and how I can make my own writing better. I also learned general tips and perspectives, as well as became aware of some other really great nonfiction out there in the world.",
    "This course really helped me develop my writing skills. Practicing my writing every week was tough. But worth the practice, and hard work. I also learned the following skills: One thought per sentence. Align sentences to one side of the page. Write short sentences. Use contractions.",
    "This class taught me how to write from the ground up. It made me reevaluate everything I'd ever learned about writing, and reshape my relationship to my writing. It also taught me how to read others' pieces, which in turn helped me become a better editor of my own pieces.",
    "Clarity, Specificity, Lyricism, and Rhythm. Verlyn will make you think about each word you put on the pagewhat it means, how it sounds, if it fits.",
    "Confidence in my writing, voice and trajectory in my career Writing clearly and efficiently How to pick and read good writing",
    "I learned how to be more attentive to my own writing and to whatever I am reading. What's working? What's not? And why? And crucially, I learned to recognize the often simple ways sentences can be drastically improved.",
    "great opportunity to learn writing with very honest feedback"

    "Aligned really well. I went in hoping to be a better writer and came out knowing that I am indeed a better writer.",
    "They fell a little below expectations. I was hoping to hear more from the professor on how to improve my writing, less from undergrads. I wish less undergrads were in the course.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. I thought I would learn a few new things, but instead I was able to build a completely new and better understanding about writing.",
    "This class exceeded all expectations. It changed the way I write, think, and observe. Watching and feeling that happen was exciting and inspiring. This class was a joy!",

    "Perfectly.",
    "exceeded them"

   "question_id": "FS1004",

   "comments": [
    "Lots of strengths - really liked that we could write on anything we wanted, that it had to be pretty short, and that we workshopped sentences and pieces each week as a group. I think if we had maybe more guidance or there was some theme for the readings that we were doing each week, that might have been helpful.",
    "Writing every week was wonderful.",
    "The seminar made me fall in love with writing again and work harder at it than I had in any other class. Verlyn doesn't just comment on your essays. He gives line by line edits for each and every piece. I never had a professor give such thorough and thoughtful feedback. NO WEAKNESSES!",
    "This course was a practice in ritual. To practice writing on a regular basis and watch improvement over that time. It was a real joy to come each week ready to work. I see no room for improvement.",
    "Strengths: Routine structure week-to-week, 500 words\/week is a good challenge, small class size. Weaknesses: Assignments are due Saturday at noon.",
    "Not many areas of weakness, chance to get personalized feedback and improve writing a lot"

    "You will get great practice at writing. If you learn one or two things, that's good enough. Don't expect any course to really change your life.",
    "Participate, take risks, push yourself it's worth it! And go to office hours as much as you can.",
    "TAKE IT! Can't recommend this class enough.",
    "Set up good habits in the beginning of the course to write often and regularly.",
    "Take it.",
    "Make sure you can give it the time you want to give it",
    "take it if you want to really get better at writing"
