    "TAKE IT! One of my favorite classes at Yale. You truly see the results of your work. It's a LOT of work, and you should be prepared to devote at least a couple hours nightly. But the amount of Spanish you learn is incredible, and the structure of the course (with online exercises throughout and so many activities to reinforce learning) really helps so that you're not totally on your own. The best part, of course, is Professor Sab, who is constantly enthusiastic, caring, and ready to help. Her happiness and kindness - combined with her rigor - really made this course special. Consider taking it Credit\/D to take some stress off, because it's a lot of constant work at a highly engaged level, but incredibly worth it - if you really want to learn, you enjoy it so much in this class that it doesn't feel like a chore. The class time would always fly by. There is no better way to learn Spanish at Yale.",
    "A heavy workload, but incredibly rewarding.",
    "Great class. This is the third language I've taken at Yale, and I would say the best of my language classes as well. There's no denying that 2 hours (more like an hour and 35 minutes, since we opted for leaving early instead of getting a break midway) every morning can be a real struggle, but I think the class--largely because of the teacher--was fun, and so the time would go by quickly. The role-playing exercises were the best for getting us to practice Spanish while having fun, and I wasn't expecting to learn so much about the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries. You don't realize that you're learning so much, with Lourdes.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you arre willing to take a full years worth of spanish in one semester. Great to get distributional requirements quicker but you must realize it is alot of work. Online homework daily and you should allocate time to practice speaking and the grammar structures. Very rewarding if you are willing to put in the effort.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 125 to any student who wanted to prioritize learning Spanish, particularly in a rigorous and demanding way from a wonderful instructor.",
    "The class is a lot of work (like, a lot a lot), but it's enjoyable and well worth it. Overall, a great language learning experience.",
    "Yes! A great and fun introduction to the spanish language. The 2-hr time block was no issue at all because Professor Sab made sure that class activities were varied and enjoyable.",
    "Very well-taught. Great pace for an intensive language course. I learned a lot about hispanic cultures in addition to the language. Professor is amazing",
    "Take it, but you gotta really work at it, and you have to accept that most of your time will be spent on Spanish. It is intense, and there are some days that you don't want to get out of bed to go sit in a classroom from 9:25 till 11:15, but you should go anyway. You will look forward to the weekends so that you'll catch a break in Spanish, not to party. But if you're playing catch-up in Spanish, or have had experience with another Romance language before, or just want your semester to be about Spanish, take this class. It is effective, and I did like it in the end."
