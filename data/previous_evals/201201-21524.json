    "An awesome continuation of skills introduced in French 130.",
    "French 140 is usually taken because of a necessity. I would strongly recommend Madame Burton, but wouldn't recommend it for students who finished L1-L3 and don't absolutely need or absolutely want to take another french course. It's advanced french, for sure.",
    "I would assume that most people that are taking French 140 have to take it because of a requirement, but GET EXCITED about it. It's going to be a fun ride and you are going to learn amazing skills in French, and you are going to come out of it feeling confident if your ability in French, wanting to speak it at any point that you are not in the class.",
    "It's just your typical intermediate\/advanced French course. Very straightforward.",
    "Great class to wrap up your language requirement or improve your french",
    "French 140 is a lot of work but it's worth it. The only thing I didn't like doing was the expos\u00e9.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you like French. The texts you read are interesting and there is less focus on grammar than in the previous levels.",
    "It's a good course - better than French 130 overall in my opinion.",
    "Anyone who has a passion for the French language should definitely go as far as L4 at least. I genuinely feel as if we appreciated the language in a way we never did in L3, and to stop there would be a massive waste.",
    "This class is very similar to L3 in both style and content, but more advanced. You watch movies and read books. The tests are fair, but the daily homework can be a drag. Mme Burton is an excellent professor and a great person."
