    "I definitely learned a lot about Macbeth!",
    "Working with Deb gives students the opportunity to engage in collective, company-based theatre making, which is an experience many of us have never had. I was able to expand my theatre knowledge and tool box in this class and developed a greater appreciation for this type of theatre making.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about working with Shakespearean texts from both an academic and production standpoint.",
    "How to work through a difficult text as a company",
    "Building a show with an ensemble, how to get really deep into a play, more love of Shakespeare!"

   "comments": [
    "This class exemplified the ideal way of studying Shakespeare as we studied the text in great depth and then went on to apply our discussions to performance.",
    "Deb is absolutely wonderful. If nothing else it would be worth it to take a class with her.",
    "The course was far too discussion based, there were far too many voices in the room and this often stopped us from reaching artistic decisions in a timely manner, and slowed down all of the pertinent processes. I think rehearsals in class should've started way earlier to make each class session as productive as possible.",
    "Really satisfying to end the semester with such a great production Readings could have been better incorporated into class sessions"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class was so fun and Deb Margolin is an amazing Professor. She really is not afraid to explore any artistic work and I love that I got to understand Macbeth on a much deeper level.",
    "Take a class like this. It's an enormous time commitment, but incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in Shakespeare or performance.",
    "I really enjoyed performing in a show this semester via a Theater Studies class. I think it allowed us all to gain a deeper appreciation for both the play and the other members of the company. Also, having been involved student run theater of all kinds, it was fantastic to be in a production with an adult in the room at all times ;)",
    "It depends on the experience you're looking for with a Shakespeare class. If you're looking for a production based experience then this is a great option!"
