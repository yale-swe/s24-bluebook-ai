    "This was a fascinating course! I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "YES. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone and everyone. The workload was average but never felt burdensome. In fact I really enjoyed the blog posts and even the papers. Every paper I wrote in this class I could see myself making improvements which was really cool to be able to notice a change.",
    "If you like the topic, then you'll enjoy the papers and work for the course. But make sure you also like the way a class is taught because if you disagree with the professor's ideas, you might be inclined to dislike the discussions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend!",
    "Unless the professor is changed, no I would not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who loves talking about books and how they apply to the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 115 05:)",
    "I would recommend English 115 to any student who enjoys reading as much as writing. In English 115 you get to work on your writing skills, but you also get to read some really great novels along the way.",
    "In this class (in my section of it) , we read a selection of literature along with essays of literary criticism. We then discuss the readings and the ideas on literature. I would recommend this class mainly as the discussions are very interesting and engaging. On the other hand, if you are not one for writing literary analysis, this may not be the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lass to a fellow student. It was interesting and definitely worth the time and effort. If a person is at all interested in literature in general, I would highly suggest taking this course:",
    "Cool readings, lots of fun, I would definitely recommend it to someone else.",
    "English 115 is a phenomenal literature seminar that allows students to progress their writing and analytical skills while focusing on an important and interesting theme or topic. It helps students become confident and capable in college essay writing and brings forth fascinating discussions. Ryan's class focused on what qualifies as good literature, and what good literature means. Ryan is an incredible teacher! He facilitates exciting conversations and encourages students to take risks and explore difficult but interesting topics."
