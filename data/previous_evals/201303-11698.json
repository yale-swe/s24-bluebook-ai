   "comments": [
    "This is a great class for those interested in learning about contemporary China, but come in without much knowledge of it. With the atmosphere of all freshmen, a great bond was formed in our class, both within the students and with the professor as well. Professor Davis is absolutely fantastic, a leading US sociologist on modern China. She really goes out of her way to help students and to guide them along the readings. I would definitely recommend this class to those who are interested in the subject material.",
    "If you're interested in China or sociology, then you should absolutely take this course. The readings can be a bit long and a bit dry, but Professor Davis is a brilliant and very pleasant woman. Her grading can be a little tough, but she's willing to sit down with you and talk about whatever concerns you might have (or just about anything at all), and tries to be helpful in pointing you in the right direction in terms of the assignments. You'll write 2 papers and work in a group to engage in a debate--neither assignment is overwhelming. I learned a ton about China despite not having any real interest in the country per se prior to taking the class, and I found the experience very valuable.",
    "Sociology 086 is a great course to either learn a lot about China or restructure the way you think about China. By reading material about a wide range of issues in China, you gain an understanding of society that is not usually covered high school or daily media. Even if you are not planning to spend all four years here studying China, it is a great class to take because it provides you with the ability to look at things with a different perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would recommend it. Like I said, it's a chance to really get to know China, something I wanted and received in full.",
    "It was a good overview of issues in contemporary China today. I thought the curriculum was very well structured and covered a broad range of Chinese society. However, I think the individual lectures were not organized well and not delivered effectively. They were much too dry, fact-based and did not carry enough insightful analysis.",
    "Pretty much all discussion\/readings-based. Sometimes Prof. Davis goes off on strange tangents, so the classes range from mind-numbingly boring to extremely interesting.",
    "I would take this class if you have an interest in China, sociology, or East Asia in general. The workload is not that bad, though the readings pile up at times. Also, sometimes the readings are pretty difficult (advance Sociology readings), but those are thrown in only occasionally. They are, on the most part, pretty manageable. Professor Davis is a great professor and is very knowledgable on the subject-she has a lot of interesting stories about China to tell as well. The in-class debates were not my favorite format for assessments, but I do think it can be effective for some. Some knowledge of Chinese history and Chinese would be REALLY helpful for the class, though it is DEFINITELY not a prerequisite.",
    "Class divided between lectures and discussions on readings. Highly recommended, but you must put the time into independently learning background information on Chinese history.",
    "Chinese Society Since Mao is a a great course for someone who is interested in understanding how China has gotten to where it is today and where it may go in the future. Professor Davis incorporates scholarly and video sources to provide an in-depth look at many of the most pressing issues in China's recent history. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "An incredible course that gives a solid overview of contemporary Chinese society. There are a lot of very in-depth, dense readings, but they are interesting and worth the time. There was probably a little too much discussion (I would've preferred to use discussion time for more lecture), although the Freshman Seminar format requires that. DEFINITELY a recommended class.",
    "I would recommend this course. Offers different sociological frameworks for understanding changes that are taking place in arguably the most important nation of our generation.",
    "A freshman seminar in which everyone can feel comfortable sharing his or her opinions. A class which teaches about current issues and trends in China. Seriously recommend it if you are interesting in China",
    "I am so happy I was able to take this Freshman Seminar. It was my first choice mostly because I was interested in US-China Relations beforehand and this gave me the perfect glance into contemporary Chinese society. The course achieved both breadth and depth. After writing the last essay which asked us to draw upon everything we had learned throughout the semester, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much we had learned. It was amazing! Professor Davis is great and very enthusiastic. Just make sure to do the reading and invest yourself in the class discussions, you'll get a lot out of it!"
