    "Good survey class of Nigeria; very cool material and the class style allows for interesting discussion; workload is manageable if you can keep up with the many readings",
    "It is a really good class.It is definitely not a gut class and you have to put in the work. However, if you do, it will definitely be worth your time. Your grade consists of class participation, attendance, a power point presentation, significant weekly reading responses, and two papers. I really enjoyed it!",
    "Take it :)",
    "Great course to learn about and discuss Nigerian history and current events, with a great and funny teacher",
    "Alright class, mostly tok it for the SO credit. Teaching's kinda meh, it feels like he just looks stuff up on Google\/Wikipedia and throughs it on a powerpoint. Pretty chill overall",
    "Great class, a must take."
