    "I learned to see a research project of my own from start to finish, all the way from coming up with a research question to writing up the results. I also improved my scientific writing skills and learned how to present my work effectively to my colleagues.",
    "So proud and satisfied to have been able to conduct my own research as a undergrad, from the earliest conceptualization of a research question to the execution and writing up of the study. Love it.",
    "This course was an excellent opportunity to better my research skills and scientific writing.",
    "Over the course of the past year, I improved my ability to read and write academic papers, learned how to use Qualtrics and Excel, improved my time management skills, improved my statistical skills, and learned a lot about social development and the origins of culture in humanity.",
    "I learned how to develop a research project, how to troubleshoot, how to conduct research, etc.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge on not only how to perform empirical analysis, but also how to analysis it statistically and present it in the form of a paper.",
    "Research, asking questions, writing scientifically, thinking critically, evaluating own writing\/thoughts\/research",
    "Numerous technical skills and anatomical knowledge. How to write an empirical paper."

   "comments": [
    "I think it was very valuable to conduct my own research, run analyses, and write up the results. I think the senior essay could be improved by requiring all advisors to provide helpful and timely feedback. I had a great experience with my advisor, but some of my friends did not receive feedback until right before the deadline, which is not conducive to creating a quality essay. As undergrads, we will need consistent guidance to conduct research effectively.",
    "This class is great for gaining practice in empirical research.",
    "I loved working with the Fab Lab!",
    "Strengths: How much you develop as a scientific writer, how it brings together everything you've learned from the major Weaknesses: I had a great advisor(s), but it would have been nice to have an aspect of the course where other students working on their thesis could have peer-editing sessions, or even casual get-togethers to work on it",
    "I think that the Psychology department, in general, could really benefit from providing their instructors and advisors with more structure for thesis development with their students. It is nice to have a lot of creative freedom and agency, but not at the cost of logistical barriers. I think there should certainly be a collaboration between the department and the IRB to make sure that theses are approved with sufficient time to conduct good research."

    "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to better their research skills.",
    "Yes!! :)",
    "Yes! If you want to get your B.S. and you have a research question in mind--go for it. You don't even need to have a clear-cut research question--just have an area of psychology that you're actually interested in studying and that can carry you through.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was great experience for future research endeavors in graduate school."
