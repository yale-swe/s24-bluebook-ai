   "comments": [
    "I developed the ability to read with greater depth and breadth, drawing on a variety of resources to arrive at one facet of an issue, and then proceed to explore and challenge the issue from all of its facets. In a course such as this, it is tempting to abstract everything into one cohesive theory of criticism-- which is inconceivable!-- and thankfully, the nature of the course did not allow me to sit in any one stable corner of thought for long. I appreciated the versatility of my thinking by the end of the course, as well as the truly applicable knowledge I now have on literary criticism.",
    "I particularly enjoyed reading widely across the works of poets in the early 20th century. The secondary material was well-chosen and helpful towards gaining an understanding of what \"historical poetics\" might mean and how these authors were engaging with cultivating the \"poetics\" of their historical period.",
    "I think this class helped me get more comfortable talking about poetry, especially in terms of meter, rhythm, and other poetic concepts."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved the structure of the course-- it was a cumulative course that allowed for strong individual emphases on poets, critics, and concepts. Each discussion was lively and well-framed, and I can think of no real improvements to be made.",
    "Really enjoyed this course. Good use of presentations, Beinecke materials, good selection of primary and secondary readings. Engaged class discussions. No complaints.",
    "I appreciated the initial emphasis on recent work in historical poetics, but this sort of fell away as the semester went on. Where we doing historical poetics in the class? Would this matter? It seemed to be apparent in the organization of the class but I would have appreciated more explicit emphasis on this aspect. In other ways I very much enjoyed the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course! It has proven vital to my developing studies of modernism, mediation, context, and perception, and I thoroughly enjoyed each discussion. The readings were relevant and widely applicable to my other courses of study, and I feel I am a more well-rounded scholar for having taken this class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. The combination of critical texts with primary materials makes this class appealing to students with a wide range of literary interests, from historical literary movements to RGSS topics to close-reading of poems.",
    "Yes, the class was great!",
    "I strongly recommend this course."
