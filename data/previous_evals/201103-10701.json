   "comments": [
    "PLSC 500 is a basic introductory statistics course for political science students. It covers probability, hypothesis testing, and OLS regression. Problem sets and exams are very reasonable, and the professor's powerpoint notes are good. Recommended for all poli sci grad students to understand empirical work. Professor Butler is great. His lectures were well-prepared and organized, and he cares about his students learning the concepts.",
    "It is a good class if you do not already have a strong background in statistics. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, again it's a good basic course in statistics.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student who has not taken a maths course for a while.",
    "I would recommend this class. An intro to statistics and quantitative analysis that prepares a student for the mathematical aspect of political science.",
    "PLSC 500 is great for beginners in statistical methods and also a great opportunity for those with a quantitative background to refresh their concepts and skills. It's hard to tell at this point how well it prepares one for PLSC 503 ot PLSC 504, but I must say it provides a cushioned entry into the study of methods in graduate school.",
    "The course gives a very basic introduction to skills and techniques you'll need to understand in greater detail soon."

   "comments": [
    "This course is a necessary introduction to the math behind empirical methods of analysis. Useful for understanding the literature and designing our own research in the future.",
    "It taught me statistical applications that allow to interpret data, a skill that will definitely be useful in my future research",
    "provided me the basics which should be very helpful.",
    "I cannot answer this question until I start doing research.",
    "I have a very limited background in mathematics, so this class was invaluable. Concepts of statistical significance and multivariable regression analysis are much clearer to me now.",
    "It was a good statistics refresher",
    "The course helped throw light on the kinds of empirical questions people ask and what sort of evidence they find relevant and compelling. Though it hasn't helped in conceptualizing research designs, it made for a good starting point to think about quantitative social science.I cannot, however, say that it helped me very much in my dissertation research."
