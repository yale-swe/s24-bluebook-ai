    "You cover quite a bit of material, and it is sometimes difficult trying not to get lost in all of the species evolution.",
    "Not particularly, but definitely not a bad 5th class if you have a vague interest in the material and are good at memorization. An alternate title to this class would be \"weird stains on rocks and what they could tell us about climate change\"",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. This was the best class I've taken at Yale. The material is amazing--you're learning about the history of EVERYTHING, which is incredibly awesome and also incredibly relevant. Derek Briggs is a leader in his field (he basically documented the majority of the Cambrian explosion, and he has a wikipedia page... what) and Celli Hull is so passionate about macroevolution that her excitement is contagious. If you can, take the class with the lab. The lab makes the class a thousand times better--you get to touch real fossils, like trilobites and ammonites and stegosaurus bones (what!!!) and you get to take advantage of everything the Peabody has to offer (which is mind-boggling). It's a whole 3 hours that you have to take out of your schedule, but it is so, so worth it. Long story short, take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like--the History of Life. If you're looking for human civilizations and cultures than you're probably looking for Anthropology or Archaeology, but this class does a really great and comprehensive job of not only going over the history of life, from its origins to the present, but also teaching students how to put all the bits and pieces of what we know about different patches of the story together into a comprehensive and intriguing story. Highly recommend taking it regardless of your major (not saying this just because I'm planning on studying paleo), because it's really important to understand the relatively modest but still exciting where you came from a evolutionary perspective and just how awesome and resilient life on Earth was, is, and can be.",
    "A fascinating topic. Some of the lectures were a bit dry, but others were decent. Definitely take this instead of bio if you're doing a prereq for EVST. Study up for the final because it's 50% of your grade. Midterm is 25% and 6 page paper is 20%. But, no homework. I repeat, NO HOMEWORK. Except for the midterm, final, and paper, this is a pretty low-stress class. All you have to do is show up to lecture.",
    "If you're into paleontology or evolutionary biology, then you'll definitely find this class interesting. G&G 125 provides a decent, although sometimes jumbled, overview of the history of life. There is almost no work outside of the midterm, paper and final. I would not, however, recommend treating this class as a gut. If you don't go to every lecture, you'll be completely lost (there's no standard textbook, and the lecture slides alone aren't very helpful). The midterm and final are both challenging, and studying for these tests can be equally challenging, as it wasn't always clear what should be studied. If you take this class, expect to have no work for 90% of the semester, but a lot of work preparing for the midterm and final.",
    "At some point, this class was a gut. This is no longer the case.",
    "If you are interesting in paleontology and geology, you should take this. However, I probably wouldn't recommend taking it unless you need the credit.",
    "I would recommend E&EB if you have to take a bio prereq and this counts, but I wouldn't recommend it as a \"gut\" science credit. The work is not too hard but the final and midterm were very difficult. I think it is an interestiing topic to know more about but you have to be ready to go into incredible detail.",
    "This class is absolutely terrible, by far the worst I\u2019ve taken in two years here. The material is poorly presented, and it is nearly impossible to glean anything from lectures. If you want to learn something, you\u2019ll have to do it by yourself at home. \u201cThe History of Life\u201d is not really a fitting title. The course did not construct any kind of narrative of the history of life or give students any idea about the big picture. Instead, it spit out facts about various fossils, events, or geological concepts that were too disjointed to provide a meaningful understanding of anything. Because of that, it was very hard to determine what the heck was going on in the course or what students were expected to understand. Also, beware of the impression that this class is appropriate for non-majors. If you take this course just because it sounds like it could be interesting, you will most likely be surrounded by students with much deeper knowledge of geology and much more intense interest in natural history than you could ever have. There isn't a lot of work, so that might be appealing. However, no work means no way to check your understanding. The first chance to see how you are faring is the midterm, and that doesn't come until the day before the deadline to drop a class.",
    "Unless you LOVE rocks, this is not the science credit for you. Go take natural disasters or fossil fuels or something - lectures are very dry, material is difficult to understand and the tests are all about memorization of a TON of minute details. No readings or homework so aside from the exams the workload is negligible, but it will be tough to get an A.",
    "If you're really passionate about geology and have a solid understanding of the stuff, it's definitely worth it to shop the class. If not, I'd steer clear.",
    "Definitely take it instead of BIOL 104 if you can. That said, if you are a biology person or a dinosaur lover, you will probably be disappointed with this course. There is one lecture on dinosaurs and one lecture on humans. Since this is Yale and they want you to be a critical thinker, you will learn a lot about rocks in this class, so you know how we know things about ancient animals. Professor Briggs will talk about invertebrates for the first half of the semester, you won't even know that anything has a spine until all of a sudden you realize that at this point in history dinosaurs existed and you're still talking about worms. Professor Hull likes to talk about plate tectonics and global warming and other physical processes, time you will probably wish she spent talking about smilodons or something.",
    "This class is a good science credit for those who aren't science majors. All you have to do is show up and pay attention to class. But be careful to work really hard on the midterm, essay, and final as they are the only grades and will heavily determine your grade in the class. For a lot of the material you can find out just as much by consulting Wikipedia than by what is taught in class. The tests are naturally difficult because they ask a few detailed questions over an extremely large amount of material that is hard to memorize.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course as a great overview of how life on earth has developed. The lecturers are engaging and the teaching staff is great."
