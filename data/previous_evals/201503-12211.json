    "Are you a history major who isn't sure what they want to study? Take this class! Are you a sophomore who wants to take a really good junior seminar? Take this class! Have you struggled in the past with teachers who don't give good feedback on papers and don't care about you as a person? Take this class! Do you want to improve your research and your academic paper writing? Take this class! Are you a Yalie, curious about the pre-industrial period with little to no experience of Venice and the Mediterranean? Take this class!!!!!!",
    "It is a rigorous course as far a readings go. Not because they are really long, but because you had better know them VERY well before showing up to class, because she expects you to have thoroughly read and remembered them...not to just have skimmed them. It is a great course, and if you're interested in learning about the Mediterranean and Venice, then this is your course. Knowledge of a Mediterranean language will help you do research, but is honestly in no way necessary for the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Such an important place\/time in early modern history, and this seminar gives a wonderful foray into the many different aspects of this fascinating place! Professor Trivellato is more than enough of a reason to take this course also.",
    "A great course outlining the Mediterranean in the early modern period. Professor Trivellato does a great job at fostering discussion and is very helpful with writing the two papers.",
    "This is a challenging (but doable) history seminar. I would recommend primarily for history majors who really want to learn about Venice but also about how to think of the late medieval and early modern period from a modern perspective. There are two papers, but Professor Trivellato is quite helpful through the writing process. Take this class if you are willing to do all the readings and work hard on writing -- it will pay off. Highly recommend!",
    "Gender, ethnicity, religion, migration, governance and historiography. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",
    "A seminar tailored to juniors and seniors, though all should shop it. Really interesting material, and Professor Trivellato is an excellent guide to the primary sources. Definitely seek help from her in writing your papers, and bounce ideas off and outlines off of her.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Potential students should be aware that the class isn't just about Venice, but the entire Mediterranean. Venice is studied for the second half of the semester because there are a lot of primary sources in english translation. Professor trivatello is great: she's very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "If you're a history major, take it. If you're not a history major, take it. I always had faith in the liberal arts, but this class in particular will dispel any doubts on the merits of learning how to think. It pointed me in the right direction as far as what I want to study goes, and includes such a breadth of topics and themes that it's beyond worth taking, no matter your major."
