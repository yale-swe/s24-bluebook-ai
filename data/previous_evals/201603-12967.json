    "I developed a wide base of knowledge of the American Politics literature, and importantly, salient trends in thought over time.",
    "The course provided an excellent overview of the key aspects of American politics.",
    "Basic experience with the more structural sides of the American Political system. And with no prior experience with writing essays on political science issues I think the learning curve was pretty steep. Think I realised how far we are still from a \"complete\" understanding of the political dynamics. In particular it seems to me there is still a big an very interesting gap to explore in the space between behavioural economics, moral psychology and political science.",
    "This class was a great overview of the study of American politics American political behavior, institutions, and policy. In addition to getting a strong foundation in these areas, we were able to assess how they evolved and what methods are employed to evaluate them. The response memos helped me hone my ability to critique and extend the work Jacob presented to us, as did classroom discussions.",
    "I learned more about American Politics in this class than the rest of my life combined. I very much appreciate engaging the concepts at a high academic level."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course lies with Hacker's instruction and ability to shape the discussions of the weekly readings in a way that is productive and hugely informative. I appreciated the wide breadth of focus of topics and the flexible structure of the discussions, which is particularly useful in a course like this. That said, while the flexible structure of the discussion allowed for interesting and exciting conversations, I think it would have been helpful to have a bit more of an expected structure going into each class. Sometimes the discussions seemed a bit tangential (but still interesting nonetheless).",
    "It was also particularly stimulating for often offering readings that challenged established orthodoxies rather than recycling them, and thereby giving us all something to think about and discuss.",
    "Think it was overall very good. (At least for me) a lot of new insights. Good clear structure - that even matched the timing of the election very well. It was a lot of work - but the work load was very flexible and could be delivered when it fit with other courses (that's appreciated). Personally I think it would have been interesting to have a whole session on trust and social capital? Both pro and con - On certain topics Professor Hacker did talk a lot :)",
    "Many of the course strengths were listed in my previous response. The course was broad in the sense that it surveyed many aspects of the study of American politics and provided us opportunities to critique and extend them in classroom discussions and responses. Jacob introduced each class by providing an overview of the field including key debates and pivots. He also did not shy away from highlighting his own expertise and perspective on the politics of policy in particular. I really appreciated the opportunity to read his work and hear his reflections, as it helped me see how different scholars situate their work in the discipline. One area I think the class could be improved is the introductions at the beginning of the class. While they were tremendously valuable, sometimes I wasn't quite sure what information to prioritize or how I may situate it within the texts we read that week. I wonder if another way to do this could be for Jacob to introduce the history\/context of the particular daily topic and then actually have a student pre-assigned to do an overview\/critique of the three readings and then offer some specific questions for discussion. I imagine we may be able to go a bit deeper into discussion with a format like this and it could also help graduate students develop an additional skill.",
    "Very well taught course with good expectations and great topics. No need to change anything."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "A great and necessary course for any student of American Politics. That said, I think it really depends on who's teaching it, since Hacker's institutional knowledge and ability to facilitate the discussion was a major strength of the course.",
    "Yes. If you've already taken American politics courses I wouldn't recommend it, but it is after all an Introduction to American Politics and does its job well.",
    "Yes...",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Jacob is an excellent mentor with a wide knowledge of the discipline and a unique perspective of policy. He provides meaningful and generative feedback both in writing and class. Additionally, as a student of American political science trying to situate oneself in the discipline, this course provides students with a multitude of lenses and methods for studying American politics.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in understanding American Politics from a very academic standpoint. The course can be difficult for non-Polysci students, but worth sticking through."
