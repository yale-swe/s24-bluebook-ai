   "comments": [
    "This was the longest history paper I had ever written, and being guided through each step of the process was really valuable. At the same time, the only real way to learn to write a paper like that is by doing it, and I really appreciated that Professor Rugemer gave us ample time to sit with our ideas and allow them to evolve over the course of the term. Content-wise, I learned a lot about many diverse and interesting aspects of Antebellum America.",
    "I learned more about the time period in the US from 1815 to 1860 including matters related to slavery, race, and abolitionism, alongside industrialization, the changing role of women, westward expansion, Indian removal, and Jacksonian politics. I also gained experience presenting my research in front of the class.",
    "I learned how to write a research paper",
    "This course is a fabulous introduction to an era in American history, and a great way to build the skills needed to do archival research and history writing. This class was therefore great because it provided me with valuable knowledge both on the era that we were studying, and on the ways in which I could pursue my own research interests within the discipline."

   "comments": [
    "It was a fantastic mix of class discussions on different books and arguments about early America and learning how to do an extended research paper.",
    "I thought that Prof Rugemer did a wonderful job assigning reading that elucidated a variety of topics and exposed us to different approaches to history writing. He guided us through the writing process, including having us skype with one of the authors of one of our books to discuss her writing process and he read several different steps of our essays including annotated bibliographies and drafts. This could not have been helped because of the amount of snow and snow days we had, but I think for students who had never been in a history seminar before, it would have been useful to have a library session.",
    "This class is awesome!!! Professor Rugemer is great at leading discussion and the reading list is phenomenal. I loved how the assignments were spread out over the course of the semester, forcing me to stay on track with my research without it feeling overwhelming. I felt that this class had no major weaknesses, aside from being at 9:25am on a Thursday."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, Professor Rugemer is fantastic!",
    "Yes!!! Take this class! Professor Rugemer is wonderful!",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in the time period, this class is a great way to learn more about it, in a much more engaging and in-depth way than in a lecture. Also, the paper-writing process was actually really fun, and I'm glad I got the experience",
    "Yes, especially for a student interested in the time period. I think it is also a very approachable course for a non-history major looking to delve deeper into a history class than a lecture provides. It covers a variety of topics and makes writing a lengthy research paper approachable. The paper is an important component of the course, but is not up front in center, though there are many different steps along the way. It definitely is a good course for someone looking for good preparation for the senior essay.",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough to other students. This is the kind of class that will make you remember how lucky you are to be at Yale, with easy access to historical archives and to the best History\/African American Studies departments in the world. This class made me wish I could go back and become a history major. It was, without a doubt, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale."
