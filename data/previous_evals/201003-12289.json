    "Like many language classes at Yale, Latin is an enjoyable experience, but a huge vacuum for your time. Because there is no conversation, it is also much less fun than other language classes. If you are truly dedicated to the material, take the class. If you are just looking to fill a language requirement or have only a slight interest in learning Latin, I suggest that you go study something that's taught in a more fun way-- you have to go Monday through Friday, so make sure you find the most entertaining class possible!",
    "The course is an intensive introduction to Latin. You cover a wide range of grammar and quite a bit of vocabulary. I would really suggest the course to anyone who wants to jump-start an education in Latin. It really helps hammer out the basics.",
    "If you took it in high school: Yes.If not: It's a struggle.",
    "The Latin 110 class is a closely-knitted community and the students have built very close bonds of friendship during the course of the semester. We have a clear sense of each other's strengths and weaknesses. The students in the class are very helpful to one another.I will recommend Latin 110 to any student who is willing to commit the time and effort.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I imagine the experience is highly variable, depending on the instructor; Caroline Stark is wonderful. The course covers a lot of material and it does go by rather rapidly. Be prepared to study.",
    "The one major weakness of this course is its bizarre textbook: Moreland and Fleischer. Its organization is...questionable. Complex constructions are presented early on and then not explained until chapters later. And for some reason we learn the entire tense system in one chapter. The course was certainly intensive. I expected Latin to be a little easier than an L1 with speaking involved. That was definitely not the case. All in all, I enjoyed being knee-deep in grammar every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student needing language credit because it is a very thorough course and the professors make it fun.",
    "Yes, I would. This is a thorough, but painless introduction to Latin.",
    "Latin 110 is an intensive language course. It moves at a very rapid but reasonable pace. Caroline does a great job explaining all of the grammar in class, so it's really up to you to memorize the extensive vocabulary list outside of class. Even though intro language class meets daily, Latin is enjoyable and helps with many other areas outside of class.",
    "It's very fast-paced and grammar-heavy, with little exposure to original Latin texts. It's easy to fall behind, but if you stay with it it does get you up to speed very quickly, and gives you fascinating insights on other languages and on language in general."
