   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course. The material is interesting and enjoyable but is presented in an approachable and accessible way.",
    "Recommended, if you're looking for a science credit. The professor and TFs are excellent, and some of the projects are fun. Some of the material may seem a bit repetitive if you've taken a bio course at Yale before, but for most parts its interesting and relevent. Great fifth credit.",
    "This is definitely a great course. We look into the bio behind a lot popular topics like global warming and the micro-biome. Sometimes the lectures could feel a little dry, but the professor was wonderful and the ta's were always there to answer any questions. The workload was extremely manageable. It does take a bit of getting used to the exams, but overall pretty fair as well. Definitely take this class if you're interested in bio but not necessarily a science major.",
    "good class",
    "This class is not difficult, but if you're not interested in the material, it is not worth taking. It is very light on the science, so if you have taken bio it will be too basic for you.",
    "This is a pretty good science credit. It wasn't very challenging, but the actual material was relatively interesting."
