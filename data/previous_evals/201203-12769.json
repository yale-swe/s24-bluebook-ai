    "If you have any interest in Yale (and not just its classes but its culture and history) this class is for you.",
    "A class in which you will study the good and bad parts of Yale through the ages and how the school relates to the larger world. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student - always interesting reading material, and it's great to know more about the history of the place we attend.",
    "History 134J is a study of Yale's history through key graduates who have had a positive impact on Yale and society at large. I would recommend it to another student. The class is an amazing experience.",
    "Yale and America is a phenomenal course that every Yale student should take. It teaches you so much about the history of Yale, and makes you feel so inspired by it. My one caution is that class discussions can be a bit scattered and you might not learn as much information from this seminar as you would from a more rigorous history seminar - but nonetheless what you learn is incredible. Consider this more of a reading group and discussion group than a formal class. A must take. Also do all the readings- they are fascinating and help you get so much more out of the class.",
    "Very fun 5th credit. Low stress, but super interesting material, without being too narcissistic! Jay does a great job and highlights the material with fun personal anecdotes. Sam Chauncy, when he's around, is awesome. Take this class just to hang with him and here his stories.",
    "Difficult to secure a spot but definitely take if you can. Prof. Gitlin and Prof. Chauncey are lively and have great stories on virtually everything. Class gives you a deeper appreciation for Yale and her history in a (inter)national context. One of my best seminars at Yale -- highly recommended!",
    "Every Yale student should take this class. It's remarkably easy to go through Yale without thinking about what this place is or what the school stands for. That shouldn't be the case. Yale is a tradition, but we need to investigate what that tradition is. Gitlin very much understands what a seminar should be. In some classes, you can get through the whole semester without knowing some people's names. Not so in Gitlin's class; he wants everyone to get to know each other. You will make friends in this class. We took a trip to New York, ate lunch at Mory's, and worked in groups frequently. Class is also just a lot of fun. Gitlin tells great stories (and if Sam Chauncey ever sits in on the class again, you will hear truly remarkable stories from one of the most amazing and inspiring people I've ever met). We rewrote the lyrics to Cole Porter songs and performed them while drinking gin and tonic. We had really meaningful discussions about the experience of a Yale student, Yalies' role in the world, and the decline of student protest at Yale. This school is a fascinating place, and we really ought to know more about its history. There's no better place to learn that history than among passionate and friendly Yalies.",
    "YES! There is no other class like it in the world. It is so much fun. You cover three centuries of Yale history in one class, focusing on highlights. There are lot of field trips, activities, and merriment.",
    "I loved this course. It's not exactly a discussion-based seminar, as Professor Gitlin ends up talking for a good part of each class, but I thought that that was worth it, just to hear his stories. When we did discuss things, it was super interesting because it often tied directly into our personal experiences of Yale--whether the values of Dink Stover's time are relevant today, etc. The class trip to New York was very, very fun, and the end-of-term Mory's trip was great too. Since you don't end up having to talk much, you might feel like you don't need to do the readings--but if you do, you'll find them fascinating and really rewarding. Also, there are so many smaller group projects that you end up having to doa good amount of preparation for several different sessions, and you get to work with several different people in the class. Professor Gitlin really tries to make sure people get to know each other, and it makes the class a lot more fun.",
    "Learn more about the institution you are a part of. Learn loads of American history along the way. This is the best seminar I've had at Yale, largely due to the fantastic group we had - stacked. Make your next semester meaningful by taking Tuesdays with Jay. This is the class I will remember in 50 years.",
    "Take it! Its a must take at Yale, and it will renew your sense of the awesomeness of the school. You get to go on awesome field trips and write a really interesting paper with a professor who is just as interested as you are!",
    "Excellent class that will change the way you think about Yale, would highly recommend for any major. Not too hard, just two papers, readings you can skim\/skip, and a class presentation (easy and interesting). Really gets you to take advantage of Yale's resources to learn about its role in American history. Prof. Gitlin tells the most interesting stories and makes sure everyone gets to know each other. Not worth a Cr\/D, take for a grade!",
    "Yale in America is a wonderful wonderful wonderful course.Every class is packed with information (so much that we don't actually get to the end of it but no matter) and we often went off on tangents, but no one protested.Some of the best aspects were both how heplful and accessible Professor Gitlin was and how wonderfull the class dynamic was.Definitely a must if you love Yale, love a good discussion, actually want to learn about Yale and its history, and enjoy drinking cups at Mory's with your classmates.",
    "Superb! Yale's going to be a big part of your life, why not spend a bit of time analyzing what it's meant to so many who have gone through it and gone on to shape America? Gitlin does a great job of synthesizing history around the theme of Yale graduates' effect on America and the class is worth it for Gitlin's enthusiasm alone. Push him to open up discussion more, he can easily spend a class talking. It's fascinating, but push on opening up the conversation, he'll be glad you did and the mood set in the class is such that you can. You also get great experiences like, in our case, having coffee with Maya Lin and field tripping to New York and closing with a Mory's lunch. The final paper allows you to delve into really any topic you're personally interested in as Yalies have been extraordinary in so many fields. Gitlin also takes care to bond the class, meaning you'll come out of it with new friends and be able to share experiences as you work on papers and projects. I wish more teachers put energy into that kind of effort, it really heightens the quality of the class and made it one I always looked forward to. Take this class if you can get a spot - it's really been a wonderful part of my college experience.",
    "Take it. Even if you don't care about Yale, Gitlin is worth it."
