    "This class is a small workshop where we work on writing in different genres like fables, short stories, and poetry. We get to read our peer's work and comment on it and it's great to see what a great writer everyone is and learn how to better your own writing from them.",
    "Profesora Jordan is super sweet, but also pretty scatter brained. We would talk a lot about a piece without saying really concrete things abou sytle and techniques and then be asked to write in that syle, even though, we never really defined it. I didn't particularly feel I learned a ton, but the class certainly introduce me to new topics. It's a perfect Cr\/D!",
    "If you want to improve your spanish grammer and speaking, there are definitely better ways to go. As a creative writing course it has some merits - if you need a class in order to write creative fiction \/ poetry than it may be a good fit. The feedback we get from the teacher however is more grammatical and spelling than actual feedback about the stories themselves.",
    "Yes. Anyone who enjoys Spanish should take this class",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 227 01 to another student because I think it's a different look at a foreign language while you can explore your own writing style and learn to improve your writing.",
    "I definitely recommend that you take this course!",
    "Definitely recommend taking it. A very reasonable amount of work and the writing assignments are all varied and interesting--everything from poetry to short stories to fables.",
    "TAKE IT. First, though, make sure there is a way to split the class between spanish fluent and american fluent. That was the only issue I had with the course. It was frustrating having to listen people who don't speak spanish try to get out a sentence that made no sense. But overall, Prof. Maria tries to balance that out by translating what those people say.",
    "Short version: energetic and caring professor, intimate workshop, more work than expected but totally worth it. Minor adjustments recommended.Requirements: Write 2 stories, 1 microcuento, 1 mini fable, ~5 poems, and finish a few creative assignments started in class. Keep a \"journal\" of class notes, responses to readings, and answers to homework questions.Longer version: This class was fabulous. I also had to work my butt off because it mattered to me and I felt like I was behind. There was a mix of levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094two native speakers, 6ish L5 people (of mixed written and spoken fluency), and 1 Brazilian who was in between\u00e2\u0080\u0094and of artsiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094a poet, a writer, a theater person\/artist, and a few others\u00e2\u0080\u0094but Profesora Jord\u00c3\u00a1n did a great job of meeting each student where they work. She wanted each student to work hard, to excel, and to love both Spanish and writing. She also really cared about her students. We had a small group (10-12) and we became friends, which made it more fun to read each other's work.The feedback we gave her at the end of the semester was that a) email communication could be a little more prompt\/clear b) we'd like to read more of each other's work c) we'd have liked to get more feedback on our own work.I also might suggest that there be fewer readings so that students could either devote more time to their own work or read\/critique more of their classmates' work. We really did have to do a lot of reading and writing (more reading-heavy for the first half of the semester) in this course.Two or three students took this Credit\/D, which would definitely take the pressure off and allow you to just do as much work asyou want to do and still easily get a credit. While I was a little more stressed than my classmates who took it Credit\/D, I do think I was pushed more and it was more rewarding.Also, you are expected to have a good written command of the language. Because I took Advanced Spanish Grammar last fall, I was ahead of the curve, which made it easier to focus on creative writing rather than spending time on cleaning things up.Overall, wonderful class and fabulous professor. A great L5 class."
