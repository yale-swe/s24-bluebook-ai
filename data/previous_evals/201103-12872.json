   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course. We explored a mathematical\/geometric approach to music analysis that at times blew my mind. Cohn is a brilliant professor, and he does not move too quickly through the material. My one complaint would be that sometimes I was not convinced that this approach produces any meaningful analyses of some of pieces we studied. But at other times, the elegance with which this approach is able to describe some pieces is quite amazing. The workload is very manageable.",
    "This is an interesting course. The material is not difficult, especially if you have taken other mathematics courses. It certainly introduced me to a new way of looking at music.",
    "Music 309 may not be satisfying to a mathematics student looking to learn more about music, but it is certainly interesting for music students looking to investigate the ongoing research into the relationship of mathematics to music. I found the class enjoyable (although rather slow at first), and thought it was very interesting (if not entirely practical). I would love to take a course that further explores the topics presented in 309."
