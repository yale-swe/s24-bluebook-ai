   "comments": [
    "This class will challenge your writing and force you to improve. Even if you're not interested in English and\/or the Humanities, writing is a valuable skill. And this class will help you.",
    "English 120 was an excellent introduction to creative non-fiction writing. Coming from a journalism background, this style of writing was something I frequently read in The New Yorker but never learned how to do. The workload wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be - the readings for each class are fairly light (and really interesting) and there are papers due every week (alternating between rough and final drafts). McCabe is an outstanding teacher - she allows students to take the reins in class discussions, is sensitive to students' busy schedules (she gets drafts back within a couple days to allow maximum time for revision) and gives helpful feedback on essay drafts. Overall I would highly recommend taking her class!",
    "This was a fantastic course. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in improving their writing skills. This particular section was strong in covering narrative journalism and writing for the radio. If you want to learn how to tell a great story, take this class.",
    "This class is a must take for anyone interested in creative writing or looking to improve their writing in general. It is not directly connected to writing standard academic essays, but it certainly offers a skill set which is transferable to them.",
    "The course is a lot of work, and it is easy to panic, but if you keep a clear schedule of due dates in your head, the class is fun and very rewarding. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "English 120 08 was an amazing class, even for someone like me who isn't looking into majoring in the humanities, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenging but rewarding writing class. It is a bit on the work-heavy side (at least in the beginning of the course, you are expected to write an essay every two weeks, with revisions in the intervening weeks), but the skills gained in writing not only academically but also personally are invaluable.",
    "A class that will improve your writing in general and your approach to writing. It is especially good if you want to improve your personal writing. It is definitely fast-paced and stressful times, but at the end it's worth it! Especially if you have Professor McCabe!",
    "English 120 Section 08 is an intense course that requires a lot of hard work, just like other courses at Yale. There is some form of essay due every week, so you are always thinking about your next move. I feel that my writing significantly improved in this course because the readings we discussed in class were relevant, and Professor McCabe did a great job highlighting which readings could help us in particular essays. Overall, one of my favorite courses this semester. I would definitely recommend it to any student interesting in writing non-fiction or just improving their overall skills in writing.",
    "Yes! I loved the course. I would warn them that it will be a lot of work, but that it will be work that they want to do. I learned so much and I know that what I learned will help me in future classes, so without a doubt I would recommend it.",
    "Highly recommended. Especially if you have taken an english class before and are not sure if you want to be an english major.",
    "This course will improve your creative nonfiction writing. You learn techniques by reading long form essays. Then you apply them to your own creative assignments. This particular section teaches writing for radio at the end of the semester. A practical class with a supportive professor."
