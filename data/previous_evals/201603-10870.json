    "My knowledge of French improved, particularly speaking wise.",
    "I become a much better French student. Learned more this half year than I have in the past 4 years.",
    "I was placed into L3 french and this course pushed me forward to speak, read and write french on a daily basis.",
    "I gained a good competent knowledge of the French language, and was introduced to elements of French literary and philosophic culture.",
    "The grammar in large part is a review and slight expansion on that from L1 & L2. You do learn to better read and discuss French literature, though, and in general further you're familiarity with the language.",
    "Confidence in my speaking and my writing. Catherine has a love and a nerdiness for the language and culture that animates the class, so I would also say that this class also gave me a love for learning the language.",
    "This course definitely helped me solidify most of my skills in french",
    "I learned to use other words that I know to talk around an idea I can't seem to say. I also learned a lot of grammar and vocabulary for the future.",
    "Comprehensive grammar, oral and aural skills.",
    "This course helped me improve my speaking skills, as well as knowledge of vocabulary and grammar."

   "comments": [
    "The course is notorious for for being difficult and it really was. The IDs and vocab were very tricky and sometimes no amount of studying could save you from trick questions.",
    "It teaches you a ton, but often can be too much at once. Things go by quickly, but I guess that has to happen if you want such an in depth covering.",
    "Strengths: working with original sources, i.e. books vs. textbooks, good help availability and instruction. Weaknesses: limited opportunity to practice speaking. Chinese department, for instance, has mandatory one-on-one tutoring. Maybe this could be arranged for french as well?",
    "The course is structured around great texts and movies, my one criticism would be that the final exam process takes a long time and your reading period basically becomes a French week where you have classes everyday and finals divided into 2 days. It would be better if those could happen on the last week of classes which is supposed to be just review.",
    "The course is a rigorous continuation of the development of French grammatical skills. I think that speaking exercises could be stressed more - while I have a good knowledge of French grammar, my speaking skills could be improved a good deal.",
    "I believe this course would benefit from restructuring its lessons and curriculum. The readings were often too hard to comprehend, much less discuss in class. The tests seemed more focused on trying to trick students up rather than test on the specific grammar rule.",
    "There are some testing tools that seem pedagogically unnecessary. Seem like remnants of strict grading techniques. I think we should have more class debates as well to take our language skills to the next level.",
    "the course was definitely manageable and the atmosphere was fantastic! Would have loved to have had more opportunities to improve my conversational french, because while i feel that I am stronger now in writing, I don't think I improved as much with my speaking",
    "The course taught me a lot but sometimes the audio for homework assignments were about lengthy.",
    "Strengths: Organized Enjoyable Intensive Continuous assessment Weakness: Noisy room (HVAC) sometimes made hearing difficult",
    "I greatly enjoyed the program which included such incredible cultural experience as reading Camus and watching Truffaut. I liked the format of audio programs and MMPs, although the technical aspect was not ideal: I felt that both audio programs and MMPs were very slow, which made it hard to concentrate on the task, and there was no option of changing the speed, and fast forwarding was not very convenient either. Otherwise, I would not say that there were any weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Probably not.",
    "It was a great course. If you have to take a language, it is definitely a lot of work, but you truly improve at French.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in developing your french.",
    "French department at Yale values learning a lot and they treat you with a lot harder material than any other language department. I like that about it since you no longer have to deal with coloured textbooks and weird vocal that you will never use, in French you get to read actual books written for native speakers.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their French.",
    "if you want to improve your writing skills, definitely take this class",
    "Yes. It is a great class to really review any past knowledge and learn a lot of new parts of the language. It is also a great class to work on speaking the language.",
    "This requires a major time commitment, but the benefits are enormous.",
    "I cannot speak for other instructors, but I would totally recommend taking this course with my professor, Catherine Chiabaut."
