   "comments": [
    "There are no weaknesses to this course.",
    "This is an excellent course. It is very involved and assures that the students improve their language skills. The only weakness is that the work schedule is disorganized at times, but this is easily manageable and the teacher is exceedingly fair and kind toward mistakes.",
    "The schedule was chaotic and difficult to follow. Professor Dolgova often had an unrealistic idea of how much could be accomplished in a 50 minute period and almost always extended the class well past its end time (sometimes as far as 25 minutes, but usually more like 7). Maybe the class should be given a different time slot where the sessions are longer, but either way the plan should fit the available time. I also did not appreciate the periodic requests that we come in over the weekend or something to take an oral test or watch a movie that wasn't even on the syllabus. Sometimes the tests were much longer than could be completed in the test time. The content of the course was very useful. The grammar and vocabulary we learned were sensible and relevant, and Professor Dolgova's handouts and teaching were helpful, I just think the administrative plan of the class could use some work.",
    "The strengths of this course include the fact that it is taught by Professor Dolgova, a talented pedagog. The major weakness of the course is that it always felt like we had inadequate time to get through all of the content. The course had a significant amount of homework, some of which we were not able to review in class due to time constraints. Otherwise, I think Professor Dolgova did a masterful job of creating a class that catered to the needs of students with varying degrees of language proficiency."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a challenging language to learn but it is worth it.",
    "This course is instrumental in getting closer to fluency with the Russian language. Irina is an incredible Professor and makes learning advances russian a really enjoyable experience.",
    "If a student had taken third year and was on the fence about fourth year, I would strongly recommend it.",
    "Anyone who wants to learn Russian at this level at Yale has no choice but to take this class, and it does really help with our speaking ability. So I would recommend it based on that, but I wouldn't take it for fun. It was a huge pain in the butt.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because I feel that it is an intensive way to improve practical language skills."
