   "comments": [
    "A pretty good general introduction to physics lab principles. Take it!",
    "Take this class if you need to.. otherwise not really recommended.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably for your requirements. For most people, it's not the most exciting thing, but it's a solid class; it's taught very well and you'll learn some new useful concepts.",
    "'A subject I am not particularly fond of, but that's my problem. The course itself was incredibly well-organized, which I appreciated. I was especially impressed with the TAs and Sid, who were incredibly helpful and made the experience a painless and even educational one. My only annoyance was that the grading was very opaque, and the fluctuations in my grades felt pretty random.",
    "PHYS 165L is a very good introductory physics lab. I would certainly recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You probably are going to have to take it if you're a stem major, but never fear, it's not bad. Especially if you've worked with Logger Pro software, this lab is not difficult at all. The reports are short and maybe take an hour to write up and the little quizzes before class are pretty easy also. It's also pretty decent because only the first lab takes the full 3 hours. I got out of every other lab early which was really nice. The practical is open note (meaning any notes you ever took and any handout you were ever given) and each part related pretty directly to one of the labs done earlier in the year.",
    "Very boring. Only take it if you have to.",
    "Typical lab experience for a premed. Pretty uninteresting experiments, and you're expected to be extremely scrupulous.",
    "You're taking this because you have to, not because you want to, and that's fine. It's a dead boring class, but the professors are genuinely caring and my TA (Han Aung) was fantastic. It's a moderate amount of work with a practical final, but if you pay attention and to the reading, you should be fine. If you're actually into physics, you should probably take the 205L sequence instead.",
    "PHYS 165L 01 is a good, intro level, physics lab. Often, many of the labs seemed excessively long and tedious. For example, the number of times I had to calculate uncertainties seemed pointless, given that we were studying much larger concepts in many of the labs. As a Political Science major, this lab was reasonable.",
    "Definitely would recommendit's actually fun to tinker around with stuff. A good balance of new interesting material but also totally doable.",
    "Absolutely the WORST lab I have taken at Yale (and that's saying something as this is my last pre-med\/MCDB major requirement lab)...This lab made me reconsider being pre-med...in fact, I am still reconsidering it since I have to take 166L....do NOT take this unless you absolutely have to. Way more work than is worth half a credit.",
    "I would recommend this if you need a physics lab because it is pretty basic and doesn't require much outside work.",
    "Not stressful of a lab at all. Lab reports take 1-2 hours each week to complete. Labs aren't too difficult. Make sure you're prepared for the practical, though. Would recommend to anyone in need of a physics lab.",
    "Straightforward lab with one page lab reports every week that don't take more than an hour. The final practical was a bit stressful, but other than that, a pretty easy and helpful addition to Phys 180 (or 170). The labs seem repetitive at times but do not take long if you work efficiently and read through the manual ahead of time.",
    "lab. it is what it is. less work than orgo lab, but not nearly as fun.",
    "If you have to take a physics lab, I'd recommend 165. I don't know about any of the other labs, but PHYS 165 isn't a bad class. It's not amazing, but it's fine.",
    "Take PHYS 165L if you need a physics lab credit. It is a pretty typical lab course weekly lab reports and lab quizzes with a lab practical as the final. I didn't find the labs to be particularly interesting and found the emphasis on calculations and uncertainties to be tedious. Not fun, but not difficult either.",
    "This isn't the worst lab at Yale, but it is not the most enjoyable either. I would recommend it if you're taking the physics lecture. Lab will take the entire 3 hours, but the work outside of lab is not substantial.",
    "Useful, fun, a great opportunity to learn and be challenged. Can take it stand-alone without the main course or with it. Would recommend.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class, you're probably a premed. No- you're definitely a premed, or at least thinking about it. Which means your only choice is between this and 205L. Well, the good news for you is that 165L is a fine class - not a particularly fun or interesting one, mind you, but it's not much work and if you get a chill TF lab isn't stressful. So I'd say save yourself the trouble and go with 165L. If you're not trying to knock out a major or pre-professional requirement, though, there's no reason to take it.",
    "General Physics Laboratory is a great companion course to Introductory Physics and highlights many of the topics we learned in physics lectures with interesting and fun experiments.",
    "Pretty typical physics lab, nothing special and just a lot of tedious work.",
    "It's a pretty good lab class. The first labs were too long. But they got better near the end, and all dealt with important physics concepts. The handouts made everything easier.",
    "YES YES YES YES! Apparently the median is an A, so it's really nice!",
    "I took PHYS 165L as the counterpart to PHYS 170. It was truly one of the only laboratory courses at Yale that I enjoyed (I have not had the best of luck with TAs). It is interesting and helps as a counterpart to the lecture physics course.",
    "PHYS 165L is a decent lab course. I would recommend it as an introductory physics lab course but would tell students taking PHYS 170 that it doesn't overlap as well with the course as it would for PHYS 180.",
    "I think it was helpful to reinforce the concepts i learned in class but obviously most people have to take the class",
    "You're likely taking it because it's a required course, but rest assured that it does a good job for being an introductory physics lab and requires less time and effort than its counterparts in chemistry.",
    "PHYS 165L is a standard physics lab class. The experiments are more geared towards PHYS 180 than 170, so be prepared to go over concepts not discussed in lecture if you take PHYS 170. The lab write ups are reasonable and the experiments are a good way of tying together physical concepts with experimental results.",
    "I would not recommend this lab to anyone who does not have to take it.",
    "Ah this class will test your patience but you are most likely taking it because you have to. Unlike orgo lab, you will often use the full 3 hour slot so don't expect to get out early (sometimes there are shorter labs though). There are four point quizzes that require you to read the handout before taking. Most people say you can skim it before hand, but I'd say to look for laws, relationships, and patterns that are articulated in the packet. The practical was long and a little stressful, but overall I found it ok (I think, we'll see when my grade comes out). Push yourself to take good notes in a carbon-copy notebook and write out your calculations. You'll thank yourself when practical time comes. Get ready to become best friends with uncertainties.",
    "Physics 165L is a good extension to the classroom concepts of physics 180. Some of the labs were predictable and some of them were boring, but for the most part class was engaging.",
    "Fantastic. This is the most fun I've ever had studying physics. I would recommend this to any and everyone.",
    "Would not recommend unless absolutely required",
    "Take it if you need to. Apparently one of the more bearable lab courses at Yale. Labs can generally be done before the allotted time, which is nice.",
    "If you dont have to take it, dont take it. If you are taking it because of pre med then it is probably an easier option than the 205 lab course but shop both for sure.",
    "If you are taking PHYS 165L, it's most likely because you need it for your major. Don't worry too much about it - lab reports are very manageable (1-page summary + lab notes) and the class is fairly well run. Just make sure that you are paying attention during the semester and have the skills to conduct experiments on your own for the final exam.",
    "Most students only take Phys 165L because they have to. That being said, it's not bad! There is less homework than most lab classes and the instructors do their best to keep the material engaging during class. Watch out for the practical final however- it's easy to forget a lot of the material during the semester.",
    "PHYS 165L is probably required if you're thinking about taking it, but it's a pretty good lab. The whole course is coordinated really well, and it's the only lab I've ever taken at Yale that truly felt like a half credit. Great practical learning experience, especially if physics doesn't make a ton of sense to you conceptually.",
    "Pretty much the same response as everyone else. If you have to take it, it's not the end of the world. If you don't have to take it, don't take it.",
    "This lab course was miserable at best, but that was the fault of the material of the experiments for me. The course was well organized and the work expected of us was not overwhelming, but it was a class I certainly would not recommend taking unless you have to.",
    "If you need to take the class for a major or a pre-req, that's fine. Otherwise, I'm not really sure why you would be taking the class but I guess if you just really like labs or basic physics experiments you could do that too.",
    "People take it because they have to -- it's not fun but it's doable. Just make sure your notes and report contain answer every single question in the handout because some are easy to miss and you'll lose a ton of points if you don't.",
    "You have to take Physics Lab, right (seriously, if you're taking it for fun, just leave now)? So, there's no question about whether or not you're taking it...it's a question of how painful it's going to be. But don't worry. It's not too horrible. I'd rank it as worse than Orgo Lab, but better than Gen Chem Lab in terms of enjoyableness. You'll usually finish each lab in about 2.5-3 hours. Basically, you have about 12 labs - you get assigned a partner, and you work through this packet posted on ClassesV2 each week that tells you to do an experiment or series of experiments of some sort. A lot of these will entail using LoggerPro to graph or analyze some physical principle. It's ok - a lot of this is just a little tedious. You basically write down your procedure and results in your notebook, print out a graph, and then turn in a one page summary of your lab each week. Not super duper painful. Just tedious. Sort of boring at times. If you have a good lab partner and a study buddy it helps. Don't worry too much - you'll get through it!",
    "If you're comfortable with physics this will be an easy lab for you. The labs are not overly tedious and fly by. I spent around an hour each week working on the report outside of class.",
    "This lab section corresponds to PHYS 180 definitely take this section when you are taking 180, it follows the concepts almost exactly in the order of 180.",
    "This lab is perfect if you're in PHYS 180 as the labs correlate pretty much perfectly with what you're learning. Take this lab if you have to for your major. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but you definitely do learn a lot.",
    "My lab was actually kind of fun, because my TA was good and my section got along really well. The final is miserable though - timed, impossible to study for, and worth a lot of your grade. You probably have to take this class, so good luck! Other than the final, the class isn't bad. You can probably do the lab reports in an hour and a half.",
    "Yes I would, it was a great class.",
    "I would recommend this lab to any student taking one of the intro Physics classes, as it complements the material we learn about in class and enhances our understanding of how it can be applied.",
    "165L was a great supplement to 170 since it taught me many classical physics topics not covered in lecture. the experiments were tedious, long, and superfluous at times but overall I learned lot and made great friendships along the way.",
    "This lab is a good introductory lab for physics, and the labs are well written and easy to follow. I would caution that the final exam, which counts for 30% of your grade, is a lot harder than the actual labs because you can't puzzle through it with a partner, and the instructions are much more vague.",
    "For most people, this is will probably be a required course. Considering that, you'll get through the lab like a daily chore- not particularly difficult, but tedious at times. Luckily, it does help demonstrate certain concepts in PHYS 180.",
    "This was one of my least favorite courses. The time commitment and workload do not warrant the .5 credits. I would not recommend this course unless you are required to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course as it helped me become better at physics. If physics is a subject that interests you, take the lab.",
    "A relatively low commitment class (lab reports take about an hour to complete every week, and you usually get out of lab on time or an hour early). The experiments are well-designed for the most part, and the course directors are very willing to help you along in your experimentation. Ask around to find the right TA; it can make a huge difference.",
    "A necessary pre-med course",
    "Much more chill than the chemistry labs. If you have a good TA and make sure that you understand all the equipment and steps that are used (never let your partner do all the work, fam) you'll be fine.",
    "It's totally a fine class, very chill. If you are not confident in lab it is helpful to take because the stakes are not too high in the experiments, and you have a lot of time to get help and make sure you understand what you are doing and why.",
    "Physics lab is the most fun and rewarding lab I've had at Yale. As a premed, you suffer through gen chem and orgo lab, and physics lab is a breath of fresh air. The concepts build upon each other well and the lab worksheet instructions are clear. The 1 page weekly lab reports were just enough to allow you to reflect upon the concepts and methods you performed, without becoming too tedious. The final definitely required a firm grasp on all the concepts, but was great in the sense that it allowed us to synthesize and apply the semester's work.",
    "I would never recommend this course to anyone, and would strongly advise against taking it unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Physics lab is relatively enjoyable, when compared to other introductory labs at Yale. I think it's a bit more difficult for Physics 170 students than 180 students because of differences in our curricula. 180 covers exactly what we do in 165L. I found that 170 students were learning a lot more new material in lab, so that's just a consideration to have when you start the class.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone who is taking Phys 180 or 170. No, it will not be the most thrilling lab you've ever taken in your life but the work is very manageable and after all, it is an intro lab. Just weekly quizzes (simple, just read the handouts) and one-page lab write-ups, and the lab final is a practical but it's doable. For people who have taken a highly structured lab like organic chemistry lab, it will be a 180 degree turn, but in a refreshing way. It is not the kind of lab that will stress you out, especially if you're taking other tough classes.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It depends on the TA, but overall, a lot of the TAs were not very helpful at all and neither were the instructors.",
    "A solid lab: not always fun but interesting. Most of the labs will take about 3 hours but not longer than that. The lab reports are easy and are just a summary of the lab. Weekly quizzes are easy if one reads the lab handout prior to class. Become friends with your TA as he\/she will help you when needed.",
    "Take it for a pre-req if you have to (on the upside, not too much work, and the quizzes are very easy if you've skimmed over the material), but if you're looking for a true indication of how scientific procedure works, or a chance to try very cool modules in physics, do not look to this course.",
    "I found myself extremely bored in this lab after taking one year of High School physics. It was not until the last few experiments that I encountered new material. If there is a more interesting physics lab available, I would take that instead if you think you are ready.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in physics - even non-STEM majors.",
    "It's your classic intro lab. Lots of students. Your TA makes or breaks your lab report grade, so you'll have to either try very hard or not try much at all depending on your luck. Otherwise not bad, but really just take it if you have to.",
    "PHYS 165L is a classic physics lab course, and a requirement for most pre-meds and some science majors. The experiments can be quite fun, but the lab reports can take awhile to write up, as the grading can be very strict. The weekly quizzes are not too bad as long as you read the lab packet thoroughly before heading into lab. The final exam was a mad rush as I tried to complete everything under timed pressure. Despite all this, the TFs and professors are usually great and willing to help students out.",
    "A good course to take for anyone who needs to fulfill a physics lab requirement including premeds and engineering\/STEM majors. I would especially recommend it for those you don't want to go through 200 physics labs that are more advanced and demanding. Can be taken with or without PHYS 180\/170 or a concurrent physics course. In general, I would recommend this course to another student. The final is relatively challenging.",
    "Physics lab is still a tedious chunk of time, but the pre-lab and post-lab work is far less than what gen chem and orgo required. If you have a good TA and\/or manage to be in a section with your friends, it won't be nearly as painful.",
    "A bit meticulous with seemingly pointless activities after chem\/bio\/orgo lab, but figure out how to fulfill the grading rubric, and you'll be fine. The final is just a combination of some of the trickiest experiments you do all semester in three parts (i.e. from three different experiments). Do it and get it over with. Really not bad at all.",
    "Physics lab is a good chance to see standard physics work in a tangible way. It made it much easier to visualize concepts in physics class. I would definitely recommend it to anyone taking physics.",
    "If you need a physics lab it isn't terrible. The class is boring but not that much work so take it if you need to, otherwise don't.",
    "It's definitely not a horrible requirement, and if you're really interested, might as well take it for fun, because it's not that much work.",
    "It's a fine class. The lab reports can take some getting used to. Each lab is interesting and they do a good job of explaining what is going on. Utilize your TA. The final is very hard and unexpectedly so, just be prepared for that."
