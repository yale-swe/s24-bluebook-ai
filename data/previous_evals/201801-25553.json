    "Strengths - great group of faculty leading the colloquium, series of deadlines helped keep me on top of everything, dinners were a great idea Weaknesses - it wouldve been nice to be a little more aware of how the seminar portion of the colloquium would be structured. It started off very demanding and ended up not being a thing at all, which is fine except that I had no idea thats how it was going to go.",
    "It was nice that we met more informally this semester. This was really great for getting work done. I think the dinners would be better on another evening, as many people could not make it sometimes due to society.",
    "The early deadline is goodwould be better to get more feedback\/guidance on drafts"
