    "Helps with improving one's writing. For me, the vocabulary was mostly redundant, and I felt that the range of students' abilities was too large, but the teacher handles it well. The emphasis is more on grammar and vocabulary rather than literature. There's also a helpful student oral presentation. For heritage speakers it's a very smart and comfortable way to enter the academic Spanish class setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think that if someone is looking to sharpen their skills in Spanish, this course was a great way to do it. I would summaries it as a course in which we worked on grammar and improved our vocabulary in a way that was very tailored to the heritage speakers and it was fun!",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are a heritage speaker who knows your Spanish isn't exactly perfect. The professor understands what we struggle with and will give you the personal patience required to get you through the semester. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "The course is fun and the professor is amazing! Take this course.",
    "I would definitely recomend this class. You get to practice your Spanish without worrying about technicalities and your skills improve greatly!",
    "I would summarize it as an excellent way to reinforce Spanish skills and I would definitely recommend it."
