    "11. Professor Peters is incredibly enthusiastic about indigenous silviculture, with which he has had many personal experiences. This enthusiasm and experience combined to generate fifteen minutes-long soliloquies and anecdotes about various aspects of indigenous silviculture. While this sort of improvisation could definitely made the teaching more immersive and helped center the material in the real world, it could impede our progress into new topics. The course could have been a bit more focused. 12. Professor Peters could get tunnel vision sometimes. There were a few instances where this manifested itself as insensitive or tone-deaf responses to legitimate student comments about the social implications of various silvicultural systems. A memorable instance was his failure to directly address the oppression of the Putumayo people under the Peruvian rubber barons, following a student's attempt to make him do so. Overall, I really appreciated Prof. Peters' relaxed teaching style and profound enthusiasm for the subject.",
    "My favorite course at FES",

    "It gave me a new perspective on tropical livelihoods and their interaction with western conservation and ecology.",
    "Critical evaluation and curiosity",
    "Overall, the course was one of my favorites at FES. It goes beyond the technical realm and explores the philosophical and social sciences realm as well, which in my opinion gives the student a more holistic and complete picture of the world's tropical forests and forestry sector. This is one of the few classes I took at FES which recognizes that everything is interconnected, and that is really interdisciplinary. This class allowed me to further develop the skill of studying something in detail without losing perspective of the whole, and",
    "The instructor has a lot of experience with indigenous silviculture systems around the world which he shares in a very story-telling fashion that is very enriching. It is a course that promotes critical thinking about environmental programs that are applied still today and it also introduces to a way of thinking the forest as an integral part of agriculture and economy."

    "Despite being a course that critizices \"western silvicuture\" and stresses the importance of indigenous silvicuture, all the materials were from non indigenous authors. It would be great to take advantage of shared interests to get to hear about students experiences in the classroom. Instructor was not very receptive to discussion."

Have to say overall I was impressed with what I managed to take away. His personal experience and on-the-ground context was priceless. Chuck Peters is a legend, he could have taught Indigenous Cooking Methods and it would have made an impact on my learning. His insight, experience, and intellect is invaluable. I hope he comes back to serve future students.",
