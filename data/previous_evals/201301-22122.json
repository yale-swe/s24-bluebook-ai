   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're interested in economics, that's just about it.",
    "Realistically this is nothing new. It takes principles you learned in Intro Macro and applies them further (and with greater Math). While you should be good at Math, don't be too intimidated and say \"I'm not THAT good.\" It's not that much harder.It's just that the exams are VERY difficult.",
    "A bunch of fun, and not too difficult if you've taken micro theory. The math isn't too hard; it's a lot of playing around with algebra. Gives a very good conceptual grounding of the major schools of macroeconomic thought, although doesn't get into so many specifics. The professor is solid and a not-unengaging lecturer.",
    "It's a lot of models, not too too much math (nothing very hard beyond basic multivariable calculus like partial derivatives and maximization problems), and a lot of facts. Great course for those who care to study econ academically in more depth, eg in grad school. I would recommend it to students who want to do a lot of work to learn a lot and who really like economics. Otherwise, the course could be very boring and overly rigorous.",
    "Tough, but worth it.",
    "If you need to take it yes. It is probably more enjoyable than Macro but at the same time you will probably get a much lower grade.",
    "Econ 126 was definitely a challenging course. After taking Micro Theory in the fall semester, the material in Macro Theory seemed tobe less outright difficult, but as the semester progressed it became apparent that the material was more \"tricky.\" The class might be less mathematically challenging, but be prepared to think. However, finishing the class is an accomplishment and you'll be able to better comprehend a lot of interesting real-life economic problems, like the liquidity trap and the concept of jobless recoveries. Take it if you want solid quantitative foundations for macroeconomics.",
    "Take it if you want a challenge, or if Intermediate Macro is only offered at 9 in the morning again. It's definitely not boring, but if you're very concerned about your grade, maybe take something else.",
    "Do this if you enjoy actual economics theory and don't mind boring lectures.",
    "Econ 126 is a high level econ class. It's a tough class (not quite as tough as micro theory) but it's certainly manageable. I'd certainly recommend the class to anybody who really enjoys econ and\/or math.",
    "A good class to take if you truly like the subject of economics. I would say that the concepts are in the medium range of difficult, but there is a good amount of math and the problem sets need time to get through. That said, it was a worthwhile class and I learned a lot from it, I don't regret choosing this over 122. If you have a tough semester, I would recommend the easier macroeconomics class. Also, the textbook is really helpful and follows the class well, which helps.",
    "This is a good class, with a lot of very technical and math-heavy material. It's no walk in the park, but the models explored really do help explain the economic phenomena of the past several years. I wouldn't take it unless you're going to use it for your major, but if you need it, I've heard it's much better than intermediate.",
    "I would recommend this course ONLY if you want to go to graduate school in economics. I'm a political science major that really likes Econ, and I found the class a bit unnecessary for my career goals. Prepare to work very hard, and use a great deal of math.That being said, you will get a lot out of this course if you put a lot in. Professor M is a great lecturer, and I feel like he multiplied my knowledge of alternative prospectives in macro.",
    "This class covers a bunch of math behind the theories of economics. Problem sets can be challenging, if only because they are somewhat confusingly worded, and the math is never demanding, just the interpretation."
