   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's strengths included in depth lessons on how to give a proper presentations and we had many opportunities to practiced the skills that we were learning. The one improvement could be that sometimes some of the lessons on experimental techniques were overly technical and specific, and perhaps not as relevant to everyone in the class.",
    "Strength: focus on learning the basics for research methods Weakness: none",
    "Strengths: professors, content, workload. Overall the course had many strengths. Dr. Moreno and Dr. Nelson were both great professor who really cared about us and the class. They gave fantastic feedback and put in a lot of effort into making sure that our writing and presentation skills were improved over the semester. The style of the course is also great (if you come into it knowing what this really is) - we got ample chances to get feedback on our proposal writing, public speaking skills, and presentations, but without it feeling overwhelming. The workload is pretty low (maybe like one assignment per week, pretty manageable for an upper-level seminar) and gives you time to actually work on improving. Weaknesses: organization. My only complaint about this course is the organization. It felt like I never really knew what was going on\/what was due until the week before, and sometimes had to email to confirm or get clarification on certain assignments.",
    "I really valued the opportunity to get detailed feedback on my presentation and scientific writing, and I also enjoyed watching other students present. I learned a lot, and I think it's great that this class attracts students with varying interests and fields of study. However, I felt that some of the class assignments and lectures were not relevant. For example, while I learned a lot from the librarian presentation on citations, I felt that the GIS presentation was not really relevant to our work. Some of the molecular biology lectures also felt like they didn't really relate to our work, and while they might be useful to know, it felt like we were going into a lot of detail with no purpose or direction. The class was sometimes disorganized, and there were times where we only knew we had an assignment due if we looked at Canvas ourselves. Overall, I think assignments and deadlines should be clearer.",
    "Ensures the engagement of everyone. Most lectures could be shortened.",
    "There could be much better communication by the professors on when assignments are due. The assignments themselves were difficult to find, and due dates were all listed on canvas, but in inconvenient places. This would be a simple organizational move that would make figuring out when to turn in assignments much easier.",
    "The strengths of this course are its dedicated professors (Prof. Moreno and Prof. Nelson) and its emphasis on teaching students how to improve their public speaking skills and writing in order to effectively communicate their research. A weakness of this course is its lack of communication about deadlines, which are sometimes hidden within documents and not easily seen on Canvas. However, by preparing ahead at the beginning of the semester, you can write down all the pertinent deadlines and not get caught off guard.",
    "The strength of this course is that its assignments really push you to be a better presenter and speaker. The main weakness is that there wasn't a syllabus with all the due dates. You had to go into canvas and check multiple places to ensure that you had all the assignments. Its an easy fix, but I was surprised not to see it.",
    "I think it's a really great course! Sometimes I was confused by what assignments were due, but in general, I don't think there are many changes that need to be made."

    "Yes! Absolutely. Amazing MCDB lab.",
    "YES!",
    "Wonderful class for basics on pres rjng research. Helpful if youre considering your research thesis.",
    "I would recommend this course, but you should know what this course really is though before going into it. The course is not really a lab, but a seminar, and is intended for junior MCDB majors and is designed as a thesis-prep course (but feel free to ask if you're not MCDB! I wasn't and I still got in). The majority of the assignments pertain to writing a pre-proposal and creating a full-length scientific presentation. You do both assignment in stages and get feedback on your work as you go along. There is also a journal club and few lectures about various different scientific techniques, and you go to a few scientific speakers\/seminars and do an evaluation of them. You also get to tour the FACS machines at KBT (or maybe in the new science center depending on what happens when it opens in the fall). I found this course to be a great way to get feedback on my scientific writing, and I learned so much about public speaking and giving a presentation. I will be presenting my work at a conference coming up and I found everything here perfect for preparing for that!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their scientific presentation and writing skills. I definitely learned a lot about how to improve my presentations, and I got more comfortable with scientific formatting for documents. That being said, the lectures are not as engaging. If a student is already involved in a lab (or wants to get involved in a lab their junior spring semester), this is a good way to get credit for that work and improve scientific skills.",
    "If you want to learn to write scientific proposal or work on your oral presentation skills.",
    "This is a great way to use your research to fulfill part of your lab requirement for MCDB. There are no tedious lab reports, and if you are working in a lab anyway you might as well get credit for it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any MCDB major pursuing research in molecular biology. You learn a great deal about how to best present your research in a format that is both professional and comprehensible.",
    "I would strongly recommend this to MCDB students who are planning on pursuing science as a career and even those who just want to have a great senior thesis project.",
    "Would highly recommend if you can get in! Great practice for the senior research project"
