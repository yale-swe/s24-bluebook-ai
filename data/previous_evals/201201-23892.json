    "The shop was a great asset in the building of the final models and the shop monitors did a great job of ensuring we all had access and kept us all safe.",
    "yes",
    "All of the resources available to me were sufficient for completion of this coursework.",
    "Yes, the facilities were adequate. However, given the mandatory large-scale building model requirement, it would be helpful if the class were given a stipend to help student groups with the cost of materials for the model - which were prohibitive in several cases this year.",
    "yes",
    "Fabrication\/shop resources were adequate, but the cost of producing the final models was at least the $200 (or more) allocated to Visualization 3, so I am unsure why this class can't also have a fabrication budget.",
    "It would be nice if we could get financial assistance with the large and intricate model we are required to make as part of this class.If we can get $50 per student for what I would argue is a comparatively useless project in Viz III, surely we can get at least as much for Building Tech."
