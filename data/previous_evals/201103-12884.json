    "Japanese 110 was fantastic, I would definitely recommend it to another student. It is challenging as it is a lot of work, but it is also very rewarding. You really learn a lot in just three short months. The teachers are energetic, the class is fun, and you're picking up a foreign language really quickly!",
    "Sure. I'm really glad I took it. The course is really intelligently paced-- I learned a lot from a semester, and studying for exams was really easy since you basically internalized everything just for going to class.",
    "Summary: Hard language, a good amount of homework. The teachers are fantastic and very helpful. I would recommend it for people who are really committed to learning Japanese.",
    "Yes, but I would recommend it to someone who has enough time to spend on L1 language.",
    "Good class. Lots of homework everyday though.",
    "Very, very challenging, but brilliant class to take. I would recommend it because of the discipline it teaches and the thoroughness of its teachers.",
    "Japanese 110 is a very rigorous and time consuming course, but be rest assured that if you want to learn Japanese, this course will help you to be well on your way. Classes are fun, interactive, and interesting."
