    "Learn how historical topics in sports have shaped sports in society today.",
    "Really gives you whole new lenses through which to view sports and society. I really learned a lot in this class and have applied it to other classes I've taken this semester. But it is a lot of work, so be prepared to stay on top of it all. If you can devote the time you need to get a good grade I highly recommend it.",
    "This is a very interesting course. It only meets once a week, however it is a lot of work and you have to be interested in sports in general. I recommend taking it.",
    "Completely recommend. Great class, but certainly not a light workload.",
    "I would recommend History of Sport to other students. The course explores modern sports and helps explain society's obsession with this form of leisure activity.",
    "Great class if you're into sports, but still enjoyable if you're not an ESPN junkie. Also, I imagine that the workload will lighten as it continues to adjust from being a junior history seminar to a college seminar.",
    "Definitely. I think it is going to stick with me more than I realize.",
    "Great class if youre interested in sports. Relevant, but more work than expected from a college seminar apparently, this class is writing heavy with a 10 pager, 20 pager, and a take home final. readings are decent, but you really have to do them to be able to participate, our class was really small.",
    "This course provides an interesting perspective on sport and is certainly missing a void regarding the study of sport. Even if you aren't a huge sports buff, this course examines the big sociological, historical, economical, and ethical questions regarding sport, so it can provide you with an interesting context to examine other aspects of history. Angie is a great professor and the workload isn't too bad. I would certainly recommend the course!",
    "The readings could be a lot if you didn't space them out over the week. The writing is a bit much for a class that doesn't give a WR credit, but if you're interested in sport then it's actually not bad."
