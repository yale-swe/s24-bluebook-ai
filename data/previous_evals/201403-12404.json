    "This course was a good overview of American education theory and practice. Professor Hersh is an interesting professor, though long winded at times, he puts in the time for you and is invested in teaching. I found the class enjoyable and learned a lot. Beware the papers are all single spaced!!!!!",
    "The next logical step after EDST110. I recommend this to anyone who might be moderately interested in education from any viewpoint.",
    "If you are interested in any aspect of education in the US, this course is worth taking. The class is a lot of work, but your writing will improve and you will learn a lot and probably make some new friends. Dr. Hersh is an expert, and really friendly & helpful. Make sure you start thinking about the long final paper ASAP so it is an interesting and meaningful project for you, not just a miserable one.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in and passionate about the material. You need to be ready to think, write, and speak critically about a very specific, very contemporary field. There is a lot of writing required for this class, which you will appreciate if you are invested fully in the course, and which you will likely resent if you are not. This is one of the best classes I have ever taken, not because it was \"fun,\" but because I learned a tremendous amount both about the subject and about myself as a writer, thinker, and student. Come into this class with an open mind and a readiness to write, write write! You will leave a better student and person because of it.",
    "A good class for students who are interested in seriously examining debates in contemporary education. You'll learn a good deal, develop your own ideas, and challenge others', both through class discussions and regular writing assignments. This is the first semester the class was taught, so it can only get better from here. Nevertheless, a few warnings: First, the workload is really onerous. I think response papers are a great and fair way to make sure students do the reading, but a four-page response paper every week can get frustrating. The midterm is ten pages, but the final is 25-30: yikes! Only take this class if you are prepared and understand the full immensity of the workload. Second, the class discussions can really drag, especially if people haven't done the reading or aren't engaged. Professor Hersh is happy to let you take the discussion in any direction you find interesting or provocative, but if no one is speaking up, things can get boring fast. So only take this if you're really prepared to engage with the reading and the discussions. Third, the course covers a lot of topics but is really theory-heavy; specifically, it is heavy on social\/moral development theory. This makes sense as that is Prof. Hersh's background, but it means that practice, research, and policy alternatives are pretty rarely discussed. If that's not your thing, don't take the class. On the positive side, Professor Hersh is delightful, kind, and has a lot of wisdom to offer. Some of the readings are really neat, and the course will get you thinking about the essential questions of education (why is it important, and how do we do it well?) in newer and deeper ways.",
    "EDST 210 only meets once a week, but there is a fair amount of reading. Professor Hersh really wants you to learn to think as if you were a peer of the authors whom you read, which is very understandable and how things should be. He even invited us over to his house for dinner\/class, which was a wonderful experience! If you are interested in learning about the true complexity of educational issues within our society and the (supposed) progress that we have made toward alleviating those issues, then I highly recommend this class! Class size is small and intimate, reading is interesting and important, and the professor is FANTASTIC! N.B. You MUST do at least most of the readings for this class. A lot of reading and a lot of writing, but totally worth it.",
    "A great course for students to understand the underlying theories that exist in most educational policy. I would suggest this course to students that truly want to make an investment in understanding what education is and what quality of education society believes they should be getting. It is a class that I believe all students should take to know more about what they want out of their own education. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but mostly to students interested in doing some education-related work during college or in the future. The readings can be minimal or very extensive, depending on the week, but the discussion can help in clarifying what is in the reading materials. There are weekly papers, as well, which makes it a writing-intensive course.",
    "This course takes up a lot of time, but it is incredibly rewarding. There is a great deal of reading, but the reading list is incredible if you are interested in education studies. It seems like just another survey course in the program, but don't be fooled -- EDST 210 is difficult and theoretical and time-consuming. There is a weekly response paper (4 pages), a midterm paper (10 pages), and a final paper (24-30 pages), plus a few weeks where you read and discuss an entire book. The work keeps you accountable to reading and thinking, and the professor returns your ideas with comments within a few hours of submission. The professor uses these responses as a starting point for discussion in class. All in all, I feel very grateful for this course and would recommend it to anybody who has the time and the passion to take it seriously."
