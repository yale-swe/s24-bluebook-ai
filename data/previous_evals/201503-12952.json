   "comments": [
    "Fun class. Can get dry at times though to all of the terms and analysis involved. The two composition projects are the best part of the class, but they are both very manageable projects. Stefanie is a good teacher, really helpful and friendly, though at times she can be a bit scattered. This was her first time teaching this course, so I think she will get better.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any student who is planning to study music theory as an elective that does not count toward a major. The concepts covered in 210 are fairly elementary, and for those seeking to gain an understanding of more complex topics, I would recommend that they take 211 instead.",
    "Music 210 is a good class to get your classical composition basics down. The material is dry sometimes, but it does teach you a lot and you end up enjoying the benefits of knowing the things you learn. Worth the work.",
    "MUSI 210 is somewhat different from the music theory I learned before college; it definitely helps to have taken AP Music Theory (I did not). I found it challenging but I learned a lot. To be completely honest, if I was not taking music lessons for credit, I'm not sure I would continue taking music theory at Yale, but it was an interesting class.",
    "Music 210 will be a bit difficult for someone who's never studied Theory before, and will be a bit boring for someone who has. At this level, I think that's just necessary. Great prep for a more in-depth music education, and I'm looking forward to continuing."
