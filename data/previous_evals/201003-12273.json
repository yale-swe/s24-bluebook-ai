   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a prospective student who,like myself, is not particularly inclined towards the sciences. The class provided an interesting survey of scientific issues without getting too technical.",
    "Definitely recommend it if you want to feel like your science credit will actually teach you something and you want to feel engaged in the class material.",
    "not too much work for a SC credit.",
    "At the end of the day, I probably wouldn't recommend this class. It will be less work than your other classes, but it will also be less interesting and marginally more frustrating because nothing you discuss in section is relevant to the tests. It's also annoying to have class at 11:30 on Fridays. If you don't mind a killer curve and you really need a science credit, it won't be the worst class you take at Yale, but it also won't get you out of bed in the morning. There's no final, so I guess that's nice.",
    "You go to lecture and are constantly told \"you don't need to know this for the test\" and then it comes time to study for the test and you are like \"well what DO I need to know for the test?\" You don't learn anything in depth. I guess this class is fine if you need a science requirement, but be prepared to feel like you have learned absolutely nothing.",
    "This class is very interesting. Not a ton of work and you are able to learn about science in a new way.",
    "Yeah take it-just be prepared not to care about the third module at all.",
    "good class for a non science major. I learned some cool biology things that I actually understood",
    "You might actually learn some cool stuff. Three exams that you have to study pretty hard for, but other than that this class wasn't TOO much of a pain.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward class and a good way for non-science majors to get a required credit and some information about important, um, issues in biology. It's a team-taught class, which can keep things interesting and moving, but that also means there's no way to get used to how exams work. Overall, it's an easy SC credit and has quite a bit of useful information, but it is not always the most engaging class.",
    "As a non-science science it's okay.",
    "I would recommend it as a good science credit and way to get a foundation in scientific literacy",
    "Good introduction to some basic bio. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a decent SC without much work. However, its not necessarily a joke of a class.",
    "Fairly easy\/interesting way to get a science credit. You just need to go to lecture because that's where all the material is delivered; readings are purely supplementary and for section.",
    "Expect to work hard in this class if you want to get an A or even a B.This isn't a \"gut\" science credit that you can skip out lectures on or not do the readings. And because the professors change midway twice, you really have to keep up.",
    "I feel as though An Issues Approach to Biology was precisely what I wanted it to be. It was an interesting course that focused on what I wanted to know, without making me feel as though I couldn't understand it at all.",
    "I do not recommend this class--find a better, less time consuming, fairer science class to fill your requirement. This was a 4 day a week class with tests that were narrow and sort of random, meaningless section, and generally some of the more boring lectures I've been to. Most people didn't go to lecture at least half the time. Don't take it.",
    "Take it for a science credit or if you are in the YPU.",
    "This class seems like it will be easy (and the professors make it sound like a gut at the beginning) but it will take up a lot of your time attending 3 lectures and a section per week, in addition to studying for really annoyingtests that focus on biological details (contrary to the theme of the class). The paper is interesting but just seems like additional unnecessary work. Take this class if you're interested in any of the modules. Lecture will bore you, but section could be interesting. But if you're looking for a really easy way to get a Science credit, I'm sure there are better ones than this.",
    "One of the best classes you can take as a non-science major (even if I would recommend this to science majors, as well). Very interesting subject matter (seriously - I often found myself looking towards section to see what people would say on the issues presented), almost no outside reading involved (no textbook, etc.), and the chance to explore a topic of interest in a five-page paper at the end of the term.One drawback: studying for the exams could be a bit difficult, since it is a non-science major class that nonetheless offers quite a bit of scientific information. However, manageable (plus, the class is curved).",
    "I would recommend this class because it was fun, the tests were not that bad and section was a blast.",
    "Very good class,. No homework just go to lectures and study a lot for tests.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend MB&B 105 to another non-science major because it is a fascinating and manageable class that gives students the biology and scientific backgrounds (factual information and biology\/scientific approach) necessary to truly wrestle with hot button science issues and engage in political\/economic\/ethical debates on science issues.For the most part, the lectures were engaging, easy to understand, yet appropriately challenging. I recommend taking notes on the bottom of each powerpoint slide to have more efficient and effective notes.The three lecturers (Tim Nelson, David Wells, and Bill Summers) were all excellent and are very helpful if you approach them after class.The readings were SHORT, interesting, and easily skimmable.Section mostly focused on the reading, so I recommend doing the reading right before section to be prepared to debate the issues brought up in the readings.The three midterm exams were difficult and almost entirely focused on the science, however, they were fair and doable if you studied hard.The one paper was a relatively easy and open assignment that allowed me to explore a biological issue of my choice.Overall, if you need a science credit, definitely take this course!",
    "Issues Approach is a great science credit for non-science majors. Take it if you have any interest in taking biology in college but are not eager to take an intro bio course with pre-meds and science majors.",
    "While I liked the material covered in the class, I found the class itself to be choppy and unstructured. Though the work load was extremely minimal, the tests were significantly more difficult and required days of studying in advance.",
    "Overall, this class is fairly interesting and provides different aspects of current controversial topics in the scientific world.",
    "This class was horrible in a multitude ofways. It's taught by three different professors who don't communicate with each other, so you have three tests that vary in degrees of difficulty. Because the tests are not cumulative, you don't learn how to play the game. There's no guidance when it comes to the final paper.In this particular semester, one of the professors was overwhelmingly in-depth (Wells). Another veered completely off-topic and veered from the syllabus, skipping interesting topics like HIV\/Aids to cover health and nutrition, making me feel like I was back in a high school health class (Summers). Finally, Nelson's entire unit on plants was simply dull and involved a lot of information and knowledge concerning a very silly topic.The lecture styles are lackluster, sometimes with too much information on the power point, other times with way too little. Very vague guides are given in terms of what will be on the test, other than one question from every lecture. The readings are pointless.Section is a JOKE, and the only place where the \"Issues Approach\" comes into play. Instead of making the lectures interesting, and infusing the issues approach with the biology as the course description implies, the issues approach only comes into play when you go to section. The topics\/discussion questions are generally far-reaching and dull, and it's hard participate unless you're one of the section jerks that everyone hates.If you can get over the frustrations, it's a decent SC credit and probably one of the easiest. But in terms of quality, this course is sincerely lacking."
