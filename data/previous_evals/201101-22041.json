    "I would highly recommend this class only to those who've finished at least second-year Japanese courses.",
    "Definitely if you're looking to take your Japanese to a serious, advanced level. You will also learn a lot about Japanese culture and history!",
    "It's consistent work, but just basic readings for homework that you didn't necessarily have to do every time, since we would read them together in class. There are only 2 tests, plus the final, so not too bad. Class is always fun, too.",
    "If you want to continue your Japanese study, I would definitely take the course. Nothing negative for me to say about it."
