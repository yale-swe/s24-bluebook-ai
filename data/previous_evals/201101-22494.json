    "There are several neuroscience courses at Yale, which focus on different levels of neural organization. Neurobiology, at one extreme, focuses primarily on neurons and their connections. This course lies at the other end of the spectrum, looking at high level neuroanatomy and cognitive function (fundamentals of neuroscience probably lies somewhere in the middle).Jeremy Gray is a very good lecturer and an excellent person. The readings and lectures for this course were consistently engaging. Grading isn't too bad--just do 4 of 6 \"target articles\"--basically summaries of papers we read--and two midterms and a final. For the tests, make sure to cite examples and be very explicit--grading can be capricious.Overall much recommended to anyone, particularly to psych\/cog sci\/biology types. Very manageable SC credit, even if you haven't taken intro psych.",
    "This course was basically an intro psych course with some added fMRI studies to name the area of the brain associated with each section. I would not recommend this course to another student unless it's necessary as a pre-req. I'm really interested in neuroscience, but this course was too broad, and did not spend enough time on the actual science part of neuroscience to hold my interest.",
    "Take this course if it meets later than 9am. That was a tough time for complicated material in a lecture course that was not highly energized. Otherwise, be prepared for the exams and really memorize brain regions.",
    "Its definitely a challenging class. Some lectures are a lot more interesting than others but if you need to fulfill a psychology requirement for the major i'd take this one.",
    "Be ready to have to know a ton of stuff. Lectures aren't engaging. Information is fun, but tedious. Tests are brutal.",
    "Don't take. Terrible class. The lectures are confusing and worthless. I didn't learn anything, and the tests were vague, subjective, and didn't reflect anything you knew. Basically, your grade felt completely random. Professor wasn't even capable of grading the second exam, so the students graded their own. It makes it pretty hard to concentrate and do your best work, when it's likely that a good percent of the class cheated.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject and you need a science.",
    "Psyc 160 gives you a solid introduction to the field of human neuroscience, taking you through both some major techniques used in neuroscience research (you read several scientific papers) and what neuroscience has found in different areas of inquiry (language, memory, emotion, pleasure). The reading is manageable and complements the lectures well - especially when you are given papers to read and then he sums them up in class and clarifies the main points of them. I thought Professor Gray was great and he's approachable if you don't understand something and need him to clarify. I thought the course was a lot harder than intro psych in terms of understanding the concepts and memorizing which parts of the brain do what, but it was a rewarding class.",
    "only if you need a science credit.",
    "No, it is very boring. Gray is a boring lecturer and not very good at explaining things. Also, his tests are hard.",
    "If you are willing to put the work in to study for the tests, its very interesting. A lot of memorization",
    "I took this class because I wanted to get a Psych major requirement out of the way, and to see whether or not I want to go into neuroscience. It's a good introductory course to human neuro. Class was really early in the morning, and the lectures are not the most lively things, so if you're not a morning person don't take this class. Also, if you're not really interested in the topic, it'll be tough getting through. There's a lot of reading, and most of it is dense. Also, Dr. Gray's lectures are informative, but he does not spell everything out on the slides. You're expected to use the information he gives to interpret, make inferences, and come to conclusions largely on your own. In that sense, it can be a tough class if you're not completely dedicated. The tests are all short-answer, and sometimes the questions were really open ended. They were graded based on if you hit on certain key terms. However, since the questions were vague, I wouldn't know to mention a certain term, and get points taken off. This was frustrating. I'm glad I took the class because I can say that I'm familiar with neuroscience, but it was not an enjoyable experience.",
    "This class teaches you about the intersection between psychology and neuroscience. It is very different from it's counterpart, Fundamentals of Neuroscience, which seems like it doesn't really offer many correlates to actual behavioral and social psychology. I only took this course because it was a List B that ended in zero (for Psych majors).The material has the potential to be very interesting especially if you already have a basic understanding of neuroscience, however since I felt like I was forced to take this class and wouldn't have chosen to take it otherwise, I felt that it was too specific. It asks you to learn very detailed parts of the brain which can get confusing.However, definitely do not write this class off. With a decent amount of studying, you can do well on the exams. The content of the tests is fair. (This semester for one of our midterms we did this weird thing where we had to grade the exams ourselves which was super stressful but probably won't happen in the future). Professor Gray is a very likeable guy and very accessible. You can definitely do well in this class.Also, this class is a science credit and that's always a plus.",
    "Prepare to study a lot on your own.",
    "I do not recommend Psych 160. It is a science credit, but it has a lot of busy work and the material is not all that interesting. If youre actually interested in the subject matter, I suggest taking an MCDB one.",
    "A good intro class, I recommend it. If I would have taken it earlier, I would have done more with neuroscience here. I don't recommend it as a senior unless you have to: lots of response papers, two midterms, and a final, none of which are easy enough to slack off much. Great sophomore course in my opinion. Jeremy Gray is very nice and flexible, though his test can be a little tough \/ hard to understand.",
    "If you are at all interested in the material, TAKE THIS CLASS. It can be tough at first, as you have to start by memorizing the parts of the brain and how they connect, but once you have the basics down, the material is incredibly fascinating and rewarding. I learned more in this course than almost any other course I've taken thus far. If you are a psych major, this is an absolute must. The familiarity you gain with the structures of the brain and their functions will help you in almost any other psych class you take.",
    "YES. Fascinating topic - a more psych aspect of exploring the mind\/consciousness\/self, so it was great for a science credit that wasn't TOO science-y. Professor Gray is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had and genuinely wants his students to do well. 3 tests and 4 short response questions throughout the semester. Tests are reasonable and cover mainly lecture material, so definitely go to lectures.",
    "I didn't really enjoy this class as much as I would have liked. The material could have been interesting, but I don't know if was presented that well. The professor was kind, and at least was always willing to help. The PPT slides\/lectures were always really confusing, even if you wrote down word for word what the professor said. Tests were also really hard to understand, and I often felt like I didn't know why I was losing points, despite studying a lot for them. This was very frustrating.. And... 2nd midterm REALLY should have been graded by the professor, but was instead given to the student to grade himself\/herself. I do not think I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "Human Neuro offers an overview of the workings of the brain and current research. Engaging and accessible, this class is ideal for non-science people who want an Sc credit, but don't want to take a gut. The workload is not light, but it's very manageable, and the midterms and final were pretty fair. You come out with a new appreciation for neuroscience, cognition, and all of that fascinating stuff. Attending lecture, however, is essential - though you can get behind on the reading, missing classes will make the midterms\/finals very difficult as Prof. Gray goes into much more depth in his explanations in class than in his Powerpoints. Professor Gray clearly cares about his students and makes an effort to share his passion for neuroscience with everyone.",
    "Not the easiest class by any means--you'll have to do a lot of memorization to do well on the midterms and final. But you will leave with a sense of the major topics in (human) neuroscience and a much greater understanding of how the brain works.",
    "I would say, if you're interested in Neuroscience then definitely take this class. If you're not, and are just looking for a science credit or think it might be kinda cool but aren't really sure at all, then don't bother. It's pretty difficult and it's hard to get up at 9am for lecture. That being said, as someone who IS interested in neuroscience, it was really really cool, interesting material and I learned a LOT. Professor Gray is a really nice guy - not always the most engaging lecturer (again, 9am is pretty rough), but definitely not boring. He's also REALLY good about getting back to you with answers to questions right before exams. Themidterms and final are hard, but manageable if you study a lot. The course is a good overview of human neuroscience, and a great intro for someone who thinks they might be interested in more advanced psych and\/or neuro.",
    "i would recommend this class. while the sheer amount of information proved challenging at times, i truly feel i learned a lot from this course. it's a great way to get a sc credit, especially for those coming from a non-science background. tests were a little tricky at times, but fair. prof gray is a great lecturer, and just an all-around nice guy. after taking this class, i have a whole new appreciation for the brain now, and can never look at the brain the same way again.",
    "Avoid. Lectures are dry and end too early. Midterms and exams have annoying open-ended questions that will leave you frustrated.",
    "This is a really good intro class for the brain sciences. If you are interested in the brain, you will enjoy it.",
    "Do not take this class. Going in, I was a psych neuro major. Coming out, I'm not.Gray is easy to talk to, but he can't write exams and can barely lecture. The course wasn't a science class, but rather intro psych with brain regions attached to each new concept. Lecture was boring.If you have to take it, take something else.",
    "Neuroscience is a really cool field, but the way this class is presented is subpar. It's unfortunate that we have to exposed to it in this way because the class just doesn't cut it. If you're into neuroscience, though, I'd recommend it. Prof. Gray is most definitely not the best professor in the world (in fact, he's really very far from it) so if you have a chance to take another neuroscience class not with him, take that one instead. Cool material, exams are kinda hard and vague, target articles are easy, Prof is incompetent.",
    "There are easier ways to complete a science credit. If you have no neuroscience background, it will be difficult to keep up. The lectures were pretty boring, professor Gray got off topic a lot which made him hard to follow. Also, there is a huge discrepancy between the amount of detail you are expected to know on the exams and the amount professor Gray gives you in the lectures. The exams were pretty painful, but if you kept up with the work throughout the semester and studied hard they should be doable. If you're interested in the brain, I suggest you try a different course.",
    "confusing, i would recommend brain and thought instead.",
    "This was a decidedly mediocre class. It was your classic read-off the powerpoint, large-lecture course. Not only that, the lectures and slides were not all that coherent, and the exams were basically regurgitation of memorized facts. I feel like I learned some important things and read some interesting papers, but overall it was not inspiring.Professor Gray has an astounding ability to make interesting topics dull. His voice borders on soporific, his lecture slides bordered on incoherent, and he really failed to convey passion for the subject.The lecture our TA gave was the best lecture we had for the entire course.Only take this if you have to.",
    "Definitely if you are thinking of being a psych major, but perhaps also if you are not and want a Sc credit that is not terribly difficult and is certainly entertaining.",
    "I would recommend you take this class, especially if you're very interested in the material. I wouldn't take it if you're looking for an easy science credit. For a science class, though, there was very little hard-core science. The \"science\" mainly involves memorizing brain regions and their relationship to human behavior. This is also a course better taken with friends. I would recommend this class, but only if you really like neuroscience.",
    "I do not recommend it",
    "What can I say, the material is interesting, but the experience of taking this class has been hands down one of the worst in my Yale career.Lectures often ended early, meaning the material was only gently touched upon by the professor, when a much deeper level of understanding and memorization was required on the exams.DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH THE SAME PROFESSOR. YOU WILL REGRET IT.",
    "Interesting subject, boring lectures, no section, difficult and somewhat unpredictable tests. The second test was strangely self-graded due to lack of a TA. Would not recommend.",
    "This was a really interesting class, but lectures weren't really engaging or interesting. I also didn't really soak in the information during lecture, but once I studied it I realized that it was pretty cool stuff. You definitely have to work to understand the material, but if you put in the time it definitely pays off and is worth it. The target articles are actually a great way to understand those journals and definitely help for exams. The workload is manageable and the readings aren't too bad. He's good about not making you know all the tiny details of the studies, just the big picture. I wouldn't worry too much about the textbook but definitely do the other readings, especially the target articles. Professor Gray is really sweet, but not the best teacher. But he does let you know what you should be doing and is really great about being available for help. He definitely cares about his students. Even if you're not sure about being interested in neuroscience (I wasn't), give this class a shot. I'm really glad I took it because I learned a lot and in retrospect it was really interesting stuff. Just be prepared to put in the work to understand it - it's doable, though!",
    "Choosing this class is my biggest regret of this past semester.",
    "Not the most engaging of courses.",
    "Don't take this class.",
    "A good science credit. Take if you are actually interested in the topic as it will be easier to get through the reading load.",
    "Take this class if you have to for your major. Otherwise, consider one of the other nueroscience options which have received stronger reviews.",
    "A lot of memorization, many acronyms, and it's unclear what Gray expects of you on exams. but you learn a lot.",
    "PSYC 160 is an excellent course, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless the student is particularly, desperately interested in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Do not take this course if only mildly interested in or curious about basic neuroscience. Do not assume that intro psych will be appropriate preparation for this course. Do not expect, as a non-science-major, to use this class as an interesting Sc credit.",
    "Don't take this class, especially if you're looking for a science credit. Its not particularly easy, lectures make what would seem to be interesting topics pretty dull, and there's tons of minutiae to memorize",
    "Only if you are interested in the topic and need a science credit."
