    "Great class. Professor Reed has a lot of experience in this area, which makes for a very interesting class. Great lectures, and Prof. Reed provides you with all the seminal papers on the course website. Like any senior seminar, this class requires a lot of self-study if you want to really understand the material, so it's only appropriate for people with some background in solid state.",
    "Great into class to heterojunctions that builds on the previous material from EE320 also with Prof Reed. He does a great job of explaining all the ideas, devices, and making the class fun and interesting. I learned a lot by taking this class about a topic that is not available anywhere else at Yale. If you are interested in semiconductors, definitely take this class. A lot of these devices and topics and not the most recent (many from 1980s or 90s), but it is an important foundational class.",
    "Great EE elective. Definitely take it if you need one, and have room in your schedule.",
    "Heterojunctions is an advanced solid state\/electronic devices class. If you don't have the background for it, don't take it. The problem sets are very challenging and require quite a bit of time, but there are not many of them. No final, just a final presentation. The lectures are interesting and the content of the material is extremely challenging, but it is typically only treated at a conceptual level. You have to come to lectures if you want to understand the material. If you're not into device physics, don't take it; you'll be bored and confused. If you have an interest in the subject, I highly recommend it. The amount of understanding and knowledge you gain is much greater than what you might expect for the time you have to put in the class."
