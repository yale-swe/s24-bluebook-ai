    "it just like L1-L3 except you solidify more grammar concepts and the quizes are combined with grammar and vocab. if you can, take this course with Alessia! i have had her for 3 semesters and she is WONDERFUL. very fair grader and willing to help!",
    "I would recommend it for distributional requirements solely. Good teacher, but syllabus was monotonous and boring.",
    "Pretty standard intermediate course, picks up where 130 left off. The videos are slightly weirder this semester. After two semesters of Spanish I continue to be impressed with the attentiveness, kindness and dedication of the professors in the Spanish department. Not sure if Alessia is returning next year but she was great.",
    "Spanish 140 is your typical intermediate Spanish class. The workload is not too difficult. You will have homework almost every night but it usually is very quick. The tests can be challenging but ultimately they don't count for a huge portion of your grade. Alessia is a very good teacher, very easy to understand.",
    "The class is great for either fulfilling your language\/major requirements or taking it out of interest."
