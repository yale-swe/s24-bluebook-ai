   "comments": [
    "I think this seminar is necessary for the students to practice professional skills, which is helpful for future work.",
    "I thought many aspects of the course were very useful. The break outs with peers were less useful because I felt like peer review of my resume and presentations was less useful. My peers do not really know more about this than I do. I also REALLY wish it was not over fall break. I was pretty overwhelmed my first semester and could have used the break for mental health. I would have been willing to come to Yale a few days early before the semester started or something to do it and keep my fall break",
    "I enjoyed the course, but I found the resume review with other students to be quite counter productive. Instead of using the hour\/half hour constructively with our individual instructors, we spent time with other students reviewing our resumes. The other students may not know what to be looking for in a resume and did not provide constructive criticism. In addition, the public speaking portion of the course left a bad taste in my mouth. Instead of criticizing my public speaking, she instead got caught up on the content, which was frustrating.",
    "it was okay. could have been scheduled for a different time of the semester.",
    "I exempt but I would have liked the option to participate in some parts of the workshop. But I didn't want it so much I was willing to get up early in the morning to participate.",
    "You should do it right before the start of the fall semester.",
    "helpful.",
    "should be on a weekend earlier in the semester",
    "Helpful in interview preparation and internship search",
    "wasn't really useful or what i was hoping. maybe better to do department specific career workshops as many people were not in my department so we couldn't contribute much since our goals and intents were so different. the resume part was a waste of time since the career coaches never even looked at them. the speech part was the best because my coach spent one on one time with me. big lectures were a snooze.",
    "resume stuff was pointless since a trained professional never looked at my work. Why didn't we get to have a cocktail hour or something at the end to actually practice networking? interviewing portion was surprisingly helpful",
    "It was very helpful for helping ease anxiety about public speaking. During my subsequent class presentations, I felt more comfortable sharing my work and ideas. Instead of holding the seminar during fall break, it would be better to incorporate it into orientation.",
    "good - get to know variety of studies in the field",
    "I think there some useful things to gain from the seminar but there were a lot of things missing that should have been included. Most of those things were career advice specific to public health professionals. For example they said epidemiology is a jargon term. No, it's not. Epidemiology is a subject field and epidemiologist is a job title. Anyone that I'm talking to potential jobs about will know and if they're not sure they can clarify. Another thing was that the resume review felt pointless because I didn't get any professional feedback on my resume--just feedback from students like me who don't know very much about resumes in the real world. It would have also been nice to cover CVs and to have a segment on LinkedIn (like what you should put on your profile). I think a lot of this was compounded by the fact that it was Fall Break and we had to be there (SUGGESTION: have the Professional Skills Seminar be the same day as new student orientation, just use a different building. Fall Break of the first semester just feels so soon to be going over everything when I'm just trying to remember where my classrooms are).",
    "Besides being sexist (instruction for females how to dress, wear their hair, put on makeup), this course overall felt like a waste of my fall break. While I do see the merits of the material being taught, they were presented in a pedantic way that was not productive. Most people were fine at presenting and really did not need to present a powerpoint in front of a group to improve. The only salvageable parts of the session were the resume and interview skills. The seminar does NOT need to be three days long, and definitely should not take the place of fall break.",
    "great and helpful. especially from the fellow students.",
    "This class did not provide specific public health focused information which was a major detriment. I felt as if I was back in high school again, as the instructor was condescending and rude.",
    "Wa a very very useful course for me.",
    "I did appreciate some of the help, but I really could have used the Fall Break. Oh, also there were very rude 5 year students (who are currently in their 5th year at Yale), which definitely brought the group down and made me way more self-conscious and nervous in a negative way.",
    "I know it must of taken a lot of work by the Career Office to organize. I thought it was good not great. The timing wasn't ideal. By fall break everyone was really tired and many resented having to sit through a whole other seminar. The workshop topics were really basic- about how to craft a resume and cover letter. Also, the peer review of resumes wasn't all that useful. I would recommend shortening this whole experience into maybe 5-6 hours. Have students give a presentation to the coaches, do a practice elevator pitch and book a 20 minute period where each student can meet with a coach to go over their resume. Also please remove from the schedule the woman that talks about emotional vampires. This wasn't helpful and the whole time it felt like she was talking down to us.",
    "It's a good opportunity to get skills in resume, cover letter, lectures and interview. However, the current course set does not take personal difference into account. Maybe it's better to let student to choose their week point and enhance some particular skills",
    "Would have benefited if this professional skills seminar was incorporated into orientation rather than keeping students for fall break.",
    "I was honestly really disappointed and had high hopes for this seminar. I wish they would have focused more on linked in profiles and networking practice. It would also be beneficial to focus on social skills like not taking your shoes off or chewing with your mouth open or yelling really loudly. Some of these things seem like common sense, but so do resumes and people needed help with that. It was unfortunate a waste of time, and I did not learn anything beneficial. The program could be improved by separating people into groups by their career path: group students going into the work force together, med school applicants together, and PhD candidates together. This way, you can give more concrete advice rather than general \"it depends on your field and...\" comments.",
    "This zero-credited professional skills seminar should definitely not be a requirement, especially over fall break. I feel that if someone needs extra help writing a resume, that they already submitted to get accepted into the MPH program and thus must at least be somewhat acceptable, then they should set that up on their own time with the career center. However, if this seminar has to be a requirement then it should be shorter than 3 days long and should be offered instead during orientation. As students, we have worked so hard leading up to fall break that we should be given that break and not revoked of it.",
    "Excelkent. Improved my resume and interview skills.",
    "I exempted out of this course.",
    "I thought that the professional skills seminar was really quite helpful. I feel like I'm much more aware of myself in a professional setting than I was before, and we were given some very useful tips about things we can do to improve the way we come across in that context. I thought the timing of the seminar was apt, and it was an intense few days that galvanized me into updating my resume and preparing myself for future interviews.",
    "It was actually helpful to go over resumes, do interviews, and work on presentation skills - it feels pretty superficial, but its useful skills",
    "Good course to take.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar. I think a better job should be done in explaining it to students, before they opt out of it. I think the professionals who are brought in to teach us did an incredible job and its a shame many students missed out because of what second year students told the first year students.",
    "The Professional Skills Seminar was useful in helping us to get started on our cover letters and updating our resumes. I think the course could have been more useful with the use of the professionals that participated. In several of the sections we had fellow, unexperienced students provide feedback on our resumes. It would have been more useful to even spend five minutes with the professional to get their feedback on our resumes.",
    "did not attend, exempted",
    "Poorly constructed for students who arent health policy or healthcare managment. needs a second prof skills seminar for each direction a student is planning to go into:PhD, med school, healthcare, working world...",
    "I liked when we had the opportunity to engage with the coaches, and when the speakers made things interactive. I wish there was more time for interview prep, in exchange for the repetitive activities. I think most of us could have used more time with interview prep",
    "The Professional Skills Seminar was extremely valuable. I met with coaches who helped me improve my presentation style, interviewing, and resume. This seminar was a great use of my time and I am thankful for the opportunity to have taken it.",
    "was too peer oriented for critique of professional skills, which isn't particularly useful",
    "Strength:Forced me to work on my resume, interview skills, 30 second elevator pitch, and presentation style. Weakness: I don't think Samantha Sutton's input was helpful. It was the same commercial pitch we've been hearing since our senior year of high school -but under different, more catchy umbrella terms. Instead, bring alumni or employers who talk about the most common mistakes made my Ivy League applicants.",
    "Different time of year, 1st semester is already too busy and not having a break really makes it unhealthy for students",
    "The course did not seem very helpful for people looking to gain professional skills. This was information helpful for undergraduates, not for graduate students",
    "Doesn't adequately teach ethics.",
    "It was useless for people who have never had any professional skills training. It is difficult to learn new skills over the course of three days.",
    "I think there is a lot of potential for the seminar to be incredibly helpful to students. As it stands, I think it focuses way to much on presentation skills and far too little time on things that are more pertinent to students - i.e. resume building, interviewing skills etc... I think far less attention should be put on presentations. I also think there is way too little sensitivity to how differently students conceive of their talents and their skill sets. I think the portion where we are asked to envision our future careers and think about what talents and fears etc... that go led us to that career choice should be done in MUCH smaller groups, and should take up MUCH more time. As an aside, a little more variety in the food would also make the week much more enjoyable.",
    "This was one of the strongest components of my education at YSPH so far. I appreciated the opportunity to get individual feedback from trained instructors, students, and career advisors over the course of the class.",
    "A waste of time.",
    "Very helpful in getting students to look for jobs effectively.",
    "This seminar is very well-organized and was very well-executed. I took away many useful skills.",
    "very well designed, promoted strong student participation to maximize their time",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar - I received some very valuable feedback on my speaking style, resume, and interview presence. I'm really grateful for this experience.",
    "Very insightful and thought provoking course.",
    "I think it's definitely useful. I wish that we had more practice rather than listening to theory.",
    "Great course. Very helpful."

Needless to say, I do not find him to be an approachable instructor, even if his lectures were moderately useful.",

I definitely recommend this course for students who are unsure of or lack confidence in their public speaking skills and for anyone who wants to learn how to create a succinct, but engaging presentation.",
    "Just ok. I mean, we all have to do it and there are a lot of great things that can be picked up from it but there are a lot of improvements needed.",
    "If you have to take it... lectures were pretty useless, but some of the breakout activities (elevator pitch, practice presentation, interviewing, etc. were actually somewhat helpful.)",
    "This was not helpful to people who were planning on pursuing research. Also, the activities were somewhat sexist (saying that women should wear makeup and put their hair a certain way) and not constructive. The course also took place during fall break, which is not only inconvenient, but unfair.",
    "Strongly recommened",
    "",
    "get out of it if you can or do everything you can to try to convince them to change it to a different time of the year. but if you can't get out of it, make the most of it.",
    "Before grad school, I worked for 3 years but for the most part at the same place. Since I hadn't interviewed in a while so it was useful to think about the elevator pitch and have a coach look at my resume briefly. I think if you have more experience giving presentations and networking, I would definitely waive it. I don't regret not waiving it but I definitely thought it should have been condensed. Many of the workshops are too general to be useful.",
    "Help you a lot",
    "I think given a few tweaks to the format, this professional skills seminar could be something great.",
    "You will have your resume reviewed by other first years that have never been in the workforce (hence, they're there--- anyone that has been in the work force for 2 plus years and knows what to look for qualified out). The next day, you will practice giving your pitch to other first years, and lastly you will have practice interviews with other first years. The group facilitators will not go over your resume\/interview you\/ect. Although some do try to give positive advice. All of your questions will be answered with \"It depends,\" as everyone in the program has a different path. If you can qualify out, do it.",
    "GREAT workshop for resume building, interview skills, professional mannerisms, etc.",
    "Although it is an intense few days, if you participate seriously and engage with the coaches you can really stand to gain some important pointers. Also it is good to know what you look and sound like through videotaped interviews and presentations!",
    "It's required, but actually useful if you'd like to polish your professional skills.",
    "Yes, recommend--was very helpful.",
    "This class REALLY needs to be conveyed in a better way. It comes across like an unnecessary annoyance in orientation and no one was looking forward to it. After taking it- I believe it was truly invaluable, and I suggest having students convey this information rather than the staff to the first years next year. Have actual second years tell them how great it was and that yes it sounds annoying but it is so, so important.",
    "I waived this course",
    "Yes, the course sums up a lot of professional skills that graduate students need to learn before graduation. I learned a lot of things that made a huge difference I the way I approach the job search.",
    "It was an amazing opportunity to improve our skills that will help us professionally. Honestly, I don't think students should skip the seminar, because I know several students who placed out because they've been working but could have really benefited from the sessions. It there was something to make it more fun, maybe a happy hour one night, that could make people less upset about missing break",
    "I would recommend this course to all incoming first year MPH students. It is helpful for preparing for the internship process. I gained many new skills and resources from taking the course.",
    "No; not a good use of time",
    "It's helpful if you are willing to put in the time and effort to do the homework.",
    "Required.",
    "Try to get placed out if you can. This course should not be over fall break. We work hard and instead of being rewarded with a break, we have to do even more work in the midst of all of our midterms.",
    "The information is helpful and you learn skills but i do not think the workshop should take up all of break. It can easily be combined into one efficient day. Spent too much time with unnecessary practice.",
    "Helpful, but too long.",
    "This course is a unique opportunity to learn from well-trained public speaking and interview coaches in an interactive, immersive way. The learning environment is very collaborative with the way the course is organized, providing opportunities to receive both constructive feedback and encouragement from peers. While it may be painful at first to watch yourself on video and critique your own public speaking skills, as the course requires, by the end of the course, you will be glad you had to take it.",
    "Unnecessary, and a waste of our time.",
    "Take it. It can't hurt and you will learn at least a few good tips to help you get a job or internship.",
    "maybe reduce to two days rather then three days next year",
    "Take advantage of this seminar! The more you invest in it, the more you'll get out of it. Go in with a positive mindset and treat it like a serious skill-building opportunity.",
    "Great course which addresses relevant topics and allows sharing of ideas. I would recommend it.",
    "You need to do it. It's not as bad as it's made to be. You can actually gain some important information.",
