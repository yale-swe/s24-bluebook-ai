    "Instructor: Joseph Gabriel Schiavo \u00a0Joe is a good teacher who balanced sections very nicely. We began with a brief recap of the week's lecture, then Joe would work out some example problems on the board to bring home the concepts from the lectures.

Additionally, Joe was very proactive in grading and providing the students with extra study materials and practice problems, and made himself available for office hours and a study session the weekend before the final.",

    "The course is valuable, but I audited and therefore perhaps did not get the whole experience and therefore didn't benefit as much as I otherwise might have.",
    "A poorly designed class. It seemed like the professor designed the course in a way that would minimize his interaction with students, avoid questions from them and establish a very hierarchical relationship. The auditorium where the classes took place was unnecessarily big but served well to place the professor _high above_ the students and disseminate people enough that there was no room (or time) for discussion. A 3-credit class that was divided in one-hour sessions. The two hours taken by the professor were not very relevant to solving the problem sets, and little reference was made to the reading materials. TAs were responsible for teaching most of the contents, since the professor didn't cover them during class, but they only had one hour a week (often starting at 8pm!) and had to rush it. Also, the reading materials were from 1930 - 1950, little reference was made to current environmental economics work like the one being done by other colleagues in Yale."

    "The mid-term examinations need to be redesigned and improved. I appreciate wanting to combine short-answer conceptual questions with problem sets, but 50 minutes is simply not enough time to expect a student to sit down and be able to think critically and fully answer the questions. The exam was caught between wanting to test if you paid attention during section and wanting to test if you could think more deeply about the main points of the lecture. In doing so, it lost out on accurately measuring both aspects because of the 50 minute timeline. The exam should have been 50 minutes of a straightforward problem to test the concepts in section, or 50 minutes testing us on the theory and its application as was presented in lecture. If the 50 minute timeline is going to stay the norm, the test needs to be designed to be a straightforward problem set. But, if it is possible to extend the length of the test, the current format incorporating both qualitative and quantitative questions can be kept. For clarity, I enjoyed the challenge of the short-answer questions and the math problems, however, given the compressed timeline, if one did not immediately know the answer, there was no time to sit and analyze the problem and formulate a solution. One simply had to move on to the next question because there was too much to do in 50 minutes. The tests failed to accurately capture a student's ability to critically think, simply because there was no time to do so. This meant that studying for an exam quickly devolved into wrote memorization rather than actual learning. The final exam was perfect, because of the extended timeline. The test itself was actually only 6 questions longer than a midterm, but we had over three times the normal amount of time to complete it. That allowed students the time for critical thought and analysis in the short-answer section, rather than just having to scribble down buzzwords and phrases.",
    "Exam evaluation is not consistent across TAs. Sections are not required for those with strong quant background. Hence they should not be made mandatory. Assignments and Research paper can be given higher weightage in evaluation. I did not come across readings published after 2012. But found readings from 1930s!",
    "Make it a 4 credit class taught in a smaller classroom that allows debate: 2 hours taught by professor, and at least 2 hours for section. It would also be useful to use some kind of materials - since there was no book and the readings were irrelevant."

   "comments": [
    "There was a large schism between lectures and sections. Lectures presented theory with occasional graphs and equations, but never went through a given problem in class. Section was left to re-emphasize the theory and do practical exam-type problems that seemed to be the TA's \"best guess\" on what would be asked on the exam. I am in no way advocating for problems to be exactly the same as on the exam, but I have to assume from the disparity between what the TAs taught in each of their sections (which widely varied, based on office hours interactions) and what was on the exams, that there wasn't much guidance from the professor to the TAs. If there was guidance, it wasn't evident to the students. This really harkens back to the main flaw of the course, which is that it could not choose between being a lecture course or being a quantitative, problem-set course.",

If you are an FES \/ grad student: This class might be very time consuming and frustrating because of the lack of debate. Unless the relationship with the professor is useful for you professionally, I'd recommend trying to find another. Try to find a group of students you can rely on to do the problem sets together, do not spend time doing the readings but maybe try to work on your final paper throughout the semester alongside the professor, so that you get the most out of the course.
