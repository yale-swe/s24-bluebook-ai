   "comments": [
    "This is a very good overview of every aspect of culture during WWI. I would definitely recommend this class if you are at all interested in WWI and need a seminar. It is not too much work. The only big project is the final paper at the end.",
    "You should take this class if you're interested in learning more about WWI. There is a lot of reading, but it goes by quickly because a significant portion of the material is personal accounts of the war. The discussion can be a bit slow sometimes, but the course itself is interesting.",
    "Great way to dive into cultural history. Take it if you feel comfortable with research on your own--this seminar isn't big on theory. Lots of awesome readings.",
    "The title of the course speaks for itself-- don't take it if you're interested in the strategy or battles of the war, but do take it if you're interested in cultural impacts such as themes of shell shock, separation between the home front and the soldiers, commemoration, etc. It's definitely a worthwhile class, and Professor Cabanes is very nice. He also picks some great movies that everyone should see.",
    "scary because you have NO IDEA how you're doing in the course at the end. no feedback, no grades.",
    "This course is not an introduction to the Great War. It requires you to have some background knowledge of the historical events surrounding the First World War in order to give students proper perspective when diving into the war's many impacts on European cultural society. That said, it was an extremely interesting and informative course that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the topic.",
    "It's a very intensive, relatively reading-intensive course. The term paper at the end of the semester allows students to focus in on a topic that interests them, which is makes for a rewarding experience. I would definitely recommend this course to a friend.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "This was a great class! Professor Cabanes is a really good teacher, and the discussion topics are all interesting, and things you won't get to talk about in a more politically oriented class. There is a lot of reading for some weeks, but most of it is worth it.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested in WWI and who want to write an in depth paper",
    "Yes, definitely. This class gives a unique perspective on WWI. If you're interested in warfare and generally in the history of the World Wars, then this is a class you have to take. Professor Cabanes, is great and knows a lot of the cultural aspects of WWI. Discussion was usually good in class.",
    "This class is a look at the cultural aspects of WWI -- including the home front, rituals among soldiers and the role of women. There is little battlefield history involved, so if that's what you like, this may not be the class for you. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who already has an interest in World War I, as it does not spend a lot of time covering basic facts about the war."
