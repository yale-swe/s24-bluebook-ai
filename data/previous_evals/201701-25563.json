    "The course was extremely disorganized. Shane and the TA didn't seem to care about the class at all. They never uploaded lectures online and liked to send out last minute announcements.",

    "I found this course to be fun without at all feeling like it was so fun\/ frivolous that I didn't learn anything.",
    "If interested in BE, yes!",
    "I think this class is great for someone interested in behavioral economics and psychology. I was very interested in the subject and found some of the material fascinating, but overall I was disappointed with the class. I came in expecting to learn more about a personal favorite subject of mine; ultimately I got turned off by the way the class was run. Help was not available, problem sets were too difficult and the grading too arbitrary. It was also very disorganized with last-minute assignments and updates. However, I do appreciate how dedicated Shane is to making the class engaging and entertaining. But I still would strongly recommend you look elsewhere.",
    "Frederick is a great lecturerer. The 3 hour class flies by. The material is interesting. Frederick (and TF Andrew) bring the material to life.",
    "There are particular students that would love the course. It is certainly not for everyone but these students who find the dynamics of the class good will have the best time with it."
