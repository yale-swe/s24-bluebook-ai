   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you are looking for a WR credit. There was hardly any writing.",
    "Prof. Denning has an extremely unique way of looking at labor in global capitalism and his lectures, as well as the books he assigns are totally worth it. This is one of the classes I wanted to do the work for. Denning is also very understanding with deadlines, etc. The class itself is a good brain teaser. Especially during discussion sections, I barely had time to talk because i was thinking of what I wanted to say.",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in learning about the effects Capitalism has on the lives of workers. This is a strong course detailing labor history through laborers in a global scheme of Capitalism. Its strengths lie in the enthusiasm and knowledge of Professor Denning. This year the course was a hybrid lecture and seminar course. The lectures were strong and the incorporated readings were equally powerful. The first four books we read were excellent.",
    "Take this course if you want an introduction to labor studies of the 20th century. It is taught by one of the field's preeminent scholars. I took this course in a seminar with him, and in the future it will probably be offered as a lecture I loved the seminar, but the lecture would probably also be incredible. However, if you're an grade obsessed students, you've been warned\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Denning openly states that grades are not necessarily the most important thing to him. It is currently December 26 at the end of this term, and I have yet to receive any grade for any of my work throughout the course.",
    "This has been one of my favorite classes, I highly recommend it. The required reading is very enjoyable, there's lots to learn from the lectures. But mostly I liked this class because it was so participatory. Everyone had something to say about each reading or presentation, and a space to say it. The freedom in selection of the book and research presentation topics, along with the guidance Prof. Denning offered, made the second half of the semester especially fun.",
    "An in-depth look at the effects of capitalism on the lives of people throughout the 20th Century. Totally multi-media - theory plus movies plus novels plus articles plus comics. TAKE IT.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you have any interest in the history of capitalism, 20th& 21st century labor evolution, and a truly in depth perspective of daily life from the changing perspective of the global working class. The assignments were really flexible too, basically any research topic you find interesting within the framework of the course.",
    "I would recommend the class. While most of the time work is discussed from the standpoint of work management, the class looked at work from the point of view of the workers themselves. The focus on daily work and life makes it far more relevant than abstract political thinking or making history a string of big moments with nothing in between, but that's not to say that the class ignored those. The class gave new insights into the nature of social movements and the politics of a working class in revolt that were deeply appreciated. It's a great class to kind of ground yourself in when everything else seems to be about the abstract and metaphysical, so it's worth a shot."
