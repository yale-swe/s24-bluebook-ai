    "This course challenged me intellectually and added considerable depth and breadth to my knowledge of political theory and philosophy. I was able to frame the course themes in light of scholarship far different from what I normally engage with. I gained new perspective and have been able to cultivate more complex thinking on the themes of citizenship, national belonging, and exile."

    "I thought it was difficult to make sense of the overall 'point' of this course. Some of the reading (e.g., Judith Butler) was especially difficult and I thought we could have spent more of the class discussing the arguments in depth with guidance from Professor Benhabib instead of leaning so heavily on the student responsible for writing a response paper.",
    "Strength: High difficulty of discourse. Weaknesses: what I bring to the table - this course, more than any other, sends me away with a genuine necessity\/desire to read more.",
    "I enjoyed the format of weekly presenters with ample time for Professor Benhabib to lecture. I also found the final week's guest speaker a helpful addition."
