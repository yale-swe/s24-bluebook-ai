    "Yes, US-China relations is something everyone should know and its a good class",
    "This was a great class! I'm not sure if Professor Wang will be teaching it next year because he's a Postdoctorate fellow, but I really enjoyed it.Every week, one student would be responsible for the readings: that student would send questions via e-mail to the entire class the day before, and then lead the discussion the day of. Professor Wang struck a good balance by allowing us to lead the discussion, but remaining active in the conversation by adding supplementary information or tying together certain facts or interpretations into a general note about the status of US-China relations at the time. Discussion was slow sometimes, depending on ifstudents did the reading that week, but I thought it was generally good and Professor Wang made a large effort to keep things moving. We chose which weeks worked best for us to lead the conversation, so try to finalize your midterms\/finals schedule and work around that.The readings were really interesting, and I felt like I got a pretty complete picture of US-China relations during each time period. Professor Wang cared a great deal about our class and was really receptive to helping us out on our assignments during office hours. Assignments were limited to an 8-10 page midterm paper and a 20-30 page final paper.",
    "Yes, the subject matter is rich and important for anyone wishing to tackle US-China relations.",
    "A great survey of US-China relations since the early 1800s, focusing mostly on the nature of the Sino-American relationship in the 20th century.",
