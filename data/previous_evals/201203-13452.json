   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in education reform the course does a great job at looking at national policy and understanding how it works in local communities like New Haven.",
    "Just know what you're signing up for. there is enough reading to drown you, if you're not careful. Those 150pg reading packets (complete with dense primary sources and photocopied books) can just crush your soul once it hits November and you're really sick of school. Not to mention the 500+ word responses each reading packet requires. The final is a three part submission--proposal, memo, and final paper (typical of research courses). It can be a really boring research project if you're not in love with the topic. I'm actually submitting this evaluation as a form of procrastination for the final. It requires a real dedicated amount of time to do well.That being said, the course was INCREDIBLY informative. Take this if you're trying to go into education. The class felt very pre-professional. It felt like what I imagine an entry level job will feel like. Teachers are great. Michelle and Julia were kind and friendly. I don't imagine this recommendation will be very helpful.. both professors graduate Yale Law this year. But on the off chance this class is offered again--happy course shopping.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you are interested in education. I thought I was and learned through this course that I wasn't. But a lot of people entered and had the opposite experience. Take it if you think you might ever want to go into education as a career.",
    "A seminar on education in new haven. Reading responces 1 per week on a large reading packet, and then a final project. Manageable work load, the professors were extremely eager and happy to meet with us outside of class.",
    "This was a fantastic class for someone interested in education and policy. The weekly reading and responses were always interesting, and the variety of topics ensured that the material always felt new. Class discussions were fun and interesting. It was great to feel more involved in New Haven by learning about the city politics and going to local schools. The final project was a great way to really focus on a specific area in which you are interested. I put a lot of extra time and research in this class because I got really into it, but on the whole the course was a reasonable amount of work throughout the semester. Julia and Michelle were great teachers and did a fantastic job leading the class.",
    "This class was really great. Julia and Michelle were so committed, and you could tell that every decision they made regarding the class activities, syllabus, and assignments, was well thought-out. We had some really cool speakers and the assignments taught me exciting skills such as how to write in different ways that I hadn't know before. Also, the readings are from a variety of sources which is really cool and more exciting than some other classes I've taken.",
    "YES! I care about education and if you do then you will like this class. It was also a great opportunity to actually effect change while taking a class. I got to meet with people in NHPS and discuss how they can improve and learn about their strategy. The contacts that I got will go way beyond this semester.",
    "If you are interested in education reform but dont know much about it, this is a great class to learn the basic issues surrounding the education reform debate. It's an engaging and chill class that takes general readings and applies them on the NEw Haven level, which is particularly meaningful if you've ever been involved to any extent with education in New Haven. THe content is always relevant and exciting, and it's one of the few gems on campus that makes you more connected and involved with the city of New Haven, which is refreshing!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. It was a great overview of the Ed reform movement, with a particular focus on New Haven. The workload was also very manageable",
    "Really awesome course if you're passionate about ed reform, or really would like to get passionate about it because the material may inspire you.",
    "If you're looking for a policy-level education course that isn't super intense, this is your course. Each week covers a different topic in education reform, with class divided between lecture, discussion, student presentation, and activity. Workload includes weekly reading responses, a few small assignments, a final project comprising several pieces of writing, and an in-class presentation. While that sounds like a lot of work, it didn't seem overwhelming at all. Another perk of this class is that it's New Haven-focused, so if you work in New Haven at all, this is an excellent opportunity to learn more about the communities you're serving.",
    "I would totally recommend it, especially if you're interested in ed reform as something to do post-graduation. Super useful.",
    "Great course to really understand the issues in education today at all levels - the classroom, the school, the city district, the state, and the country. Julia& Michelle are awesome!",
    "It is an amazing seminar about education reform. Don't think it will be offered again but Michelle and Julia both have an extensive knowledge and experience in education and are great resources and mentors.",
    "If you are interested in any type of education work, or in city of New Haven, this class is definitely worth taking. Does a great job of covering a lot of ground education-wise while familiarizing you with the New Haven school district.",
    "Survey of urban educational challenges and applicability to New Haven.",
    "Absolutely! It's incredible how little a Yale student can know about New Haven and specially considering the education issues and all the reform that is going on in CT, it's extremely important that every student be exposed to what's happening. I would totally recommend anyone who is interested in New Haven, politics, and\/or education take this class."
