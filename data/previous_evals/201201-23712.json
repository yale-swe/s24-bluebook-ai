    "Question 1 - - It would have been nice to have a few more supplemental readings, especially in the beginning, to put the casebook into more familiar territory.Question 2 - - While I appreciated Marjorie's style of addressing things as they came up, especially in the beginning I could've used some more straightforward explanations, a glossary, etc.Question 7 - - Marjorie was wonderful, a breath of fresh air!Question 8 - - great class.",
    "Question9: I think there should be a mandatory filed trip to a planning board or ZBA meeting. If it was officially on the syllabus, it would be easier for us to plan accordingly.",

    "Learning about land use law from a seasoned, enthusiastic practitioner in a low-key environment.",
    "Vigorous in class discussion",
    "Having this class taught by a practitioner was invaluable; someone who knew the law but also knew how things work in the real world, and was working on cases dealing with these issues.",
    "Marjorie's attitude and instruction and the atmosphere of the classThe go the speed we need structureFun assignment\/paper to finish upLearned a ton",
    "The professor. She works in the field and gave us a lot of practical advice",
    "Attorney Shansky is dynamic, fun and very knowledgeable.",
    "I found Professor Shansky delightful to learn from -- she is very kind and considerate, and is also very clear in her approach and in her explanations.This course provides a great introductory overview of legal land use issues and is beneficial to anyone who will be dealing with zoning issues in their future work.",
    "The instructor was very smart, extremely nice and supportive, and a very eloquent and good instructor.",
    "The opportunity to learn from an incredibly knowledgable and experienced practitioner in the field. The bridging of practice and academia was one of the most beneficial aspects of this course.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "I think it would have been great to establish a field trip to a local planning meeting right off the bat. Instead, we waited until the end of the semester and then only half the class was able to make it to the meeting. A mandatory field trip (with several date options) would have improved everyone's understanding of how a zoning board\/commission meeting really works.",
    "Would really be helpful to have the first class be a primer on law - not even land use law, but just law in general. Most of us had never seen a case book before, weren't sure how to read it, interpret it, etc. It was a skill eventually learned, but if it's explained earlier it would help us get more out of the course. Much of the legal jargon is unavoidable and fun to learn, but at the same time, could be distracting for our purposes.",
    "A bit more organization at the start would help",
    "The professor should start with explaining the main concepts. We went over them as we came to them over the course, and some were not made clear",
    "Please leave a copy of the text on reserve in the library.",
    "increase the pace, maybe have little responce papers?the exam had very little to do with what we were learning--also its BS to allow people to use the internet for an exam. Posing scenarios with questions like many law classes would have been a better format since that is how the rest of the class worked."

    "Do a presentation on a topic you really are interested in.",
