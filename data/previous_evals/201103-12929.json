    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a good amount of work if you don't want to feel behind all the time but it is definitely worth it.",
    "Fourth year Russian: no more textbooks, more readings and movies!",
    "Russian 160 is a great final language course to be really prepared for conversation and reading\/literature classes. It can be a lot of work, but you'll find yourself using the concepts regularly and improving noticeably.",
    "This course was extremely helpful as a continuation of Russian language. Likewise, Dolgova is excellent, though she has high expectations for daily work.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it; it's essentially just chatting around a table in class, learning vocab and some more advanced grammar concepts. It's not too high-stress, but I honestly feel like my ability to just speak in Russian has drastically improved."
