    "I learned how to interpret international law and agreements.",
    "Very broad overview of international environmental law. A bit of treaty analysis done but very little comprehension of the field gained.",
    "the nuanced language used in international treaties and the ramifications of its interpretation by different nation states",
    "Apart from the nitty-gritty of intl e-law which we discussed in lectures, this class taught me how to really go through a treaty and figure out what it means and what its real life implications are. We also walked through the treaty negotiation process, and I undertook the most extensive law research I've ever done.",
    "I did not have a background in international environmental law before taking this course, so it served as a great introduction to these topics that I hope to further explore in future courses.",
    "I learned a lot about analyzing treaties and international law.",
    "I learned how to effectively analyze international legal treaties and how they apply to environmental law",
    "The course was fantastic, I learned so much just from listening to professor Robinson's insights. He is a wealth of knowledge.",
    "Through this course I gained a foundation in the processes, principles, and applications of international environmental law. I saw the usefulness of various agreements and the many steps the international community will need to take to address the looming issues our planet faces. The research paper allowed me to delve deeply into a particular issue and develop writing skills, as well as deep understanding of that particular topic in international law."

   "comments": [
    "Opening the class to multiple levels of students was helpful at times, but I don't think students fully understand the legal implications of a law class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Robinson really cares about his students and will make time available to meet to discuss research topics. Weaknesses: Very little engagement; a seminar turned small lecture that eliminated any opportunity for workshopping or discussion.",
    "the course is essentially like a research supervision where you choose to analyze a treaty and write a research paper on it. professor robinson guides you in terms of your arguments and critique, and he is a great resource since he knows a great deal about the subject matter. the research paper is like a thesis, and it would help to have the students started on it sooner in the semester rather than later.",
    "Strengths: Cymie and Nick are absolutely incredible, are at the forefront of their field and so knowledgeable and willing to guide you in your individualized research. Weaknesses: The course would benefit from far clearer expectations at the outset. I still am unsure how our projects\/presentations\/paper will be graded, and am also unclear on some of the particulars of writing a law research paper.",
    "I think the course should include more discussion rather than lecture. Also, it would be helpful to have more paper deadlines to ensure that students have drafts ready by a certain date.",
    "The course was great, but I think it would benefit from a slightly longer allotment of time.",
    "Professor Robinson and Payne brought a wealth of knowledge to this course and decades of experience actually participating in the process of developing and litigating international environmental law. Their experiences and insights were one of the strongest aspects of this course. The paper was also a good assignment to develop research skills and a deep understanding of how international environmental law works in one particular case. The primary weakness of the course was its disorganized nature and the lack of any graded work except the final paper. Very few instructions were provided regarding this assignment and it was difficult to ascertain what Professor Robinson expected. Furthermore, because it was the only graded assignment of the course, it took on a very high-stakes feel and made the final few weeks of the semester very stressful. I think that spreading out the work a bit by shortening the length of the final paper and by assigning a couple short papers or other assignments during the semester could help resolve this issue."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked how many topics we covered! Definitely would recommend.",
    "Yes",
    "Survey course of international environmental issues and history of law in the field. Professors are very knowledge. This is a lecture, not a seminar. No assignments except a paper which you get no guidelines for at the end of the class. If that's your cup of tea, go for it. I took it credit\/D and I'm glad because I have no idea what my grade would be otherwise.",
    "Unless you have some grasp of law, most of it will probably go over your head and seem like you aren't learning anything at all. Be prepared for 0 grades throughout the semester and then a 25 page paper with no guidance due at the end of the term. I have no idea how I am going to do in the class, and although I did get to work closely with a treaty for my final paper, I don't feel I left with anything else from the class.",
    "if you want to learn how to analyze international treaties\/are interested in going into environmental policy, this is a great course. professor robinson is like an encyclopedia and speaks for the whole 2 hours of the seminar making it more like a lecture instead of a discussion seminar. while it may get boring at times, it is inspiring to see a man know so much about the material!",
    "Fantastic course if you have a specific passion within intl e-law and want to intensively research it while guided by some of the top experts in the field. If you're new to the field or if you need clear expectations of the course at the outset, this might not be the right course to start with...background in both intl law and e-law will help a lot, and the specifics (e.g. grading, paper expectations) are not as defined as they should be. However, I found this course to truly be a strange and wonderful opportunity. You will learn the ins and outs of treaty reading, negotiation, law research writing, and gain specialty in your chosen field. I entered this class thinking that most of intl law and e-law was futile and bad...and don't get me wrong, a lot of it is, but I also have a weird sense of hope for developments in some specific realms of it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend class because Prof. Robinson is very knowledgable and helpful and you learn a lot.",
    "Definitely take this class! The professors are great, and other than the final paper there isn't much work. Since the final paper is on a subject of your choosing, the whole class becomes very interesting. I would highly recommend the class to anyone interested in the future status of the environment.",
    "Yes! If you were interested enough in this class to click this far the take it! Robinson is an incredibly knowledgeable man. He knows his timelines like no one else I've seen. Reading and lecture can get a little bit dense sometimes, especially at 9am, but there are a lot of cool class activities that make up for them (simulated negotiations,etc.) You'll really get a handle on the framework of International Environmental law. Don't leave you paper to the last minute! (Which will he hard to do as Prof. Robinson will meet with you as often as you need).",
    "Absolutely! There aren't many classes available on international environmental law and this one is wonderful!",
    "I would only recommend this course if the student is aware of what they are getting into. The vast majority of the work for this course is one very long final paper, with the only other real work being weekly readings. Professor Robinson was willing to provide lots of assistance along the way, but it was still a difficult paper to write and the instructions were not always clear. The broad topic was interesting, but the weekly readings were not particularly engaging. The class was also a hybrid lecture\/seminar, but often took on more of the characteristics of a lecture, with Professor Robinson lecturing for the majority of the classes."
