    "The class was well organized and structured, and I particularly appreciated the student-led discussion sections as it allowed students to take the position of lecturing. A couple of the modules were particularly out-of-place, such as the electron transfer module. Some of the techniques modules (X-ray and cryo-EM) had a surprising amount of mathematics involved, and were not taught sufficiently well to make sense. A big turn-off of this class was how the instructors often threw all sorts of mathematical equations at us without explaining them well enough to make them intuitive enough for us to see the nuances and implications. They really made it very confusing to both learn and study later. For instance, the very definitions of key variables (e.g. \"recovery time\" -- is it half-time?) weren't clearly laid out and were already set in the problem sets."

    "If you are genuinely interested in biomolecular structures, this class will definitely give you a very strong understanding of the detailed insights and considerations about them. The class also teaches a great deal (half of the class materials) about the main biophysical techniques used like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, which are critical to know going into the field. Nonetheless, the instructors and lecture modules vary widely in the class, and a lot of the mathematics were not explained well enough, which adds more to the already sizeable workload. So overall, if you are genuinely deeply interested and ready to take on the workload, take it."
