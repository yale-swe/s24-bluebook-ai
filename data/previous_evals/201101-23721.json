    "What can I say. If you are going to take Spanish L2, definitely take it with Maripaz. She is very approachable and encouraging, and her classes are very well organized and easy to understand. I've decided to take both L1 and L2 with her, and I think that in itself already says a lot.",
    "Strengths: Learned SpanishWeaknesses: I felt some of the grading was biased.",
    "I loved Spanish 120 and would definitely recommend it! Not too much work, but you'll be amazed at how much you learn! Maripaz Garcia is an awesome teacher - very clear, straightforward, and engaging.",
    "Yes if you have to take it",
    "It's a crash course through the main grammar points of Spanish. Whether it's solidifying your knowledge of imperfect vs. preterite, learning and mastering the subjunctive, or learning all of the future and imperative tenses, 120 is all about grammar and beginning to use your knowledge to begin forming analytical answers, not just responses in Spanish. It's a building semester for sure. I would recommend it if you love the language and want to be able to take your speaking up a notch.",
    "Yes. It's a good course, it's a lot of work though.",
    "It's a language class, so you know what you gotta do.",
    "extremely recommend...it's wonderful!"
