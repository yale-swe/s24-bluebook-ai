    "Literary analysis.",
    "This class gave me the skills to effectively analyze and understand the undercurrents that define contemporary French literature. It was also a helpful in that the professors' feedback definitely made me aware of where my writing could use additional development.",
    "The course was really fantastic at giving a really concise and interested overview of French literature since the 1990s. Many of the texts were enjoyable to read and explored modern subjects and language. I also learned a lot about current French authors, French literature prizes and tastes, and French publishing houses. That said, I learned to skim French books like a champion... This class has a lot a lot a LOT of reading that becomes very overwhelming very quickly. Some weeks will be 300 pages of reading and supplemental activities. I felt I missed out on a lot of meaningful discussion due to simply not having the time to finish the readings.",
    "French literature analysis Modern French publishing industry and how it functions",
    "French oral and written skills",
    "I improved my ability to analyze French literature, especially large quantities--the pace of a book or two per week stimulated growth in my reading capabilities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I found the class to be well-structured and extremely well-taught; Professors Cadieu and Kaplan are both fantastic instructors, understanding but demanding and so, so well-versed in their fields. I enjoyed the structure of every class, involving collaborative work and some elements of more lecture-like teaching (background on various publishing houses or authors), and also the readings. My only issue was often being unable to finish a given book because of the amount of reading for that week.",
    "First of all, this class was wrongly named on the bluebook. It's not \"French Fiction\" it's \"French Literature.\" I was slightly turned off to realize that we would be reading a lot of autobiographies, memoires, and autofiction works. I was expecting to read more fiction stories than what I got. Also, this class would be greatly improved if it met twice a week and had less reading due at a time. It felt like I had a weekly bookclub for which I was never fully prepared because I didn't have the time to read the book. If the class met twice a week it might be able to dig a little deeper into some of the texts and be a little less overwhelming work-wise.",
    "One of the perks of studying *very* contemporary literature is that its authors are mostly still around -- and thanks to our wonderful professors, the class was able to directly interact with some of the creators of our favorite texts. Literary culture truly comes to life, through the vibrant book list, translation exercises, slang glossaries, etc.",
    "An amazing class in every way, however a bit less reading would be great!",
    "One great strength was the teaching--I loved both professors and I thought the fact that they co-taught the class allowed for intellectually diverse discussion. The literature was for the most part involving, and the pace of the course was good. One small critique was that all the literature was depressing! Part of me wonders if even one book in the course could be uplifting, but at the same time, perhaps the tone of the books is largely indicative of French literary culture in general."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! Both professors are truly excellent, the works are good, and you'll learn a lot about literary analysis and the complex literary world of France today.",
    "Eh. Maybe if it met twice a week instead of once and if the workload were 3\/4 of what it was. Otherwise I'd skip.",
    "Yes! If you are very good at french (written and spoken), and are interested in contemporary french literature, take this class!",
    "Absolutely take this course! The texts are accessible, the topics relevant and diverse, and the discussions fun and engaging. Professors Kaplan and Cadieu make a great team, and the 3 short + 1 longer papers aren't bad at all.",
    "Yes on every level!",
    "Yes. It's a tough class, but the teaching is phenomenal and the books are very well written. It is a great opportunity to practice spoken French as well."
