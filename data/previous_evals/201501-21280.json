   "comments": [
    "This is a sequel to PLSC 500. If you didn't take 500 it will be very difficult to succeed here. It builds on a great deal of material and the presentation is unorthodox. This is a strength of the course but be prepared to work hard. The material is very challenging and the course is ambitious in scope but you won't find a better course covering the same material at Yale or probably anywhere in the wold. I would recommend it provided Peter is teaching it.",
    "This course is excellent. I would recommend everyone who is doing field research in economics, public health, environmental science to take this course. Causal inference and observational studies have been a huge topic and it is essential for researchers to understand the basic ideas of these topics. Before I took this class I actually don't understand underlying logic of regression and i only know the mathematics part and this course provides a new perspective.",
    "PLSC 503 is a difficult course, with a lot of confusing subject material, but ultimately you will probably do fine. I imagine the course will change dramatically once Peter is no longer teaching it (it will probably become a lot more conventional), so a lot of my advice would probably be unhelpful. But I will definitely say that if you decide to take this course, set aside a lot of time for the psets and readings!",
    "Requires prior knowledge in R but manageable with the TA. Weekly problem sets could be tiring, but definitely worth it for anyone interested in research. Its a great learning experience",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "I learn how to think critically about applied research and am cautious about analyzing data from observational studies.",
    "This course was extremely helpful for writing my thesis. I'm already putting what I learned while working as an RA",
    "I've gained the basic literacy in quantitative methods I need to be a critical consumer of political science research, and to begin performing my own replication work. Peter's have been by far the most valuable classes I've taken at Yale."
