   "comments": [
    "It made me more knowledgable about energy technology and the relationship between technologies and pollution, carbon emission, etc, but did so in a fairly superficial way. I feel like we never delved deeply enough into any subject to truly make the class worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend it only as a good class to get a sc\/ qr credit.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The subject matter is fascinating, but most classes consist of a boring lecture that will somehow make interesting material dull. The group project was fun and helped us learn the real costs and benefits of different energy sources. Problem sets and tests were easy and short. The article discussions were great, but this class needs discussion every day to make it engaging.",
    "Overall, I probably would not recommend this course. While the subject material is very interesting, it was not taught in an engaging manner.",
    "This class was fairly easy but too lecture-based for a seminar and confusing at times. All the parts were very disconnected. There is a problem set every other week and an article discussion every other week, which is probably the best part of the class. There is also a project, which I learned a lot from. I did learn some interesting things, but I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Can be a bit boring at times, but a good way to get a science credit if you need it. The work is manageable.",
    "The class has a lot of potential and occasionally was very interesting, but many times I feel as though there was no connection between topics. It was a fairly painless way to get a science credit though. If you've had a decent science background in the past its not too bad.",
    "This is a seminar class that feels more like a lecture. There is somewhat of a disconnect between what is learned in class and the problem sets, but there are good features to this class that make it a good way to earn a Qr\/SC credit.",
    "After experiences like Energy, Technology, and Society, I often find myself wondering \"Wow, how can I describe this to the average, ignorant ETS-virgin?\" I cannot convey through mere words what takes a lifetime to truly understand. In representing such a vast expanse of knowledge, I feel that, no matter how much care I take, my response is inadequate. How can the student who has merely rested a toe on the path of understanding represent through his words the path's essence. Finding myself forced into such a situation, however, I can only ask the question that I have already had to answer. Are you ready for Energy, Technology, and Society? You may not know at this moment. You may not ever, but if you are willing to learn, to close your eyes and sense the world in a new way, then you have taken the first step. After merely stirring a toe in the depths of Energy, Technology, and Society, I cannot in good faith use my own limited understanding to attempt to recommend this life path, but I can say that it has not let me down yet. If you're interested, take the leap, and discover where your feet land.",
    "ETS, as we affectionately called it, changed my life. Before this course, I wanted to be a stay-at-home Dad. After his course- I want to devote my life to the greatest challenge facing my generation. See- I was raised by Conservatives, who listened to Glenn Beck rather than scientists. Although before the course, I knew in my heart that they were wrong (as they are in everything), now I have the arguments and scientific evidence to back up what I was saying before. So thank you Paul Fleury- for enabling me to prove my parents wrong once again. And he did this while also conveying his expertise on sigfigs and unit conversions- which is basically all of what science is anyway.I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone who plans to live on earth or have kids who would prefer to live on earth because this course provides an insightful and fascinating background on the single most important issue facing mankind over the next 250 years. However, I don't recommend the class to anyone in Directed Studies. Here's why- Paul \"don't use to many sig-figs when you got no idea that you're initial numbers are accurate\" Fleury does one thing- cuts through the BS, which may be hard for DSers to deal with.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The material is very interesting, but the professor makes it very boring.",
    "I enjoyed my time in the class, but I would only recommend it to those who are genuinely interested in today's energy issues. It does not require scientific expertise and is not a lot of work, but I think that it may be difficult for people not interested in energy-related topics to really enjoy the course."
