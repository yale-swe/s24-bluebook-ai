Although sometimes the discussion was challenging since there were so many materials had to be covered in ahead of the class, it was helpful to get a sense of concepts that we learned.",
    "The Discussion group was incredible.",
    "A new way of teaching where students have to read the materials first and come well prepared in class to discuss with the instructor. Beside from that, the content itself was very compelling since reforestation is very important in this world where climate change is a big issue, mostly driven by human activities, causing forest and species loss. Understanding the technics and social values for successful reforestation is very important.",

    "The course is too short to cover the material properly, and the discussion sections are too short to properly discuss all the material.",
    "Discussion seemed overwhelmed by trying to summarize the readings and thoughts\/questions. It may have been valuable to break discussion into smaller groups or with fewer readings to get beyond thinking about \"readings\" and thinking more about on-the-ground implications of the course material.",
    "We already gave our evaluation to the instructor in the end of the class.",
    "The way that the reading materials are used in class. Too many readings and no time to reflect on them.",
    "I felt the in class discussion couldn't fully cover all the materials that we previewed before the class since there were multiple materials. I wonder if it would be better to have less materials and have more focused discussion or have more class time to cover everything deeply.",
    "The online material should be made available to the students beyond the length of the class for reference.",
    "Time and workload.",
    "Case studies should be more widely focused and not just specific continents",
    "The class workload is very condensed over 6 weeks and would do better if it is spread out over a the entire term. Field trips would also be something interesting to add to the course.",
    "The quizzes felt a little random and nitpicky to me. It seems like they are perhaps worth a little too many points for being such as small part of the overall scope of the course. I spent about 100 times more time working on my final paper and on the weekly questions."
