   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: power system Weakness: the second half of the class is kind of simple",
    "Some of the initial homework assignments were way too in the details and took too long to do. Strengths: I learned a lot in this course on how to think about the full energy systems. Weakness: there were some overlap in material with classes that I took in the past.",
    "Strength: broad topics",
    "I love that field trip to the power plant. I hope there can be more interactions in class.",
    "The lectures could be more engaging and interactive.",
    "Professor Rao's willingness to engage student's questions, the thoughtfulness of his assignments, his encyclopedic knowledge, and his scholarship otherwise all stand out as exemplary. In all earnestness, it's hard to name specific strengths of the class since it was such a wonderful experience across the board.",
    "Strengths: The course tried to provide a holistic view of the energy scenario around the world and offered an international perspective. Weaknesses: Students could have been introduced to actual practical tools such as modeling softwares which could have had more application outside of the classroom and in the professional world",
    "The course could definitely be more organized. The homework assignments were definitely effective in helping me learn, but the questions were frequently unclear and needed clarification from a TA. The final brief was also a worth-while assignment to complete, but more specific instructions would be very helpful.",
    "I thought the strengths of the course were the lectures and guest speakers. Weaknesses were a few of the problem sets, which seemed unnecessarily repetitive\/redundant.",
    "Problem sets are insightful",
    "Strengths: the problem sets were very thoughtfully designed and engaging; the lectures were well developed, easy to follow, and interesting; the professor and TAs were very accommodating of questions and feedback Weaknesses: some of the readings were a bit inaccessible and they were not referenced in class as often as they could have been, creating a bit of a disincentive to actually do the readings Improvements: I would suggest creating checkpoints for the final brief throughout the semester (topic selection, outline, etc.), to motivate students to start it early, which would ensure that people got more out of that exercise than they would if they wrote it all at the end of the semester",
    "As it is a survey course, it is understandable that some topics will be covered a little too briefly for some students to understand. For me, the thermodynamics and heat transfer lecture left me confused. Also, when looking back at slides, it could have really helped if the equations and formulas were better labeled with the variable letters and what they represent. But this class content was very interesting. I appreciated the quantative focus, especially on the psets which were well designed to be fun and informative. The discussions about the social, economic, and political contexts were valuable. Though, I could have benefitted from a better explanation of how topics were expected to be understood for the midterm. It is great how the final brief was open to be about any fascination we had.",
    "Lectures are quite dry and the topics were somewhat sweeping and broad. I would have preferred the class to be flipped in order to incentivize attentiveness, with short quizzes after the main lectures (similar to the structure of the physical sciences foundations course). That being said, I really appreciated the learning that occurred over the course of the problem sets.",
    "The class is well-organized with clear themes. I wish the class utilize more multimedia and demos during class.",
    "I wish the class had skipped some of the more basic physics concepts (W = mgh) for example, but some of the other people with different backgrounds had trouble, so maybe this is a necessary issue. Overall, the class was excellent though.",
    "I found the earlier parts of the class related to calculating efficiency parameters and other physical characteristics of energy systems particularly challenging. This is not necessarily a weakness of the course, but it would be helpful if there could be additional resources built into the class especially for people who don't have as much of an electrical engineering or quantitative background. I also think expanding the time with which we have to work on the final brief would be helpful. Given the almost limitless range of potential topics, it might be a good idea to have students submit their ideas earlier and then work on the paper for longer. Given the breadth of the topics available, it's challenging to really say something of substance within only 10 pages. Perhaps the end results might be more useful if either the scope is narrowed a bit, or the time allotted to do research etc. is lengthened.",
    "Very technical content. Should be simplified a bit.",
    "Great for students who do not have strong background in energy systems if you are not afraid to spend time for the class. The way the course is defined makes it a surface course.",
    "Due to the various expertises and backgrounds of the students in the class, it was difficult for the professor to find a middle ground to teach the course. For instance, some of the problem sets were engineering focused and were difficult to solve. Additionally, the problem sets were not worded in the best way and were very long.",
    "Better wording of excel assignments - although the assignments were challenging and very good.",
    "Overall, I greatly enjoyed this course. I gained a basic grounding in the physics and engineering behind energy systems and was exposed to a range of key topics in energy policy and markets. Recommendations to improve: 1. The lectures did not prepare us well for the homeworks. It would have been helpful to briefly walk through examples similar to the homework assignments in class. Effectively, we relied on the TAs to teach us this material rather than the instructor. 2. Similarly, the course and homework did not prepare us well for the mid-term exam. I would create a couple of short homework exercises at the beginning specifically designed for students without a background in science\/math to bring them up to speed (either required or optional but highly recommended). I recognize this may feel basic for a graduate program, but many students come in with little preparation in or recollection of electrical engineering or physics. Repetitio est mater studiorum.",
    "The class was well- organized. Material content was very relevant and it had an international focus.",
    "Assignments are too simple for students with technical background and a lot of the discussion class surrounds very basic mathematical concepts",
    "The lectures were sometimes strengths- when things were explained clearly and the material felt accessible. The assignments were very challenging for me and I don't think I would've been able to do them without extensive hours working with other students and going to office hours. The course material was sometimes challenging for me as well- I came into the class with little background of energy systems and I sometimes felt a little lost in lecture. But I really did appreciate Professor Rao's perspective on global energy systems and getting what I could out of the class."

    "Do it!",
    "Do not expect to gain technical (engineering) knwoledge, however the class covers many perspectives, including social perspective",
    "I would say that if you don't know much about energy systems, you will learn a lot in the class, although there will be material that you probably won't end up understanding. I got a good basic understanding of energy systems and considerations, though I would not be confident in replicating the material that was covered on the assignments.",
    "Its quite disjointed, hard to get an overall arc of energy systems. But there is some great learning if you piece it together."
