    "A great fifth class. Lectures are always joyous, and the assignments are actually pretty enjoyable.",
    "Yes. This course is relaxed, flexible, and at times very interesting. While there are two professors in charge of the course, I would say close to 60-70% of the lectures were taught by guest lectures--some great, others fine. This is a relatively easy course and served as a great fifth class.",
    "Definitely, this is a gem science class with many interesting guest speakers and two great professors."
