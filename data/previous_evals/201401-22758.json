It's a great experience in general, but if you happen to have an interest in European modernity, modernist filmmaking, melodrama, or how cinema can trouble social, class, and technological concerns--definitely take the course."

    "I came in with a deep interest in Haneke, and my final project was on his work. However, I gained a very good understanding of some of the dominant themes in RW Fassbinder's work, something I've long been interested in but never quite got around to. My final project dealt with certain themes of cinema and media that will likely be of relevance to my dissertation."
