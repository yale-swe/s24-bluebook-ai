    "Lots of reading - can be really difficult.",
    "I do not recommend this class. DS philosophy, sure, but the professors are not optimal. Professor Franks just lectures--it's supposed to be a discussion class! Furthermore, he makes things complicated. He should not be teaching anyone but serious philosophy majors--maybe just graduate students even. I felt like stopping him every sentence because I had no idea what he was saying--that complicated!The material is amazing, the lectures help you understand them, and if anything, with Franks you get amazing class notes. That was pretty much the brightest part of the class-my notes.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS to a fellow student. It's a rewarding experience that exposes you to a wide variety of interesting works. This class enabled me to question my beliefs and put my opinions to the test.",
    "Directed Studies is a very intense program and has essentially dominated my freshman year. I like it because I am reading texts that I will probably never read anywhere else (the greatest works of the Western Canon). While some courses at Yale (Epics, Intro to Political Philosophy) cover some of the works in the curriculum, nowhere else at Yale will you find such a concentration of texts. It's not so much a class as a program. I didn't find it limiting academically since I essentially got to take classes in the literature dept., phi. dept., and political science\/ history depts. Reading some of the works through an interdisciplinary lens can be fascinating and inspiring. At the same time, it can be quite overwhelming and time consuming (more hours of classes than most students, between 300-800 pages of reading a week, a 5-6 page essay due every Friday). So if you take DS it becomes a question of how you want to use your time. I have friends in DS who are involved many different extra-curriculars at Yale. This year I'm involved with improv, one of the culturalhouses at Yale, and I work a student job. DS did, however, limit my participating in theater at Yale. So it is possible to do other things. You will need to budget your time. You will not get all of the reading done (This I promise). But you'll be able to do other things. It's just up to you to know your schedule and your limits.Some people feel that DS is just the study of work by \"dead white guys.\" For the most part, that is true and is the reality of the Western Canon. Yes, it is good to bring in other authors (unfortunately, DS only features two female authors and all white authors), but that is the nature of the program. It comes at the Western Canon from a certain angle. It doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It isn't global studies. It is a survey course of the \"great books\" of the Western TraditionAll of the works are read in English translation so you are not expected to be familiar with the language in its original text. DS expects that you know how to write an academic essay. The essays are not research essays. You will not look at secondary sources. The essays require you to craft a thesis and use the text to make an argument. There are international students (both from English speaking and non-English speaking countries) who take DS and seem to be okay. It is a challenge, but it can be done.A full year of DS fulfills all of your distributional requirements for writing, social studies, and humanities. Freshman year you must fulfill distributional requirements in two out of the three categories: writing, language, and\/ or quantitative reasoning. If you choose to do pre-med and DS (which a good number of people do) you will take the three DS classes, organic chemistry (and an orgo lab). This will fulfill your freshman year requirements. It is a lot of work, but it manageable. That being said, you should only take DS if you are truly interested in reading the works and learning for the sake of learning. Being able to say that you took DS and\/ or that you read a certain work is not a good enough reason. You should be interested in reading and thinking about the material. If you are not, you are better off reading the Sparknotes. DS is a reading program. If you don\u0092t read the works, you won\u0092t get much from section or lecture and you won\u0092t do well on your papers.So essentially there is no one way to do DS. It's got its pros and cons. I think there is too much \u0093undirected\u0094 reading in DS. But I think that the chance to meet in section with some of the top professors and brightest students at Yale to discuss such influential works is incredible. If I had to do DS again, would I? I'm not sure. Have I learned more, read more, and written more in one year of DS than in all of high school? Yes. Will I carry this knowledge with me for the rest of my life? Absolutely.",
    "DS philosophy is a joy. The writers are a bit more interesting and a bit more challenging, but Franks makes sure that this is not a problem. He is patient, and both willing and capable to explain the challenging things encountered in class. Don't expect to talk too much in section, but don't worry, you won't need to.",
    "Just take a look at the syllabus and get ready to do some really dense reading. You'll cover a really diverse range of authors, so if you don't like oneor two of them, you'll probably find at least something else in the course. That being said, I myself didn't do all the reading in the class and sometimes couldn't keep up because some stuff (like the denser Kant) just went over my head and I relied on the professor's\/friends' explanations and summaries."
