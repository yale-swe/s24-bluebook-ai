   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student--all other students. Turkish has been so interesting and fun; it's impossible not to love the class. I look forward to it every morning. I didn't have a particular investment in Turkish or Turkey before I started, but now I definitely do. Etem is the best teacher and I've learned so much without ever feeling stressed about it.",
    "Take it, take it, take it. Amazing language and an absolutely amazing professor. Turks are also just the nicest people ever. He is super understanding of any issue you may have in the semester. Just make sure you do your HW and get a tutor asap if you have to miss too many classes for any reason.",
    "Turkish was one of my favorite classes this year. Although it met everyday, like all language classes, it never felt like a burden to go to class. Etem always made everyday lively and encouraged friendly banter that livened up each class period. The work load was also not too intense and the work that was assigned always seemed very useful. I especially liked the large amount of in class speaking that Etem encouraged, I think that was very helpful as well. If you are looking to start a new language, I would definitely recommend Turkish.",
    "Turkish 120 is a great introduction to the language and gives you the ability to communicate on a day to day basis in Turkish. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to pick up a fun and different language for its grammar structure is different from the romance languages."
