    "If you get placed into this class, take it. I actually found it easier and more fun than L2 Spanish, despite having a great L2 professor.",
    "If you have to take L3 it is by no means the end of the world. Even though classes met every day it's not nearly as bad as it seems and you even have fun sometimes.",
    "Spanish 130 02 is a good intermediate spanish class. The material mostly a review of past concepts but the class moves fast so there is never a dull moment! The small class size is a great opportunity to get to know your professor and peers and the workload is not overwhelming. Take this class if you want to improve your spanish ability and get to know some people!",
    "Enjoyed it. Yes.",
    "Professor Seymour is super nice and available, it's not that hard a course as long as you keep up with the lessons.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because it encompasses a lot of spanish material. It is a very general course containing material in tenses, and vocab which strives to promote fluency."
