    "Definitely improved my French grammar and writing flow without a large amount of stress.",
    "I sharpened my French reading and writing skills.",
    "I learned a lot about how to write in French, and the diverse ways in which it is done. I feel a lot more confident in my ability to write.",
    "This course improved my knowledge of French writing styles and different sorts of essays. I think my writing improved a great deal. My self-checking and self-editing were probably the most improved.",
    "A lot of background info on different writing styles.",
    "My French writing improved significantly. The hand-holding in terms of drafting (3 drafts per paper, 1 paper each week) made time management a lot easier.",
    "I definitely improved my writing and speaking skills. I especially enjoyed writing creatively in French. From this, I expanded my vocabulary an improved my written grammar."

    "Great course - Mme Pinzka is a wonderful professor, funny and caring and engaging. The workload was balanced, definitely consistent and not easy but never out of control. Good variety of assignments which really helped improve French without directly focusing much on grammar\/vocab.",
    "The course has a steadily high workload; it'd be nice if the professor suppressed one of the units. Major weakness: The textbook is terrible. Many of the exercises therein were redundant or too simple.",
    "Oh boy is there a lot of busy work. I felt at times a little bothered by excessive busy work that didn't exactly help. I feel that doing a bit more reading and discussion of the styles would have been helpful instead of answering repetitive questions in a text book. Also: the book is $156 and really not very good. Wish it had been better and more engaging at that price.",
    "A LOT of the exercises in the taches d'encre book are repetitive and really useless.",
    "Strengths include the great design of the class. Every week, you tackle a new writing from from narration, to dissertation, to a resum. It takes a bite size approach to writing in french, which is great for even advanced students. A weakness was the textbook used. Although the content and the prompts provided by the textbook were really great, the exercises felt like a lot of busy work."

    "Yes - Great course if you want to practice and improve French writing in a relatively fun and low-key setting (though not without significant work). Mme Pinzka is a wonderful professor, funny and caring and engaging. The workload was balanced, definitely consistent and not easy but never out of control. Good variety of assignments which really helped improve French without directly focusing much on grammar\/vocab.",
    "Highly recommend this course for improving your French writing skills, but it's a lot of work.",
    "Take this class if you are in any way insecure about your ability to write. This course prepares you well for 200+ level courses.",
    "If you plan to major in French and French is not your maternal language, take the class. If not, you could probably forego it. I also strongly recommend taking this course AFTER 198. The grammar covered in 198 will help a lot in the writing assignments in 195.",
    "The class gives you a lot of background on many writing styles (story, descriptions, formal emails, etc). Great for general info especially for french majors.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you are at all interested in expanding your French vocabulary and writing expression.",
    "This course was wonderful and I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in improving their French writing and completing some interesting assignments.",
    "This course is very important for anyone serious about French and writing in French. Through various writing exercises, both creative and academic, you will write a lot and receive weekly feedback. I recommend this course because you will definitely improve if you put in the time to compose thoughtful writings. That being said, don't take this class if you won't have the time to commit to writing every day or every other day."
