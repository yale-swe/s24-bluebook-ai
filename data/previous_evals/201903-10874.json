   "comments": [
    "Really broke down the steps of writing such a big piece, helped formulate research question and steps",
    "I developed and worked on my senior capstone. I learned research methods and what a good capstone looks like.",
    "I learned more about the process of writing my Capstone in the spring and wrote the first component of the project. I received feedback on my ideas and writing throughout the semester.",
    "I learned valuable skills for developing a self-guided research project. Broadly, I improved at setting realistic goals and holding myself accountable. I also learned about the processes for completing archival research.",
    "I learned how to refine my thinking and writing through various iterations of my capstone project ideas."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: making big project more feasible, clear feedback, community Weaknesses: so many assignments, IRB should come earlier",
    "I thought it was a useful course and I especially appreciated the early deadlines. I thought that the timing of each writing deadline was a little rushed and would have liked more time to just sit in the literature, but because I only had a limited amount of time I read less and had to write more. I also thought that it did a good job of being flexible for different kinds of projects. The feedback was a little irregular - sometimes I would get feedback from TZB or Anne, and sometimes I wouldn't.",
    "Strengths: I think the restructuring of this course to make it more individualized has worked well! TZB and Anne are so dedicated and provide amazing feedback, ideas, and encouragement. Workshopping drafts with peers was useful as well. Weaknesses: Sometimes it felt like coming to class was really not useful -- for a few weeks right after midterm especially, it was hard to actually see what we should be aiming for week to week, and what we were really doing in class. Maybe there could be a few like, random classes throughout that are geared toward reading key texts or something like that, even though that's not strictly useful for each person's capstone project it could be a cool thing to do in class just as a capstone exercise, especially because it didn't really feel like we needed all the class time we had this semester to get to where we are now.",
    "Strengths: Peer-editing was super helpful throughout the semester and really pushed my project along. The flexibility of the instructor and the syllabus was great because it helped each student use this course for individual needs\/goals. Weaknesses: Some class meetings felt like a waste of time just because all our projects are so different and it sometimes felt like a better use of time to spend the two hours working on my own project than to sit all together.",
    "This course was great! I worried it would be annoying - largely because I think that there is a really big problem that arises when a group of students with diverse, unique projects and interests is required to follow the same schedule. I also sometimes think that putting deadlines on research, some writing projects, etc. sometimes damages a student's intellectual engagement. But this class was great, because TZB was really happy to let us follow our own schedules and do what we needed to do to get our work done. It was the perfect balance of structured and flexible.",
    "This course really kept me on track with my capstone. I have made so much progress since the start of the year thanks to this class. It was great that the assignments were flexible depending on each project and each person's progress. An assignment every week was a bit much to keep up with. I think I would have made the same progress and been less stressed if the assignments were due every other week.",
    "It would be helpful if we were more aware of what we were going into before the fall. I know a lot of seniors expected to do their major requirements in the fall and the Ed Studies project in the spring, and felt overwhelmed by the amount of work we were doing on our projects. I think it's totally fine that we get such a good head start, I just think it'd be helpful to know that before we choose courses and propose other theses.",
    "I thought the class set up a good environment in which to share ideas and receive feedback on my Capstone and feel it developed over the course of the semester. In terms of improvements, I felt as if sometimes expectations became unclear\/it was challenging to get as much as I could have out of the course as everyone was at different stages of their projects. Assignments in the early weeks felt somewhat repetitive\/redundant over time, and I think it would have been more helpful to have been able to begin the final project\/paper earlier and have spent more class time on workshopping that.",
    "Please make this mandatory course NOT at 9:25 in the morning",
    "This course was very well facilitated to support a range of students working on diverse projects. One major strength of the course was the initial series of module assignments which ensured students were turning in weekly project updates and building on ideas. Continued incremental deadlines throughout the semester allowed for deeper learning and better work without stress. Feedback on drafts was really helpful. Because students were working on distinct projects there were some times when class-time felt redundant, however the professor was aware of this and took measures to prevent it from happening.",
    "This course was really helpful in guiding me toward refining my project, especially the initial modules and the workshopping! I think looking back that I would have been interested to workshop with other members of the class rather than having the same people evaluate my work multiple times, but it was still really helpful.",
    "The strengths of this course is 1) the format - it is nice to only have class once a week and use the other time for your research 2) Talya - she is amazing!! an insightful professor and very adept at creating a positive classroom dynamic 3) advisors - having one-on-one meetings with my advisor every week was extremely helpful in helping me cultivate my ideas! As far as weaknesses, we spent a lot of time in class peer editing. Oftentimes I did not know exactly what advice I should be giving. It would have been helpful to perhaps have edited a prospectus together as a class, in order to see how other people edit and learn what exactly we should be looking for"

   "comments": [
    "yes, great for capstone progress",
    "It's a required course",
    "You have to take it within the program, but don't think of it as a chore! My capstone was so much fun to write, and it's so rewarding and personally fulfilling to engage in work that you have chosen, and have chosen because you deeply, personally, intellectually, and academically care about. Engaging in capstone research also taught me a lot about self-accountability in academic contexts, something that you don't really learn elsewhere at Yale.",
    "In its current form, I felt as if the course was valuable to the development of my project but not as valuable as it could have been if the course were structured differently or enabled us to begin developing the main structure of the project earlier. I feel as if future iterations could give students more opportunities to do so and perhaps to structure class time differently to enable better and more extensive feedback on each other's projects.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. There is a tremendous amount of freedom to pursue interesting projects with a lot of support in identifying the best ways to do so.",
    "Absolutely!! Of course it is mandatory for every Education Studies scholar, but it is also a deeply intellectually engaging and rewarding course if you put the time in"
