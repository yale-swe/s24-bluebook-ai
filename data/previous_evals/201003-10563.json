    "I felt that this Clinic could have been better managed. The training sessions were too much of an information dump, that still left us a bit in the deep end of the pool for dealing with our clients. This led to lots of back and forth on documents, which felt like a very inefficient process. I thought the class sessions could have covered more law on non-profits, or included more class discussion.",
    "The clinical faculty are great! Their lectures can sometimes be a bit dry but their advice about transactional lawyering and their responsiveness to individual student questions is fantastic."
