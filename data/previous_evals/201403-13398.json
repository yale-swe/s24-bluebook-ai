    "The homework for this class takes a while - it's not as bad as other STEM classes, but certainly a lot more than a HU or SO on average. The homework is hard, but office hours help a lot. This class is weighted 50% on the homework and 50% on the final, but this year, you could get a C in the class if you didn't take the final. Lectures are early in the morning.",
    "This is a challenging class, however if you manage your work, pay attention, and go to office hours you will get through it. Professor Pollard's teaching style takes a while to get used too, but he is super nice and very helpful in office hours and after class. Also sometimes he brings his dog to class\/office hours and she is the best...",
    "A good class. That being said, a difficult class. Probability theory does not mean counting arguments like you saw in high school. That will all be covered during shopping period, and then it gets really rough. There is a lot of beautiful math, you will learn a lot, and Professor Pollard is really fun, but be warned. (I'm an applied math major)",
    "A course that should be taken only if you're ready to dedicate a great deal of time and energy. You'll learn a lot with Pollard, but it'll be tough.",
    "A pretty rigorous introduction to probability theory; take it if you enjoy math\/statistics or need it for your major. Problem sets can take pretty long, but are definitely manageable. Pollard is a good lecturer and is very open with his office hours. The final was difficult.",
    "Absolutely do not recommend, due to the way in which the class was taught. This class was the worst class I have ever taken or will ever take at Yale (I am sure of it). I have never written a negative review before, and Ive taken several classes in the Yale math department. This professor\/class single-handedly ruined my semester. Even though lectures were very hard to follow, the problem sets were incredibly difficult and impossible to do on your own. Yet the TAs were unwilling to help and laughed when you did not understand topics that were taught very poorly in class. The professor had trouble relating to the students on any level. He seemed to have made up methods for solving problems entirely out of thin air, because he did not clearly explain them nor did any book (I tried many). Wait until someone else teaches it, because probability theory is really interesting and cool material (or at least, I imagine it could be if taught in an at all reasonable way). Even though I spent most of my semester on this class, I could have learned WAY more by spending the 15 hours per week that the psets took if I had spent them learning probability theory on my own. Also, the exam was brutal, entirely unfair, and not reflective of what you could have studied from the books or problem sets. It included things that the professor rushed through in 5 minutes in class and never appeared on a problem set. And it was 50% of the grade. Also, there was no midterm, so it was impossible to know how to prepare for the final. (This class was graded 50% psets, 50% final.) Also at least 1\/3 to 2\/3 of the class dropped throughout the semester, including people who had to withdraw right before the final. It was hard to tell the exact number who dropped though, because many people stopped attending the lectures. Ive been looking forward to writing this scathing review all semester, and I could go on for several more pages about how incredibly terrible this experience was.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. The psets are really hard and you don't really actually learn about statistics.",
    "A very challenging course in probability theory. If you are looking for an intro statistics class, this is not the class for you. If you are looking for a class that will really push you to the limits and make you think, consider taking STAT 241.",
    "I was really disappointed with this class for many reasons, most of which I think are attributable to the professor. Most people who take this (in my opinion) are Applied Math majors who don't cop out and take 238 (which is arguably much easier). I am one of them , but the class was so poorly structured that I feel as though I would have learned more in 238 or even this class taught by a different professor. To start off, there was no syllabus or textbook. There were only his 200 page notes, so if you didn't understand his way of explaining things you're already screwed. Even when teaching, he would never clearly indicate a new or important topic. He would just kinda explain some stuff, and if you could follow for the full 50 minutes it was a good day. (On the side of the board he would write the highlights of the previous lecture, and from those I learned what the main messages of the previous lecture were. But without those it would all be mush.) The most frustrating thing is that Pollard is a really nice guy - I often went to his office hours and he would stay for sometimes an hour after explaining concepts to me. He would bring in his dog to class and crack little jokes. He is also crazy knowledgable in probability. But I think he's the type that knows it so well that he has trouble explaining it to beginners. When confused about a topic, he would give analogies or connect it to things (which would be helpful to solidify preexisting understanding), but would never clearly explain the fundamentals. I sometimes left his office hours on the brink of tears in frustration since his lack of clarity made me feel guilty that I wasn't understanding it. If you have to take this class for the Applied Math major and it's being taught by Pollard, I really recommend considering 238 or waiting a year. I regret taking this class since I have such a weak grasp on continuous probability, which we spent months on.",
    "This class is required for the Applied Math major, and it's a good introduction to theoretical statistics. Pollard is smart, but his problem sets are challenging, as is his final. Go to class. I repeat: Go. To. Class. He will downplay the difficulty of the final exam. It is not easy, and you should study hard.",
    "DO NOT TAKE WITH POLLARD. Even though the material in this class could have been really interesting, this class would have been better taught by a syphillitic donkey. Pollard is extremely unclear in lecture and creates blisteringly difficult problem sets, combining for a terrible experience. The TAs are horrible as well and literally laughed when I couldn't understand a problem. This class is the reason your semester could suck, and it's all because of Pollard. AVOID AVOID AVOID.",
    "Very frustrating class, probably the worst I've ever taken. If you're a math person, you'll probably be fine, but if not, BEWARE. Definitely DON'T take it if you're more interested in applied (as opposed to theoretical) statistics. The shopping period psets are easy, but it gets much more confusing after that. I wish I could say I learned a lot for the 10-15 hours per week I poured into the class, but I can't. I barely understood the lectures or homeworks, and then got mowed down by the final.",
    "The beginning is easy then it gets hard around variance then it's easy again",
    "Very good intro to probability. You learn a lot, and the course moves at a good pace but is definitely accessible to beginners. The homeworks are fair and relevant to the class material. Extra help is always available. David Pollard was great. He explains the material clearly and is just a nice guy. I liked his sense of humor, too. Take the class!",
    "It is hard but if you put in the work you can do well.",
    "A good class overall. The problem sets start pretty easy and get challenging as the semester progresses. Professor Pollard is really good at explaining concepts, and this made we really want to go to class. On the other hand, the class was at 9 am, so that didn't happen as much as it should have. Grading seems pretty fair and the concepts are interesting.",
    "Good rigorous first course in probability",
    "Take this course if you want to understand a lot of interesting problems in probability and apply methods to tackle them. If you learn, and reflect and synthesize, you'll see the beauty of some theorems and how they relate to real life.",
    "If you are taking this class with Professor Pollard, do NOT take it, unless you have an incredibly strong background in probability theory and mathematics. The problem sets were insane, the final exam unreasonable, and lectures hard to follow."
