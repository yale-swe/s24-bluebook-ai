I was sometimes disappointed when she prioritized her grants over spending time in class - we set aside time to attend class and I hope she would be able to do so as well.When Dr. Lichtman lectured, I got the most out of lecture. Although she focuses quite a bit on her own work, that work is interesting, so it was good to hear about it!",
