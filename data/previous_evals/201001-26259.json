   "comments": [
    "I think the content and organization of the course and Mark's teaching makes this a great course. The only problem is the class size is way too big and interferes with discussion. Plus, for whatever reason, the class as a whole seemed to have an apathetic, skeptical attitude toward the course material that prevented us from having productive discussions. Similar to 510, I found the assignments extremely frustrating, but when they were finished, I realized how much I had learned and been challenged. I particularly liked the modules on the models of policy analysis and transformative change, and I'm sure I will come to appreciate what we learned about communicating persuasively to different audiences. The course was a lot of work, but it was satisfying to know that all of that work would be worth it in the end.",
    "the class is way too theoretical and US-focused. It also did not do a good job of updating to current times and looking at health reform. One of our papers was on reinstituting some level of prohibition during the Bush years--this is not helpful. I think many of us wanted this class to provide us with more practical skills, but we ended us getting a ton of theory.",
    "Not exactly what I expected from the Capstone. Hoped to get more practical knowledge, but overall, a well organized class with straightforward goals.",
    "This course was a bit more theoretical than I was anticipating. I was hoping to gain more applied skills in health policy development.",
    "This is a good class for policy concentrators given it really draws out real questions that will arise in the policy making or analyzing arena. Although having an ethics focus is sometimes challenging for classroom dynamic, it is an incredibly useful and interesting subject to think about as it pervades policy at all its stages of creation and implementation. The course works well and follows a module-based learning trajectory that prepares students for subsequent assignments. Class discussions are always engaging as much of the material gets at fundamental notions that individuals may have on issues that they begin to question over the course of the semester.",
    "The course was too large. It would have been fabulous as a 10-15 person seminar, as it was, discussion was somewhat stifled. It is, however, an extremely informative and rigorous class. The assignments are absolute terrors, but I suspect I'll appreciate them when I've had a chance to recover.",
    "Great course. A culmination of your training in health policy. I liked the way the class was structured - a seminar.",
    "I think that the idea of this class is noble in theory, but was not well executed in practice. It is very worthwhile to have a capstone experience on the health policy sequence. There were several weaknesses of this capstone experience. First, the class size was too large and prevented engaging small group discussion. Second, we received very little instruction on some of the most useful portions of the course, such as the interview and the press release. Third, participation was very low in classroom discussions. This is obviously partially the fault of students, many of whom did not complete reading. To correct this, participation could be made a larger part of the grade. I was excited about the class when I looked at the syllabus at the begining of the semester, but was disappointed when I finished the course because I felt as though I should've gotten more out of it. Mark is a knowledgable and passionate professor, but the course could've been a much better capstone experience. I wish we had spent more time learning concrete skills that we could take with us into our future jobsas policy analysts.",
    "I felt that this class was too theoretical. I would have liked to come out of the class with more tangible skills that I could take with me into my career in public health. While we did write press releases and a taped interview, it would have been helpful to have actual class instruction on exactly what we should be thinking about and doing when writing these assignments. It also would have been helpful to learn how to write a very good policy brief, as I'm sure most of us will be doing this in our future careers.",
    "I though the course was too theoretical. I wished we focused more on practical skills (how to be persuasive, how to write a press release, how to structure a report, how to do an interview, etc.). The topics were interesting, but I just wished that more was directly applicable to our work as policy public health people.",
    "The topics covered were of almost no interest to me. Additionally, the paper topics were pre-specified so there was no room to pick topics of interest in that regard.",
    "This course is good. At first I was confused about the overall objectives for the course etc. but as time went on I realized that I was being introduced to various policy analysis models that will be very useful to me in the future. The papers are quite labor intensive in terms of research required, length and addendums. However, I always learned from the process and at the end of the day I do believe that being forced to sit for a long time with something helps to internalize the learning process. The classes were stimulating, however, sometimes I wish there had been more group discussion. Although it was a seminar style class, I often felt like it was more of a lecture.",
    "could be really great, but needs more flexibility in terms of subjects for papers. a little too vague."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great! Discussion sometimes fell flat, but Mark was able to find some way to get us talking. This is one ofthe few discussion-based classes at YSPH that I've actually enjoyed, thanks to Mark's ability to guide the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is really focused on the looking at vague notions of different ways of being a policymaker (rationalist, counselor, advocate) and doesnt seem to want to expand the theory to more current issues. He is great at providing feedback to our papers though and having the taped mock interview was one of the highlights of this class. This is something that career services should look into as interview prep.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a good instructor and creates a nice structure for the course. He is very receptive to students questions and concerns and always makes himself available. I would, however, like to see more practice-based assignments, like the interview.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an amazing professor and mentor. He has the ability to orate on any policy topic with depth, critical questioning and analysis- Mark definitely brings this to the capstone course as he seems to embed content from readings naturally into class conversations. He does a great job leading discussion in structured manner while also allowing for people's unique questions to be brought up and tangential learning to occur. All in all, Mark is fair and uses a number of innovative assignments and pedagogical techniques to bring out the best in the class.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0is an excellent professor, in small groups. His style worked much better in this course than in HPA 510, and would have been even more appropriate in a smaller version of this course. I really appreciated having him as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is obviously very knowledgeable in health policy. Gets us to think deeply and he ensured we learned a lot in the capstone",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great prof. He's smart and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was a great lecturer, but I found lectures to be too theoretical.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very passionate about the course, unfortunately, seems insensitive to whether students are enjoying the material.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great professor. He is obviously highly intelligent, but also attuned to the students and the learning process in a way that is unique. Reading the paper comments, I got the feeling he actually read and thought about every word I wrote, which is actually rare. He clearly spends great time and cares a lot about our education. Moreover, he forces you to face and deal with ambiguity in away that is sometimes confusing and frustrating, but always instructive. For example, in class and in during the paper writing process, I always felt like there was no possible \"right\" answer and that it would not be feasible to cover all the bases of whatever strategy I was arguing for. That is a frustrating feeling, but true to life and therefore very instructive and valuable. Most importantly, however, Mark is very attentive, approachable and available. I always felt like I could email him or schedule an appointment and always, always received very prompt responses."

   "comments": [
    "Great course! Make sure to approach the course with the right attitude -- trust that there's a reason to all the madness. At the end of the course you will appreciate how much you learned.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student and I only took it because it was required. This class should be replaced with a more practical class that is more focused on providign us with technical skills.",
    "Not exactly what I expected from the Capstone. Hoped to get more practical knowledge, but overall, a well organized class with straightforward goals.",
    "This course has a greater focus on the theoretical framework for approaching policy analysis and less of a focus on the actual process of writing policy proposals. This course will teach you more of how and why a policy analyst should approach an issue a certain way.",
    "The policy capstone is a great course for those interested in ethics and theory around policy making and analysis. It is a discussion class that is better the more students participate. Although the assignments at first may seem daunting or odd, upon their completion, you learn a lot about your own learning over the course of the module and recognize the assignment's relevance and purpose. An overall good course for developing critical thinking, while also remaining cognizant and interpretability of subjective and normative reasoning. I'd recommend it to those with these interests, and less so for those who see clear solutions for problems - this is class that is really about the complexity of health policy.",
    "Is good, and worth the effort, though it would be better if smaller.",
    "Nice course. You learn how to become a policy analyst.",
    "Overall, this course was interesting but not as applied as I wished it could have been.",
    "A course on the ethics and philosophy of health policy.I would not recommend it, but it's mandatory for HPA students so it seems we have no choice.",
    "This course forces you to learn and deploy various modes of policy analysis. --I recommend this course."
