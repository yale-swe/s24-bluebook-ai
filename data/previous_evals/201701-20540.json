   "comments": [
    "LCAs, marketing write-ups.",
    "1) How to apply the Principles of Green Engineering to evaluate the true \"sustainability\" of a product 2) How to use Onshape, Arduino, various CEID tools and resources such as 3D printer, laser cutter, thermoformer 3) How to use the \"Yes and\" method to bounce ideas back and forth with classmates 4) How to perform LCAs and MCDAs 5) How to do a marketing pitch 6) \"Re-learned\" the creativity I had when I was younger!",
    "This course taught me information and skills that I will use and promote in life after Yale. The most useful skills I will take away are working in teams with diverse backgrounds (using yes, and....) and avoiding doing the right things wrong. I really enjoyed learning about problem statements, MCDAs, LCAs, and biomimicry.",
    "I learned how to develop a product from multiple different areas of this such as CAD, marketing, problem design, and area recognition.",
    "This course provided us with the skills we need to get started in sustainable design. The first half of the semester was spent learning about the principles of green engineering, how to think and what to consider in sustainable design, and necessary skills like computer-aided design and life-cycle assessment. Then, we spent the rest of the semester on projects where we used the skills we learned in the first half of the semester to try and design solutions to real-world problems.",
    "I am not an engineering major and taking this class taught me a ton. Not only did I learn 3d printing, laser cutting, and other engineering skills, I learned how to think very, very outside the box.",
    "I learned about sustainability, which was helpful, for the first few weeks, but then I learned about things I don't really care about for the remainder of the course. It just felt like a product design class. :( I also learned to use some of the machines in the CEID but I just don't feel like I'm ever gonna use those skills or any of the building skills I learned ever again! None of this was relevant to what I want to go into (air quality, water quality, etc.), which is a shame. I don't think this class should be a requirement for environmental engineering majors; I think there should be at least 2 or 3 specialty classes to choose from for upperclassmen to specialize in, like Professor Hong's developing-world water quality class or Professor Peccia's bioengineering class.",
    "This course taught a great balance of \"hard\" and \"soft\" skills that are often tough to find in a college curriculum. Hard: basic understanding of CAD software, basic understanding of Arduino, using 3D printer, making prototypes, utilizing CEID Soft: how to be \"creative,\" how to effectively present an idea, what it means to truly have \"green\" design, and how to ACTUALLY be innovative. The breadth of skills that I've learned in this class is unlike that of any other that I've taken throughout Yale.",
    "Besides getting a better understanding of what \"green\" really means and how to factor this into the design process using multi-criteria design analysis, life-cycle analysis, and the 12 principles of sustainable design, I also learned practical rapid-prototyping skills like CAD (on-shape), 3D printing, laser-cutting, and thermoforming.",
    "I developed an understanding of the criteria used to evaluated sustainable technology and solutions as well as how to undertake the design process in order to develop these and other kinds of innovations. I also learned some background in some of the major problems facing the environment today and what others have developed to help. I got to use CAD for the first time and became practiced in using the ThermoFormer machine; these experiences, combined with efforts put towards the midterm and final project, gave me an even greater appreciation of the CEID as a resource and working space. The class was also my first class in which the most important assignments ,s well as many of the minor in class activities, are done in groups, and it gave a lot of practice with teamwork."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Interesting projects; I wish there were more focus on project engineering and less on presenting\/marketing.",
    "The strength is that it forces you to really take responsibility for your own project under the deadlines",
    "The strengths were learning various skills that I previously did not have. I learned how to use the laser cutter, 3D printer, arduino, onshape, and sustainable minds. Overall, I would not be nearly as comfortable rolling up my sleeves in the CEID without this class. I wish I took it sooner. The weaknesses are time constraints. I would have liked more time on the final project and on innovation and design.",
    "The strengths of this course are it's interactive and product-based coursework. However, I found the first homework excessively long and wish that there had been more time to work on product design.",
    "I really liked that we had projects that involved real world problem solving rather than tests. The only thing I would recommend changing is the subject of the midterm project, which I thought was kind of unexciting and irrelevant (I've never purchased tea that is served on the go with the \"double cup\" method).",
    "I loved the course! I think the hardest part of the course was working in groups with people that we were not always compatible with. However, this was also my favorite part of the course. I loved the lectures, the work time in class, and the midterm\/final projects. I think the only thing that could make the course a little better would be to put some thought into the midterm group assignments. Random groups made the assignment pretty difficult.",
    "The structure of the course needs serious adjustment--more time should be given to establishing and working on final projects than just four weeks. The short time span left teams scrambling and impacted the final product put forward. Expectations for supporting design documents were often vague and need more clarification.",
    "STRENGTHS > Thomas & the other TFs were very present and helpful. Julie and Paul were less present but still helpful, especially for guidance in the final project. > I can tell Paul & Julie put a lot of work into this class. > OnShape was a great free CAD platform that was especially helpful for being shareable WEAKNESSES > It irks me to no end that this class is a requirement for the ENVE major. There are so many other fields to go into for environmental engineering (renewable energy, biofuels, water quality, air quality), so it is beyond me why we have to take this product design class. I understand that it teaches us principles of sustainability and does so in a hands-on manner, but why not have different hands-on classes to choose from, that can all be geared to teach these sustainable principles? That way I can actually learn skills and get prepared for the field of engineering I actually want to go into. For example, I am very excited about Prof. Hong's water quality in the developing world class, and I can see myself going into that field. Why can't we learn about sustainable design (of water systems for example) in that context? > Sustainable Minds was horrendously slow to re-load BOMs after EVERY SINGLE EDIT and super buggy (copying every item in the BOM twice when concepts were copied to be edited, putting it out of order, PUTTING IN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WRONG CO2 VALUES!! HAVING TO REENTER THAT ITEM INTO 5 SEPARATE BOMS AFTER HAVING ALREADY COPIED THEM!!!). I also wish they would build a simple sharing ability into the website (!) so that multiple people can work on the same project, like OnShape! > The final project was stupidly rushed - giving us 2 or 3 days in between brainstorming and LCA, LCA and MCDA, MCDA and initial prototype was idiotic and frustrating on the part of the instructors and I felt it was a waste of time seeing as I wasn't doing by best work and giving it due diligence but just trying to get through it to meet the deadline. Completely frustrating experience. > Grad students should not be allowed in this course. I was excited to work from them and learn from them, but both of the grad students in my final project group were both uninvested and difficult to work with. They were too busy to contribute as much as they should have, and what they did contribute was consistently sub-par quality, doing the bare minimum or not much above. Incredibly frustrating and stressful, especially for grades. >A major weak spot of this course is that it inevitably favors students with strong CAD and machining\/workshop backgrounds, especially so given that the final project is required to be a physical product. It is beyond me why it must be this way. It felt like i was the token \"technical\" person on the team with the \"builder\" background (just because I came into the class already trained in a few machines) and my three team mates had nothing to contribute on that matter. It would have been more fair if the final project was allowed to have been an in depth LCA or some other assessment, which would be just as helpful as a new product in many cases and would create a much level playing field amongst groups and students of different backgrounds. > scheduling was horrendous - 2-3 days between turn-ins??? and then 10 days till the final pitch?? Why not space the deadlines out? All this accomplished was to rush teams through the very important brainstorming and assessment projects, choosing poor design solutions to pursue just for the sake of rushing to meet the deadline, screwing them over when they run into problems machining the product (again, favoring students with workshop backgrounds! And don't tell me there are enough resources and help for anyone to do well - we are Yale students with very full schedules and can't devote all the time it would require to be on the same level as some other students in the class, even if we were getting help. Again why make it a product-based class?!",
    "Strengths: basically everything I said in question 1: teaches a mix of \"hard\" and \"soft\" skills (and leaves students walking away feeling like they have actually learned a lot of useful information). Also, teaches creativity and innovation in a way that I didn't think could be \"taught.\" But it can, and it was! Plus, it was challenging without being impossible, the right amount of work, great professors... all those little things that make a class enjoyable. And the candy! Weaknesses: I liked the mix of grad and undergrad (I am an undergrad and it was a great\/humbling experience to learn alongside \"real adults\" who were more experienced and knowledgeable than I was.) However, I wish there had been more support available within the class for those of us who were inexperienced not only in the \"hard\" skills, but in design\/engineering in general.",
    "I think this course is awesome but it tries to cover a LOT in a really limited time which makes it feel a bit disjointed. I was quite disappointed at the end of the semester when we were discouraged from thinking about system-level changes because of the scope of the class, even though this is what Professor Zimmerman and Professor Anastas drove home the very first day of class with all their graphs. Additionally, it was sometimes a bit unclear what exactly we were being evaluated on, given that not all the pieces we learned fit into every project etc. Might have been helpful to see some sort of rubric for the final (I noticed that judges did have some sort of rubric, which may have better guided our own design process had we been privy to such information)",
    "This class is very unique and students learn a lot of great skills from it. I greatly enjoyed coming into class and working on the in-class activities with other people, and the final project, though challenging, is a chance to create something innovative using all the skills taught to us. I never would have considered learning CAD myself since it is not necessary for my major, but I was happy to add the basics of CAD to my skill set. This was the case with other tools that we learned. The group projects made teamwork a must for success in the class, and it gives a lot of insight into the value of the different strengths people bring to a team. Sustainability is a critical challenge for our age, and I am happy that there is an engineering class devoted to tackling it with creativity. The biggest weakness of the class is probably the grading--it's hard to tailor your work, in either the midterm or the final project, to receive any specific grade, and with the group-based effort involved, it gets even harder."

    "Light engineering project class.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get into this class, absolutely take it. It has been my favorite course thus far at Yale because it's refreshingly hands-on and hones in equal parts your critical thinking skills and imagination. It will change your perspective on what a truly 'sustainable' product is. You'll get the opportunity to work and swap ideas with a friendly bunch of peers in a nonjudgmental \"anything goes\" environment. The first half of the semester is informational, then the fun really starts when you get to prototype and design in the second half of the semester.",
    "If you are interested in the design process at all you should take this",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to students interested in sustainable design and innovation. Paul and Julie are both great and encourage thinking outside the box.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course-it was very interactive and engaging, even considering the large workload.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're at all interested in some combination of design, sustainability, and engineering. It's not like a traditional college class - if you're into a lot of structure (weekly homework, notes, exams) then maybe you won't enjoy this class. But if you're into working on solving real world problems, you'll love it. Paul and Julie's teaching style is really refreshing and uplifting - definitely worth experiencing :)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! The class consists of lectures and small homework assignments during the first half and two major group projects during the second half of the semester. Expect to spend a lot of time working in groups of classmates. This can be challenging at times but if you have a good group, it's great. Paul and Julie are AMAZING as are the TAs. They are incredible supportive and helpful and really took the time to get to know us.",
    "If you want to go into product design, take this course. It's also a helpful class for learning about sustainability in engineering; it's just a shame that there are no other courses to choose from to learn these same principles (esp. for environmental engineering majors for whom this is a required class). Outside of this however, it's generally a fun class, if pedantic.",
    "YES!!! This class will teach you more than many other classes at Yale, skills like Arduino and 3D printing, and concepts like how to be creative and innovative. Plus, it was challenging without being impossible, the right amount of work, great professors... all those little things that make a class enjoyable. I cannot recommend this class enough!!!! I suggest that you take this as a junior or senior after you have already taken advanced classes in your field of study. You will be better able to design things if you do.",
    "This was a really great hands-on course that I think encompassed much more than just \"green design.\" I think that it is well suited not only for engineers but also for entrepreneurs who want to branch out a little bit and understand rapid-prototyping that can be used to bring a concept to market.",
    "It was a different kind of class than any I've ever taken before, but it taught me a lot of new things, and I enjoyed it. I recommend it for people who enjoy working in groups, people interested in sustainability, and people who enjoy, or at least want to try, creative thinking. It's a really interactive class and if you put in the effort for the projects, you can create really innovative solutions. Your experience does partly depend on the team you have, but generally I think teams work out pretty well, and it's good practice for any future positions involving team work. Prof Zimmerman, Prof Anastas, and the TA's Thomas, Lauren, and Mark, are all great sources of help throughout the class. Grading is a little uncertain, so if it's not needed for your major, it would be wise to make it a Cr\/D. If you've ever wanted to learn about the cool things that you can achieve using the tools of the CEID, take this class."
