    "Basic Calc II-- integration, Series, a little diff eq at the end. Not too difficult. The class is different than regular math courses. You watch a 10-15 minute video before class that functions as the lecture for the material, take a short quiz (you get 6 tries), and then during lecture parse out what you didn't understand. Really efficient if you get a good instructor. Otherwise, class becomes unbearable and you'll just stop going. Dhruv was an incredible instructor. He has an incredible teaching personality, and class flew by with him. He really communicated with us and didn't waste time going over things we felt confident with.",
    "Take it!! Solid class; great structure; and the workload is reasonable.",
    "I would say that if a student wanted to take the class, they need to be willing to learn a lot of the content on their own.",
    "Math 115 is a review of AP Calculus BC. As long as you make sure you understand the topics, you should be fine in the class. Don't take this class if you don't have a calculus background.",
    "A good course, not insanely hard, manageable workload, good teachers, just make sure to try a few teachers out.",
    "Only do it if you have to."
