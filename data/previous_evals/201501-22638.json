    "Take it! Sigrun Kahl is easily one of my favorite professors at Yale. The class isn't too much work; it's centered around two not-too-long papers that you will write for the class to read. That may sound intimidating, but it really isn't. Everyone writes about something different, and she's more than willing to help you with your topic and research. In the end, you learn a ton yet don't feel overwhelmed. tl;dr: Take it!!!",
    "Pretty good class. Gives you a good understanding of welfare state theory and of the systems in place in America and various countries in Europe. Readings are pretty interesting and current.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in the way that other western countries think about welfare. You focus a lot on the US's exceptionally ungenerous welfare state in comparison to the central European and Scandinavian models. You touch upon questions of, What are the features of these different models? What cultural factors led them to be this way? What are the enduring impacts of these differences?",
    "This class will take a lot of work, but the structure is really unique and you'll learn a lot. You discuss not only the readings but also your classmates' papers, which I think really adds to your experience. Professor Kahl is also a great discussion leader. She also cares about her students very much.",
    "This class gives you an amazing opportunity to explore a topic from multiple disciplines, since the welfare state is a topic that spans economics, sociology, history, social psychology, political science, ethical philosophy, and more! To give you an idea, one of my papers included a regression, interview testimony, and a short story I wrote to illustrate my point! In most classes, you won't get a class that allows you to write this kind of eclectic papers. Professor Kahl is jovial and kind, but her lesson-planning skills aren't the best. Hopefully, the next time she teaches this class she will have less trouble with off-track discussion and wasted time in class.",
    "I like how Professor Kahl took us on a tour of what needs to be known about Welfare States, although I wish class discussions had been as organized as her syllabus. There's always a lot to uncover in one session, readings were all very interesting, there was a nice balance of theory and empirical discussions and it's nice how the class and its syllabus attract students from different backgrounds within social science. However, not strictly following agenda on one hand and snow days on the other demolished class organization, which was unfortunate but at least was partly addressed through Professor Kahl's more authoritative way of directing class discussions nearing the end of the semester.",
    "This class has a lot of potential, but failed to live up to it this year. Easy enough with interesting readings, but discussion leaves something to be desired.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, definitely take it. The quality of class discussion will depend on who else is in your class, but Professor Kahl is super supportive and really great. Two essays, two comments, and a reflection memo really isn't too much work. No final is a great perk as well.",
    "yes, a lot of ppl dropped at the start because they were intmiidated by how difficult the class seemed. Though you would benefit form having a good grasp of the theories in intro micro and macro, it isnt actually as hard and economicsy as it seem. its really nice how the class doenst have a final exam",
    "I would recommend EPE 258 01 to another student. The course provides a theoretical analysis of the welfare state and the typologies of different welfare states. Building on the types of welfare states, the course shifts to analyzing the welfare state as a political economy and a moral economy. The course also looks at how the types of welfare states were formed and what influences the welfare states. The course looks at the components of welfare states as contracts between citizens -- breadwinners and caretakers, the young and the old, the healthy and the ill, the able and the disabled -- and how the contract may differ across the welfare state typology.",
    "Very interesting class. Learned a TON, totally changed the way I thought about welfare systems. I would recommend taking an intro class on welfare and an intro class on stats or econ first, however; I didn't have either of those things, so the discussion sometime went over my head. Also, the deadlines are wonky, so keep a close eye on that.",
    "This is a great overview course, and Professor Kahl is wonderful. The workload is definitely manageable, and it is really great the way student papers are incorporated into our learning experience each week. Overall great."
