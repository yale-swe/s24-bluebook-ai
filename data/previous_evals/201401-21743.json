    "You don't have a choice. Mandatory for seniors.",
    "This class is required for the major, but if the senior project continues to be mostly in the spring semester I would recommend taking a related class or even starting to work on the project in the fall or otherwise over winter break (especially if you're a double major and will also be working on another project\/essay in the spring).",
    "A chance to work on your own project--- freedom! However, choose an advisor that you think would appreciate your work. If not, you may feel pressured to change your work based on what your advisor thinks which defeats the purpose of senior projects. I hope that future years can figure out a way to make it a more social course where people can really get to know each other and their work outside of the dry, flat presentations shown in class.",
    "A requirement.",
    "You don't have a choice anyway, but it's good.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, not that it is optional. I found I grew so much as an artist in my own practice throughout this experience. The class helped me get to know the other art majors in my class and sparked conversations with them outside of class. I found it truly tied together my experience of art making at Yale."
