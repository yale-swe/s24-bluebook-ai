    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Well, if you took CHNS L1 then you kind of have to take CHNS L2 to get the full 3 credits anyway, so I'd recommend L1 and L2. Just be ready for the workload, it's a lot, but you will definitely get used to it so it shouldn't be a problem.",
    "Great course, hard in terms of workload. Don't do it if you're going to have a hard year. You HAVE to take L2 if you want credit for L1, so make sure you're ready to do chinese all year. Really rewarding.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it if someone really wants to commit to the study of Chinese. The courseload is ridiculously intense at times (unbalanced since Spanish and French have very less workloads for equivalent 1.5 credits!). So I'm not sure... it is taught so well but sometimes, I feel that the language is so hard\/will take such a long time to learn and has such a huge workload that it might not be worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as long as you are ready for the work. And it's really not as much work as people make it seem.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Chinese 120 to continue your study of Chinese. It is taught by an amazing group of teachers in a small classroom setting, creating the perfect environment to study of this rigorous language. Although the time\/effort put into Chinese is not trivial, Chinese 120 students can walk out with the confidence of carrying on a basic fluent conversation.",
    "I would recommend this course. However, the format might get very monotonous after a while and thus lead to a lack of motivation. Try to keep the work.",
    "I would highly recommend it."
