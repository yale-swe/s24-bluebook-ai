    "DS is a great core program and I would recommend it to anyone. I think the texts could selected more carefully and I felt some bumps in this years syllabus. There could also be more supplementary material included (more art gallery talks etc...).",
    "If you are looking to develop and create your own understanding of these texts, then perhaps this class isn't for you, because you'll be fed ages-old interpretations of these texts and won't be given the intellectual space to think of your own. Also, the pace of the course is often overwhelming (new author every week) and you won't have time to really digest the readings by yourself because you are always working on a new paper or doing the reading for next week.",
    "DRST 006 is another course in Directed Studies, and I whole-heartedly encourage enrolling (or continuing) in D.S. if you have the opportunity and are interested in the foundational texts of the Western Canon. Bear in mind that, like all D.S. courses, the readings can be heavy at times and the course is geared toward small seminars with critical discussions. One observation that many students share is that the second semester of D.S. only improves upon the first, and in my estimation H&PT is no exception. Professor Hill is a terrific professor for DRST 006. He brings to light many key developments in political thought and relates them to understanding our modern world. In his section, be prepared to tease out the central arguments in individual works and then explore the overarching themes of the canon. Professor Hills approach is at times unique compared to other D.S. sections, but his becomes an increasingly rewarding experience; I enthusiastically recommend the course and section.",
    "If you are prepared to argue with and draw out Prof. Hill, this section will be fascinating and fruitful. If not, you will be spoon fed. This section is a DS staple because it is taught by an older and lauded professor who, in many ways, represents DS as a bastion of archaic intellectual privilege, but has the potential to do so critically and engagingly. The simple fact is that only the students can make this the case, so the onus is on each student to do their level best to question whenever possible.",
    "I would, because it provides a very good foundation for understanding politics in the current world. It also is a great way to talk about classical influences in politics from the first term."
