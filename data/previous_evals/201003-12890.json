    "Yes! Great survey and necessary to improve your reading.",
    "If you're considering L5, you've probably had other classes with Fereshteh-khanom and know what to expect. She is still extremely caring and demanding, with erratic assignment of work. She will make you meet on Fridays as well - this is a 3-day-a-week class.The modern short stories we read were all interesting - we tended to either have a vocab list or an english translation to read at home, and then translated in class. The stories did have similar themes (oppression), but you'll be impressed with your ability to develop taste in Persian prose.",
    "Given that this is the only advanced Persian class usually offered, there's not a lot of choice here. You'll read amazing things, though you may feel that your spoken abilities are not given a workout on par with earlier Persian semesters.",
    "I couldn't recommend the class more highly. If you reach L5 Persian, you absolutely should take the class."
