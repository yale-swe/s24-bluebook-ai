    "i would definitely recommend it. take it if you want to learn about the issues that face people and that you yourself face in america. you will definitely be mindblower. ever seen that claritin ad where people see clearer after something is stripped off their eyes after claritin use? thats how you will feel after this class. you will be mindblower and empowered after you take this.",
    "Seminar that gives an in-depth analysis on how the presence of institutions (both mental and sociocultural) creates and maintains the structural inequality that is pervasive in American society. I very highly recommend to any and every Yale student, but there is a fair bit of work: 11 readings responses of 500 words and three papers that are 6-7 pages double spaced. On the plus side, there's no final paper and you're done by the last week of classes.",
    "I would! You should really do the readings for this class if you're going to get something out of it, so it takes some work, but it's really, really worth it. Honestly, if more people understood the material we covered in this class, a lot of this country's problems would be solved. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "This is a hugely worthy class and should be a foundational class. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "Anthropology of Inequality is an excellent and necessary course, focusing on the ways and reasons social and economic inequality are propagated in the United States. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to EVERYONE. I can honestly say this course, more than any other I have taken at Yale, has fundamentally changed the way I view the world, my position in it, and my academic studies. It addresses why most Americans are unaware (like myself) that inequality is systemically enforcedan idea I was highly skeptical of before taking this class. I came away with answers for many of the nagging questions I had about poverty and socioeconomic class, in the process often being moved to tears or finding myself angry and emotional. Even if the course may not count towards your major, it is crucial education for everyone as citizens and human beings. The readings were well chosen and the curriculum was well organized. The class discussions were insightful and constructive, and Professor Bell did an excellent job guiding them. A notable facet of this course was how well Professor Bell helped us to construct meaning from each weeks individual readings while helping us connect them to each other and the broader themes of the course. Seminar classes can often feel directionless if there is a new discrete batch of assigned reading each week, but Professor Bell really provided nice analysis so that everything was purposeful and that broad themes emerged from the course. At the same time, she allowed for plenty of exploration on our part through the discussions. I came away with a strong grasp of the concepts of structural and institutionalized inequality and the ways these operate, despite having almost no exposure to these ideas beforehand."
