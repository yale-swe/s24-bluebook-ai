   "comments": [
    "Cryptography as a subject is very interesting. This class is not. The professor is incredibly boring. The TA's are stingy graders. The second to last day of class, they assigned two problem sets due during reading week. In this lecture of nearly 30 students, class attendance waned to the point that there was only 3 people in class one time. The professor was furious, and the TA's retroactively implemented participation as part of the grade. Then everyone started going to class, but stared at their laptops during all of class because it was unbearable to pay attention. Upon realizing that they had forced only attendance and not attention, they demanded us put away our laptops for the duration of class. Do not take this for a CS elective unless you have exhausted your options.",
    "The fun part was learning all the number theory behind the cryptography. I think there was more of this in past years, but students didn't like it. I personally like the math more, so I was disappointed that we didn't have more of the math. However, the class was still enjoyable because the topics were fun. Very useful.",
    "The course gives a well-rounded overview of many of the important topics in the field of cryptography, as well as some work that has been done on the research front. There's a lot of cool materials, so it may take some time to digest them well. The math treatment is not too intense\/involved, so most people should be able to handle it just fine. Overall speaking a good course.",
    "CS 467 is a good class for anyone who is interested in cryptography; however, some programming experience is necessary, and the class cannot be fully appreciated without a good background in CS>"
