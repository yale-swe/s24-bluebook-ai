    "Probably not because it was so much work and very stressful.",
    "If you're spending the time and money, you might as well do it well; I don't think it's worth a Cr\/D\/F, and it's hard not to love it and want to expend the effort. Definitely take it if you're interested in photography and making work you can be proud of, and be committed to taking it seriously.",
    "A lot of the kids in this course seem to have prior experience with cameras, but it doesn't mean a thing on their photos. Take it if you love the world and documentation, and if you love exploring light and darkness.",
    "This is an excellent class and one of the few at Yale that give you technical skills, but it is also a LOT of work that you can't do halfway.",
    "A lot of work but totally worth it\u2014Vicky is super cool and an amazing landscape photographer herself. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the darkroom, but you\u2019ll end up with some gorgeous prints that you\u2019ll treasure forever.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class."
