   "comments": [
    "The first half is really well organized and what is expected from a structural biology class. The second half is a lot of information from kinases, and specific kinases which gets repetitive, up to some extents boring and the time to study for the final is super short.",
    "The course organization was not the best. Less instructors would help. Some lectures had overlap.",
    "The strength of this course is to use a lot of structure detail to elucidate the mechanism of the target inhibitor. It would be better if teacher could arrange the range of teaching so that we won't have redundant class.",
    "Since the topics might be somewhat overlapping, some materials were covered repetitively. However, it's not a big issue.",
    "This course not only gives you a great deal of knowledge but also allows you to gain a lot of hands-on experience with Crystallography. Also, the instructors always relate the knowledge to real-life examples to get us more motivated to study the basic concepts. However, the tests are very daunting. They were brutal. But as long as you studied what was discussed in class, you will be fine.",
    "Very good course."

    "If they really like kinases and structural biology, yes",

    "Yes, it is very useful especially for pharmacology students. I like the practice class in the course so that I can get in touch with the crystallization and drug design procedure.",
    "Yes. This is one of my favorite courses here at Yale. They did a pretty good job of introducing pharmacology in the aspect of structural biology. The TAs are super helpful as well.",
    "Yes. If you are a pharmacology student, you should take it. It has all the necessary knowledge you need to know and also gives you a sense of how the pharmaceutical industry works nowadays.",
    "Yes, very nice if you want to learn about kinases"
