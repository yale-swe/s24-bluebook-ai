   "comments": [
    "I developed a very good understanding of the state-space representation of systems, observability, controllability, stability, feedback, state estimation, and optimal control, as well as an overview of adaptive control and learning.",
    "Learned a lot about linear systems, linearizing non-linear systems.",
    "I learnt a fair amount of mathematical systems and control theory, which is great, because that was what I was hoping to learn. It was nice being able to represent all sorts of systems in abstract forms and prove various properties about them, like whether they are controllable, observable, stable, or optimal.",
    "I learned how to set up and solve first order linear systems and linearize whatever I couldn't solve. I gained insights into control, learning, and optimization and applied the skills I learned to problems given in class and ones I found on my own. This is by miles the most useful course I've taken at Yale and the inspiration for me to continue working in this field after graduation."

   "comments": [
    "The course was a good overview of many topics. I would have liked to go more in depth into optimal control, and especially adaptive control, as we only got a high-level overview of that topic.",
    "Really enjoyed first half of course, second half was more less enjoyable since it seemed less focused and some lectures were left half finished.",
    "I really appreciated that this class was mathematical and proof-based, because I only feel like I really understand something if I can understand the math behind it, and this one of the few EENG courses that really focuses on that. That said, sometimes the notes were a little confusing and had typos, though mostly they were very thorough and detailed. I think I would also have learnt more if some of the later topics had been gone through more slowly (e.g. adaptive control, neural networks), as opposed to having overviews.",
    "This course has no weaknesses. It presents great material in a fast and followable manner that tells an incredible narrative of control theory."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those interested in control systems and control theory. It gave a good overview to many subjects, and an in-depth view to many topics in state-space representation and analysis of systems. Professor Narendra expects a lot from the final projects, but you get out what you put in.",
    "Great course, class project was enjoyable. Class lost focus during second half, which impeded learning.",
    "Take this class if you like a mathematical, proof-based approach to systems and control theory! You'll get to learn whether generic systems can be proved to be controllable, observable, stable, and you'll also learn how to optimize them using some not-too-difficult calculus of variations. Psets can be tough to work on alone, but both the TF and Prof. Narendra are very willing to help. And be prepared for a term project! Slightly less stressful than having a final exam, but it also means that you'll have to prepare and think about it far in advance (don't forget to meet up with Prof. Narendra regularly about it).",
    "If you're looking for a great EE elective look no further. This is by miles the most useful and engaging class I've taken. Very interesting material. Problem sets complement the lectures well. The midterm is very fair and the final projects are not only fun to do, but also fun to watch as the members of the class presents them. Professor Narendra is fantastic and helpful."
