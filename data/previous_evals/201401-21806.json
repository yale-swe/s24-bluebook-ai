   "comments": [
    "Light, flexible workload--newspaper response, book review with good book options, then either a final paper or exam, and the paper has tons of flexibility. Great Hu.",
    "Do the paper option instead of the final exam, and this course will be a factor in your life for about three days total. Great 5th+ class. Highly recommend on those grounds.",
    "An okay class...lectures are boring but there is no reason to go\/pay attention because there are no tests aside from the final. Section is no longer taught by Summers -- it's highly intense TAs instead. The assignments\/final aren't particularly difficult though, and if you choose to take the final you'll actually learn some interesting material (assuming you study the slides). Summers is a very nice guy, but be weary of the intense, mandatory section.",
    "A lot of people don't attend class. I did and the lectures really varied - sometimes they were really interesting and even entertaining, sometimes they were pretty dry. If you decide to write the final paper instead of taking the final exam, you don't really have to take lecture notes. I don't have a sense of how many people do the paper vs. the final, but I'd recommend writing the paper because you have a lot of flexibility in terms of what you can write about and you can choose something that interests you. If you have a choice of TA and they don't change, choose Con.",
    "The class isn't work intensive at all. The readings, though they will be discussed in section, aren't required as Professor Summers does a pretty good job of covering everything during lecture. If you're looking for an interesting class that isn't stressful, I would recommend this one.",
    "Definitely, definitely don't take it. Even though it's only 3 assessments, I honestly would have rather be in a more difficult and demanding class that was interesting rather this extremely boring one that a trained monkey could do.",
    "Good class- the history of molecular biology provides an interesting perspective and was quite interesting.",
    "With a one-page paper, a five-page paper, and the option of either a final exam or a final paper, this class was definitely not much work, but that was probably because few people put work into it. It has the potential to be interesting but I just think no one tries hard enough to make it so. I also think this was the first semester in which Professor Summer did not teach sections, and there were two teaching fellows as a result. I sensed that these teaching fellows did not get along, but that's not that relevant. As section leaders, I think they were both very good (I had James, and he was great). I would only recommend this course to a student who would actually try really hard in it, because then it could be rewarding. As for taking the final exam or writing the final paper, I did the final paper. It was a ton of work, but I learned so much about how to write a historical paper.",
    "As a biology major, I found the course material incredibly interesting, since the lectures portrayed the science that I\u2019d previously learned in science classes in a totally new historical perspective. Professor Summers is a good lecturer. Work-wise, there were few assignments, but the weekly readings were generally good to read. I would recommend this class to another student, but I would warn that a student might want to have a little more experience with history classes for the writing assignments.",
    "It is an interesting course, but Professor Summers can be dry. I had a few friends who dropped the course because they disliked their TA, but my TA was wonderful, making hte class well worth it.",
    "No work.",
    "It's a great class - light workload, interesting topic, and fun section.",
    "Molecules Life and Disease is a nice class. The lectures are interesting and professor Summers is knowledgable. There isn't too much work to be done (one 1 page article review and one 4-5 page book review) although the readings can be a bit dry. If you decide to take the final rather than write the paper, try and study along and along because the information can be overwhelming at the end.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the title.",
    "Meh, take it if you need the Hu credit or are a HSHM major, otherwise not the most interesting. Material has promise, but wasn't delivered very compellingly. Not a ton of work except the final paper (or exam) at the end."
