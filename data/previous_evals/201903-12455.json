    "I developed a broader depth of knowledge in the skills and traits of an Air Force Officer.",
    "I learned what it means to be an officer in the Air Force.",
    "I learned the basics of what it means to be an officer in the Air Force.",
    "A good introduction to Air Force history and regulations.",
    "I learned how to be both a better leader and follower, and learned many of the values of the US Air Force.",
    "I learned basic information about how the Air Force functions (e.g. courtesies, dress and appearance, etc.)",
    "Basic knowledge of rank structure, insignia, and pay-grades. Customs and uniform details. Very minimal information about what it means to be a leader.",
    "I learned the USAF's purpose and mission, the values that the Air Force stands for, the duties and expectations of Air Force officers, and basic Air Force customs and courtesies.",
    "The course covers basic military introduction material, from rank structure to dress and appearance standards. It's very basic as it is the first of the AS classes, but serves its purpose."

    "This course is a very good course to transition civilian students to the military life required by ROTC, and eventually active duty. Its only weakness is that it is limited by the curriculum approved by HQ AFROTC, and perhaps not as rigorous as a typical Yale College course.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the instructors engagement with the students.",
    "The course was very strong in the content it presented, I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "It was taught well, I have a good understanding of the information now",
    "This course had a very low workload. Other than the talking paper and briefing we didn't do much. But I think that's how it was designed.",
    "Weaknesses: not very engaging and not very informative Strengths: practicing a talking paper presentation was helpful"

    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in an Air Force career. Even if that student eventually decides military life isn't for him\/her, the course would've still given the student the insight necessary to make that decision.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in becoming an Air Force officer one day.",
    "Only if you're in ROTC",
    "I would not recommend a Yale student not in AFROTC to take this class.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to expectations in AFROTC and one's Air Force career."
