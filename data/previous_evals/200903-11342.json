    "I would recommend it to other students. For an \"intro\" L5 I feel, based on conversations with other students in the conversation class, that it is much more worth your time and effort. Be prepared to work a lot. Definitely take it though.I've heard great things about Terry Seymour but I absolutely loved having Juliana as a professor. You probably can't go wrong either way.",
    "This is an advanced course in Spanish grammar. It goes takes a more in-depth look at grammar concepts learned in previous years of Spanish study. For example, the course includes a very advanced study of ser\/estar, preterite\/imperfect, subjunctive\/indicative, sequence of tenses, relative pronouns, adjectives, etc. The class has two midterms, a presentation, 3 writing assignments, and a final exam.",
    "Yes, take this class! It's a good chunk of work (several exercises due for each class), but definitely worth it. You learn all sorts of nuance and intricacies of the language that you've probably never encountered before. A lot of the rules you learned arediscarded in this class, since there are so many exceptions. (e.g. swapping ser for estar or the preterit for the imperfect in a sentence that you once learned could only work with one of them is actually still correct with the other, but has a whole other meaning) This class also had a surprising amount of conversation time in it (almost as much as Advanced Conversation when I took it!), which I was happily surprised by.And definitely take it with Juliana! A topic like grammar could be a really dry, boring class, but she makes it so much more exciting! She's a wonderful person and truly wants you to understand the material. I would take a course if she were teaching it; she's great.",
    "I would recommend this class really only for people who are doing the Spanish major. It's a lot of busy work for a credit.",
    "This course involves a lot of work, but it doesn't have to be difficult. I took it after L3 and L4 and it is not too much of a skill-level jump. The assignments take up a lot of time and can sometimes be mundane but they are graded very easily, as long as you do them, and correct them the way the syllabus instructs you to. In terms of material, the course is fabulous. It clears up so many of the Spanish grammar concepts that are never detailed in lower level Spanish classes. Sometimes the material is a little heavy, but the course is not overly daunting.",
    "If you take this class, TAKE IT WITH JULIANA. She is an amazing instructor and this class might even become your favorite, if you do. Her endless enthusiasm, energy, humor, and talkative nature made the class a true joy and added much-needed life to a topic as dry as Spanish grammar. As far as the class itself goes, it is a LUDICROUS amount of busy work (regarding homework), but I found it all very helpful, and I feel my Spanish (and especially vocabulary) has improved significantly since the start of the semester. Even my speaking has improved, though it is not the focus of the course. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to brush up on Spanish vocabulary, grammar, writing, reading, and speaking, and who doesn't want to deal with the ridiculous forced dialogues of Advanced Spanish Grammar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking to improve your Spanish grammar.",
    "Yeah, if you want to strengthen your grammar. Lots of busy work for homework, but honestly I don't think there is a better way to reinforce the grammar concepts. Prof. Ramos-Ruano is super nice and I couldn't imagine a better teacher for the class. She is so enthusiastic and devoted to all of her students. Grading is pretty harsh though. It was hard to do well.",
    "This class has an incredible amount of busywork, so it's not for the faint of heart. Even if you have a very good grammar background, it is more work than you think it will be, just because of the sheer volume (as opposed to difficulty) of written assignments. Take it with Juliana Ramos. She's a pretty strict grader, but you learn more that way. She puts in a ton of time and is always willing to work individually with students. She's sweet, energetic, and funny.",
    "I would recommend it only if it is necessary for your spanish, or for your major."
