   "comments": [
    "It was a difficult course, especially the grammar, but it's the last level of french where you have to learn new grammar - so that makes it definitely worth it.",
    "French 140 is like a french 135---you cover things that were taught in 130, but add in a few new things. The majority of new things that one learns comes from integrating the old with the new. I would say keep going with this course if you are interested in learning french. You'll definitely improve your writing ability if you actually dedicate time to the redactions. The homework can be a lot, but if you space out time for it each night, you'll definitely come away with more from each class versus doing it all the half hour before. If you're looking for an easy language requirement filler class, this isn't it. But if you are looking for a class that will force you to work harder on improving your language, this is it.",
    "140 is great for learning French and getting exposed to some good French literature and culture. You have to read a lot, speak a lot, and learn a lot of vocabulary, which really trains you to in the language very comprehensively. I completely recommend it. The work sometimes because a bit overwhelming, and it certainly deserves to be a 1.5-credit course, but it is worth it if you are trying to improve your understanding and fluency in the French language.",
    "A lot of work but worth it.",
    "French 140 is an incredibly taught intermediate\/advanced French course. The professors are fantastic, the books you read are wonderful, and the course emphasizes fluency not only in reading and writing but also in speaking and communicating. The class is quite challenging given the high workload and Monday-Friday sessions, but you can really tell that the teachers are invested in helping you learn French. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would certainly recommend Fren 140 02 to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a continuation of french grammar learning and an introduction to larger french novels. We read two books and analyzed them as well as a few films, in addition to grammar points that were both reviewed and taught. This course truly improved my french, and allowed me to especially ameliorate my speaking, since you are always expected to speak in class and take part in discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Whether are not you are serious about learning the language or are just trying to complete you're distributional credits, this class is a great experience!"
