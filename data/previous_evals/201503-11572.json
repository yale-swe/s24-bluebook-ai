    "Absolutely! I think every self-respecting Yale student should take Basic Drawing before she graduates, because it develops an intensity of search, a liveliness of spirit, and an ability to see that is absolutely imperative to live a perceptive life. Basic Drawing is a beautiful course, and the section with Pedro is very little work. He's a cool guy, and he made our class laugh every day during our in-class crits. Definitely recommended.",
    "ART 114 is not a \"basic\" drawing class in that if you have no experience with drawing it might be a little difficult. You will spend 4 hours a week drawing for homework, but for me it was very relaxing and therapeutic. Sometimes it was hard keeping on top of my work, but other than that I loved basic drawing!",
    "Definitely, take it with Pedro Barbeito! So far he is the best instructor I have encountered at Yale. I very much enjoyed his creative teaching style. He is very supportive and very nice with his critique. He will find something interesting even in a 'below the average' drawing and will explain how to improve or how to use certain technique, etc. but at the same time will tell how to polish even an excellent drawing. His homework assignments are interesting, very creative (give a huge room to experiment), often challenging but not overly time consuming. I felt that the workload to be just perfect. He expects you to spend 4 hours a week working on your homework and very much appreciates if you go beyond that suggestion. It doesn't matter whether you have never seriously drawn before or you have a comprehensive art school background -- you will enjoy this course, learn a lot of new and improve your drawing skills."
