    "I learned to recognize and improve on my spoken and written hebrew. I learned a lot about cultural trends and discussions regarding the language in Israel. My favorite was a discussion on gendered language in Israel. It's interesting to see how such issues are thought about from the perspective of a very gendered language.",
    "I learned so much about the way in which Hebrew has changed due to globalization and changing circumstances of modernity. I improved my vocabulary in a really warm and positive environment while gaining a deeper understanding of Israeli society through this course.",
    "My Hebrew greatly improved because of this class. I fixed many of my writing mistakes and became much more confident in my speaking skills. I also learned a lot about Israeli society's relationship to modern Hebrew and how the language has been impacted feminism, immigration, political movements, and youth culture.",
    "In particular, my writing was vastly improved by this course along with my speaking.",
    "I developed my vocabulary, grammar skills, and a better understanding of contemporary debates and themes related to the development of the Hebrew language."

   "comments": [
    "I very much enjoyed the set up of this course although I would appreciate more readings in Hebrew, sometimes discussion felt a bit forced, so maybe it could be good for us to have some response questions regarding the reading, not just writing whatever comes to mind for each of us. This would guide our thoughts and the discussion a bit more.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I really enjoy the course set-up, weekly reading responses in Hebrew and then a midterm and final. Professor Roginsky is extremely engaged and provides fascinating examples for the given topics we discuss in class.",
    "The class really helped me develop my Hebrew skills, but was boring at times.",
    "Although we were conversing in class, I didn't always feel like my Hebrew skills were increasing. I think there could be more vocabulary taught in the class and made applicable to class conversation, homework assignments, and quizzes.",
    "The class was very student driven and discussion based. This made for interesting conversation usually.",
    "I think this course did a good job of surveying a variety of important issues. I think the course could have benefited by integrating grammar lessons more consistently, although I understand that is not the focus of the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very insightful and interesting--take it if you are interested in a sociological and modern take on the hebrew language.",
    "I absolutely would. Professor Roginsky is a wonderful teacher and mentor. She present fascinating topics related to Hebrew's development in modern times. I learned so much about topics I'd never even considered before, such as Hebrew names, online Hebrew language (like AIM language), or how children's books shape society through their language.",
    "If you're taking L5 Hebrew, I'd definitely suggest this course. The topics are really relevant, and it's interesting to take a language course in which you're discussing the modern progression of that language.",
    "This course really improved my skills in Hebrew and exposed me to new facets of Israeli culture and life.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in high level discourse about contemporary challenges and developments in the Hebrew language."
