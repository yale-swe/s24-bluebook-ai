   "comments": [
    "I gained a better understanding of contemporary art and artists.",
    "This class really gave me a good survey overview of African American art and artistic movements from the 1950-2000s. I was exposed to a lot of art I would have otherwise not known about, and that's what I loved about the course.",
    "I learned to look critically at art as well as a lot of really great material about African American history and the inner conflicts in the art world.",
    "I learned how to evaluate modern art in this course. It taught me how culture, social, political conditions help to inspire art.",
    "Introduction to almost all of the most famous African American artists.",
    "I'm glad that I took the class because it introduced me to a wealth of amazing artists who are, unfortunately, not nearly as well known as they should be. I loved having a reason to visit YUAG so often.",
    "I learned a lot about black art and I learned to talk about art in a way that I wasn't able to before.",
    "I learned so much about recognizing African-American art and, because this was my first art history, I developed a vocabulary to talk about art.",
    "Developed a lot of research skills to complement visual analysis with cultural references.",
    "I developed a good working knowledge of African-American Art History since 1963, plus some skills re: how to look at\/talk about\/read about art in an academic art-historical fashion.",
    "I learned how to apply scholarly essays to the wide variety of art we studied. Access to YUAG's private viewings also improved my skills in close looking and visual analysis. Memorization played a big role in the class, and studying a large amount of works by very different artists showed the diversity in African-American art.",
    "I got such a better understanding of the trajectory of African American life in the US after the civiil rights movement. I was exposed to so many artists with whom I wasn't familiar simply because they're excluded from the Western canon... they are so worthwhile. I look at performance art and music in a new and improved way now, since Professor James didn't limit the material to the visual arts.",
    "As a graduate student, this course instilled in me a critical wealth of history related to my personal pursuits in the arts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material covered in the class is really wonderful, but there is an overwhelming amount to get through. The lecture's seem to be less about talking about the artworks and more about defending the choice to include them.",
    "I think the only thing that could be improved upon would be more focus on connections among artists in multiple generations. Towards the end it became a little hard to distinguish developments between artists like Bailey and Edwards when studying many others as well.",
    "The strength of the class was that the professor made sure to include feminist and women's histories of African American art, and to make sure it wasn't all male-centered. The only downside to the class was that it was really lacking in lgbt art and artists--maybe a quick shout out to Marlon Riggs (and Ligon, but we didn't talk about his homosexuality in this context), which was somewhat disappointing.",
    "I wish the content of the final had been clearer and that the readings from journals were included on the resources, because some were really hard to find online.",
    "The course did a good job of introducing me to a wide range of black artists. A lot of works were covered, and the connection between art and politics was focused on. I would have like more focus on the creative process of the artists.",
    "Interesting lecture that really comes together at the end. Perhaps less reading, since students were not very engaged with them.",
    "I wish that the class focused more on developing our tools of visual analysis -- perhaps through a couple of readings. We did this in section to an extent, but I don't think those conversations really sharpened my skills. I also really wish that we had received an image list of potential material for the final before hand. With three other classes requiring work during finals period, it was highly stressful to attempt to memorize ~200 images in just a couple of days. It's unfortunate that the Whitney field trip didn't work out, because it would have been nice. It often felt like section didn't have as much depth as it could have, maybe. Then again, the structure limits how much you can really discuss. Toward the end of the class (post-black and beyond) it felt like the themes for each lecture weren't as clear.",
    "The course could be improved by not talking about art before 1963, and to focus on a smaller amount of works in order to give them the time and credit they deserve.",
    "I feel like the course tries to do too much. I would rather do justice to a select few artists and works without rushing through every possible thing (not that others shouldn't be mentioned, but a lot of other students mentioned to me that they wished they had spent more intimate classes with specific artists).",
    "Strengths: clear chronological order, many good readings, compelling selection of artists, comprehensive curriculum, awesome TF. Weakness: promised a couple more awesome things than it delivered. For example, we didn't take a field trip to the Whitney museum as promised, nor did the director of Lemonade come in. Not actually problems, of course, but a little disappointing--maybe next time it would be better to leave those kinds of things as surprises in case they don't work out, rather than announcing them far in advance.",
    "The strengths of the class include the broad and fascinating subject material and Yale's excellent resources. The greatest weakness was definitely the poor organization of the class, and lack of any historical thread throughout.",
    "The current format is exceptional and could only grow with more outside trips to museums to experience the work first hand."

   "comments": [
    "This is an important class for Yale to offer as it attracts people from many disciplines to participate in discussions about art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; changes your outlook on art, among other things.",
    "Absolutely. Knowing art history is so important, and knowing the art history of people who have been historically excluded by the art world--and continue to be excluded--is even more important.",
    "This was my favorite course at Yale (and I'm a senior so there's no chance of anything beating it). I absolutely loved this course, and I'm so sad Professor James won't be here next year to teach it again. You learn so much about art and culture, and its not limited to the African American community on its own...you learn about the intersection of black artists with the \"mainstream\" (i.e. white) art world that has for so long been the major focus of exhibits. I loved looking at the art in class every day, and even going back and studying it was really wonderful because it meant I got to see it again. Professor James chose such amazing works to look at.",
    "I would 10000% recommend this class to another story",
    "I would recommend this work. The workload is pretty standard for an art history course and a wide range of artists are discussed. A lot of time is spent focusing on how art interacts with society, and not much on the creative process.",
    "Solid art history course. Take it for the simple joy of being introduced to the work of so many incredible artists. The course is definitely doable even if you don't have an art history background. It has a fair amount of work, so do note the syllabus. The final involved an excessive amount of memorization, but it doesn't count for a huge portion of the final grade. I would encourage you to take it.",
    "No I would not, because Erica James is leaving and her experience teaching the course is the best.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You'll learn and grow so much!",
    "Definitely! For me, at least, it brought a welcome pairing with directed studies, which doesn't have time to\/just doesn't focus on black artists.",
    "Great course! Unfortunately, neither the prof nor the TF I took it with will be there in the future, so I can't speak too much to the logistics, grading, etc. But if you're interested in the material then go for it! It's cool that it's so contemporary; if you see African-American art in a contemporary museum after taking this course, you'll be likely to know the artist or the influences from class!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with an existing knowledge of the timeline of Aftican American Art. It did not provide a historical background, and was very heavily based on visual analysis and scholarly readings than history.",
    "Yes!! It's so valuable to look at minority artists, and the questions of racial representation this course raised are incredibly important to discuss.",
    "Yes, this course was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Highly informative, engaging, and at a pace in which everyone has a chance to learn."
