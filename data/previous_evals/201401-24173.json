   "comments": [
    "Overall, I liked the concepts covered by the course. It's a good introduction to surveillance, and covers a lot of the important concepts and challenges in surveillance methods. I liked the organization of the course.The methods portion of the class could use a little tweaking--we used R for this portion of the course, and while I appreciate exposure to different statistical analysis packages, the focus felt like it was learning R rather than learning concepts. As all students are exposed to SAS at YSPH, that package seems more appropriate. I also think that it would be nice to incorporate the methods in all the final projects, and I wonder if the learning experience associated with the final project would benefit by integrating the two options for this year. I also thought the grading was a little too easy in the course, and think that it's ok for students to struggle a little in applying concepts, as this ultimately facilitates learning.",
    "Overall, the course was pretty good. It gives a good understanding of how to set up a surveillance system and how analysis works.As for weaknesses, the first five or so weeks of the course were pretty simplistic and uninteresting- the material could be compressed into two or three weeks. The next section the involved R coding was tough to follow since most of us had no experience in R. If one lecture was devoted to teaching the basics of R and how it compares to SAS, it would have made the rest of the course a lot more clear.",
    "-good introduction to surveillance-interesting mix of topics in the introductory lectures, student projects-homework not returned in timely manner-weekly readings should be posted more quickly--maybe a week in advance?-readings listed in syllabus didn't always match what was posted online-would put more time between \"journal club\" presentations and final group presentations-would like grade back on journal club presentation-methods section didn't work too well (although good info)--maybe could try to get time in the computer lab for those Wednesdays and could just use SAS instead of R-guest lectures could be more engaging",
    "Enjoyed the methods of how surveillance is done. R-programming was not fun although others who enjoy programming may have enjoyed it.",
    "This course was a fantastic overview of surveillance in public health. The lectures were really great and I loved the case studies. The guest lecturers were for the most part very good.The homework was challenging and I'm not sure that it contributed much to the course. I think it would have been more beneficial to spread out the homework assignments rather than have them all be done during the month of March or so, which made the workload a little hard to manage for this course. I think if R continues to be a part of the course, there should be 2-3 lectures just on introducing students to R.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the laboratory component of this course. The labs were straightforward and the TA was very helpful. It was also nice to gain exposure to R. Emphasis was on content rather than learning the programming language which was a plus.Weaknesses: The emphasis on group projects. Most of the work for this class was due at the end of the semester and relied heavily on group work. Having the student presentations spread throughout the semester may have worked better.",
    "It was a good introduction to surveillance. I didn't know much about it beforehand. I don't think I could perform any sort of surveillance analysis at the end of the day, but I know the different kinds of surveillance systems\/analyses are.",
    "Overall, I would rate this course 7 out of 10. It was great but I know it could be much better if",
    "This course was a solid introduction into the basics of surveillance. It did a good job of teaching the different types of surveillance systems and getting students familiar with terminology and basic statistical methods. The topics covered were very diverse, keeping the course interesting throughout. One of the weaknesses of the course was some of the guest lectures overlapping with other courses (creating some redundant material for quite a few people) and some of the difficulties with the methods section of the course. While teaching surveillance methods is a great idea, it was difficult to keep the whole class on the same page since many people came from varying levels of statistical backgrounds. The course should either have a few prerequisites to ensure that those coming in have the appropriate skill level, or should be truly an introductory course with a separate lab component to teach the basics of R (the coding language used for the methods section). Personally, while the methods assignments were very difficult for me at times, I would not remove that section of the course as I thought it provided a reallyimportant intro into modeling that I wouldn't have gotten elsewhere. That being said, it was frustrating at times trying to put in the extra work to learn the syntax of R by myself. With the demands of all my other classes it was difficult to put in enough time to ensure that I was learning how to code properly. Spreading those lessons throughout the semester may help alleviate the huge increase in workload around the methods section of the course.Lastly, the case studies were very enjoyable and I liked class discussions after group presentations. A lot of good ideas were brought up and Dan was very good at asking questions that got to the root of issues and made people think.",
    "A great into into surveillance methods. The final projects were helpful in helping students to think about how the methods learned would be applied in the real world.The methods classes were particularly useful, if more challenging. A stronger and more in-depth focus on the methods would be useful, even if this came at the expense of other course material. Some of the concepts, especially if it involves using R, are challenging and seemed unpopular but will provide students a competitive edge in the workforce.",
    "Strengths: Strong surveillance principles outlined, with many case-studies of real surveillance problems and solutions. Good introduction to many infectious disease surveillance issues and ways data is collected. Guest lectures were interesting and engaging. Introduction to methods was very useful.Weaknesses: Surveillance of mostly infectious diseases were covered. 1-2 lectures to discuss environmental health, chronic illnesses, or surveillance of social problems might be interesting. Readings were sometimes highly technical which was at odds with the general overview feel of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0It's clear that Dr. Weinberger cares about the course and ensuring students are getting something out of it. He's very responsive to feedback, and welcomes suggestions for improvement. He's great!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0The course was taught well- some restructuring of the first section and some more effort into teaching R would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0-great professor--very knowledgeable and approachable-very willing o help students",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Excellent teaching style and engagement with students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was really great. He made a really great effort to get to know the students, which I think was fantastic. He really cared about getting feedback and trying to improve the course. I really enjoyed his fostering of discussion, and it was evident that he knew what he was talking about and was passionate about sharing the knowledge with students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Not bad for his first class. Still trying to work out some things, but he responds well to students questions and comments. Clearly cares about the class and students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan's awesome! He's very relatable and incredibly nice. His lecturing style improved greatly.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was a very responsive, very open professor that was always receptive to feedback and great at listening to student input. It was fun getting to know him throughout the semester, and the lectures improved as the semester progressed. Some of the other guest lectures were redundant (already covered in other classes), but case studies and discussions were a highlight.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dr. Weinberger was an excellent resource both in and out of the classroom. He was always willing to meet with students and his natural curiosity and passion for the subject was clear. It is great to have a professor that is so encouraging of students to follow the ideas that interest them the most within the context of surveillance. YSPH needs more professors of his caliber!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Strengths: Very approachable and sensitive to student's commentary about the course. Very knowledgable about the subject material, and willing to integrate student's interests into the course format. Homework and projects were fair and useful in the context of the course. Case-studies and discussion questions were a nice way to break up lectures.Neutral: Methods component of the course was interesting and useful for some students, while stressful for others. This portion could be included as a lab component or split into another more advanced course. As it is now some may find it useful but not enough, others that it is too much.Weaknesses: Lecture information presented in slides did not always mesh well with what was asked for in homework assignments. Lectures presented different, and useful methods, but did not always discuss strengths and weaknesses or situations where one method was preferable and why. Maybe include a take-away points slide at the end. I expect this will improve since this is Dr. Weinberger's first class and he is very attentive to student's needs."

    "Instructor: Marina Antillon \u00a0Overall, Marina seemed very knowledgeable about the subject matter and was responsive to emails. She was the main lecturer for the methods section of the course, which was at times confusing or difficult to follow. This could also be because I did not have a very solid stats background, but overall those lectures could be better organized in the futre.",
    "Instructor: Marina Antillon \u00a0Marina was an excellent TF. The classes she led were well thought out and easy to follow. She explained difficult concepts in a manner that was easy for students to understand. She made an effort to meet with students who were having problems understanding the course material, and she displayed a high degree of understanding of the course material.",
    "Instructor: Marina Antillon \u00a0Strengths: Very approachable. Good grasp of methods questions presented in homework. Responded quickly to emails and always made time for questions and office hours. Always willing to assist and help when problems occurred.Weaknesses: Was very prepared for methods lectures but could work on presentation skills."

    "Overall, good course. I think the course will be even better next year, as Dr. Weinberger has solicited feedback from students throughout the course. It's a good introduction to public health surveillance, and though the focus is on infectious diseases, it's appropriate and interesting for non-EMD students.",
    "Reasonably useful in providing the basics for public health surveillance.In spite of some issues with the class, the lecturers seemed genuinely interested in improving it and I think this class is worth recommending.",
    "-would recommend-flexibility in group projects-interesting topics",
    "This is a great course -- probably more interesting if you know R already and spatial mapping and want to expand on the knowledge but for students without prior knowledge of this, I think it's a great introduction to surveillance and helped me learn a lot that was only alluded to briefly in other courses.",
    "With a bit of restructuring, this will be a great course. I still feel like I learned a lot, although having most of the work due during the second half of the semester was very stressful.",
    "This class was good, but will undoubtedly be much better in the future. Great class overall.",
    "This will give some rudimentary skills in programming and some basic knowledge in surveillance. If you are interested in the subject, you should take it since Dan is a fantastic professor and it will only be getting better.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topics covered. Once the course is fine-tuned (this was the first year it was taught like this) it should get even better. The minor setbacks from this semester should be addressed within a few rounds of teaching the course and it looks like it will be a solid option for anyone wanting to learn more about surveillance.",
    "Public Health Surveillance is a good introduction to infectious disease surveillance. The class has a quantitative methods component that is a \"taster\" of surveillance methods which students should be prepared for. Lectures are information heavy, such that doing the reading assists in picking out pertinent points. The professor and TA are very approachable and knowledgeable in the subject matter and very committed to improving a student's learning experience."
