    "By all means. You will learn a surprising amount about the critical side of art that can help in your creative work.",
    "If you want to take this course you are probs an art major. Definitely take it and love it! It changed the way I look at my work, and certainly changed my plans for the future. There is some reading, but you will get more out of it than you put in. YIKES great seminar.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The readings are great, Jeffrey is great, and the class will help you in your thinking about your own work and the work of the last century."
