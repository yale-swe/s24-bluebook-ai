   "comments": [
    "First, Dean Levesque is an incredible person and teacher, so take this course to get to know him and witness first hand what it is like to study under someone who is truly passionate about what he or she is teaching. Second, this course is a true gem in Yale's Bluebook. Few people come across, or even consider the possibility of, a course on the history of education in the United States that is, in fact, rooted in the history of the University itself. But, for the few who choose to consider the sequence of events that have led them to be sleeping, eating, and studying in a residential college at one of the finest institutions of higher learning in the world, as well as partaking in a liberal education, this is the course for you. This course takes one through the founding of the colonies and the first college in America, Harvard, to the battlefields of religion and war that indelibly shaped the American colleges, to the clash of the curricula, to the modern university in an era dominated by technology and research, and it is, in my opinion, a wonderful opportunity to reflect on one's education through many lenses, e.g. history, religion, industrialism, democracy, feminism, civil rights, etc. It is the perfect course for a senior, especially a second semester one!",
    "Take the course if you'd like to learn about the history of higher ed, especially at Yale. Phenomenal course if the topic interests you, and I can't imagine why it wouldn't.",
    "History of Higher Ed is such a great course - it allows you to really learn about how the modern college system came to be, and in the process, reflect on your own experience and things you had never questioned before. Assignments are manageable and well thought-out, and Dean Levesque is an understanding and fantastic professor! Definitely take it if you can; it was a fantastic senior spring course.",
    "History of Higher Education is a really interesting and fun class that doesn't require a lot of work. It will make you think about your own college experience, and the final research paper is a great opportunity to learn about something you are interested in at Yale. Definitely recommend taking it if Dean Levesque is teaching it!",
    "This is one of a few classes at Yale that forced me to stop thinking about grades and start thinking about what I was learning. It's a pretty reflective course that is more about critical (and sometimes philosophical) thinking, research skills, and cultural evaluation than shoving down material to spit it back up. This class is absolutely worth your time if you're willing to do the reading participate; you're going to get out what you put into it. It's a Yale-specific opportunity; take it if you can.",
    "You should take it. You get to learn about college history, especially Yale history, and it's fascinating. The reading load and the final paper make it a course you should take seriously, but it only meets one a week and you can do your research paper on whatever you want. It also made me more eloquent in a seminar format, which is definitely helpful.",
    "This is a fun, light class. That said, it is primarily a study of the higher education of WASP-y men in the US, and focuses too much on ancient history (read: 18th and 19th century) rather than more recent\/relevant stuff."
