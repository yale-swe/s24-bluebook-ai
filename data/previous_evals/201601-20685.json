   "comments": [
    "Personally, I found this semester's texts far more engaging and relevant than last semester's. You get a wide range of European and American historians, and don't spend more than one week on any one of them, which is definitely a plus if you're looking to expand the breadth of your knowledge.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to other students. The books are very interesting, and discussing social contract theorists can really change how you think about humans.",
    "I highly recommend Spring DS HP to a fellow student. DS is the best way to learn and engage with this material, which I consider to be necessary for the productive discussion of modern political and current issues.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. Definitely the best of the 3 DS classes, it shows you a ton of different thinkers and helps you move past accepting the state as a normal thing. HP lets you look at government anew and say, Well that's weird. Almost every single author on the syllabus is phenomenal. Don't start papers Thursday night until second semester at the earliest. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to look cool\/tough and will not do as well on the papers as if they had started earlier. Try to do all of the reading for HP, just because it's all interesting and worthwhile. DS in general is pretty great, and a unique experience, and HP is definitely the best of the 3 classes.",
    "I would recommend it to another student."
