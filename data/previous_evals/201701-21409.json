    "This was a fantastic survey of Victorian novels. The syllabus covered enough that it felt like a true survey, but not too many as to prevent Professor Yeazell delving into the works in great detail.",
    "I learned how to structure arguments in literary analysis through the lectures in this class, as well as how to make time for large quantities of reading on a regular basis. More specifically, I learned a lot about the Victorian period in Britain and how authors responded to the changing times, how they published their books, and why the period was so fruitful for the literary form of the novel.",
    "I developed a newfound but infectious love for Victorian Literature, 19th century England, George Eliot and Charlotte Bronts prose, the themes that were pressing and prevalent to readers, and the narratives that are and are not included in Victorian novels. I strengthened my close reading and paper writing skills.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation of Victorian literature, from an academic perspective (one that I would not have gained by reading it on my own). Professor Yeazell's lectures illuminated so many new ways to read a canonical text, and gave me new ammunition to read more Victorian novels on my own.",
    "became better critical thinker and reader",
    "* An understanding of the history of the novel as a writing form, with a particular emphasis on its emergence in England * Finessed my skills to both read critically and understand larger themes from individual passages in addition to the text as a whole * A greater understanding of the role and function of the narrative scope, style and tense, historical, chronological, and geographical setting, and the use of epigraphs in a novel * A deeper appreciation for the wide breadth and diversity of 19th century British novels and a new found love for George Elliot's Middlemarch",
    "I think I became a much better novel reader - I learned to pay attention to details in the text that I would otherwise ignore. I also learned a lot about the historical context for the novels that I would not otherwise have understood.",
    "I learned much more about a specific period of literature, and I learned more about the difference between historicism and formism in literary criticism.",
    "Before taking this class, my knowledge of 19th century literature was limited to a standard high school level, so from a strictly content-related point of view, I gained a significant insight into Victorian England's literature, and how it relates to the literature of other eras. My critical writing, I feel, also improved through the practice gained in the class.",
    "I learned a ton about Victorian novels and the Victorian era!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The selection of novels is perfect as is the way that Professor Yeazell structures lectures, both across the entire semester and across the series on each novel. I also appreciated the chance to write 2 papers across 3 deadlines and the opportunity to submit re-writes on the first paper--it really helped to get and apply constructive feedback on the first paper and made grades much less of a focus. Don't change a thing.",
    "The reading schedule was fair, and I especially liked being assigned Middlemarch over spring break because it made an overwhelming text slightly less overwhelming. The lectures were engaging and fascinating. I don't have any improvements to suggest for the course.",
    "This course is extremely well-structured, with an incredible syllabus. Professor Yeazell is a fantastic lecturer, and section was always engaging. I especially appreciated having the opportunity to revise a paper for a better grade if I handed in a paper on the first rewrite date. The only weakness of the course is that I wanted more than 50 minutes per lecture\/section to discuss and think about the material we were reading.",
    "The classroom in LC was a little dark\/claustrophobic. I think Professor Yeazell's students would benefit even more from her lectures if we could have a brighter room. Also, I think the course load could be heavier, i.e. 3 papers instead of 2.",
    "too much reading amazing lectures",
    "Strengths: - wonderful professor and teaching fellows - the selection of books (in the spring of 2017 we read Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, North and South, Middlemarch, and Tess of the D'Ubervilles) - insightful lectures Weaknesses - at times the page numbers of the various passages we would read were hard to keep track of; would be nice if a list of those page numbers were passed out in class every day - documents such as first two sets of paper topics only being available through paper copy and midterm instructions only projected during section; would have been nice to have had those uploaded on Canvas to access - Midterm being given in section at the same time that we read another book (North and South) -- made it difficult to truly focus on that novel and as a consequence was the one I understood the least",
    "I loved this course. I thought the lectures were fascinating and the section was very productive. I think the only improvement would be setting aside time to address student question once a week or once every other week in lecture.",
    "Great reading list, but you need to keep up with the readings.",
    "It's a wonderful course in terms of the material taught and the professor. The novels are fabulous and Professor Yeazell lectures about them in a warm, accessible, incredibly knowledgeable way. She is a treasure. The quantity of reading is somewhat daunting and at times overwhelming, and it's very easy to get behind very quickly. But it's well worth it to read all of the novels, even if the discussion sections sometimes leave something to be desired depending on the TA.",
    "Lecture was interesting as well as very helpful in preparation for writing essays and for exams. I enjoyed all of the books although it was a lot of reading.",
    "There is way, WAY to much reading. I just simply was not able to complete 400 pages of dense Victorian prose per week. This class could easily cut North and South and lose very little.",
    "The course's strengths are in its outstanding syllabus and in Professor Yeazell's lectures. She is eminently knowledgeable and a gifted lecturer, and the books on the reading list are absolute pleasures to read. The course's weaknesses are in the sections, which I found tended to be disconnected from the content of the lecture, and confused rather than enriched the reading."

    "Absolutely take this class! It's a great opportunity to read some fantastic novels and to really engage with the material in a new way. It is a lot of reading, so you do need to stay on top of it, but Professor Yeazell picks fantastic books, so it doesn't feel like work, it feels like leisure. The lectures are fantastic and every one is fascinating--I never miss class! Not to mention, Professor Yeazell's leather pants are super cool.",
    "Definitely take this class -- the books are amazing and a ton of fun to read (I did not expect to get so into Great Expectations, despite having read it already), Prof. Yeazell is a fantastic lecturer, and you come away with a wonderful sense of not only the changing rhythms of the Victorian era but also its place in a broader social\/historical, artistic, and literary trajectory. The lectures are also a great lesson in how to structure complex yet easy to follow arguments.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. The reading can feel overwhelming, but it is absolutely worth it to keep up, so that you can relish in Prof. Yeazells amazing lectures. Not only that, but the reading is definitely worth doing, and the rest of the class is structured so that the class assignments are evenly and fairly spaced out throughout the semester. One of the best English courses Ive taken in the major.",
    "Yes, if you love to read. Even if you don't think you have a particular soft spot for Victorian novels, this course may cause you to develop that soft spot.",
    "best class ever if you like the syllabus. absolute must take for an english major. amazing lectures",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who hasn't read any\/all of the novels on the syllabus AND\/OR wishes to read, analyze, and learn from them through the interesting lectures of an incredible professor, Ruth Yeazell. Though the readings can be substantial at times, they are worth reading and Professor Yeazell does an excellent job picking out the most significant themes, questions, and conflict that arise in each. Even as a second semester senior, I looked forward to every lecture!",
    "This is a great course! The novels are really enjoyable, the workload is light, and most importantly the lectures are phenomenal. I had read half of the books before, but I still learned so much and got so much more out of them. I especially appreciated the way the course deals with empire and race in these novels, a theme which is often not addressed.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The novels are wonderful and Ruth Yeazell is a fantastic lecturer. She knows the material and the period as though she lived through it, and I always enjoyed hearing her interpretations of these works. Just be prepared for a great deal of reading that is sometimes difficult to manage.",
    "I would recommend this class, certainly. However, it is a lot of reading. I had already read two out of six of the novels going into the class, and I honestly don't know what I would've done if I hadn't already read those books. So in order to get the most out of this class, I would recommend either reading some of the books beforehand or just committing a good amount of time to it. That being said, it was a wonderful class and I thoroughly enjoyed lecture and section and every single one of the books.",
    "I do recommend the course. You just have to go in knowing you can't read everything or you'll get frustrated. Yeazell's lectures are sometimes inaccessible, so you zone out. But overall it's a good course if you're an English major and like the period.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anybody at Yale, and especially English majors (though anybody would get a kick out of it). The books on the reading list are books that everybody should read at some point, and Professor Yeazell is one of Yale's most compelling lecturers. The work load is manageable if you keep up with the reading. Don't miss out on this one; it's a gem.",
    "If you enjoy Victorian Novels and like reading lengthy books, this class will be a good fit."
