    "The New Iraq is an intense small seminar with weekly debates on a variety of events and topics that have happened and affected Iraq since 2003. It's a great in-depth look at the recent history of one Middle Eastern country, as well as at US foreign policy towards the Middle East.",
    "This was a very solid course with great seminar discussions. If you are able to get in, you should very strongly consider taking it. Professor Sky is a delight.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! You will learn a lot from this course!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASSEmma Sky is singlehandedly the coolest person in this university. Do NOT pass on taking a class with her (however, DEFINITELY take the seminar as opposed to the lecture).I can't say this enough: TAKE THIS CLASSIt is fascinating, the workload is manageable, there is EMMA SKY in the class! Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "The simple answer: TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you don't think you're interested or you think you know enough about the Iraq War...all the more reason to take. It will open your eyes and minds. This class is not to be missed!",
    "Yes definitely. Take this class! You get to meet incredibly interesting individuals and Emma Sky herself is amazing.",
    "Fantastic course. Strengths: the experts brought in really bring life to the conversation and provide some unexpected perspectives, and Emma is just the best. Weaknesses: As is the case in any GLBL seminar, some students feel inclined to grace the class with their infinite knowledge of the universe at every waking hour.Emma is the perfect kind of seminar leader. She steps back from class discussions, concealing her opinions, but is always prepared to call out inconsistencies in arguments or point out harsh realities. She is hilarious and fun (in a very dry way) and incredibly knowledgable in her field. It was a pleasure to take a class with her at its helm.",
    "I would definietly recommend this class for anyone specializing in the Middle East, civil conflict, or transitions to democracy. However, it does not make a good introductory course. Professor Sky is fascinating and the class is definitely worth taking, but only if you already know a little about the region.",
    "As its course title suggests, GLBL 372 is a very specified course. It focuses exclusively on the United States and Iraq post-2003, which means that it goes into great depth in that aspect of Iraqi history, but it does not address as much the wider impact the U.S. 2003 Iraq War has had on the region or Iraq's role in the wider Middle East. If this area of history\/foreign policy interests you, or if you are at all interested in exploring a major impact on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East today, then I highly recommend this course. Professor Sky is an incredibly knowledgable source; begin able to learn from someone with as much experience as she has was a privilege. If you are interested in a wider view of the Middle East, then I would recommend another course (she has also taught a lecture course on the international politics of the Middle East in the past).",
    "The New Iraq is essentially a weekly discussion forum, focusing each week on a particular issue facing Iraq post-2003. Readings are generally provided for building context, rather than specific discussion, and students are each assigned a week to prepare more extensively to present arguments to the class. Other than this, major assignments are a midterm and final paper, each of the same length. The focus is on thinking about Iraq and discussing to develop ideas, rather than completing lots of arbitrary assignments. Highly recommended if you are looking for a truly in-depth course on a very specific topic, rather than a survey course.",
    "best class I've taken at Yale take it!",
    "This is an excellent class which gives you in depth knowledge about Iraq post 2003. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in this topic. The Professor is very knowledgeable and interesting."
