    "From this course, I learned a significant amount about how to program in Python, as well as more general principles of computer science, computer architecture, and data structures. While much of the theory was surface-level, the course provided the optimal balance for someone attempting to learn programming as a functional skill rather than to become a computer scientist.",
    "!A: (Please read) OVERALL THOUGHTS: The course covers an incredible amount of material. Great way to force yourself to learn Python. Youll cover UNIX coding, Python, Regex, Object-oriented programming, Shell scripting in bash and python, SQL and databases, computer architecture and bytecode, R programming, and Machine Learning. Theres no other course at Yale that offers anything close to this. Youll NEED A BACKGROUND in CPSC112 or CS50 but this course is not meant for majors. BAD: The SQL component needs to be revamped. We didnt actually learn SQL or how to do queries in SQL. All we did was implement a database in python which is NOT the same as learning SQL. Next year, I think the R programming should completed be removed from the curriculum (as every single STAT class will teach you R). Instead, we should actually try to be familiar with SQL and learn it completely. The bytecode segment of the course was interesting but I have no idea how its relevant to this course? It seems very theoretical (suitable for CPSC200). Not sure why we learned this in the first place for information systems and had a whole homework dedicated to this. GOOD: Im very comfortable with python now I think. The Machine Learning assignment was extremely difficult because we were all completely on our own and it was an independent project but I honestly enjoyed it. I only touched the surface with TensorFlow and dont consider myself fluent at allTheres a lot more to it and all I was qualified for was a basic model. Still thought it was interesting and I enjoyed that segment a lot. The homework assignment were mostly writing functions in the language we were studying that week. The only homework assignment that felt marginally real world was the database one and the machine learning, which I liked. Still would have liked more assignments that focused more on real software engineering and production code rather than simply test to see if you know python\/r syntax. PROFESSOR SLADE: I honestly think he has wonderful intentions and he cares about the class. However, I was not motivated to come to class. Next year, this class should meet TWICE A WEEK. And for a longer time period. The lecturing was very slow. This class 100% could be condensed into two class meetings that are each a little longer. TEACHING ASSISTANT: I went to Kun Ren a couple of times. He can be helpful however his English is not the best which meant it was sometimes difficult to communicate with him.",

    "Course provides a good introduction to various more practical areas of CS, but does so at a comfortable pace. This allows for more self-exploration rather than just pset completion. Lectures could feature more real world insights, even if they're not relevant to the problem sets or exams.",
    "Strength: you learn very practical skills from a very qualified professor Weakness: Lecture can go a bit slow at times",

    "Take it if you want a comprehensive course on the ins and outs of Python and UNIX with computer science concepts intermixed here and there. An excellent introduction to programming and computer science for those not sure about taking 201.",
    "Great intermediate course for non CS majors with previous background. You learn both fundamentals of python but also computer science theory. Also spent last half of course on machine learning. Would highly recommend. Professor Slade is great.",
    "Yes!! The programming and concepts are really fun.",
    "CS 200 is a wonderful class for getting one's feet wet in programming. It requires a slight bit of background knowledge (i.e. AP computer science, CPSC 112, or a few weeks of screwing around on code learning websites would all suffice), but all of the material is quite accessible. The course is taught primarily in Python, with some forays into both UNIX and R (R has been emphasized much more in previous years). The class this year was fairly small, and though it was still a lecture, students often asked questions and guided their learning experiences. Moreover, the instructor implemented a number of suggestions for content (i.e. more focus on databases, machine learning, etc.) that some of the students expressed interest in. Notably, I took this course as a non-CS (Psych) major with only an AP computer science background who was interested in improving my programming skills. Weekly problem sets were manageable, and midterm\/final exams were very fairly graded. Professor Slade is extremely knowledgeable about the subjects at hand and will work hard to make sure that the students are getting what they need out of the course. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to take a CS class and apply that knowledge to their own research outside of computer science.",

    "Yes, I got a lot out if this course. It is not very stressful, Slade is very accessible, and the the course is structured not to make its students lives difficult but to support learning and making CS enjoyable. Slade wants his students to love computer science and it is very evident in this class. Psets are meaningful and do not waste your time."
