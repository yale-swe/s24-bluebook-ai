    "If you have any love for math, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It will suck all of the fun out of math. I came to Yale considering being a mathematically oriented major and I never want to take a math class ever again now. The set up of the class is such that you watch 1 to 3 20-minute videos for each class, teach yourself the material, take a quiz on the material, and then go to class. However, if you didn't understand the videos (which you won't unless you've taken Calc BC, which I did not), you have no hope of following anything going on in class. The classes assume you already have a grip on everything, despite the fact that no one will teach you. I would only recommend this class to someone who has taken BC or is talented at learning off of Khan Academy. It's literally impossible to understand without outside assistance.",
    "MATH 115 continues on students' previous knowledge of calculus by introducing some new concepts which build on our prior knowledge. It is very interesting and extremely well taught. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 115. Just make sure to space out studying for the midterms (especially the second one) because the content gets harder!",
    "It is something that you're probably going to have to do so you might as well get it out of the way early.",
    "The Math 115 course was a very systematic and well organized approach to teaching Calc II. Students were expected to learn the basic concepts on their own through video lectures, and then these concepts were thoroughly explained and expanded upon in class. It was definitely challenging, but I do recommend the course to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend Math 115. It is a very comprehensive course that gives students an in depth understanding of the concepts learned in Math 112 or the equivalent. The work load was very manageable, and the exams covered only topics learned in class while challenging students to think about the topic in new ways they may not have been taught.",
    "I would only take this class if it's a prerequisite or you really enjoy math.",
    "I would summarize it as hell. The workload was heavy and the class was a struggle all semester. I would never recommend this to a student unless he or she needed it for his or her major and even then I would advise against it.",
    "I would say that it was a challenge but doable. Math 115 has had a reputation for being quite hard, but I thought it was far. This was actually my most enjoyable class all semester.",
    "For this class, you should be prepared to put in some significant effort. That being said, if you keep up with the pace of the class, you should be fully prepared for exams. It is easy to get behind so make sure that you are a disciplined student.",
    "It is a great calculus course, well organized. It uses the flipped classroom method well. Definitely try to take it with Prof. Hall, he is clear and supportive. It is at times challenging, but if you like Math, you,ll enjoy it for sure. Taught well.",
    "Depends if they wanted to pursue math. Not sure if I would recommend it as a class \"just to take\"",
    "It's not your standard Calc BC. The course this semester emphasized series, integration techniques, and even introduced differential equations. If you are fresh from a high school calculus class, the material might seem easy for you. If you're not, you'll have to put in a lot more work to catch up to the level at which the class is taught. There are plenty of resources made available to you aimed at making learning the material as painless as possible, and it would be good to take advantage of as many of these as possible. I wish I had gone to more office hours. Professor Hall is wonderful, and a great lecturer. Take it with him if you get the opportunity.",
    "This is the type of class that you should only take if you want to further your math skills in general and not one that you need for further science classes necessarily.",
    "teaches you the basics of integral calculus, series, and differential equations",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student who is very strong in math.",
    "MATH 115 is an introduction to calculus. However, if you are thinking about taking this course to review old material, I would advise against it. It is much more difficult than any high school calculus class, and the way the material is presented makes it difficult to learn and\/or refresh concepts in an effective way."
