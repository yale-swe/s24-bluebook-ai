   "comments": [
    "At first I was discouraged about this class because we only work with charcoal and we only work with line (that means no shading!), and everything is from observation, so it quite literally is the basics. I was surprised, however, how much I learned from just charcoal and line. You will really improve your drawing skills with this class. Dushko is also a great teacher who is encouraging yet provides excellent criticism and is capable of turning people with zero drawing experience to \"people who can draw.\" He also tells fun stories and doesn't put too much pressure on (unless you start slaking).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even if you have no prior drawing experience! We had a wide range of backgrounds in our class, but I think that we all benefited and our drawing definitely improved by the end of the semester. Be forewarned that you will have to complete some (very time-consuming) paper and cardboard building projects (at least in Dushko's or Reed's section). Dushko was a great professor though and he can be pretty funny in his own way. I really looked forward to class everyday, and the drawing assignments were very reasonable, especially during the week. He also gave us ample time to complete our larger drawings at the end of the semester. You will have to put some time into drawing if you want to improve, but it's definitely worth it! I really wanted to take an art class at Yale before graduating and I definitely do not regret it!",
    "This is a drawing class, but also a class on visual perception in general. It makes you look at the world in a different way. I would highly recommend this to any student looking to learn to draw, or look at the world more deliberately. Also, the three-dimensional assignments would be excellent for any engineering, architecture, or sculpture student, or any student with visual\/spatial interests. If you are worried about it affecting your GPA, take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "You have to go into this class for the right reasons, knowing that it will be a lot of hard work and not a particularly enjoyable experience. I wouldn't say I'm \"good at drawing\" after this course, but I came out of it knowing how that's sort of a dumb thing to say anyway. You learn new ways of looking and seeing, which I found quite valuable, and it definitely gave me a new layer of information with which to look at other people's artwork. That said, it was very difficult and, a majority of the time, I wasn't sure how the assignments were really contributing to my skills. They work in oblique ways. In addition, I felt like my learning curve really plateaued after the first month, which was frustrating.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking to put in several hours a week to improve their drawing abilities. I would not recommend this class for someone who wants to take are as a gut course or an extra credit.Dushko's assignments are interesting and reasonable. This class will help you improve your drawing, but you will also have to put in a reasonable amount of work and not blow off the assignments. It's a lot of fun and Dushko's advice is helpful without being overly critical or making anyone feel uncomfortable.I really enjoyed it.",
    "114 with Dushko is more of an introduction to visual thinking. The class places a heavy focus on sculpture and drawing what you see. There is no \"shading,\" or classical technique taught. Many students seemed to begin the semester with a strong drawing background, and not having had one proved difficult. All in all, this was a great break from other Yale classes and I certainly learned a lot. If you're looking to truly push yourself, enjoy building cardboard dinosaurs.But if you're a senior, looking to take a fun, Cr\/D art class, you may want to take a less intense section.",
    "Good basic line-drawing class."
