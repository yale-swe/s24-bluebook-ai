   "comments": [
    "Take this course! It'll make you think about the body in ways you never have before.",
    "TAKE IT.You will think about everyday things so differently and it will make you a better writer. It is also great practice working with the primary sources. Some of the readings are a bit dry, but most of them were interesting. Best History Seminar I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely recommended. The class challenges your perceptions of the human body and asks you to research the history behind the views we have now. The class had one shorter paper and a final research paper, as well as a primary source presentation in class. It was a fair amount of work, but worth it.",
    "Yes, this is a course that you should take because it helps you understand the HSHM way of thinking about the past and the present, plus you will never think about the body this way otherwise!",
    "Yes! Great course! I learned a lot and definitely have a new perspective on the body. The readings and class were interesting and laid back.",
    "Yes, very interesting and fun course. Readings were very fun to complete.",
    "Wonderful, fascinating class! Professor Eisenberg is fantastic and the material is just so interesting. Definitely goes more for breadth than depth because of the nature of the syllabus, but it made me curious about and gave me insight into a lot of topics I hadn't previously considered.",
    "History of the Body is a once-a-week seminar that covers a different topic related to the body each week.The professor is great, the topics make for engaging and exciting class discussions, and the workload is totally manageable. I would definitely recommend this seminar to another student, but would suggest another history class first.",
    "For sure",
    "Definitely it was a great course very modern topic but looking at how it got to be the way it is",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It challenges your notions of societal customs and makes you think about why things are the way they are. You'll definitely learn something.",
    "Absolutely take this class!! It's really amazing, and changes how you view your own body and bodies around you. The readings are all incredibly interesting, and the films are a fun addition too. Professor Eisenberg is also great. He's funny (we watch many Louis CK and Seinfeld clips in class), and knows how to direct discussions to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I always looked forward to coming to this class and doing the readings."
