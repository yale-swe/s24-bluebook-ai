    "As a whole, Math 112 is exactly what you'd expect of it: If you have some background with calculus, then it shouldn't be too difficult at all. However, for those with absolutely no background whatsoever, be prepared to put in a lot of work. That being said, between your professors, TA's, and peer tutors, there are several resources available o you to help along the way.",
    "Math 112 is a well organized class, in which you cover a lot of material and it is important to have background knowledge before going into it. It is fast paced and not easy. I would recommend this for someone who has already taken some form of calculus.",
    "MATH 112 covers Calculus 1. It is a good course to take if you are looking to fulfill your QR requirement and is a class I would recommend."
