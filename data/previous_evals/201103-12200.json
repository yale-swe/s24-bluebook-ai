    "Interesting topics, but not enough class discussion. Great way to explore your own interests for the final paper though.",
    "Sure. Better to take it if you have a decent background in social theory.",
    "Boring. Lots of long words and references to social theorists for no reason. Don't have to do any of the reading, so it's easyy to get by on no work, but I think Prof Siu's grading might be harsh in the end",
    "Interesting info, but the class is a 2-hour lecture - no discussion.",
    "Only if it is capped at 12. The class is good practice for future research, but the discussions in class are vague.",
    "I had never taken an anthro class before, and I found I loved the discipline, its methodologies, and its goals. However, this class was frankly a bit poor. Helen Siu is wonderful, but she is clearly a lecturer: class discussion was rare, and student presentations felt perfunctory. I did gain a greater grasp of anthropological and historical approaches to Asia as a process not confined by national boundaries, which was the goal of this course, but it was a scattered seminar that I can't recommend. As a lecture course, however, it would be interesting!",
    "In its current form, I would recommend caution before taking it. The subject matter is much more nebulous than it appeared during the one session that met in shopping period. However Siu is planning to modify the course, so stop by at the least."
