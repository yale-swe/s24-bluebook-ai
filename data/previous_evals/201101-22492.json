    "Even if you don't plan on becoming a therapist or studying clinical psychology, you should take this seminar! It is a year-long class, but it definitely doesn't become boring. And it might seem as though there is a lot of work outside of class, but the field placements are truly fun and not at all burdensome. Readings are light in comparison to other seminar courses, and there are no exams. If you come to class and do your work, you WILL do well. Plus, Professor Lockhart is one of the nicest and most approachable professors I have met here.",
    "I would still recommend this class. I feel like the second semester was a little slower and a bit less interesting, but it still was a great class. And practicum was still great.",
    "This is a great class that really allows you to see if you would like to pursue a career in clinical psychology or psychiatry. The field placements vary a lot but all seem to be rewarding. Class discussion is a great place to process your experiences. If you like working with people and are interested in Clinical Psych or Psychiatry definitely take it.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Same drill as first semester, only with a few changes. This semester, there are partner presentations each week, plus seven ~1 page written responses. You continue at your placement. I learned a lot of interesting things in this class that I have applied to my everyday life. However, this class is not for everyone. Prepare to talk a lot about emotions. This works for a lot of people, but didn't always work for me.",
    "If you want actual, hands-on experience working with a population of individuals with mental illness, this class is for you. Try to get into a placement where you get to work one-on-one with someone, because I think some people who worked in group settings came away feeling like they weren't really able to form deep connections with the people they were working with.",
    "amazing class! don't miss it. a chance to learn outside a classroom- about relationships with people and about yourself.",
    "Worth it to take for the experience of going to meet your buddy at Children's Home or in the other places alone. Also, good for getting a grasp of different types of therapy."
