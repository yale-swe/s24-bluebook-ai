   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course. Required for painting concentrators. For other people: this is not for the weak of heart. There is a lot of work and expectations are high. You are likely to be surrounded by excellent painters, so if you don't put in the requisite amount of work, it will show.",
    "Yes, but the teacher changes from semester to semester so I dont really know.",
    "Really great class. It's completely different every semester based on who is teaching it, however, so my evaluation only covers when Nicole Awai teaches it. She had us read essays and respond to them with our paintings, which was a really interesting process. I recommend this course if you're thinking about being an Art major. It can be a lot of work, though.",
    "It's fine. It just depends who is teaching it whether it is more self-directed or project based. Either way, you get to paint whatever you are interested in and can work as hard as you choose. I didn't think the class was a great use of my parent's money, but Nicole made me think a bit about things.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. Although you might feel unsatisfied during a lot of the class because you are unsure of what exactly you should be doing\/thinking about, you must take the initiative to talk to the instructors. I do feel like I've grown a lot during this class.",
    "Yes if it was taught by someone else.",
    "I'm not sure how the instructor will be next semester. I have a feeling she'll modify a few parts of her teaching and her syllabus. I think this class is useful, but challenging when it comes to working with the teacher.",
    "Great to be a member of the painting community and to have a studio space. These were invaluable. I learned through generating work, and less through my interactions with the Professor and TA",
    "Painting 1 with Nicole is a great, intellectually engaging class. This past semester she based the class on five (though it ended up being four) essays. To give you an idea of what these were about, in a word- Beauty in the age of Road Kill, Bullshit, the self portrait, what happened to paintings in the 80s?, etc. The deadlines were spread apart, so as with any painting class its hard to consistently stay in the studio, though I recommend trying to develop a schedule to do this.",
    "If you're a painting concentration you have to take this class, and fortunately it's a fun, interesting painting class that will challenge the way you approach art and stretch your imagination. Nicole is a lively, inspiring instructor and her projects are great. Definitely a far better and more useful class than Will's. But for any of you hoping for more intensive technical instruction and preparation in Yale's upper level art courses--sorry, not here, or anywhere I'm convinced. If you ask for extra outside help Nicole and the TA are happy to give it, but it's something you need to go out of your way for and spend a lot of extra time on."
