    "Honestly, even though I had fun (by not taking it too seriously), I wouldn't recommend it. Even though I wasn't taking it too seriously, I really felt frustrated by the lack of depth. You really lose a chance to appreciate the language\/culture moving as quickly as this course does; basically, it felt rushed.",
