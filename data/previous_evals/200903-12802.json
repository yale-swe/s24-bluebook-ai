    "I definitely recommend French 130 02. I feel like my french has gotten a lot better since the beginning of the semester. If I go to France I will have no trouble socializing, communicating etc.",
    "Take this course with Ruth Koizim. I really enjoyed her class, largely because she was my teacher. She doesn't accept lackluster efforts, and she will push you to work harder if you aren't.",
    "Definitely. It just gets you that much closer to fluency in French. It's fun and engaging.",
    "French 130 is when you start to really immerse yourself into french. you tackle books and movie with vigor.",
    "A perfect way to continue learning French after two semesters with French in Action; this course came as a breath of fresh air just when using French in Action had become a little dull. The syllabus is varied, yet all the texts and films have tangible thematic links that makes them, as a whole, satisfyingly manageable at the end of the semester. This course still involves a lot of worksheets, exams, and compositions, though with a bit more personality than the workbook busywork from L1 and L2.",
