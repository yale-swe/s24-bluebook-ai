   "comments": [
    "A good, practical course. Lectures are dry, but you'll leave with solid knowledge of 3 types of parallel programming and specific APIs for implementing them: message passing (Open MPI), multithreading (OpenMP), and GPUs (CUDA). The psets are pretty tough (debugging a parallel program is a nightmare), but good practice.",
    "Whether this class is worth taking really depends on whether you believe parallel programming is the future. Parallel programming ends up being a lot more complicated than you would have initially expected: it is not as elegant as pretty algorithms. Most problems, it seems, are either trivial to parallelize or impossible to really parallelize effectively. Generally I am less optimistic about the future of parallel programming than I was at the start of the course. Except I am really impressed by GPUs (graphics card-type technology that has limited shared memory but millions of threads) because with GPUs, the number of threads can increase with the problem size, which really changes the way you think about the possible running times of certain kinds of problems in the future. The class itself was a bit dry. The languages\/tools that we used seem geared much more towards research than industry: I dont know how much Ill use Open MP in the future. Nevertheless, threads are similar in any language and the main concepts overlap.",
    "CPSC424 is an introduction to parallel programming. I'd recommend it if you have room in your schedule - it's a ton of work, but you learn a lot.",
    "This course is an alright elective. You learn 3 major tools for parallel programming- MPI, openMP and GPU programming (CUDA), as well as some general ideas\/techniques in parallel programming. Some of the assignments can be surprisingly hard and take a lot of time, mostly because debugging a parallel program is pretty hard. Lecture can be pretty dry but are informative.",
    "I think it's a pretty fun elective.",
    "Highly recommend. You get to learn about various methods of parallel programming that can come quite in handy in industry. Some of the work can get tedious; however, contrary to what some may say, there is much more to the class than just matrix multiplication.",
    "Interesting problem sets. Take it if you want to program on the supercomputer.",
    "424 was a roller coaster of a class. Parallelism provides interesting new challenges to programming, but makes debugging your problem sets really difficult. Waiting for your programs to run can be frustrating as well. The material is pretty interesting, but the pacing of the class is not always even.",
    "A great course to learn about parallel programing and high performance computing. Topics were multicore multithread and GPU programing. Most of the work was towards the end of the semester. I hope they fix it in the future."
