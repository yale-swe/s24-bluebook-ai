    "Lectures and discussions led by Professor Bradford were much more engaging and better organized than those led by Professor Montagnini. Professor Bradford engaged thematically with the material and was able to take it to a level above the straight facts, whereas Professor Montagnini's lectures, while interesting in their subject matter, were not as well-developed and crafted as Professor Bradford's.",
    "I thought that Prof Bradford's lectures were much better than Prof Montagnini, her's were way to simplistic. I felt like it was better to read the book.",
    "I declined to answer many of the questions because I was taking the course as an audit. I really appreciated the lectures, especially by Mark and had wished I had taken the course for credit as it would have forced me to delve into the material more deeply. Regardless I still was able to brush up on and learn new material by just sitting in on the lectures.",
    "Mark tends to speak so fast and I couldn't follow what he said. He only spent less than a minute on each slide, which made more difficult to understand his points. I guess we needed more time to grasp what he wants to convey.",
    "My responses above reflect an average of what I thought of Mark's and Florencia's teaching style.To be clear, I felt there was a dramatic contrast between their abilities to teach this subject.With the exception of her lectures on Soil Nitrogen (which were very well covered), I felt Florencia's lectures lacked the depth I expect from a graduate course. Her response to questions so often highlight her lack of understanding of the subject.Mark's knowledge of this subject matter is far deeper, and he presents the material very well. he is clear about when there is something he doesn't completely understand, and approaches the student after class to discuss further if we are not satisfied.Mark also does a great job at highlighting the major ideas we need to take from the lessions. (This is the main contrast between him and florencia. Florencia focuses on briefly touching on many many detailed concepts, leaving us without guidence.)",
    "There are two instructors who differ greatly in their ability to cover material. I thought Mark was a very engaging and articulate lecturer. He was able to develop course material and highlight current studies that made our learning relevant. I struggled with Florencia's lecture style and was frustrated with her inability to answer student questions. Seemed that any material that required a deeper understanding was quickly glazed over.",
    "Mark Bradford co-taught this course for the first time. I thought he was an exceptional teacher and challenged the students during his lectures. He spoke a little fast and covered a lot of ground quickly, so at times it was challenging to keep up with him. Nonetheless, I thought he was excellent.I did not find Florencia's lectures to provide a lot of value-added to the material in the book. Her lectures typically lacked depth. I'm glad Mark B. co-taught this course because it made up for the lack of depth from the other professor.",
    "Florencia's lectures were incoherent, boring, rambling, anecdotal, convoluted, aimed at an audience of fifth graders.Mark's were clear, challenging, engaging, educational, and appropriate for FES.It is a shame he wasn't given free range with this course. I was warned by other students that Florencia was a bad teacher, but thought that having Mark on board would redeem the class. I was only partially right.",
    "response to 10- I think all MF or MFS students should take this class; there is so much to learn about how soils affect forests that is not covered in other classes.",
    "There were two instructors. Mark's clarity is good; he could speak more slowly. The field trips would benefit from changing the assignment from site to site.",
    "I was disappointed that Tom Siccama was unable to participate on our field trips.Professor Bradford was an excellent professor - his slides and lectures were well organized, presented and explained.",
    "Qu2: Much of the instruction was condensed into the first half of the semester. The material could have been spread out more evenly.",
    "My instructor evaluations are different for the two professors. Mark is an outstanding professor, and would give him \"excellents\" for the professor-related questions, while I would give Florencia \"average\" ratings. Professor Bradford's preparation for lectures is very obvious. He does an amazing job of reviewing the basic information we were supposed to learn from the readings, but then adds to them with information beyond the basic readings. His lectures are clear and organized, he's very accessible, and he's so interested in student feedback. He asked us several times during the course for specific feedback on particular aspects of the course, and he also brought some great new ideas for assignments (discussion, another set of presentations, etc.) His knowledge and efforts really motivated me to work hard. I had a harder time with the organization of Florencia's lectures. It was harder to tell what specific ideas and details were important. A few other suggestions: 1) Revisit the purpose of the field trips and possibly revise the format of the actual trip and report accordingly. The first one felt very confusing, like we didn't have enough information to appropriately do the activity - the report also felt like that. However, the second trip felt great because we knew what we were doing. The 3rd one then felt redundant. Spending 3 whole trips on soil pits doesn't seem in line with the goals of the course. I'd say one trip (that provides students with enough guidance and explanation of what they are doing) on pits would be great (in other words, give students the experience I had on the 2nd trip - but not the 1st or 3rd). Other things that might take the place of the other trips would be some lab work - what are basic techniques soil scientists use? Also the presentations suggested early in the course where we present material to different audiences might be useful in place of a trip or another group discussion. 2) The course felt top-heavy: most of the lectures occurred before the midterm. The second half of the course felt \"light\" - the student presentations were a nice diversion, but I didn't really learn much from them for the amount of time (preparation and class time) that went into them. I'd say restructure or remove. 3) Divide the class into smaller groups for the discussion and do more than one. Anything that is done once in a class is (almost) not worth the time if it requires a new set of skills and interactions from the students. I felt like we were just \"figuring it out\" when we finished, and we'd \"really get it\" if we had another discussion. 4) More smaller assignments along the way. I know this is graduate school, I know grading is a burden, and I know there are trade-offs to everything. But there is something to be said for providing students more opportunities to engage with the material as they are learning it rather than in big chunks while studying for exams.",
    "N\/A",
    "Florencias and Marks lectures were extremely different. I felt that Mark's increased the conceptual, creative thinking - the 'connect the dots' - and demanded practice of the more applied understanding of the material.The class overall was terrific. great combo of using the book and critiquing the book."

It would have been more useful to have more varied trips to look at the breadth of soil services beyond just identifying genetic horizons. Additionally, I really enjoyed the discussion we had in class about the IPCC and Climate Change--I would encourage more participation in that way.I know Mark was talking about adding a participation grade, which I think is a good idea, especially if the class includes more round table discussions.",

    "Florencia's lectures - need more depthField Trips - having groups of 8 was too much. It prevented many members from being able to think\/write about soil properties b\/c the rest of the labor had to be distributed into other sections (geology, hydrology). The fact that other sections were required made the field report difficult at times because more often than not, people had no previous experience in some of the sections and therefore had to spend a lot of time self-teaching themselves the material in order to then be able to write about it (hydrology, geology). Therefore, more time was spent on related disciplines than on soil properties\/taxonomy, etc.Soil pit analyses were a little chaotic, especially during the first trip because we were pretty much placed next to a pit and then told to analyze it, without having practice with the analytical tools needed to do itwell.I suggest having a mini tutorial class on how to begin a soil pit analysis before going into the field.Also, I wish this class had some laboratory sessions to practice determining certain soil properties (bulk density, CEC, etc).",

Of course we figured it out eventually, but it would have been helpful if the expectations were more clear from the beginning.Also, the last field trip was not very productive because we only dug one pit as a whole class, so most people were not involved. When it came time to write the report for that last field trip, not everyone from each group was involved in that either, because the topic was very narrow for each group, and it was most efficient to have one or two people complete the whole thing. (it would have been much less inefficient to try and split up the work, and it would have been impossible to get everyone to meet up together at the same time to complete it together)...",

Such 'unprepared' questions just distract class ESPECIALLY if professors try to cover that huge amount of textbook. Why can't students who answer questions by themselves by reading textbook get participation grades while students who don't read textbook and come unprepard asking easy questions can get better grade?? If someone can monitor the quality of questions, I would agree. But if not, it would create distraction in class and most likely end up with lack of time to cover what professors want to cover.",

There were definitely people who did not hold their weight with the group reports, which is always extremely frustrating, but always seems to be a part of group work. I would have appreciated doing the field work in a group and then writing an individual report.",
