    "Go for it if you have an interest in game theory and political sciences. It's great to look at issues from a rational and logically rigorous point of view.",
    "Yes! Professor Fox is extremely kind and methodical in his teaching. His awkwardness is very endearing, and he clearly cares very much about his students (I do not say this to be critical or personal--just to counter any concerns if other students note this). The course has apparently gotten harder than past years; I think it is neither overwhelming nor easy. Plus when you get your head around it, game theory actually has a pretty beautiful logic to it. And yes, it is useful in conceptualizing political science problems (even for someone like myself who does not focus on quantitative areas). The only issue is that the problem sets are much harder than the lectures and exams...don't worry, this isn't a problem for grading (since the psets are graded on a satisfactory\/unsatisfactory basis), but it would be nice to feel more confident about the homework.",
    "Frankly, I stopped going to lecture and took it credit\/D. I am not sure why I chose that class. Probably because of the lecture format, and the fact that the class goes pretty slowly; it was just too slow for me. So if you're good at mathematical proofs and definitions of mathematical objects this class will annoy you.",
    "if you need a QR and nothing else fits into your schedule or you actually are good at math\/logic, then attempt. it is an interesting way to see the world.",
    "Game theory in politics",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for an unusual QR. I don't think that it's a particularly easy alternative to other QR classes but it is material that is somewhat interesting.",
    "If you want to take an upper level analytical political science course with a professor who genuinely cares about his students, then this class is for you.",
    "This class is confusing, the problem sets are very difficult, but if you study fairly well for the midterm and the final, you'll be fine. Go to office hours. It's really the only way to understand how to do the problem sets.",
    "I would recommend Game Theory if you really have an interest in the subject but you should be prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "This is a great class if you want to learn about game theory. Not necessarily about political science - more of a general intro to game theory class. However, it's ALOT of work, and the problems are very hard and require you to spend significant amounts of time.",
    "Do not take this class. Dry lectures. The course material is basically the worst parts of economics condensed into a discipline. Every model or concept in this class is based on inane and unrealistic assumptions, ultimately making the final conclusions of any exercise useless.Even if you need a QR requirement, take Econ or a calc class. This was just terrible.",
    "It's a pretty decent QR. I suggest you pay attention in lecture if you want to do well on the problem sets.",
    "If you are good at logic, econ or maths this will be great. If you think this will be an easy QR you are wrong! But it is very interesting subject material if you take the time to understand it.",
    "JUST TAKE THE NORMAL VERSION OF GAME THEORY. Seriously. It makes so much more sense.",
    "Game Theory and Political Science is an intro-level economics class with few real-world applications. If you are very interested in game theory and enjoy algebra, this class might be rewarding. However, the class is largely unrelated to political science. Justin Fox is a committed and kind professor who goes beyond what he needs to in order to help his students. I would not recommend this class.",
    "I enjoyed this class. I would only recommend it if you are pretty interested in the subject though--otherwise finding the motivation to figure out the concepts can be difficult. It was sometimes difficult to understand the concepts just from lecture--going to office hours and section helps. The problem sets can be irritatingly difficult, but grading is pretty lenient. It is definitely possible to do well, but it can be a pain.",
    "This course was much harder than I expected. The essay and midterm were fairly easy. The final was impossible. The weekly p-sets are kind of helpful, although Osborne is a pretty bad textbook for explaining more difficult games towards the end. You really need to go to class every time in order to understand the material.",
    "This class was terrible. I found it so frustrating since we learned so little and the material was so poorly taught to the point of being incomprehensible.",
    "If you're trolling for a QR, this could be the one for you. There's one problem set per week, a midterm, and a final. Assuming you get a \"satisfactory\" on 8 of the 10 problem sets (something that is relatively easy to do), the median\/average grade of the class is an A-.",
    "Somewhat interesting material and a very friendly professor. The course could have been improved with additional focus on political science examples and applications. If you need a QR and are interested in game theory, take the class. Be sure to go to Professor Fox's office hours though if you want to learn how to do the problems.",
    "Good credit-d-fail class. Often could be tedious, but still usually interesting. Problem sets only help (never hurt) your grade, so you can easily just not do a large chunk on them and fly by the C range if you're just looking for credit.",
    "Definitely take it if you're willing to put in the work, but it is definitely hard work. How badly do you want to understand game theory?",
    "I took PLSC 344 instead of the Econ version (I am an Econ major). The material ended up being the exact same as the Econ class, and the problems were of the same difficulty. However, the teaching styles of the two classes are very different. The Econ class (taught by Pollack) tends to focus on examples and less on terminology. Professor Fox spends a lot of time in class defining Game Theory rigorously through specific terminology. However, the terms don't end up being used that often in the problems, and it can sometimes feel unnecessary. That being said, it is easy to tell that Professor Fox is a man who loves the teaching vocation, and he is generally pretty good at it. He is very generous in his office hours and cares a lot about his students understanding the material. The class was structured to have 10 problem sets; if you completed 8 of them, your grade got bumped up (ie from an A- to an A). We had a short paper worth 10%, a midterm worth 40%, and a final worth 50%. The midterm was pretty easy but the final was definitely a great deal more challenging. Overall, if you're a poli sci major this will probably be a good supplement to the general qualitative curriculum. This class trains you in rigorous quantitative reasoning, and I would recommend it as a fifth class for those that are up for some reasonably challenging material.",
    "Nothing about this class was rewarding or interesting or easy. I dropped this once, I realized I knew nothing going into the midterm.",
    "Take this class if you want to work hard and get an A for that. It is not a gut class at all! The sylllabus was just unfair: it says we were going to have 3 or 4 exercises every week. There were weeks we had 7 problems in the pset! That is not OK. Professor Fox is the nicest guy around. Go to his office hours! It is really helpful! But keep up with your work, otherwise the final will be really stressful. At the beginning, the class has a very slow pace. It changes in the middle of the semester but nobody tells you. I made a terrible mistake in not paying attention to that. If I hadn't got an A in this class, I would have regretted taking it. But I did. So, it is up to you: you are gonna work really hard and get an A or you can choose an easier class, enjoy your life more and maybe not get an A. It is up to you. Your Yale life is made of decisions. That's one of those.",
    "I would reccomend Game Theory to another student.",
    "This course was a lot more difficult and intense than most students expected it to be. In order to keep up, going to Professor Fox's office hours was incredibly helpful. It's also important to do and understand each problem set. I would recommend this class for those students truly interested in game theory and in learning how to approach problems and predict how others will act.",
    "If you like quantitative social science, take this course. It is interesting and covers some very cool ground. If you aren't into quant soc. sci. you can skip it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. However, it is NOT A GUT CLASS! It is a very challenging course, especially if your mind is not inclined towards QRs.If you take the course, lecture is only useful for the first half of the semester. After that, it is more beneficial to do the readings, and attend office hours to work through problem sets. Lecture tends to be very similar to the text book. Sometimes, it feels as though Professor Fox literally regurgitates what is in the book onto the board. However, if you visit him during office hours, he it at his lecturing prime. He answers questions and is much better at explaining game theory concepts.Although I had a love hate relationship with game theory, I have to say that I am slightly tempted to take another game theory course. If you plan on taking the LSAT's, I think this will definitely help you with the logic games. =^D",
    "Like many of the students in the class, I took game theory to fulfill my QR requirement, and I would recommend it to other students looking to do the same. It's not particularly math-heavy, although it does require quite a bit of logic, but I found it very accessible and not too much work.",
    "A great introduction to game theory that moves at a manageable pace, especially as the material gets more difficult. Professor Fox is thorough and helpful. Its a solid polisci credit that is rather unique.",
    "HARD if economic-type things aren't your strength. Take this class with caution--it's no gut, even though the grading tends on the generous side.",
    "It is a good course. But it is very challenging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with the stipulation that if you are truly interested and passionate about Game Theory, then all the work will be more than worth it. It can and will change your perceptions of the world if you put in the effort.",
    "Take this course if you do not like math. It is a QR that does not really involve math. It's not a gut--you will have to study fairly hard for the exams--but the problem sets only take a few hours the night before they are due and are graded on a satisfactory\/unsatisfactory scale. It's not a lot of work during the year, but you'll really have to learn the material right before the exam. Go to office hours. They help a lot.",
    "The main reason I took this class was to have a QR that didn't require a lot of math. There was a bit more math than I expected, but it's often possible to complete the problem sets and get away without doing math.Again, I took this class mostly for the QR, and it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. However, I did think there were students who enjoyed it and got more out of it than I did.Also, I found it hard to pay attention in class.",
    "Do not take this class. Lectures are mess and section doesn't clarify anything. I don't know anyone who enjoyed it.",
    "This class was really interesting, and game theory is fun in a sort of torturous way. But the problem sets and exams were tough, mostly because the problems aren't really what's been done in class and requires a lot of intuitive leaps. That's tough, but if you can get through it it can be interesting.",
    "Good QR, put the work into it, and you should find it rewarding as well.",
    "PLSC 344 is an excellent course. I would definitely recommend it."
