   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who doesn't mind spending a semester on something hugely impractical. Despite how useless it might be, the subject matter is really interesting and Amanda does a great job with the material. The difficulty of the class varies by topic, but in general it is interesting enough that this didn't really bother me.",
    "Great class. The subject matter is really very fascinating and there is no better place to study fractals than Yale. Professor Folsom is approachable and sincerely wants to help you understand the material. That being said, lectures can sometimes drag along as she makes an effort to explain every step of solving a problem in great detail. That also limits the scope of the class. I took the class hoping to learn about the Mandelbrot set and we spent less than a lecture discussing it. PSets are reasonable as are the exams. Be prepared though for exams to involve very different fractals than the normal ones you see on homework's",
    "I would recommend this class if you like math, especially if you are artistic or enjoy design. Note, the math does get quite intense sometimes, and there are a lot of concepts to keep track of, so it's not a simple class. If you do the work, though, it is worth it and enjoyable.",
    "It's a challenging class that can be really rewarding. If you have time to put into definitely take it! But it's a lot of work and not the best for a beginning math class.",
    "MATH 290 has somewhat long problem sets, but the exams aren't too difficult as long as you go to class."
