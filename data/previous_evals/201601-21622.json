   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend. You will keep up with your Chinese and study interesting topics. Most importantly though, students learn how to read Chinese articles quickly and efficiently, a level only a handful of students reach in their time.",
    "Great! I took CHNS 166 (first part of Chinese Media and Society) and wasn't sure if CHNS 167 was really going to be useful, but it was. I learned a lot and would definitely recommend it.",
    "This course was phenomenal. It helped students cultivate real-world skills by training us on how to read Chinese media. Our Professor was kind, patient and very supportive. My Chinese improved greatly, and I got to learn a tremendous amount about contemporary China in a way that I loved.",
    "I really enjoyed Chinese Media and Society this semester. Zhou laoshi is super helpful and makes every class interesting. He is also very passionate about the topics that we discuss in class which makes for a very lively class discussion. The workload is very manageable, mostly written work, presentations and quizzes in class. The reading is also very light but interesting. Would definitely recommend!",
    "This is a great class to take if you feel confident in your writing abilities, but want more practice speaking about high level social issues (the imbalance between males and females, the AIDS epidemic etc). There are a few short essays, two midterms, a few oral presentations and one longer final essay, but it is all very manageable. The conversations are also very interesting, as you are able to openly discuss the causes and effects of many of China's social issues.",
    "A great upper-level Chinese class to keep up your Chinese ability! Your reading, writing, and speaking will get a workout. It's definitely not just focused on language learning though; a lot of the class is learning more about modern Chinese society, which imo makes the language learning a lot more interesting as well. Zhou laoshi is phenomenal. Take this class!"
