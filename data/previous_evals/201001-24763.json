    "Yes. good class if you are interested in material culture or interdisciplinary things.",
    "I would recommend to a student only if he or she is interested in the reading list. I took the class after taking Philosophy of Art, which provided a good foundation for the sort of readings in Material Culture.There is a fair amount of work - 3 essentially 10-page papers - so take that into account.",
    "Many different views and theories regarding material culture are discussed. It is certainly a good class to take for people who are interested in fashion, icons, and art.",
    "It is an interesting class. I recommend it.",
    "This is a really cool class and it really makes you think about the meaning of your everyday visual experience in a new way. Plus it's just fun. We spent one day discussing Lady Gaga, the next contemplating the snow falling outside the window. But be prepared for some dense theory from sociology, literary studies and psychoanalysis. This class is hard to get into and has half grad students, so you really need to read and think and know what you're talking about. I wrote my final paper on Hello Kitty. Best assignment I've ever had."
