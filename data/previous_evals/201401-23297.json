   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're willing to explore truth\/fakery in depth, definitely take it! The readings are very comprehensive, covering a wide range of topics such as literature, art, history, religion, commerce, etc. I've heard that our workload is greater than most other ENGL114 sections, as there are little assignments due every class and in-class workshops for which we have to write at least 4 comments on each draft. But I feel like my writing has improved a fair amount, especially after writing the four major papers.",
    "I've never enjoyed writing as much as I did in this class. Prof. Johnston Gordon is an amazing teacher, and is willing to work with students during the draft and revision process.",
    "Class preparation due before each class meeting -- usually a light reading\/response or a brief writing exercise 4 papers total, drafts turned and lots of feedback given Yes, I would recommend Engl 114 with Professor Gordon!",
    "I'm a science major, so I tried something new-- and I don't regret it.",
    "The topic is interesting, and you discuss elements of fakery that make it more nuanced. However, the papers require you to think about fakery in different ways and can be challenging. Go to office hours and ask for help and discuss your ideas if needed.",
    "A course that you will be glad you took. There is a lot more to the topic than you might think, and professor Gordon is amazing. I saw marked improvements in my writing, even though it was tough at times. This course is a marathon, but then again, writing is a marathon, so being able to keep up with this course helped my writing in tremendous ways. Professor Gordon is the best professor I've had so far at Yale. She is extremely dedicated to her students, plans out every class very carefully and effectively, and is a great person to talk with as well. I'm very glad I took this course, and I certainly recommend it. You won't regret it.",
    "Definitely a class to take during your time at Yale, especially if you are remotely interested in the topic of fakery (includes art forgery, identity theft, sports doping, gambling, etc.). However, I will say that you get out of the class you put into it. So if you want to get a good grade on papers, make sure to write the paper beforehand and work closely with the writing tutors and Professor Johnston Gordon to improve it.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 to students, especially freshmen. It provides a good foundation for writing and is a good transition from high school.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's manageable, interesting, and you become a better writer."
