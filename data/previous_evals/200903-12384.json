   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with any interest, and even those without. You will learn a lot, and the emphasis upon linguistics means that you will do so from an unconventional, and hence highly-rewarding, angle.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Slavic people, their history, culture, languages, and politics. Professor Greenberg is an incredible teacher, the course load is not heavy, classes are interactive, and the readings are always interesting. Overall, it is a really great class.",
    "Definitely. this class is a must take, for anyone, whether or not you're an expert in Slavic studies or you never heard of it.",
    "yes, it is a great course.",
    "Slavic 206 covers the modern Slavic world, detailing history and culture across countries in Eastern and Central Europe, and giving an explanation of the origin and development of the Slavic languages. I would absolutely recommend this course. It is always interesting and fun, and Professor Greenberg is a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You will learn a lot of interesting things about the slavs and have a lot of fun. The work is definitely manageable and interesting since you have a lot of freedom.",
    "If you are interested in the Slavic countries and are looking for a broad introduction, take this class. I personally am a History major interested in international relations - the course suited my interests well by providing a multidimensional overview of the Slavs, from linguistic, cultural, artistic, religious, and demographic angles. Prof. Greenberg is wonderful. He's helpful, extremely knowledgeable, easy-going, kind, and truly passionate about his field. This is the type of class that you always look forward to attending, as it is fun and low-stress. If your specific interest isn't covered well in the seminar meetings, the final research paper is completely open-ended and will allow you to explore any broadly Slavic topic you like. Overall highly recommended.",
    "Take this class! It is great just like any other class Prof. Greenberg teaches! You learn about Slavic peoples, the atmosphere is very conductive to learning, and the class is fun and not much work."
