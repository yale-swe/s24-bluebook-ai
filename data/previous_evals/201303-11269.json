   "comments": [
    "EENG 202 is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale if not my favorite. The teaching is outstanding (Sekhar is my favorite professor at Yale and Alp was an excellent TA). The material is interesting both inherently and in the multitude of applications from signal processing to economic modeling. I would definitely recommend this course and any other class you can take with Sekhar.",
    "EENG 202 is a fantastic overview of the signals and systems component of Electrical Engineering. The class goes over many topics and makes sure that you understand what's really happening. That said, it does go by rather quickly, so I would recommend reading his notes (which are posted online before each lecture)to familiarize yourself before you go in for lecture for him to clear up and confusion. The midterm and final are fair, and overall it's a great class if you're interested in signals, systems, networks, etc.",
    "Recommended to anyone interested in Information Theory and signal processing as it is the first class for both at Yale.",
    "EE 202 is a fantastic course that surveys an array of topics related to systems and signals. It is a challenging course with an above average time commitment\/difficulty: Homework and labs are not easy and take some time. Midterm was fair. Beware the final. Sekhar is a fantastic professor who is clear, considerate, approachable and is invested in the students. There is a good amount of math in the class, particularly statistics and linear algebra. You don't need them beforehand to take the class, but background in these areas would be helpful. Try to participate in class. ~22 students in the class.",
    "It's a very concept based class and you go through a lot of material. But it's so interesting because you can actually see the concepts applied in everyday life. Learning how things like encryption, Netflix, and compression work was awesome! I'd definitely recommend this class but make sure you keep up with the fast pace of this course and take advantage of the huge amount of time outside of class that Sekhar and Alp are available to help you.",
    "Amazing class. Sekhar is the man and one of the best if not the best professor I've ever had. He's a clear lecturer and makes himself available for questions or other advice during or outside of office hours. He and the TA, Alp, make a great team. You'll learn a lot from this course. It's a survey course on information science and you'll probably find a topic within EE that really sparks your interest.I also recommend this class to non-EE majors. Anyone who likes math and statistics should take it. It helps knowing some probability theory and linear algebra before taking the course. The course itself isn't that much work, though I was well prepared in terms of my math background.",
    "A good survey course for signals and systems.Look out for the final, though",
    "Excellent survey course that covers a wide variety of EE topics. One of the best taught classes I've taken at Yale. Sekhar obviously cares a lot about his students, and does everything he can to make himself available outside of class. His lectures are very clear and he's always open to questions. Overall, excellent class!",
    "This class is really well-taught and is great for both EE and EECS. It's also possible that it will be interesting if you aren't majoring in either, though I cannot speak to its accessibility.",
    "Great survey course. Some difficult modules but nothing gets too rigorous."
