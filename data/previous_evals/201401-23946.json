    "With regard to questions 1 and 4: Prof. Doss assigned a very large quantity of reading, but it quickly became clear thatwe did not have to do the reading because Prof. Doss would review specific papers at length in class. This both undermined the reading assignments and made the class quite slow. My preference would be for fewer and more targeted readings and lectures oriented towards situating that\/those readings into a wider academic and practitioner context: have other papers found similar or conflicting results? Are these results useful for people \"on the ground\"? What are the recent seminal papers in the field and various subfields? Why?"
