    "Highly recommended. The class provides a lively and rigorous discussion of the various genres of biblical literature and the problematics of biblical interpretation.",
    "This small seminar focused on close readings of select biblical texts from the genres of poetry, prophecy, and to a lesser extent, narrative. We looked closely at Song of Songs\/Solomon, Jeremiah, Amos, Second Isaiah, and the relationship between the last two and the exodus narrative. We discussed the unique features of poetry and allusion in the bible, and throughout our discussions briefly considered the historical\/social context in which the works were produced.Dr. Polliack managed to strike a perfect balance between lecturing and discussion; she gave enough background information and direction for us to have thoughtful discussions. Dr. Polliack is also one of the nicest people you will meet, but she still was very good at keeping the discussion on track.",
    "One of the best professors I have had here. I have never felt as comfortable offering opinions or thoughts as I did in this class, mostly because I knew that even if Meira told me flat-out that I was wrong, she wasn't doing it to embarrass me, but rather to help us alllearn together. WOnderful professor, who really fostered community and conversation. That is rare, usually professors spend the class trying to impress their greatness on their students. Meira is one of the few who really seem to care about the students and our learning. Loved this class, even if it was a little over my head at times. Going to miss her next year!"
