    "I learned more advanced grammar\/vocabulary and, in the process, reviewed a lot of the material from last semester, as well as learned more about Italian culture through literature, film, and music.",
    "Great continuation of L1 Italian. Learned most of the Italian grammar and feel confident to use Italian in basic conversations. Some introduction to Italian culture which was nice."

    "I wish that the course was less based out of the text book. Julia, however, made sure that we did other things besides simply going over the textbook, which I appreciated a lot. She was and is a great teacher!",
    "I think this course moved at an excellent pace. I enjoyed that we had a lot of tests because we were constantly learning new things.",
    "More of reading in Italian to help expand the vocabulary. I feel like vocabulary is definitely an area that was overlooked. Grammar on the other hand was thought exceptionally."

    "Great language that is fairly easy to learn with these teachers",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it has been fun and interesting to learn Italian this year.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "Italian is a good language to take if you have prior language experience in the Romance languages - pretty easy to catch on to verbs\/syntax\/etc",
    "Yes! This was a great course that continued on the basics of the language that we learned in the first semester.",
    "Definitely a great sequel to L1. All the Italian grammar is covered so if you hate grammar it might be challenging. However, if you expect to be able to speak Italian freely extra learning is needed."
