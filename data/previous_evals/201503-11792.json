    "I would really recommend this course if you are intending to write a research paper within applied micro. The exposure to so many different authors in leading work will help you become a better econ writer and reader. However, if you are just looking for a good econ seminar, this may not be for you.",
    "If you're thinking of taking an economics seminar and want one that is focused on applications of economics this is the right seminar for you. Professor Reyes is a great teacher, the syllabus offers interesting readings and you will learn a lot. If you haven't done econometrics\/used Stata in a while, this will be initially challenging, but it is manageable if you put in extra time at the beginning. I highly recommend this course to all interested in the policy implications of economics and looking for an econ class that is actually well taught!",
    "Definitely take it! This is my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. Don't let the name of the class scare you. It's basically just applying econometrics to real world issues. You'll read some of the most interesting economic papers out there. Plus Prof. Reyes is awesome. She's hilarious and super smart. She makes the classes very engaging so I was never bored in the 2 hour seminar.",
    "This is a good course that studies the application of econometric methods (mostly regressions) to questions that can be loosely categorized as microeconomics. We carefully read one or two fairly recent papers each week, focusing on issues like crime, health, race, and gender, and how economic methods can be used to better understand them. The workload is very reasonable--weekly readings, several STATA assignments over the course of the semester, three short reading responses, and a 5-7 page final paper\/in-depth analysis. My primary criticism is that the discussions can get a bit tedious (and sidetracked) at times.",
    "This was a great course for a senior seminar. It exposed me to a branch of economics (and a lot of interesting papers) that I wouldn't otherwise have encountered during my time at Yale. While the majority of the coursework is not technical, you do need to have a strong econometrics understanding to be able to discuss the papers. The course load itself is reasonable, and the grading fair. Professor Reyes is obviously a brilliant professor who is very clear in her feedback in class and on assignments. Class discussions may not always have been incredibly lively, but Professor Reyes did stay true to her promise of focusing on the methods used to reach results and helping us understand how exciting the methodology could be.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics, interesting papers, good guidance through the papers, good discussion, good teacher. Helps teach you how to think. Weaknesses: Empirical assignments were a bit easy and didn't help adequately prepare us for the final paper, final paper at times felt like groping in a pitch dark tunnel, office hours were sometimes inconvenient because Prof. Reyes doesn't teach full time at Yale so we could only meet up with her during one time period a week. Take it, but don't be deceived. This class is more work than you would expect.",
    "This class was challenging, but it was also one of the best classes I have taken at Yale and in the Economics major. Empirical micro teaches you to structure and think about broad problems (which oftentimes have direct policy implications), as well as to challenge all assumptions you encounter. Professor Reyes is fantastic - one of the best professors I've had at Yale - and is super passionate about the topics. She is a leader in the field, yet is super accessible and friendly. Make sure you go to office hours and ask for her help if you're lost - I learned a lot by just sticking around the classroom at the end of the class every week. Assessments are straightforward, but Professor Reyes often looks for \"thinking outside the box\" moments. Pay attention to detail. Make sure you do the readings and come prepared to discuss them in class!",
    "Really good choice for a senior seminar. We read very interesting papers and the discussions were always engaging. The paper topics are timely, so everyone is engaged. The workload is also relatively light for a seminar: read 1-2 papers per week, 1 final paper, and 2 problem sets in Stata. Great class, would recommend.",
    "Econ 481 is applying microeconomic methods-particularly regression from econometrics-to various societal problems. Do violent movies cause crime (no, they actually decrease it)? You can find out in this class. I highly recommend it. The workload is manageable and the material is super interesting."
