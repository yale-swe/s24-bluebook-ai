   "comments": [
    "Professor Semmel is a fabulous character and immensely knowledgeable. You'll enjoy his class.",
    "I would always recommend DS",
    "I would summarize the course as a general overview of Western political philosophy from the Renaissance through the twentieth century, and would absolutely recommend it to a friend.",
    "Professor Semmel is one of the hidden gems of the DS faculty. His sections were never dull, disappointing, or uninteresting.",
    "This course is probably the most \"relevant\" to our lives of any of the three DS courses in terms of its relationship to contemporary domestic and international politics. Understanding the intellectual history behind current circumstances is tremendously important for informed political deliberation.",
    "Yes and No. H&P is sometimes a bit hard to decipher--I found it to be more meaningful than philosophy but still often confusing. The lectures were sometimes rambling.I really respect Prof. Semmel and I am glad I was placed in his section! I appreciated his honesty, kindness and patience in class and willingness to meet outside of class. Slightly more focused class discussion and more historical background\/connections between works would have made the class even better.",
    "DS History is sometimes the least appealing of the three, if only because it has a lot of reading that can get very dry, but it is much better in the spring than in the fall. A fun course overall, and certainly not worth dropping DS to avoid.",
    "If you've made it to the second semester of DS, you are more than ready for H&P! The readings this semester are all the fascinating thinkers to whom you were introduced in high school - Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Burke, Tocqueville, Hamilton, Madison, Marx, Smith, Nietzsche. Because you probably have a better historical context, you will get much more out of the readings than last semester. The lecturers do a good job filling in any blanks you may have. And Professor Semmel is very good. He's a really nice guy, and is very helpful with paper writing. While our section discussions may have gotten sidetracked to less important topics, they were still very fulfilling. I would recommend his class!",
    "Probably, but only if he\/she finds a professor that inspires him\/her. Without this kind of professor, it is impossible to be inspired to do the reading and really learn the material."
