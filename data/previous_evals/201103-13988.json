    "This class offers a diverse perspectives of the natural world. I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in an American Studies approach of a topic that offers the opportunity for many different interpretations, and of course, to anyone interested in the natural world.",
    "AMST 258 changes from year to year based on who is teaching it, so it might be difficult to extrapolate out from this! I think the only thing that remains constant is the dinner at the end.This is an interesting topic (check out the syllabus for more info on how the prof is approaching it) that requires you to deconstruct different conceptions of wilderness. We read a lot of environmental history and hit up topics (the destruction of the Columbia River, the creation of national parks) that I had encountered. Definitely left with an interest in environmental history and a far more complex understanding of wilderness.The difficulty that I had with the class was struggling to build a body of content and understandingthat grew from week to week. Sometimes topics felt disparate and even though discussion was interesting I had difficulty connecting the dots and coming away with organized thoughts. That said, I prefer more structure than less and so I think if you're interested in the topic and want to do excellent readings on it with a knowledgable professor, do! If Christine happens to teach again, she knows a ton and is really accessible.",
    "It all depends on the instructor, so take this class if you like them and the syllabus they put together. On the other hand, if you're interested in nature and the outdoors at all, you will find like minded people in this course and that's always a bonus!",
    "If you are at all interested in natural spaces in north america, this course will give you a great overview of what role wilderness plays in our lives today as well as throughout history. If you've never taken an environmental studies class before, this would be GREAT starting point- you'll come out with a new way of viewing nature in north america and in your own life. If you have taken many AMST or EVST courses before, this is also a great course for you! If you've already done some of the readings on the syllabus, you'll have a jump start on the discussions and be able to dive even deeper into some of the most important nature writing in north america."
