   "comments": [
    "French 110's method focuses on speaking and listening, skills that are necessary to study abroad in a French speaking country. It is unlike any language class I have ever taken outside of Yale because there is no emphasis on spelling or simple vocabulary. The French in Action program likes to test you on your ability to comprehend entire passages, not a few words. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who hopes to become fluent in French. I am amazed at my own progress and abilities in the French language.",
    "It is a lot of work, a ton of work, but you will learn so much French that it will astonish you. You have daily workbook exercises and weekly tests, but the course material is not all shoved down your throat. You are taught bits and pieces at a time, and eventually it all comes together. I recommend this if you are willing to commit to learning a language and doing the homework, but if you are looking for an easy language, look somewhere else.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is very much in love with French and dedicated to learning it. I would describe it as very intensive and difficult yet effective.",
    "Intensive French program. Expect to work hard.",
    "Only take this class if you are really dying to learn French or desperately need a language credit. Be aware that there is a ton of work each night, plus tests every Monday night. The tests were surprisingly hard. Even though you could kind of get away with skipping the homework some nights, it would put you behind for the weekly Monday tests. Too much work overall."
