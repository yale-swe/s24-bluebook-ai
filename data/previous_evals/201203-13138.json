   "comments": [
    "A relaxed approach to looking at the intersection of Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary music in Shakespeare plays as well as the plays themselves. Does not require in depth knowledge of either music or Shakespeare, though it will definitely enhance your enjoyment of the class. A good way to get exposed to new music and theatre.",
    "Take this if you want a pretty easy credit and have some interest in music, particularly opera and classical music.",
    "My big word of caution is if you are looking for a class to read carefully and discuss Shakespeare's plays, this is not it. If you are looking for a chill class, where you get to read the plays in a not too critical way, learn a lot about Elizabethan music, learn a lot about opera and get to go see an opera yourself at the Met Opera house (which was awesome!), then this is the class for you.",
    "Shakespeare and Music covers everything from Elizabethan folk ballads to contemporary opera. You'll trace songs and musical references in several plays to their origins as well as look at various song settings and opera adaptations of plays (Verdi, Ades, Britten, etc.) How interesting you find the class will depend on the amount of interest you have in the topic in the first place. Workload is not great, just reading and listening assignments for each class and a couple essays. During class you'll be discussing these assignments as well as watching and listening to clips. The highlight of the course is the field trip to the Metropolitan Opera, which is a wonderfully fun experience. You don't necessarily need to be a musician to take the class, but you should definitely have an interest in Shakespeare.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want an interesting credit that isn't a lot of work. As a science student, I think it was a perfect freshman seminar experience! Also the trip to the opera was the highlight of my semester.",
    "Read five Shakespeare plays and study both the history of music in Shakespeare and the impact of Shakespeare on the musical world. I would recommend it to a student who is willing to read; would most recommend it to opera and poetry enthusiasts."
