    "The course is wonderful. The curriculum is interesting, the teachers are dedicated, and the course covered all four skills--reading, listening, speaking and writing. Nishimura Sensei's initiative to improve our Japanese intonation and pronunciation by arranging one-on-one tutoring sessions is a great initiative as well.",
    "If you're taking 157 you probably took 156 last semester so it's pretty similar, no surprises or anything. Classes can get a little repetitive since the format doesn't change. Conversation practice this semester was much more useful though.",
    "The teaching quality is what makes this course so enjoyable to it's students. The professors are very responsive to students' needs and always have clear answers to theit questions during class. There are not many weaknesses of the class, but one may perhaps be that much of the learning experience can depend on the engagement of other students, so in a class with students who are not particularly enthusiastic, learning can sometimes be a bit stiff."

    "Absolutely. I saw a market improvement in my Japanese skills.",
    "If you want to work on your reading and writing skills in Japanese then yes; improvement isn't as drastic as in the lower levels but I definitely felt more proficient at the end of the semester. That said, the workload is a pain as it always is, and you don't get to practice much speaking \/ free conversation as I'd have liked. Tests were also surprisingly harder than previous semester.",
    "Yes. Take this course if you want to improve your Japanese!"
