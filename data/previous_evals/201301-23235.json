   "comments": [
    "If you can take this section, I would highly recommend it. Not only are the course materials great, but Megan is fantastic, supportive, and instructive. Yay fairy tales!",
    "YES! I would recommend it to any fairy-tale lovers who want to understand cultural trends and more from fantasy.",
    "An awesome class where you get to read so many texts you may never have had the opportunity to read. I would definitely recommend it! Not only is it fun, but you also really improve your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was by far my favorite class freshman year.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course. Great reading material and not too work.",
    "Great books and learn how to actually write.Highly recommended especially with interesting topics like this.It is super fun, interesting, and helpful",
    "Most definitely take this class. The reading list is amazing. I've never had so much fun doing my homework. Also, Megan is amazing. She's into everything nerdy and wonderful, and I loved talking with her outside of class! Writing the papers for this class was truly enjoyable, and I wish I could take it all over again. Sometimes some people in the class got a little carried away with their own bizarre ideas, but it's an english seminar- what do you expect?",
    "Fairy Tales was an extremely engaging class, and I highly recommend it if you are interested in seeing how fairy stories have influenced culture for hundreds of years. We read everything from classic tellings of the tales to modern interpretations, and analyzed the influence of fairy tales on films and novels. The workload varied, but was overall not too bad because the readings were diverse and entertaining. It varied from short stories, poems, and articles to longer novels such as Jane Eyre or Howl's Moving Castle.",
    "Take this class! The people were great, the instructor is great, and the material is great.",
    "Amazing course! The readings are so much fun to do and the discussions we had were so interesting. Megan is an absolute sweetheart and also a great instructor. Loved this course! Definitely should consider taking it.",
    "If you think there is the magic in the world, or if you like to imagine there is some magic, although what scientific studies tell us, then Take The Class!!It is a great class. You will learn a lot from both the professor and your peers. You will improve your analytical skills of poems, short stories, novels, plays etc. You will be faced with both classical and modern renditions of fairy tales, myths and concepts associated with the secondary world (the faerie world).If you are a fan of LOTR then even more take the class, you will start with reading some Tolkien and then reference his approach to literature when interpreting many of the following texts.You will not have to read a lot, and you will both learn and have fun. :)",
    "Yes, definitely recommend",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is incredibly fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's an excellent introduction to literature at Yale. It will give you a firm base for how to write a literary essay.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115 02 to another student. Although Professor Eckerle can be a tough grader, she is really kind and helps students improve their analytical skills. The books that involve different fairy tale aspects were extremely interesting, making for great essay topics and fun class discussions.",
    "Take this course!!!!!!!!! Not only will you be reading some of the coolest and most intricate and dark stories out there, but you will be taking this course with an awesome person (Megan!!!!) You will definitely be challenged to improve your writing, but in the end, you will seriously notice a huge change in your writing style that makes your works so much more cohesive and clear. It is definitely worth it."
