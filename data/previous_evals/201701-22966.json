   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We learned a lot about experimental design, but a lot of it was targeted to clinical interventions, which makes sense because it is a class for clinical students, but was not really relevant to most of our research.",
    "This course was very helpful in many ways: -getting experience writing grants -getting supportive and helpful feedback on presentation styles -gaining familiarity with research methods -the scaffolding around grant writing was particularly helpful My only suggestions for improving the course are that I wish that you had lectured a bit more and I wish that students had given just one presentation, so that we might have been able to devote more time to it and thereby gotten feedback on our best work. I wish that you had been able to devote more time to lecturing because this course was the best introduction to statistical methods we have had in the department and I wish we could have taken greater advantage of that.",
    "Regarding the grant proposal assignment, I think the page-count requirements for the Approach section should be shortened, as I found 8-9 pages very difficult to reach. I also think that having an example grant from a peer or junior faculty member to refer to would be helpful. Referring to the NAPLS grant proposal was really interesting but also kind of intimidating; as such, it may not have been the best example for those of us writing grants for the first time.",
    "The class was excellent and I have only very minor suggestions for improvement. It would be nice if we could have been assigned a paper each week that utilized the methodology we would be talking about in class. Also, very minor, but it would have been nice to have a sample RO1 other than NAPLS since this is such a huge\/multifaceted study and our projects were all much smaller in scale. It was a rare and special opportunity to be able to get feedback on our teaching and aim to improve on it. Also would have been nice to spend more time on ethics!",
    "Strengths: This course gives students an opportunity to teach, get feedback about teaching, and improved upon the feedback. This course gives students practice with grant writing, and exposure to the awkwardness of study sections. Weaknesses: The grant writing process makes for a hefty semester for several weeks. Having a study section makes you all the more uncomfortable with the scrutiny of being in a PhD program, but this time your peers are leading the critique. While this is not unlike the experience one would getting a research setting, I wonder if we may have had half of our peers discuss our research with us as to improve upon the grants. It makes sense that the instructor would not have time or energy to let you know of any fatal flaws in your grant proposal, but finding out on the last day of class was unsettling."
