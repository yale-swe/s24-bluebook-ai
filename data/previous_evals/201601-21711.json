   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Manley is phenomenal - very enthusiastic and knowledgable, and he made me laugh out loud at least once (most times many more) per lecture.",
    "If you're an English major or you know you like Shakespeare then take it, but if you're not a big Shakespeare fan, skip it. The lectures are interesting, but they only make sense if you do the reading in advance, which is sometimes a bit tedious. Workload is manageable.",
    "This was a fantastic class for anyone who loves Shakespeare. I would not take this class if you cannot handle reading a play per week, but all that really requires is a Sunday afternoon. The professor made lecture enjoyable, this isn't your high school shakespeare class with a droning professor. You will learn how to write killer papers with nuance and depth while exploring the best that english literature has to offer.",
    "This is a great course on Shakespeare but it is a pretty big and comprehensive introduction that isn't for the faint of heart, so students are at a disadvantage if they aren't already familiar with shakespeare. There are only three papers which was nice, but the midterm and final felt a bit extraneous and it was hard to care about them when we were more focused on papers, which were better able to capture what we had learned. Professor Manley was great and super enthusiastic about Shakespeare which makes him easier to learn from and engage with during lectures. Section was helpful to get more in touch with the work while lectures dealt a lot with big themes, so it was good that TAs could work through specific passages with us.",
    "A great class to take! Professor Manley's lectures are awesome, often mind-blowing. The plays are for the most part really fun to read with the exception of a few. The workload is quite a bit of reading but only 3 5 page essays and a midterm and a final that don't require a lot of studying so long as you read the plays. Would definitely recommend. Section was also well run.",
    "If you're inclined to enjoy Shakespeare, this class is great; reading a play a week really gives you a chance to get to know Shakespeare on a greater level than just close examination of one or two plays and you get to be surprised by the more obscure ones you never thought you might have read or encountered otherwise!",
    "Definitely recommend this course! As a non-major who enjoys reading literature, I found this course to be the perfect addition to my schedule, with excellent lectures and a fair work load (three papers and two short exams). I think the comedies have a reputation for being less literary than the tragedies, but Professor Manley's lectures show how rich and nuanced they actually are. A great choice to take either for a letter grade or as a fifth, Cr\/D class.",
    "If you enjoy reading Shakespeare, you'll enjoy this class. If you've never read Shakespeare before, I'd recommend learning a bit more about him and his work before taking this, unless you plan to become very invested outside of class. If Shakespeare bores you and you want to take an easy English class, you're better off picking something else. There is a lot of reading involved, but as qualified before, the time you spend doing it will fly by. Be prepared to think long and hard about the meaning of what you're reading when you write your papers, too. Otherwise, remember to have fun and not treat the work as \"just the next item on the checklist.\"",
    "A great survey of some of Shakespeare's greatest works. Take this class only if you are willing to read the plays; otherwise it won't have much meaning for you. Make sure you pick a TF you feel comfortable with, because all your grading is done by them.",
    "Shakespeare is good. You should read Shakespeare. LMAN gave well-rehearsed lectures, appropriately intellectual, if a little dry.",
    "This class is amazing for English majors, and I imagine it would be a fun way to knock of a writing requirement for STEM majors, as well. If you have even the slightest inclination towards the works of Shakespeare, this class is an excellent way to get really deep into the plays. It's not the sort of English class where anything is skimmed over; you really get to know the works intimately. There is a great deal of reading that you really have to stay on top of for the exams, but the writing is easily graded and there's really not a lot of it for a WR requirement class.",
    "I cannot recommend this class highly enough! Consistently funny and engaging, each play enters a dialogue with the entire canon of Shakespeare, and the course works to create a beautifully cohesive whole. Professor Manley is such a brilliant lecturer, so this class is a must for English majors and a wonderful addition to anyone's schedule.",
    "This English class is great if you like Shakespeare or want exposure to some of his most and also least well-known plays. The lectures can lack a bit of dynamism, but if you are diligent you can get a lot out of them. And the reading schedule of a play a week is never overwhelming.",
    "Incredible class. I feel like I have full in depth knowledge of Shakespeare now.",
    "Absolutely. It's a fantastic course.",
    "It was an interesting class, but you may find yourself a bit out of your depth if you're just looking for a writing credit like I was.",
    "Great class, but what you put in is what you get out.",
    "If you're looking to take one Shakespeare course at Yale, take tragedies in the fall with Brian Walsh. The syllabus is significantly better! Manley is a fine lecturer, however.",
    "This is a great class! I would recommend it for all Theater Studies and English majors. Professor Manley is brilliant and as funny as the plays he lectures about. You will have to write three essays and read a lot of Shakespeare (almost every comedy), but for me, the Shakespeare was a plus! This was a really enjoyable class that I would highly recommend for you and your friend to take together so you can laugh and study together.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 200 for anyone interested in Shakespeare for its wonderful lectures and dedicated section leaders."
