   "comments": [
    "Sometimes I felt like I wasn't sure where the course was going. We had a lot of disjointed lectures that didn't always mesh well together or tell a big story. I guess it's kind of the nature of the beast - surveillance has a lot of different aspects and I guess there isn't really one best way to introduce all the topics. Homeworks tended to be really ambiguous and sometimes hard to follow. I also was irritated that the first two data sets for the homeworks had to be redone (after I had already completed the homework with the first data sets). Lots of work can be done here to make the homeworks more clear and helpful. Copying and pasting code doesn't really do a lot, and I feel like I came out still not really knowing how to apply many of the lab and homework topics outside of class. As a really math-oriented person, I would have really appreciated more in-depth coding and mathematical background and maybe a few more advanced topics. But I realize that this is not the view of the majority, which is unfortunate.",
    "I thought this class was great and one of my favorites in all of YSPH. Dan is a wonderful professor who makes time to help his students in any way he can. We did method lectures and labs which explained some of the tools but a lot of the code was already done so it was more passive learning. For some people that helped learn the basics of surveillance but for others who are more astute coders it wasn't quite enough. We covered a range of topics and students had to present on different topics so we were able to cover a wide range. I think as an intro this class was wonderful, however, for people who have had some introduction to surveillance more methods would be ideal. Either way I loved it and thought Dan\/Marina were great!",
    "Strengths: Great introduction into basic surveillance concepts and systems Weaknesses: Not enough methods labs Try increasing to 2x a month at least",
    "This class gave a really good overview of surveillance techniques. It was well organized and engaging.",
    "This class is an interesting and important topic that is relevant to a variety of students' interests. Its biggest strength is the professor, who is clearly skilled at designing and evaluating surveillance systems. Its biggest weakness is that is lacks organization and sometimes leaves you wondering what exactly it is you're learning. This class would probably benefit from using a textbok.",
    "Course is good introduction to surveillance and does a good job of incorporating labs for practice. It's not very inclusive of diseases that are not infectious or examples in other countries.",
    "I thought this class was very good for the methods parts but I didn't care for the theory. Until the end of the course, I really felt like I had no idea how to actually perform the theory we learned in earlier lectures. In my opinion, this class should be equal theory and methods. Perhaps a theoretical model is the first class of the week having an in depth case study of a surveillance system for a particular type of disease or a particular kind of surveillance system. Then the second class of every week will focus on learning the methods to actually do that in the real world. Collecting and analyzing surveillance data is a very real and practical life skill and I feel like this class as it is currently designed only teaches that skill at a peripheral level.",
    "I wish we had done more methods lectures. I do not know how much I got out of the other lectures. I felt that as a whole there was a lot of breadth but not a lot of depth in the course. Also, for the methods lectures, we should write the code in class with you & not be given the code. This way we can be more engaged in the process. Analyzing the data for the final project was the best part of the class. It was a real life situation. There were certain things that I know a lot of groups went to you for in order to learn more about the methods or how to apply the methods we learned in class to the particular situation. I think that maybe some of those unique situations could be taught and added to methods lectures. I also really liked the lit review paper. Many of the other lectures were mostly just review of concepts that we had learned in other classes & I didn't get as much out of them as I had hoped.",
    "I liked the lectures by people from outside who had rich experiences on the course matter . The group project for which we used actual data from another country was very helpful. Excellent!",
    "It is a fantastic course. It gives a great overview of what surveillance is and how diverse the topics can be. The only weakness is the use of student presentations: they don't bring much to the class and prevent us from learning more .",
    "I really enjoyed the beginning few weeks of the course and the final few weeks of the course. I thought it was important to learn the basics of a surveillance system and I liked learning different methods. I think the course could have a heavier methods focus. Some of the information covered in the middle section were things that we had learned in other classes, particularly Principles of Infectious Diseases I.",
    "This is a relatively new course, so the structure of the class, especially labs seemed undefined at times. However, the guest speakers were excellent, and Dan and Marina were engaging and wonderful. One of my favorite classes this year!",
    "Really liked the course.",
    "Needs a lab session with more focus on R",
    "This course has the advantage that it allows students to study an area of public health that they are interested in. A disadvantage is that the lab structure should be changed. With just three labs you don't really get to learn that much. In biostats we have lab every week if that were the case in this class we would learn much more and get more than an introduction to programming in surveillance. I think that it is very important than the structure of these labs be changed because it would allow students to actually develop skills they need for the job market.",
    "This was a good introduction to disease surveillance. Some of the guest lectures didn't really present any new material. I know that previously, students wanted less of a focus on methods, but I would have preferred a stronger focus on methods (even though this would have entailed more work). I think that the student presentations could have been shortened and that doing one lecture and one methods section a week (or so) would have been really useful.",
    "I enjoyed this course. The material is not particularly difficult but we cover a wide range of diseases\/case studies and how surveillance differs for each. I enjoyed the guest speakers that were brought in also. I like that this class is focused more on the practical side of public health, and I liked the final project and assignments instead of exams. I think that I would be interesting in doing more hands on work during the methods labs, since it was sometimes difficult to do the homework since we hadn't written any of the code ourselves.",
    "Good class. Make sure to tell students to limit their presentations! Some people talked for like 50-60 minutes, which meant that we had to cut back on the real lesson from the professor. I appreciate his kindness but he is way too lenient when it comes to keeping people on schedule-- then the rest of us miss out on course material, which is the real reason we are in the class, not to hear summaries of papers we read."

    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was always super cheerful and very knowledgeable about the subjects. He was a huge help in figuring out our final projects and answering questions about how to run our analyses.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is amazing. He is very understanding and is more than willing to explain concepts and go over methods outside of class. He was willing to meet multiple times to help analyze data for our final project. He is one of the most open and supportive professors I have had at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was very knowledgeable about what he taught. I learned a lot and will definitely keep ahold of the slides for future reference. As far as the presentations went (not the final) he could've been more authoritative in keeping to a time limit. Some of the presentations went on for an hour! It cut into class time and we would never really get through the slides on that day! Don't be afraid to buzz people in the future! Those presentations shouldn't have gone on for that long.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dr. Weinberger put together a well organized course. He was very sensitive to students' questions and did a good job of adjusting things based on our interests.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is a great professor who is dedicated to improving his course and providing a meaningful experience for students in it. While it impressive to go through in-class examples with him, a little more structure would go a long way.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Professor is knowledgeable and has experience with many of the topics. Lecture can be more interactive as it is often just lecture-based. More labs might be helpful for those of us more interested in obtaining the technical skills.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0I think Dan is fantastic and is SO open to helping students. It makes a huge difference when you have a great professor who goes out of their way to make sure students learn and perform well.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0He was really good at taking feedback & applying it to the course. He was also always willing to meet.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Excellent teaching skills and use of audiovisual aids. I liked his prompt response whenever we had queries. I did not see any weaknesses at all. Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0A brilliant professor , weary approachable and always available to answer any questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is really great and approachable. He's flexible and really open to student feedback, and he was accessible to reach outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was wonderful. He was engaging, extremely helpful and his slides are concise and easy to understand. (He can sound monotonous at times, but no big deal)",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was very helpful and accessible to students. He responded well to feedback and tried to cater to students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Interesting lectures",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dr Weinberger is cool. One advantage that he has over some professors is that students really like him. He is approachable, smart, considerate, and flexible. However, I think that improving his ability to present would really be a game changer. Presenting is not something that comes naturally to people and there is a mixture of how you use your voice, your tone, your posture, and your slides themselves that gets people's attention and keeps it. As students we had a professional skills seminar that addressed some of these topics. I think these same resources should be available to faculty. Dr. Weinberger has the advantage that he is both smart and approachable. I think it would make a huge difference if he improved his presentation skills. Overall I am glad I had him as a professor and I think his class is only going to get better.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dr. Weinberger is an awesome professor who is very clear, approachable, and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is really passionate about the subject and really wants everyone to take something away from the class. He is really receptive to student feedback and is very helpful when meeting with him.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0See above."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course because I like Dan and I know he is responsive to student feedback and will work hard to improve the course next year. Almost all infectious disease work has something to do with surveillance, so it's important to know where your data comes from and what caveats you need to be aware of. This course does a good job of illuminating some of the behind-the-scenes details that we don't always think about with research.",
    "I loved it. If you have had prior surveillance it might not be method-heavy enough but even with prior surveillance I thought it was fine. He is very open to feedback so if you feel it is too method heavy or not enough he is willing to adapt the course to suit student's wishes. If you have space in your schedule it is great!",
    "Great course. I would encourage people to take this course BEFORE considering taking Ginny's. It gives a nice lead into her more technical course.",
    "This is a good course for students interested in an overview of surveillance techniques. Most of the focus was on infectious disease surveillance, but there were some sessions looking a chronic diseases as well. I would recommend it for people interested in surveillance methods and programming.",
    "This is an interesting class and has a fairly low workload, and the professor is great. There are other classes you might get more out of, however.",
    "Class is good if you just want an introduction to surveillance and not an overwhelming amount of work. Its more focused on infectious disease, obviously, but a variety of speakers are invited which provides an interesting opportunity to learn about other diseases, career paths, etc.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend it because I don't know how much I got out of the course. I think if more time had been spent on methods it would have definitely been worth it.",
    "For anyone interested in disease surveillance, I would say go for it. It was very helpful and very practical course.",
    "Take the course ! If you want to know what surveillance is and get passionate about it, it is a 'must-attend'.",
    "An overview of Surveillance, with a focus on examples and case studies more so than methods (although that might be open to change in future years). Would recommend.",
    "Quantitative, covers broad topic in infectious diseases. I would definitely recommended to anyone who is interested in surveillance. Thank you so much for offering this course!",
    "Do take!",
    "This course teaches a crucial topic in public health and I would recommend it. I believe that this course has the potential to be great and that is why I made recommendations in earlier sections.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes I would recommend it-- it taught me that I am not as interested in surveillance as I thought. It was good to learn new software (R and SaTScan). It was also cool to see the application of biostatistics in real life."
