    "I would recommend Latin 120 to another student because it is fun to learn about one of the first languages. In this class we explored some basic Latin writings and it was really cool to see how these writings affected history. The workload was decent, but definitely not unbearable. Quizzes were usually every Friday, but they never seemed daunting because we learned the quiz topic so well in the classes prior.",
    "Latin 120 is most relevant to anyone who has taken Latin 110 at Yale, because the same grammar principles, learning style, and textbook carry over from one term to the next. The course offers a foundational understanding of more complex Latin grammar principles, and transitions towards the end of the term into a practice of basic Latin translations.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. It is a good introduction into latin and I've had a positive experience with the class and each instructor I have had.",
    "CHALLENGING, INTERESTING, WORTHWHILE",
    "I would definitely recommend Latin. It's difficult but very well taught and worthwhile.",
    "Latin 120 is a good and helpful course which teaches you the basics of Latin grammar and syntax."
