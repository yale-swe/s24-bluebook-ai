    "I wouldn't take it for fun, but as far as labs go, this one is totally painless. Rather than having weekly quizzes, you prep for the experiments by writing an \"experimental plan.\" There aren't write-ups every week, and the only in-class assessment is a multiple-choice final at the end, which isn't super easy, but is very fair as long as you study all of the questions in the lab packet. One warning to future students: read every detail of the formatting guidelines in the course packet and follow them to the letter. They will take off lots of points for things that may seem minor to you, like forgetting to put your last name at the top of every page, or starting sentences with numbers. Paying attention to all of those seemingly meaningless details can take some time, but once you get the hang of it it's not hard to do well on the write-ups. Definitely less work than 119L, and much less stressful (I didn't dread this class every week). Furthermore, DiMeglio is very nice and helpful, and you're not graded on your yield. So if you have to take it (which I'm assuming you do if you're reading this), don't stress -- even if you're not in love with the material, if you put in the work you shouldn't have to worry about getting a bad grade.",
    "This lab is well organized. DiMeglio is a wonderful instructor. There is less work than General Chemistry Lab.",
    "Chem 222L is a great course. Since the orgo lecture class is so hard, I think they try to make up for it by making the lab a little easier. I would recommend it to another student because its a good way to see a demonstration of the concepts you learn in lecture. Plus they play the radio in the lab!",
    "Take this course. It will improve your knowledge of chemistry.",
    "If you're taking CHEM 220 then take it.",
    "Taking this lab should not be a drag for anyone. It's a really fun way to apply your orgo knowledge even if you're not planning on working in a lab ever again. You learn a lot and its fun!",
    "This was a great class to go along with first semester orgo. It's definitely a lot easier if you've had prior lab experience and know how to prepare experiments ahead of time.",
    "You probably have to take this lab, but you should be happy to know that it's definitely one of the best labs at Yale. Much better than general chemistry and much better organized and interesting! You only have to write one \"full\" lab report too, which is really nice.",
    "Better lab than general chemistry, way more laid back.",
    "Orgo lab was pretty enjoyable. The labs themselves are usually fairly straightforward and it's nice not having to rely on a partner. I understood the concepts we covered in lab better than the ones we didn't when it came to the lecture's exams. The assignments are a bit annoying it that they have to be formatted perfectly, etc.There was only one lab report due. Other than that there's a summary of the procedure due before each class and a few quick questions usually due after.",
    "Yes! I found the experiments more interesting and enjoyable than genchem lab.",
    "Overall a pretty good, relaxed lab. You'll learn several new lab techniques and get some practice on writing lab reports. Take with CHEM 220.",
    "Take it. It is a very basic level that you must know.",
    "A great lab to be a part of. Take it.",
    "A good introduction to basic organic chemistry lab techniques and concepts. We did interesting labs which I found very rewarding. Definitely worth taking!",
    "I would recommend CHEM 222L. The work that you do seems very relevant to the course, and the lab reports develop actual skills such as writing abstracts rather than focusing on minutiae. My TF was really nice and a good teacher, and I got to listen to music while I worked. I had a great experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you need to take Ochem lab, we learned the fundamentals well.",
    "It's a great lab course at Yale. It is interesting and well organized, and I left feeling confident doing basic laboratory techniques.",
    "You take Orgo Lab because you have to. Taking it with Dr. DiMeglio makes it as painless and as useful as possible.",
    "its a standard intro organic chem lab but with a great ta. if you've got to take it, its not bad.",
    "Lab for Orgo 1, not too much work but grading is hard"
