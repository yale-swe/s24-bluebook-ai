   "comments": [
    "WOW WHAT A GREAT CLASS!! learned all about cyberwar, cyberweapons, and how the cybersphere is being used in international diplomacy. talked about policy and how to regulate it, ways it has been weaponized, etc. overall just so cool and so applicable because everyone's stuff is online and cybersecurity applies to everyone, really kind of a wake up call.",
    "This class is great at introducing many different cyber issues-- and is especially good at keeping up with current events.",
    "great class",
    "Having no knowledge about the internet or computer science I was a little intimidated going into the course. The class provides you with a better understanding of the technical fundamentals of the internet and of cybersecurity. It is interesting to analyze the unexplored realm of cyberspace from a policy perspective, as international norms regulating its use have not yet been established it makes for very interesting discussion!",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of cybersecurity and cyberwar, as a new means and perspective of international diplomacy and international relations. Through the course of this semester, we not only covered a range of historic events that defined cybersecurity, and its development as a means of national security and international diplomacy, but also current events and pivotal cyber moments: North Korea's hack on SONY, Stuxnet, Snowden's intelligence leaks, etc. Furthermore, we not only engaged in military aspects of cyber, but learned how to analyze law and international law, as well as come up with diplomatic and political solutions to the cyber crisis. Throughout the course, we were given the opportunity to practice writing policy memos, research papers, and creating our own policy briefings, which was fine preparation for IR.",
    "I learned how to write a policy memo, both by myself and in a group setting. I also learned how important private cybersecurity (in companies, personal accounts) is to national security. I went into this class knowing almost nothing about cybersecurity and cyber war, and now I feel comfortable talking about the subject. This class taught me that cybersecurity needs to be prioritized more by our government because it so significantly impacts international and domestic relations.",
    "I gained an understanding of the broad context and reach of cybersecurity and cyber issues in the world today and an appreciation of the importance of understanding cyber for addressing any and all national security issues we are facing today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "readings were very relevant and not too difficult, the memo and threat assessment were really cool and not something you get to do in a regular yale class. idk what the weaknesses are i really liked it. maybe being at 9:25 in the morning was a weakness :)",
    "The briefing, memo, and dinners were all great additions!",
    "I liked how this class wasn't really an academic class. That said, I would have appreciated if we could have read 5-10 academic articles to become acquainted with the academic aspects of cybersecurity and to understand how academics compare cybersecurity to other security-related topics. When I wrote my final paper, I realized that there were a few interesting articles that I wish we would have read. However, the strength of this class is not and should not be the academic side of it: I really enjoyed applying the skills and knowledge that we learned throughout the semester to write short memos and do presentations.",
    "Great structure, interesting readings and awesome debate!",
    "Great course covering the basics of cybersecurity before going in depth about a number of topics.",
    "having the paper and briefing occur both at the end of the course made it feel a little lopsided. Perhaps the briefing could occur during midterms to better space out the workload. That is really my only complaint i can think of.",
    "I thought this was an excellent course that delved into cyber, and how it defines international relations today. I liked how the class was structured, in that we covered a new topic every week--from the development of the Internet and cybersecurity, to the Russian hacks on US elections in 2016. I also appreciated how interactive the course was: media files of interviews were played in class, there were special guests and professionals that spoke, and there were supplementary events outside of class related to cyber that we were encouraged to attend. One suggestion for improvement is that the lessons and themes of each week are more tied together, and international diplomacy solutions are more firmly spelled out.",
    "I think the strengths of the course include the reading list, the class structure, the assignment structure, and Professor Wittenstein's teaching style. I think a weakness of the course was as it was at 9:25 a.m. at the Watson Center, it took some time for the class to wake up a bit, so good discussion did not really start until around 15-20 minutes into the start of class.",
    "This was a great course. It covered a range of topics and areas, with interesting assignments (a policy memo and later a briefing in character as an assigned national security or cyber official) and great class discussion."

   "comments": [
    "i loved this class and if you can get in, you should take it. learned a lot about the importance of cyber security, how the cybersphere has been weaponized and is hard to defend, and how important it is to the future of international relations. all super applicable stuff, and we always incorporated what was going on in the world at the time of our class. 4 page policy memo, weekly readings, group threat assessment paper and presentation, and a 16-20 page final paper but really its all interesting and nothing is tedious work. 11\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the cybersecurity or if you would like to take a course that is less academic than most other courses but still sufficiently challenging. I especially liked how open-ended much of this course was. This class is definitely more about asking the right questions than knowing the right answers. Since cybersecurity is a relatively new field, there isn't that much academic background material out there, so the syllabus was comprised of newspaper articles, government reports, and a few books. I thought it was really cool how the purpose of this class wasn't so much to understand previous theories but rather to develop our own understanding of the field. Plus, Professor Wittenstein is great!",
    "Definitely take, I have taken two of Professor Wittenstein's courses and he continues to be a great teacher and provides an intellectually stimulating class every week.",
    "Absolutely; extremely interesting material.",
    "Absolutely. Cyberspace in international relations is very poorly understood (it is a new phenomenon after all) and it is fascinating to ponder and discuss the way existing international norms should apply (or not) in cyberspace. The class also helps you to better understand current events concerning the internet (the 2016 election hacking, stuxnet, etc.). Definitely would recommend to those interested in cybersecurity as it pertains to international relations (even with no background in the field).",
    "This is an excellent class for any student interested in international relations, as cyber is a unique and intriguing element and new development of IR that has quickly become more relevant as time passes. Not only do you learn about cyber from the very beginning--how it all started with the invention of the Internet--but you learn about key and critical moments that defined cyberwar, as well as current events related to cyber, and the international crisis regarding this amphitheater of international diplomacy. Furthermore, you will build great skills related to government and IR given a variety of different assignments: policy memos, research papers, and policy briefings. This is one class where every week is exciting and filled with riveting discussion. This is a course truly on the cutting edge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I knew nothing about cybersecurity going into the course, and with the way Professor Wittenstein organized the course, we covered a wide range of topics that I now feel comfortable discussing. Professor Wittenstein also provided a lot of opportunities to engage with the course outside of class.",
    "In this day and age, I would recommend any student to take this class as cyberattacks are becoming more prevalent, public, and destructive. This class teaches both the technical, political, and security implications of cyber warfare. I feel much more knowledgable about a hot current events topic.",
    "Absolutely take this course! Great class that covered a range of issues (who knew cyber was relevant in so many areas?), with interesting assignments and an engaged professor."
