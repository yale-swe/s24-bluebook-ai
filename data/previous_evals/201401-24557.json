    "The reading load, unfortunately, is unrealistic - especially for those with only basic physical sciences background.",
    "I would have liked the professor to reveal more of her expertise on the subject matter. It was great for the class to bestudent driven, but expertise would have been welcome.",
    "While the idea of this course was inspiring, it was ultimately problematic to have make this course a seminar. While the professor was dedicated and engaged, it felt like Nadine was learning along side us. This was pretty problematic when questions would come up in class but a clear answer would not be provided. A lot of the confusion that was raised about aspects of the IPCC report was never really resolved.",
    "This material is so important and everyone in the room who signed up for the class was committed to really understanding the material, butthe format and delivery was a real let down. It's not appropriate to let students say things that are inaccurate without correcting them. I think it would have been better to have presenters meet with the instructor the week before to clarify the material - identify the key figures and really drill down to understand the core questions. Instead listening to 30 minute power points where big points and small points are all just treated superficially is frustrating. I think the instructor really should have taken a more active role in actually teaching the material. Or lean on the university and bring Mark Pagani in for the paleo chapter, Trude for the aerosols, etc. It's such important information I really think this class could have been taught better. Maybe have every student do a reading response each week, or a quiz on the summary, something to get people engaged.",
    "The reading was very intense and difficult to understand. I think that thi class would also be more effective if it was held later in the day to help give full attention toboth presenters"

    "This course could have benefited from a longer class period to allow for both presentation and discussion of the material.",
    "The professor needs to be more well versed in the technical aspects of the IPCC chapters we were all reading so that she can clearly and succinctly answer students' questions. It is an admirable idea to have students teach one another the material but there needs to be a backstop to ensure that what is communicated is correct. I did not feel this was always the case.",
    "Each chapter was taught by a student. Sometimes, if the student did not understand the chapter well, or put together a poor presentation, much of the content was lost.",
    "The structure and setting up a class to never hear from an expert and almost never having an actual discussion....",
    "I think the professor should be more forthcoming when it comes to helping the students who are struggling at points in their presentations. The material is extremely difficult to understand if you've never seen it before, and even harder to explain to others. The whole class would benefit more from the professors knowledge and understanding of the material!!! Sometimes it felt like the students were being punished for not understanding all of the material when it should be more about learning. It would also help if the professor outlined the important take-always from each chapter in handouts to keep as reference!"
