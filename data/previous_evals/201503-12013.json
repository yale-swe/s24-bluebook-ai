   "comments": [
    "This class is best for people who would never be encouraged to write on their own. I really loved reading other people's work and getting the chance to have mine workshopped by the entire class. Marc Lapadula is a funny man, and if you're coming in knowing that there will be some really strange days in class, you'll be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class if they are willing to devote a lot of time to the midterm project. To summarize it, I would say that it is a highly enlightening introduction into writing and analyzing screenplays and an eye-opening course into how the stories of movies work.",
    "You'll read a lot of screenplays, and you'll write a 8-12 page short. There are only 2 assignments to turn in, the midterm project and the final screenplay. There's a lot of work for the midterm project, so be sure to start early on in the semester. The set-up is nice with the subgroups who meet throughout the semester, and workshop each other's screenplays before the big group workshop. Lapadula is great, and he knows how to tell a story.",
    "Definitely recommend for anyone interested in film, screenwriting, storytelling, hollywood, etc.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to learn how to write screenplays. Most of the work is concentrated in the midterm packet but just leave yourself some time to do that ( as in don't start it three days before its due) and you'll be just fine. The hw is fun too, its reading screenplays.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning to write for film, and I would encourage them to get a jumpstart on reading the screenplays. It will only work to improve one's hold on the particularities of writing for film.",
    "The things you've read about this class are true--Professor Lapadula is quirky, and the tangential lectures that you'll experience on the first day of class will continue throughout the entire semester. Don't expect a class that focuses on the skill of creative writing. In this class, you write one short 8-12 screenplay, in three drafts, and that's basically it--there are few other screenwriting-related exercises. The first half of the semester is dedicated to the professor's (often rambling but entertaining!) stories and thoughts on great films, and these classes often consist of lectures that he's given at other public speaking events. In the last half of the course, you will workshop each other's drafts. Once you actually start workshopping drafts, Professor Lapadula's comments are very helpful and insightful! He does clearly wants to foster a love of screenwriting in his students.",
    "TAKE IT! If you have any interest in film\/writing, take it.",
    "ABSOLUTLY AMAZING. Professor Lapadula is a wonderful teacher, mentor and person. I feel extremely lucky to have the chance to have him as my teacher. Truly brought him 100% to every class and made everyone feel special. He is very knowledgeable but at the same time very approachable and very willing to help. He also did a wonderful job in connecting and creating a network among students: the class felt like a small community at the end. Professor Lapadula is very caring, nurturing and personable professor. He is so passion about his job and he genuinely cares about his students and their success. There isnt a single thing I would change about Marc Lapadulas teaching style. He is supportive and caring. Despite the fact that my first language is not English, Professor Lapadula allowed me to be part of the class and encourage me to write and improve every day. He will remain forever among my favorite professor at Yale.",
    "Overall this class was incredible. Marc is a great professor and he really cares about film and how to properly write a screenplay. The class was a little loose in structure but I think it worked well for the premise of it. One of its greatest strengths was that Marc split us up into small discussion groups and it was up to us to meet up and discuss. It worked marvelously and it allowed for getting to know someone else's writing intimately."
