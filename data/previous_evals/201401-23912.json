    "The major limitations of this course were the lack of a (real) Teaching Fellow who was paid for her\/ histime, and the lack of an adequate computer lab with sufficient computing power. That said, despite the pitfalls that lead to many frustrating and long modeling struggles - I learned a ton in this course and I am very glad that I took it. The skills covered here were very relevant to what I may be doing in the future.",
    "Oooh boy this class was a lot of work! Definitely the biggest workload of the semester. My group spent several hours a week, every week, working on assignments, in addition to the big push of work to complete each one. However, you get a LOT out of it! Marketable skills. Comprehensive understanding of the science behind the work. Experience using tools. If you want to work in species conservation, whether as a biologist, conservationist or policy expert, this class is a must.",
    "I would have liked more connection between the in class lectures, which were very interesting, and the actual assignments that we were completing. There seemed to be a bit of a disconnect there and I would have liked to learn more about how to integrate the in-class theories with the application of conservation.",
    "1. the class needs to have a cap and needs to be held in a lab space. Bowers is completely inappropriatefor GIS.2. instructor needs to establish grading criteria and expectation for students on day one, instead of constantly changing expectations-- for example, telling us that there is a graded final project, then canceling this assignment the week before its due. This is not only frusterating, but also unprofessional. It is the job of the instructor to create a framework for students to follow-- not make it up each up class. It is job to prepare before class, NOT during.3. Instructor needs to teach to all levels in the class, the course is sold as an introductory course, for those with NO GIS experience, however the class is taught to the top 5 or 10 percent without regard for anyone else. This is okay, however maybe a new instructor needs to be aquired for the other 95 %.4. Utimately, with material provided, I taught myself the skills- professor and lecture unneccessary.",
    "Great course to learn about landscape conservation, focusing on species needs.",
    "I am relatively new to environmental conservation, and found this course to be an incredibly useful, ifvery fast-paced and work-intensive, introduction to how conservation works in the \"real world.\" My one complaint would be the ratio of time spent playing around with GIS and modeling equipment versus the amount of time spend interpreting data in terms of species-specific needs. Hopefully some of the techniques this class piloted can be passed down to future classes, so they can shift more to interpreting results, rather than figuring out the software.",
    "Question 3 - this course, as it was offered this semester, should be a 5 credit course.",
    "Great course. Os is an excellent teacher - one of my favorite at Yale. I appreciate the effort he put into this class. I feel like I gained hard skills that will be useful to me in the workplace of with my research. I appreciate how applied this course was.A significant chunk of the work load was GIS work not directly related to the content of the course (data processing).The group project was frustrating, to say the least, in part because the groups were too large and the nature of GIS work is not conducive to a group with varying levels of experience.",
    "Question 12: This course provided valuable insights to my previous professional background on species conservation. Theoretical and practical skills and knowledge gained from the course can be applied anywhere and on any species in conservation, research and academic projects.",
    "This was a really, really great class. I left feeling as though I had learned so much-- we covered boththe theoretical ideas behind conservation and landscape\/community ecology, as well as some really valuable technical skills (GIS, Maxent, and Circuitscape). I have seen how valuable and sought-after these skills are, and it is great to have a class that was both intellectually interesting and academically relevant, as well as practical and professionally oriented."

    "The skills gained through modeling and the materials covered in lecture. Also the reports produced using the modeling methods.",
    "The assignments were a huge amount of work, but they were how you learned everything in the class. Lectures were an interesting supplement, but the work is where we learned things.Os Schmitz is an excellent instructor and Anne Trainor was an essential asset to the class - I have no idea how one could teach it without her. She should definitely be formalized as an instructor moving forward to allow students better access.I felt like the grading and assessment of projects was pretty straightforward and each time I got useful feedback.",
    "The assignments and learning the different software was very helpful and I feel that I learned a lot of valuable skills. The lectures also presented a lot of interesting concepts relevant for conservation, but not always discussed or practiced on the ground.",
    "The material was extremely interested and not found in any other courses at FES. Coming out of this class, I feel very prepared to work for many types of conservation organizations.",
    "This course was among the most valuable courses I have taken at FES. Throughout the assignments, you really felt skills you were learning were applicable and would be useful in your work outside of FES.",
    "Provided materials",
    "Learning to use many different software for species distribution modeling, including Maxent, Circuitscape and GIS.",
    "I really liked the way the group work was structured - for the first four assignments, people worked on individual projects, but in the context of a group effort. This gave people natural support systems for figuring the software out, while still enabling them to focus on their species of interest (this set-up also prevented the problem of having too many cooks in the kitchen for the first four projects, since everyone had their own final report to turn in). I think I was really lucky in terms of my group mates, and I learned so much about this field and the tools we used to complete the assignments just from watching them work.The content is also really fascinating - I would have liked a bit more discussion and focus on some of the readings we chose. My background is weaker here, and discussions like the one around puma prey selection in Patagonia would have helpful in getting a better sense of the literature (though, maybe students with a stronger conservation science background would find this less useful?).",
    "This is the one course I've taken to date where I feel like I learned tangible, conservation relevant skills I can add to a resume\/cv. The workshops were immensely helpful in developing these skills",
    "The course exposed students in problem solving by combining science and practical actions.",
    "The end result of this course was having useful, applicable skills that could be used in the future.",
    "Os as a teacher. I looked forward to his presentations every morning. His facilitating of the class on the protected area in S. America was particularly successful (having us do the readings ahead of time, discuss them in class, the conclusions we drew about data quality, conservation challenges).Learning hard skills that I can apply to work (making SDMs, PVAs)Os' lectures were excellent.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the individual and group works throughout the semester. These exercises provided students with opportunities to manipulate data on species to draw predictions on their current and future distributions, assessing species population viability; tools which are essential in species and habitat conservation. Data were not provided, but students managed to search for data on their respective species, a way which expended students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to understand and resolve any issue related to data collection in conservation projects.",
    "(1) Hands on experience using conservation-relevant software, (2) exploring new questions and (3) thinking critically about the future of conservation.",
    "The integration of theory and practical technical skills.",
    "The way the course was outlined\/structured worked really well-- doing the components of the main final project as individual assignments, and then essentially compiling and analyzing them into one final document, was really helpful and made sure that the final project wasn't overwhelming."

   "comments": [
    "See #13. Not having a lab with Circuitscape software installed and computers that were fast enough to run it in less than 24 hours was a major limitation and frustration for this course. Only 6 computers in Sage had the software installed, and they were all taken up by people running 15+ hour models so those computers were unavailable to others in the class as well as other FES students.",
    "I would imagine that other people didn't have quite as good an experience in their groups. I wonder if there's a way to better organize, or perhaps mix up, groups, so that they are a little less 'clicky' or so that your group doesn't determine your whole experience in the class. Just a guess. I loved my group.The software for this class needs to be installed on every FES and CSSSI computer. There were times when people simply couldn't access machines to get their work done, which was pretty unfair and frustrating. Plus the Sage computers REALLY need better upkeep. They are almost un-usable, they are so clogged and slow.It sucks that we are constantly kicked out of CSSSI for classes with almost no warning and often very rudely. We need a place to work.",
    "Ann was a great resource throughout the course, but it would have been more helpful for us to have had a paid TA with set office hours each week to help through the assignments. I also think having a separate lab session every other week would have been helpful too, for the same reason.The assignments were very time intensive, not because they were necessarily difficult, but because they required specific knowledge of the software not easily gleaned except through repeated trial and error, and often had long run times (sometimes over 15 hours). It would have been very helpful if all the computers in the Sage lab (and maybe the Stat Lab), had Maxent and Circuitscape installed. It would also be great if Ann or another TA wrote up a user's guide for the software with directions for some of the trickier aspects of the program (like setting cell size extent and resolution equal across our layers).Having an in-class session or two with Stacey Maples would have been helpful to work through the software-specific ArcGIS techniques.",
    "The workload was not terrible, but we did not have enough faculty support. Having either a workshop or two with a GIS expert like Stacey Maples at the beginning of the class to go over the general tools we will use and giving the TA set weekly office hours would make a huge difference. We spent tons of time (15+ hours per person per assignment, sometimes more than 25) fighting computer programs rather than learning the material. Although encountering difficulties is reasonable and part of actually doing this kind of work, this was unnecessarily difficult and stressful. Enforcing the GIS prerequisite would also help, but we were doing sufficiently specialized work that more guidance would have been good.",
    "The general structure of assignments in the course could be improved. At the beginning of the course, it seemed like forming a group of students with differing skills would be beneficial throughout the course. However, since analysis was carried out in groups, but each student had to write up their own assignment, a couple of group members who had more quantitative skills often had to spend much more time carrying out the analyses, explaining the process and trying to teach other group members, while still having to write up their own assignments. Therefore, the interdisciplinary nature of the course may be better served by having a few group assignments rather than individual ones, so that all group members could contribute throughout the course.",
    "INSTRUCTOR",
    "There was no interaction between the groups, and so the final result has to do with the luck of having people that are good at GIS on your own group. If this is not the case, the assignments are really difficult, time consuming, and the final grade might not be fair when compared to the work of others. It would be good to maybe have a smaller class and have everyone learn the same skills and strategies.",
    "The time commitment this course re",
    "More cohesion between the lecture and workshops would be helpful, sometimes the lecture strayed too much from the issues the course was trying to deal with",
    "The workload could be lessened considerably by addressing the GIS\/modeling aspects of the course. While I understand that part of the purpose of the course was to teach the students how difficult it is to acquire and manipulate data, there is a point at which that stops being useful, and starts being detrimental to other courses. Also, even having taken the GIS raster course did not help with the problems of dealing with raster datasets from different sources in different coordinate systems, cell size, and extents - this is not addressed in the course, and it was a MAJOR time drain for the second workshop (speaking as one of the GIS 'experts' in the group). Having Stacey Maples offer a workshop on how to download, clip, align, and mosaic, and aggregate rasters would have saved everyone a lot of trouble. Also, communication between different groups was not that extensive because groups worked at different paces and in different locations. The course could use an online message board (Dr. Tomlin uses piazza.com for his GIS courses) where students could post questions to others in their class.",
    "Fewer students per group. If that means making more groups, that's fine. Scheduling group meetings with 5 people is a nightmare (when everyone is so busy).Maybe feed us a little more refined data. Cutting and resizing all the layers for ArcMap took my group weeks of frustrating effort. Maybe it's worth it, maybe not. An easy thing the class could do is alert us to Stacey Maples' office hours.I think another lecture on the Yale Framework would have been very relevant and helpful, especially given Os' expertise in this area.",
    "The course was designed in a way that discussions among students themselves and with the instructor provided better understanding where any confusion would raise. I appreciated the overall teaching and aspects of this course.",
    "(1) Technical support for running programs (especially Circuitscape) and (2) more connection between lectures and project work.",
    "The assignments didn't quite mesh with the lecture. The first assignment was too time consuming, but the instructor is already aware of this and there is already a plan for how to handle it differently next time the course is taught.",
    "A few more structured \"Q&A\"\/help sessions in the CSSSI stat lab with access to the computer programs would be good. We ended up having a few ad-hoc technical help sessions with Anne Trainor, but having more formal, structured time where we could get help with the computer programs (GIS, MaxEnt, Circuitscape) while we were actually running the programs would be helpful."

That being said, Os is an excellent lecturer and I don't care that the lectures weren't perfectly integrated with the course work - they stood alone and were valuable for my overall view of conservation.The assignment to read about the puma and deer issue in S. America, with the follow-up discussion in which it was conveyed to us that data isn't always great but it's still useful, etc., was perfectly done. More of that type of synthesis would have improved the course.",

    "Advantages - it was useful to have people with different skills in my group. For example, several people were familiar with ArcGIS, and worked on creating maps, while others in the group worked on writing.Disadvantages - I think smaller groups would have been more effective (4 people instead of 5?)",
    "4 of 5 group members were great. One did almost literally nothing and it was a huge drain on our group since we ended up doing his work for him in addition to our own work. In future, I would cap the group size at 3 people - this seems like a functional size that doesn't allow for deadweights of this type.",
    "At the beginning of the course, it seemed like forming a group of students with differing skills would be beneficial throughout the course. However, since analysis was carried out in groups, but each student had to write up their own assignment, a couple of group members who had more quantitative skills often had to spend much more time carrying out the analyses, explaining the process and trying to teach other group members, while still having to write up their own assignments.",
    "My group was not very good at GIS, and so we had many difficulties at achieving remarkable results, as the other groups did. It was somewhat disappointing to compare those results and realize that there was so much which could have been improved, and most importantly, so many GIS tools that would have been interesting to learn how to use.",
    "This course would be impossible without group work. Our group was lucky in that we were well-balanced in terms of skills, and we had a really strong GIS person on our team. For me, the group work was overwhelmingly positive, but I think this balance and the presence of a GIS superstar were key to this good experience. While we did our best to help the GIS guru and take on any other roles we could, I also think we all felt that the burden of our project might have fallen a bit too heavily on our GIS guru, in terms of resolving and troubleshooting confusing issues - again, passing on some of the general guidelines and protocols groups developed might easily resolve this, and cut down the time spent trying to figure this software out.",
    "The team aspect was great, having people to collaborate with and bounce ideas off is invaluable for the workshops we did",
    "Disadvantage - trying to schedule five people is nearly impossible, giving the demands of other classes\/assistantships\/SIGs\/events. Maybe try four people in a group.Advantage - having people you were committed to working with allowed for us to divide up the work (as much as that was possible) and discuss problems with each other.",
    "Advantages: the analyses can be split up, more species covered, more ideas, etc.Disadvantages: with our group, the advantages didn't really play out as they ideally should. A couple of people in my group didn't have the GIS skills to help out with the data processing (which took a TON of time). They could have easily learned these skills over the term (I did), while they chose not to. A few of us ended up doing multiple species anyways, so we didn't need to have 5 people. Keeping everyone up to speed on a complex analytical project such as this was a challenge (in a bad way), and I was not happy with our final product, which was unrefined as a result of some of my group not doing their part until the very end (last day). They were unprepared for the level of analysis we were doing and didn't treat the project as seriously as it deserved. I'd ask to enforce the prerequisites, but I didn't have them all (GIS) and I still feel like I contributed a lot to my group, so who knows what to do...?I think the group work with half of my group could have been incredible, with a product I would be proud to show off. In reality, I enjoyed the individual work and was very frustrated by the group component (with part of my group), and am not very proud of our product (it's still super rough and not presented in the best way).",
    "The group works were designed to use additional skills and knowledge borrowed from other disciplines such as GIS and Statistics. And group works were composed of students from these different backgrounds which allowed them to learn from each throughout the semester, while working on their respective species conservation projects.",
    "It was, at times, difficult to work in a group with many levels of GIS experience; I think I learned less because some of my teammates took over all of the GIS related work. That said, the group aspect of the course allowed us to accomplish much bigger projects, which was rewarding and meaningful.",
    "The group work was great. This project could not have been completed without working in a group, or it at least would have been very hard and frustrating and the product would not have been as good. I really learned a lot from my team mates, so that was a great way to learn outside of the lectures. The only change I would make would be to maybe have the groups be a bit smaller-- 4 people would have perhaps been ideal, a bit easier to manage than 5."

   "comments": [
    "Make sure you are at least taking GIS or somewhat familiar with it. Also, know that it is a modeling course and you spend a lot of time in the computer lab. Try to create groups that have at least one GIS expert if not two. Try to get in and do your models on the computers early!",
    "Take it. It will kick your ass, but you will appreciate it. This is one of the rare classes at this school where you will actually learn something AND have the opportunity to apply it. If you are interested in species conservation, whether as a biologist, conservationist or policy expert, you should take this class. Pick your group carefully, get organized quickly, and be prepared to work.",
    "Be prepared to put in a lot of time on the assignments. It helps to have raster GIS experience as well.",
    "Definitely take it! But clear your schedule for it and use GIS as much as you can beforehand.",
    "Take it! But be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Sign up and download the material, skip all lectures.",
    "Make sure that the grouping of students is not aleatory, but rather based on the skills of all the members.",
    "Be prepared for a very large time commitment (i.e., chose your other courses and your extracurricular activities accordingly).",
    "If you are interested in doing meaningful conservation, as influenced by science or creating policy relevant science you must take this course",
    "They should definitely take this class",
    "It is a crazy amount of work, but the course will give you a number of skills you won't gain from other courses. Previous or concurrent enrollment in the GIS raster course is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.",
    "This course totally changed how I think about conservation. I had always thought about things on a local level before. Now I see how interconnected conservation efforts need to be, and how we're \"painting ourselves into a corner\" by not thinking on a dynamic landscape level. I've had many people say this to me over the years, but Os made a stronger case AND by having us do our own analysis (future SDMs) I was able to see with my own eyes the effects a changing climate will have on my species of interest, and how we need to start thinking way bigger about this stuff. Getting the chance to do our own analysis was an incredibly empowering opportunity, and I feel that this is truly one of the most useful classes I've ever taken. I think Os has the pedagogy nailed on this stuff. Thanks!",
    "I would encourage them to take the class, whatever specializations they are in as this class is useful for both students in Environment and Forestry options.",
    "Make sure you are competent in GIS and\/or are willing to put in a lot of time working through sticky spots.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone interested in conservation. The workshops\/final project will be frustrating and hard, but it is all worth it when you see how much you learn at the end. Do not, under any circumstances, procrastinate with the final project. Leave yourself as much time as possible to analyze your results\/findings, put the report together, and make sure it is polished, since that always takes longer than you think."
