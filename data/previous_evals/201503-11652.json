    "Incredibly illuminating. Taking a course like this reminds you why the classics form the foundation of our intellectual endeavors. Studying them shows how humans have been grappling with the same challenges for thousands of years. This course gives you strong examples in moral leadership and case studies in statecraft.",
    "Athenian Imperial Democracy was the best course I've taken at Yale: the course material was fascinating, the professor was insightful and engaging, and it inspired me to want to spend more time exploring Thucydides. The course explores the time period between the Persian War and the Peloponnesian War in understanding 1) how the Athenian empire rose in power to challenge Sparta and 2) whether, as Thucydides writes, that growth of Athenian power and ensuing Spartan fear made the Peloponnesian War inevitable. At the beginning of the course, I was a little tentative in how I'd fit in with the seminar, but Professor Kagan does an incredible job in promoting and facilitating discussions, while also adding his own perspectives. Each class is based on the papers of 4 students who are assigned topics to write ~5 pages about for that week; each student ends up writing two of these papers during the semester. Those serve as the starting points for the discussion, which turned out to be an effective format. In class, Professor Kagan challenges you to explore and defend ideas about your assigned topic, but in a compassionate way where you never feel uncomfortable. There was also a final exam, which consisted of identifying sources and writing an essay on one of the overarching themes in the class - I thought it was fairly reasonable. The course was really a wonderful opportunity to read Thucydides closely and draw parallels between the issues and ideas of the Greeks to modern challenges we face today. Through the discussions, Professor Kagan provided us with many profound insights - not just about Thucydides or history, but about life and society more broadly. If Professor Kagan is teaching his Peloponnesian War seminar next year, do whatever it takes to get in! I'd recommend talking to Professor Kagan after the first class and then sending him an email - that's what I did.",
    "Kagan is without a doubt one of the best professors at Yale. He doesn't hesitate to challenge unsubstantiated or poorly thought out points during discussion. This led to one of the most interesting seminars I've taken. Any class that he teaches is worth taking.",
    "Loved it. Hist 288J is rigorous look at the West's first democracy. Course meetings were engaging and mostly took the form of debates.",
    "A fantastic class on a very interesting subject that is surprisingly relatable. Kagan is terrific, and the workload is not ridiculous. Great class discussion.",
    "Absolutely take the class! Kagan is a legend. You'll learn a lot, especially about modern history. The professor loves making analogies and parallels between the Greeks and recent historical events, particularly the Cold War, WWI, & WWII. At times, Kagan's class felt like \"A Study of the 20th century as seen through Ancient Greek History.\"",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Or any seminar taught by Kagan, for that matter. IT WILL BE THE BEST DECISION IN YOUR YALE CAREER. Ok sorry for the excessive all caps, but we just finished finals and I'm delirious and I still think this course is amazing. Kagan will push you to understand not only Athenian history, but the mechanisms that govern human interactions even today. This course could not be more relevant to international relations today - you'd be surprised what these old dead Greeks can teach you. More importantly, what KAGAN can teach you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The class really made me consider where historians gather their primary sources from and how to interpret them. Kagan led great discussions - seamlessly linking what we were discussing in class to greater questions about foreign policy and history more generally. The hype is not overrated.",
    "It is course that looks at ancient Greek history (wars, politics, diplomacy) in the fifty years leading up to the Peloponnesian War. In a usual week Professor Kagan assigns four reports to four different students based on a specific event or question. Those students then answer questions in class and the rest of the students discuss questions related to the topics as well. I certainly recommend the course. Kagan has a great mind for historical investigation and argument. He also has a very insightful understanding of Western history as a whole. There is much to learn about politics and strategy from the ancient Greeks, but even if you are not interested in those subjects, the course also sharpens your critical thinking skills. I'm sure there are people out there wouldn't enjoy this course, but for most people, I don't think they would regret taking this course."
