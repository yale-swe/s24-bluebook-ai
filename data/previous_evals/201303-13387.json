   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Spanish 746 to fellow students. It provided a very thorough introduction to the four poets and connected them to larger social and literary trends of the era (in and beyond Spain).",
    "I would say that it is a course that focuses on four central Spanish poets on the track from romanticism to modernism and on the themes that they have in common or the way that they show a development in Spanish literature. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "In this course you will study read, talk, and breath poetry. It was a wonderful experience to learn more about the poetry of Rosalia de Castro, Becquer, Machado, and Juan Ramon Jimenez, in connection with the poetic movements of their time. The readings are very appropriate and not overwhelming, and the material is taught in a clear and organized way. I would definitively recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the aforementioned poets in connection to their time and the evolution of poetic and literary movements.",
    "If you'd like to take a course that will help you improve your reading of poetry, then take this course.I would certainly recommend Span 746 to another student. The course is challenging, the material is fascinating, and Professor Valis is an excellent teacher.",
    "I would take this course if you were interested in Spanish poetry and understanding each of the authors at a deeper level. As an undergrad I was missing a strong background on many of the related authors of the time period but found my graduate classmates comments very insightful.",
    "A survey of 19th and early 20th century Spanish poetry focusing on four canonic poets. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Excellent approach to some of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century poetry issues in relation to the crisis of representability and the evolution of poetical language. Definitely recommendable."

   "comments": [
    "Although I do not plan to specialize in this field, I think that this course will be very helpful in preparing for doctoral exams, and it allowed me to gain a more thorough knowledge of a field that I would otherwise know very little about.",
    "This course helped me to develop a better understanding of 19th and early 20th Spanish poetry, especially the poetry of Becquer, Rosal\u00c3\u00ada de Castro, Antonio Machado, and Juan Ram\u00c3\u00b3n Jim\u00c3\u00a9nez. Moreover, through this course I believe I learned some of what it takes to read poetry closely. I believe this will serve me well in my future research."
