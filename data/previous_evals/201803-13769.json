    "An overview of the health system in the U.S. including insurance markets and how hospitals and physicians operate. Also learned to always think about how policy incentivizes different parties and why the U.S. health care industry is so distorted.",
    "I learned a lot about the architecture of the US healthcare system and I feel much more qualified to understand discussions about insurance and health policy.",
    "Past evaluations are all correct-- you learn a scary amount of information that you somehow have to internalize and memorize for the midterm and final. Nevertheless, the material is both interesting and incredibly useful outside of class. Its probably been my favorite in terms of material thus far. Still, there's a lot of material and you really do need to go to lecture to hear what the professor does not put on slides.",
    "I developed much more comprehensive understanding of healthcare and its issues. From its major stakeholders to the public policy around it, healthcare was the main topic of this course.",
    "Information about how our health system works, what are its problems, the economic principles related to healthcare",
    "Basic intro the the healthcare sector, all the various stakeholders, key legislation, basic economics",
    "I developed and gained a nuanced understanding of the US healthcare system. I am glad that I took this course because I feel empowered as a citizen of the US--knowledge is power and I know that when I am no longer eligible to be on my parents' plan and need to buy my own, I will know about what options are best for me.",
    "Youll learn about healthcare economics with an emphasis on the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid.",
    "I learned about the American healthcare system--its various components, the challenges it faces, the reasons why it is so expensive and is becoming more expensive every day, and why healthcare reform is so challenging and yet so important. The class will teach you about insurance, the safety net, and much more and is very useful for understanding the latest policy debates.",
    "I learned about the organization of our healthcare system and the economics of health care and health insurance.",
    "A much more nuanced understanding of how hc works in the US.",
    "I gained a great understanding of the US healthcare system as well as general healthcare related economic concepts.",
    "A much broader understanding of the health care system in the US.",
    "I learned a lot about health policy and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. I came in knowing nothing and learned a great deal amount of information.",
    "Lots of knowledge about the US healthcare system. Very helpful and interesting for anyone interested in health care policy, biotechnology, or medicine.",
    "I learned a lot about the policies behind modern healthcare and the reasons behind them and the complications they may have caused.",
    "I learned about the state of our healthcare system",
    "I cannot stress how much you learn by taking this course. I knew next to nothing about the American health care system before starting the course, and this course covers a wide variety of issues that are always in the news. It leaves you with a very broad and in-depth understanding of the health care system.",
    "Overview course of the US healthcare system. We touched on basic vocabulary like deductibles, co-pay, co-insure at first. Then discussed Medicare and Medicare in detail.",

    "You learn about the healthcare industry and information you should really know for life.",
    "I learned about healthcare and how healthcare works in the United States",
    "Understanding of the US healthcare system and its problems.",
    "I learned about all the issues in the US healthcare system. Class was definitely much more a political science\/history kinda class, rather than a Econ class about health care. I learned about issues of access, quality, and affordability of care; and the changing landscape that impacts these challenges.",
    "Good survey of Healthcare in the US",
    "This class was incredibly helpful in giving me an overview to the United States health care system and the economic principles that are intrinsic to this system.",
    "Learned a lot about the US healthcare system",
    "Almost nothing to be honest. I got an overview of what the current health policies are like, but nothing too deep. They throw out terminologies without explanation, like a bunch of acronyms and make you go wtf as you review for the tests.",

    "Overview of health insurance, market failures, pharmaceutical industry, and physician labor markets",
    "You learn about the governmental healthcare system and its interaction with the private market such as prescription drugs and private plans.",

   "comments": [
    "It was really tough to learn the material. The curriculum is what the professor speaks, not what's on his slides, but it's tough to keep track of everything he says during the 1 hour 15 minute class sessions. Important concepts are presented very quickly because there's a lot of material to cover, but it makes it hard to follow the rest of a lecture when the most foundational concept was not clear. The exams also include stuff that was very briefly touched on, which incentivizes students to focus on memorizing really nitty-gritty details when studying instead of understanding how the system actually works. Guest speakers were really interesting!",
    "Professor Forman was definitely a strength of the class. I loved hearing his perspective on these issues and he generally did a really good job of taking complex healthcare issues and making them interesting\/understandable through anecdotes from his extensive experience in healthcare.",
    "I consistently felt like the TAs didn't care about the course, which was discouraging. But, the professor was great! He's been teaching this class for a long time, and he also has experience in both the policy and the delivery side of health care, which is nice. He is very approachable and can answer almost any question you throw at him. The last few lectures could be left off to give more time for Medicaid\/Medicare\/Insurance (what seems to be the more important lectures). In general though, this class was amazing!",
    "One strength is the clarity of the lectures\/notes, because it really distilled a lot of the complex jargon to more understandable terms. Also, I really appreciated the various guest lectures and getting more perspectives on this subject. At times, the course felt less structured due to the lack of homework assignments, but there was an impetus to study more independently.",
    "The amount of information was rather overwhelming and the class can be boring at times. However, overall, it's a very interesting class.",
    "Class was great, my only criticism is that the guest lectures were often kind of disappointing. It seemed like in many cases the lecturers werent really primed in what they should be talking about, or what they said was simply irrelevant",
    "I loved the guest lecturers, who all gave different perspectives about different facets of the health care market. We heard from a great mix of speakers, from a former director of the CMS to the CEO of Aledade to the CEO of Yale New Haven Hospital. I also enjoyed Howie's lectures, too. He is so knowledgable about the health care industry that it is both shocking and inspiring.",
    "Strengths: Super interesting material, not a lot of reading, exams arent that hard. Weaknesses: Curve can be brutal because exams arent that hard, Professor can be dull if you dont force yourself to pay full attention.",
    "The course moved a little slowly at the start, which forced us to rush at the end. The guest lecturers overwhelmingly brought insight to the course and the discussions we were having. Professor Forman has a good sense of humor; however, he sometimes rushes through the slides too quickly. Also, some effort should be made to give feedback on essays before they're turned in.",
    "Slides were hard to follow, Professor spoke very fast, and I often struggled to understand information because Professor would mention concepts or acronyms without explaining what they were\/what they meant. However, the TFs were very helpful and I found the class very interesting and helpful.",
    "The course was incredible and it covers extremely important material. If anything, I think that more sections (which were optional anyway) would be useful.",
    "It covered interesting material. I think at times it covered too many topics superficially and would have preferred to cover less overall material but in greater depth.",
    "The lectures could be more planned out so that we get to all of the material before the end of class.",
    "The guest speakers are good for the most part.",
    "Strengths: very interesting, very applicable knowledge that will be useful later in life Weaknesses: SO MUCH MATERIAL. lectures were incredibly stressful as we would go through so much material with no time to process information",
    "Loved the multiple guest speakers we got. Always interesting people in very different parts of the health care world.",
    "Way too much information thrown at you.",
    "Gives a very strong overview of the US health care and health insurance systems. Information included is all very relevant, but could be organized in a better way (e.g. the lecture on what exactly the ACA did and the proceedings through Congress\/SCOTUS was the very last lecture when it should have been one of the first). Taking maybe one lecture at the beginning of the course to ensure that students all understand the basics of what health insurance is, what the ACA did about it, etc. could help set up the course for better understanding. Slides are sometimes difficult to understand or it is difficult to grasp what the relevant details are and what is extraneous.",
    "the course provides a good, broad foundation for how our healthcare system is structured and what exactly is so wrong with it. the workload is reasonable, and the final paper was short and very flexible, allowing me to write on a topic that was most interesting to me. The grading for the homework assignments can sometimes be very nitpicky, but they allow students to go more in-depth into a few key concepts presented in the class. The lectures can be a hot mess sometimes -- they often stray pretty far from the slides, which is both a good thing and a bad thing - it's pretty frustrating at first, but then you can focus more on what Prof. Forman is saying, and how his examples\/anecdotes illustrate the concepts in the class. The TA sessions, though optional, provided a useful second perspective on the course content to enhance my understanding.",
    "Great lectures",
    "The course itself was fantastic. The only thing that I think could be improved is adding a practice test before the midterm. But I thought the questions on tests were very fair and I wasn't surprised by them.",
    "S: knowledgable professor and very important topic in future careers\/adulthood W: no significant homework to provide review",
    "strengths -- the breadth and depth of material covered weakness -- lecture style could be improved by a brief recap at the very beginning of lecture, especially when we have guest lectures in between the regular programming",
    "Strengths are that Howie is truly and expert and brilliant. Weaknesses are that the TAs are not helpful at all.",
    "I really liked the content about healthcare but it would have been good for some more economic background to have been provided where relevant. I think it also would have been interesting to discuss current events more and maybe to move the ACA lecture earlier. This would have made it easier to understand some of the guest lectures.",
    "Very interesting guest speakers, really enjoyed professor Forman's lecturing too. However, class wasn't paced very well.",
    "Terrible grading, TFs grade like asses. Lectures dry as hell. Howie is a good guy and he definitely means well. That being said, he is not a talented lecturer. He will tell you the first day people complain about his monotone voice, and to take it at face value. I thought it wasn't that bad and id be able to handle it. Trust me I was wrong, I could barely bare to sit through a single lecture within 2 weeks into the course.",
    "Lectures were wayyyy too fast. Great guest speakers.",
    "Great professor and very interesting but lacks a lot of structure.",
    "I think this course was overall very good and I cannot think of particular weaknesses associated with it.",
    "Strength: comprehensive. very low-stress. Weakness: disorganized. Please be more selective with the information you want to relay. If it's irrelevant don't include it in the slides.",
    "Strengths: Professor Forman was an effective lecturer who teaches at a good pace Weaknesses: Would be nice to have more guidance from the teaching fellows for the final paper and homework assignments",
    "It is detailed into healthcare, but there is little to no economics. The class is very good if you keep it within those limitations.",
    "The lectures are not super engaging, but the final paper was super interesting and rewarding.",
    "Professor was a good lecturer but the lecture slides are poorly structured. The PowerPoints have many slides with confusing graphs that we didn't need to memorize. Some content in the PowerPoints were also not covered in class which made it difficult to study for the final.",
    "Although the readings in this class were interesting and a bunch of interesting topics were covered, I sometimes found the lectures to be a bit dry \/ dense.",
    "For one, I would have loved to have TA led sections that were still optional (but structured), so you did not go only to have questions answered or listen to other students questions \/ answers. Secondly, I would have appreciated better transparency for grading.",
    "The course is useful in that it simply covers a lot of relevant information about the US healthcare system. I have two main suggestions. Firstly, the course could be better structured, as sometimes there were different definitions of terms or concepts between, say, TF office hours, slides, and what was said in lecture. Secondly, this class could include more theoretical health economics concepts. The level of theory in this class was fairly low and taught slowly, for instance we spent almost an entire lecture talking about elasticities in a fairly simple way. Given that introductory microeconomics is a prerequisite for this class, perhaps those can be taught with more depth.",
    "The course is structured well but could have been organized better in terms of which days we learn what on."

    "Only if you have a strong, strong interest in U.S. health markets and policy",
    "Yes definitely take it. The information feels very practical and interesting",
    "I would recommend this class to another student! To me, the material is interesting enough for the depth\/amount to be worth it. But you do need to make sure you don't get behind because again, the amount of information you need to know on the exams is terrifying.",
    "If you are at all interested in healthcare, I would definitely recommend this course. Prof. Forman is a great lecturer and very forthcoming in his views and also other perspectives on the subject of healthcare. Surprisingly, I found it to be a very unbiased\/objective explanation of these topics. It was super interesting to read some of the literature and learn more about healthcare.",
    "Yes! Every American should take this class so they can be made aware of how our healthcare system works.",
    "Definitely! You dont need an econ background either, I had never taken an econ class before and was still able to understand everything.",
    "Yes! Take this course and empower yourself as an informed citizen who will inevitably interact with the heath care industry in some way. Also, given that health care is 18% of the US GDP, you should make an effort to learn about it! The market is so broken, and everyone complains about it, but how is it broken? Who is to blame? How can we fix it? Answers to questions you will discover by taking this course.",
    "Yes, take this class. It isnt that much work and the material is super interesting. Make sure you sit and the front and attend all of the TA sections so you know whats going on at all times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to understand the U.S. healthcare system. However, the exams require a lot of memorization and it's not a class that you can skip lectures and still really know the material.",
    "Yes--very helpful information to know.",
    "Yes, for a better understanding of how healthcare works in the US",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as they are willing to put in the work (it covers a ton of material).",
    "Yes, I thought it was interesting material and will be helpful to know for anyone in the U.S. trying to navigate the healthcare system. It is particularly helpful for someone interested in healthcare because the course did a good job of making students comfortable with many health care terms.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in anything about health policy you should take this course.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, but only if you are truly interested in healthcare. Otherwise you will be bored and stressed from memorizing so much material",
    "Yes if you are interested in learning about healthcare",
    "Definitely. This is a great course to take to make sense of complex issues in health care. Very rewarding course and great access to interesting guest speakers. Not too much work, and Prof. Forman is a great lecturer.",
    "No, boring and hard. Way too much work.",
    "Take it. This course really helps you understand exactly how the US healthcare system works. Several guest speakers every semester who help to supplement the lecture material.",
    "yes! you'll need to get used to his somewhat disorganized lecturing style, but you'll learn a lot. make sure you go to lectures!!! it is very difficult to make up lectures even with a friend's notes",
    "Absolutely, if you're interested in the topic at all",
    "Yes, especially if you're going into medicine. This course opened my eyes to all the issues we need to solve in healthcare and why it's so difficult to solve them. It was both depressing and invigorating.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to those who are particularly interested in health policy and US economic systems.",
    "Yes - if you want to learn about the American healthcare system and the incentives of stakeholders within it, take this course. Workload is relatively light, as long as you come to class and actually pay attention during lectures.",
    "Yes! I would recommend for both Econ and non Econ majors",
    "Yeah - it helped me understand healthcare better",
    "was well organized to understand the entire health care system, not just ACA\/recent laws Prof Forman can seem totally disinterested in meeting w students outside of class, but is engaging in class Outside speakers are great TAs were very helpful and kind!",
    "Yes, I learned a lot. As an econ major, I don't interact much with the healthcare system. However, I learned that health care expenditure is fundamentally tied to the economic well-being of our country.",
    "If you're interested in health care yeah! but this is not a gut. Very low work load, but very very hard to do well. Grading is super arbitrary, and depends on nitty gritty details you have to memorize. A whole lot of content to study for the exams, and grading very poorly reflects how well you know the material. If youre interested in it take it, but be prepared to cram and grind for the midterms. Also watch out the grading is tough.",
    "Not that much work but its kind of difficult to get an A. Good lecture but goes really fast - download the powerpoints and mark off the ones he skips because he tests figures from the slides. Its kind of hard to do well without a lot of effort because all the frat\/srat people have years of notes, and the course doesnt really change from year to year (aside from numbers). Would recommend as a 5th class taken Cred\/D or if you need it another Econ elective.",
    "I would if they are interested in healthcare. It is much less of an Econ class than a general history class about healthcare.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The workload was manageable, lectures interesting, and guest speakers fascinating. Plus, I think this is an important topic for all people to be informed about as the healthcare system will affect everyone's lives in some way.",
    "Yea definitely!",
    "No you'll be bored out of your mind. Essay questions are not hard but you don't know how to study for it.",
    "Yes this course really gave a strong background for anyone looking to work in the health field",
    "Yes, this is a very valuable course that will inform you about important healthcare policy issues that are currently being debated",
    "Yes, but expect grading to be harsh and everyone to have high grades on tests. Not an easy class for grades. Very good info though, and relates to topics I wouldn't look up willingly.",
    "No. I didnt really gain that much practical knowledge, and at the end of the day, the thesis of the course felt pretty intuitive: policy solutions must be bipartisan, and health economics are complicated.",
    "This is a great course to audit if you want to understand more about the US healthcare system. I learned a lot about the different pipelines for healthcare delivery, however, be prepared to take good notes alongside lecture slides to keep up.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class a student looking for an interesting economics elective that is applicable and useful for the \"real world\".",
    "Yes, if you would like very detailed knowledge of the intracacies of how healthcare and insurance systems function.",
    "Yes, I would. This is an excellent course, it is very well structured and the professor is great at helping students understand the material regardless of their level of knowledge in the topic.",
    "If you are interested in the US healthcare system, yes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Take this course if you are interested at all in health policy. Professor Forman is engaging and extremely knowledgeable on the subject. You will learn all the basics of health finance.",
    "I think it is important to take to learn about American healthcare."
