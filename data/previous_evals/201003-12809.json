    "Yes. Learn to use computer programs.Have an art class with a lot of freedom to pursue concepts\/media of your choice.",
    "It was an overall interesting course.If you're expecting to learn how to use a tablet or really learn how to use Adobe Photoshop, After Effects... then this may not be the class. You learn a little bit about each, but it's hard to retain all the information.A very open-ended experimental class.Most of the work is done outside of class and then discussed in class.It seems to be very good for if you're already working on a lot of things and would enjoy some good outside feedback.",
    "I would recommend digital drawing to anyone interested in working with adobe editing programs. It's a pretty self-directed class, so people from lots of different backgrounds could benefit from taking it."
