    "Rev. Kris is a very experienced Episcopal priest and pastoral counsellor. Her small group sessions were well organized, thorough and didactic. Each of the students were given equal opportunity to participate and give feedback. Rev. Kris conducted the practicums in a very gracious and dynamic style. The group chemistry grew every week and each of us always walked out with practical learnings and deep insights. Rev. Kris had an excellent teaching style particularly in explaining areas in need of additional work or showing alternative approaches to the cases discussed. An area of potential improvement would be for the group leader to also be more deliberate and specific in pointing out the strengths of the student and what was done well. Sometimes it felt as if the good points of the individual's work were understood by the student but this was not always the case. So balancing the learning points with what was done well would make an already excellent practicum work into an even more outstanding experience.",
    "Lewis was very pastoral to the group and offered valuable comments."
