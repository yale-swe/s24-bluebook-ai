   "comments": [
    "I would recommend SPAN 120 to a student who was interested in pursuing a language. It is a very structured class and makes learning very easy. It is a good amount of work, but if you put a little work in each night, you will do absolutely fine. It would be helpful to know most of the basic Spanish grammar before enrolling in this course because material is covered relatively fast though. Before all of the quizzes and tests, the instructors send out an email about all of the topics that will be covered, so there's not any surprises on tests.",
    "SPAN 120 01 is an interesting and engaging level 2 Spanish class. You learn almost every grammar structure as well as a lot of useful vocabulary and information about Spanish culture and history. The work load is reasonable and the course is so well organized that you are rarely confused about hw assignments or exams.",
    "I would recommend the class. Even though it's a lot of work, it's the best way to learn a language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students who want to have some basic knowledge of Spanish. The class has a lot of work because there are many tests and exams but it is all worth it in the end. The professors are great and the material interesting.",
    "Span 120 01 was a bit hard and a lot of work in the beginning, but is spaces out in the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because you learn a lot and the class is fun."
