    "This class is very enjoyable and will certainly improve your Hebrew. The material covered is much more interesting that the average L3 Yale language course (we often covered very meaningful poems and songs).",
    "Yes. It is a lot of fun, a very interesting language, and a great department.",
    "Take this class!! If you have taken Hebrew through L2, don't stop now. Chances are you have to take this class for Distribution requirements if you are looking at it, but either way it is a fun and informative class. he strengths are that Ayala is an amazing teacher who responds to the needs of individual students with kindness and understanding. Additionally, the class requires a great deal of writing and speaking, which really helped me get better at Hebrew. Lastly, the great thing about the class is that you finally have enough grammar to read interesting poems, stories, and articles, greatly adding to enjoyment of the language.",
    "Modern Hebrew 130 01 is a solid course. Continuing on the strong foundation of Hebrew 110 and 120, it builds students ability to speak, read, and write Hebrew. Prof. Dvoretzky has been teaching for a long time and seems to know what she is doing. She is comfortable explaining the nuances of the language to her students and also willing to engage with a and learn from students, which is great to see from a professor of her expertise. She does occasionally assign overwhelming amounts of homework. Still, I think I learned a lot from the course.",
    "In 130, you learn the rest of the past and future tenses in the active structures. At the same time, you do a lot of interesting stories, songs, and poems, rather than just going through the book methodically. However, there is little emphasis on vocab this semester. Ayala is very nice and tries hard to structure the class to interest the students in it this year."
