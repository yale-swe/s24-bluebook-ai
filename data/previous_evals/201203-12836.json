   "comments": [
    "L3 Spanish was WAY better than L2. A lot of the material is review from what you have already learned. Daily classes sucked.",
    "Review, doesn't teach anything new from L1 and L2.",
    "I would recommend it, it's a good class to improve your Spanish.",
    "Less intense than L2. Tanya is really helpful.",
    "A good review of L2 after a summer of having forgotten pretty much everything--with built in additional grammar. A lot more movies, games and short story reading. Would definitely recommend going for L3 if you are wavering between L2 and L3--in L2 everything is much more basic and dry.",
    "pretty chill. lots of review of L1 and L2. take it with Tanya for sure, shes really chill and a good teacher.",
    "This is a good class - especially if you take it with Tanya.",
    "A very solid spanish class. A little high school-like in that there is homework due every day, but that's just languages at Yale. You work consistently through a textbook, so the work is predictable. If you commit to speaking spanish 100% of the time in class you can really maximize your comfort with speaking the language, otherwise you can skate by, only answering direct questions in spanish. If you're finishing out your language requirement, you really dont have any choice but to take this class. Fortunately, its a pretty good one, so don't fret. Do your homework (it's like 5 min a night) and you should be just dandy.",
    "It was good! Tanya is very sweet. When she cannot answer your question or does not understand, she will look it up after class and email you or talk about it the next day, which is great. She is Spanish, so if you have a preference about which accent you'd like to pick up, that's something that might make her better or worse for you. Really great though.",
    "General overview of L1 and L2 Spanish."
