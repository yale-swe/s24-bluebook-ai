    "This course is aimed at equipping students with the knowledge needed to tackle basic problems of diffusion and chemical reaction. The first half of the semester covers a few interesting experimental techniques and the math behind them. In the second half of the semester, we basically learn one equation and what we can do with it. It's hard to see the immediate relevance of this course because everything we learn seems to be very specific to a research problem.",
    "I learned how to evaluate the transportation of biomaterials within the body, with and without a reaction present. I also learned how to apply various differential equations to describe different scenarios.",

    "I found an application for differential equations in biology. It was really fun when, during my final project for another class, a grad student referenced many of the equations and problems we had been working on in class.",
    "I learned how to solve biotransport and kinetic-related problems. The topics covered in this class were very useful to pre-med students, as the first half of the class focused on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Overall, I think this was a very valuable course."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Saltzman and the TF's are extremely good at explaining the course material as it gets more difficult. This made class and section quite enjoyable. However, the course's greatest strength is that it is very intellectually stimulating. Figuring out how to solve the problems we pose in class is really fascinating... so long as you're not trying to do it in 20 mins on an exam, where the derivations and solution can be so long that it would take you 20 mins just to write everything down if you were copying it from somewhere else. The course makes little attempt to connect what we learn to broader questions in bioengineering, even though you get the sense that what we learn is the foundation for big fields like drug design and physiological modeling. It would be nice to see more specific examples of the uses of the theory we develop. The second half of the course gets to be fairly redundant because we basically use one equation to solve a variety of biotransport problems, but they remain fairly interesting.",
    "Lecture material and homework material were a bit disjoint at times and sometimes the homework was posted a few days before it was due.",
    "I really enjoyed the material, especially when we evaluated problems related to real life applications, and I thought Saltzman was an engaging and exciting professor. The only recommendations I have are to do less proofs during the class time and do more practice problems so that class could be more engaging. Or move the class to a later time. It was often hard to stay awake and engaged at 9 AM, especially when working through somewhat tedious proofs.",
    "It felt like we spent a lot of time on the algebra of how to solve problems, could have focused more on the concepts and setting up problems.",

    "The class has very challenging material. However, one of the problems that I had with the course was that in order to understand and complete the PSETs, many times you would have to go to the TA sessions. I believe that the TA sessions aren't really for mastering previous material, but simply trying to understand what a PSET problem is saying. The class could be greatly improved by making the PSETs understandable and comprehensible. The questions aren't just difficult to understand, they usually require tricks that have not been shown before. Furthermore, the material could be better framed in terms of relevance-- it seems difficult to contextualize so many of the equations that we learn. This is not to say that this is a bad class. It is difficult, but Professor Saltzman is a great professor. He is readily available and is willing to discuss difficult areas. With a few fixes, this class could be great.",
    "I think this course is structured really nicely. A definite strength was the way office hours\/section was set up. I don't think I've ever had a more useful section than Becky's. A weakness may be that we really only get to see every problem once in class when we derive them. However, that is common of many STEM classes and is a fairly small issue. Also, a lot of the questions on psets I thought I struggled just because of the wording. I often had to go to section just to understand what the problems wanted as opposed to learning how to do the actual math. I think that's the only thing I struggled with in term of the structure of the course.",
    "The course had two very dedicated TAs. They were always willing to give guidance. Also, Professor Saltzman posted his notes online, which was very useful in following the class.",
    "The way the class is organized is bad. Don't put stuff on the Wednesday pset that you teach on Monday. How are we supposed to plan ahead. Either push the pset due date back or teach the material in the last week's class. Also, spread out the sections so that it's not right before the pset is due when everyone's scrambling to get it done. Please give us review problems that will actually help us on the exams. Sometimes they distracted us from studying what was actually important, and they were also overly complicated such that we couldn't do them without a TA's help. I wish this class was formatted like Signals and Images where the tests are open notes and the time limit was more flexible. Those tests were challenging and still tested our knowledge. Saltzman's estimate of how long the exam takes is also wildly off. We're always working until the last minute and it's a surprise to him. Please have realistic expectations of students. We're only reviewing your notes and psets. Give us wacky problems on psets to expand our knowledge but not on the exams. We're all trying to balance this class with many of the other activities we do at Yale."

    "This is a fairly fun class! The problems we solve in class are really interesting, if not relevant to everyone's research interests.",
    "This is a required class for BME majors, and I don't think I would recommend it to a non-major, just because of how specific the material is to biomedical engineering. But I did really enjoy the class and the material, and thought Professor Saltzman was a very engaging and kind professor.",
    "It's an ok class, you have to take it if you're BME, but if you're not interested in the topic, it's hard to sit through.",

    "BENG 351 is a required course for BME majors and I honestly think it is a good, solid class. I found it hard, but also fair. I could never complain about the way it was being taught and also never felt completely overwhelmed. It was just one of those classes where I worked hard, tried to learn the material, took difficult exams, and knew that my grade wasn't going to come easily but was never upset by that. Saltzman doesn't usually teach this course, but I thought he did a great job picking it up after a few years off. It was also interesting to see differential equations become very applicable in biology. (PSA this class is a lot of simplifying and solving differential equations, but nothing nearly as hard as ENAS 194). Class format was weekly psets some longer than others, a midterm exam, and a final. Katherine Miller-Jensen usually did a midterm project, but our class did not. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who's interested in kind of the basics of thermo and transport.",
    "If you are a BME major, you have to take it. However, I would highly recommend this class to pre-med students wanting to learn about kinetics in depth.",
    "Straightforward course with some interesting material, although it moved very slowly, especially in the second half. Would recommend."
