   "comments": [
    "This course was one of the worst courses I have taken in the MCDB department (although they have all been pretty bad). I would NOT recommend this course to an underclassman friend (in fact I have told many to STAY AWAY). I have developed knowledge towards very basic genetics topics while learning how to manage failure in bi-weekly quizzes that are significantly harder than the material taught. I have learned to accept mediocrity and sit through terribly taught lectures. Overall, a very quintessential way to complete my MCDB major requirements.",
    "I really learned a lot about the basic principles of genetics. It was an astounding amount of information to cover over the course of a semester, but it was definitely worth it.",
    "This was a good basic Genetics course, and covered many topics that are touched upon in other classes.",
    "I have taken quite a few science classes at Yale, including several MCDB courses. Genetics was helpful to me to fill in some of the gaps I had after taking BIOL 103.",
    "I learned very little. The course mostly reiterated the initial bio modules. What was new, they taught us poorly.",
    "Genetics topics and techniques from molecular to population levels.",
    "Genetics has been one of the classes in which I have learned the most this semester. You learn about everything from genetic mutations, basic genetic techniques, how to read a pedigree table, understanding population genetics, etc. You will walk out of this class with concrete skills.",
    "I learned about modern-day approaches to genetics and genome analysis and was introduced to cutting-edge research and applications of genetics.",
    "Another basic MCDB course, almost a repeat of BIOL 103, but fun and not too stressful. You'll learn all sorts of things about development, genetic and allelic interactions, replication and repair mechanisms, the usual. It's not too much work but you have to study harder than the other MCDB\/pre-meds to actually do well, which is always off-putting in MCDB courses.",
    "I learned how to think of many aspects of biology from a genetic perspective. Before this course, I frequently conceptualized a lot of cellular functions as simply \"things that happened,\" but this course taught me the nuance and ubiquity of genetic information.",
    "From this course, I gained a deeper understanding of genes and how they interact and function. Genetics is a complex topic, but after taking this class I feel that I have developed a better idea of how genes work.",
    "Learned basic genetics stuff, went well with Genetics lab which helped greatly",
    "Developed a better understanding of the tools used to understand genetics. Like beyond the punnet square and ways to investigate traits that dont fit the simple models.",
    "I got more experience reading science papers. I learned about genetic mutations and the underlying causes and consequences.",
    "MCDB 202 taught foundational genetic concepts and explored these concepts via research papers. Emphasis was put on understanding how to utilize these basic concepts (such as Mendel's First and Second Laws) and how to analyze research papers, especially how to read figures.",
    "We explored various aspects that Genetic covers e.g. Population genetics, developmental genetics which was all quite interesting. I also gained the skill of reading papers closely.",
    "Learned a ton about genetics -- way beyond punnet squares and intro level stuff from other classes. Really interesting when you get going!",
    "I learned so much about genetics and its wide applicability in modern science! It was especially rewarding to link basic genetic concepts to the research I am currently conducting in my lab. After the bi-weekly discussion sections, I have become much more confident in analyzing scientific papers. This skill will serve me well in the future!",
    "MCDB 202 covers some of the basics of genetics, not in great depth; the format of the course does not lead to reinforcement of the material.",
    "I learned how to think critically about genetics, and how to apply this knowledge to a variety of genetic problems, including in both developmental and molecular concepts. I learned how to read peer-reviewed papers more thoroughly and diligently.",
    "This class gave a nice overview of genetics. It was informative and interesting and the workload was not too bad.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. You really have to stay on top of things because of the quizzes.",
    "Good intro to genetics",
    "I definitely gained an in-depth understanding of how genetics work in the human body and in the population. I feel like I learned a lot with regard to how genes play out into what we do and see.",
    "Developed a strong understanding to genetics and principles of genetics by building upon and reinforcing foundation material covered in previous biology courses.",
    "This was a fabulous course. Most of what I learned was techniques for genetic analysis rather than the cellular mechanisms of genetics, although there was a good amount of that too. This course makes you realize the importance and limitations of data in drawing scientific conclusions. There was a good amount of focus on statistical techniques, which I really appreciated. I also learned how to read scientific papers.",
    "I learned about a variety of areas of genetics from population to developmental. I especially enjoyed learning about the advent of new technologies such as CRISPR and GMOs.",
    "MCDB 202 was a wonderful introduction to genetics that covers both breath and depth. We started with Mendel's Laws and expanded onto gene and allelic interactions and how those can alter Mendelian ratios in offspring. We also learned about topics including population and developmental genetics. This course gave an introduction into more quantitative skills involved in genetics (like conducting a chi-square test or using the Hardy Weinberg equation), but the math was not overwhelming and the class did a good job of walking students through the analysis. I feel that I now have the foundation to understand and learn more about new technologies and genetics research.",
    "Great intro to Genetics.",
    "A lot of genetics concepts!",
    "I learned about the way genes are regulated and interact with each other, and read some papers about research currently conducted in the field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: good papers to read for section Weaknesses: professor teaching style, lecture slides, TA was unhelpful, quizzes were incredibly difficult given easy material (too many quizzes had questions without any right answers or multiple right answers as to further confuse students).",
    "The course is well-organized because it obviates the need for an extra discussion section, which was very helpful, and the format also forces students to keep up with the material, which was initially painful but eventually something for which I was grateful. I did wish that we were able to review the problems that we got wrong on the quizzes, instead of receiving a score but being unsure what questions we missed. I understand that the instructors were wary of students copying down the quiz questions, but if there were a designated review day when we could just sit down and see the questions that we missed, it would make reviewing for the final much easier. It also would have helped if the participation grade for the discussion section were more quantitatively instead of arbitrarily determined.",
    "It is a little unorganized- I liked the structure of biweekly quizzes, as it forced me to keep up with the material throughout the semester, but did not add the stress of a quiz every single week.",
    "As the Prof mentioned on the first day, genetics is a pretty large area. I think the courses main weakness is that too much is crammed into one semester. I think by focusing on one aspect of genetics at a deeper level, the course could be improved. For example, 3-lectures on DNA==>RNA==>Protein is not sufficient or helpful when MCDB 200 covers that material in an entire semester. Focus!",
    "The course presentations are so bad! Slides that should say \"Identical by Descent,\" for example, read \"Identity by Decent\" and were then copy and pasted multiple times. So there were a lot of slides, but very little information on each one, and often incorrect information was repeated far more times than necessary. The textbook was very useful, but class became rather unnecessary.",
    "The class covered a good range of topics. Having biweekly quizzes was also helpful to keep us on top of things. The sections and papers (Special Tuesday!) were nice as well. The class was rather poorly organized. Lectures slides printed in class, presented on projector, and uploaded to classesv2 were often inconsistent; sometimes neither printed nor uploaded slides were available when class begins (which should really be up at least the night before so we can at least look over them first and print ourselves if we want; having a copy in class was necessary to take notes too!). Moreover, it's not uncommon that lectures don't finish the slides, but they happen so often that the slides and lectures were asynchronous almost always, which was really confusing as well. So honestly managing notes was difficult throughout. Also, the quizzes were riddled with a couple (10-20%) of mistakes every time, which was really frustrating and not conducive to learning. The wordings were often confusing as well, with ambiguous questions\/answers. It really wasn't a matter of not understanding the content well enough-- it was more that the language wasn't clear.",
    "There are 5 quizzes and a final which I felt like was incredible helpful in spreading out the amount of information that we had learned. It was certainly manageable. The papers that we read were also extremely interesting (I liked the Special Tuesdays a lot) which added a real-world component to the information we were learning.",
    "Strengths - the concepts and the organization of the class. The biweekly quizzes were a good way to make students keep up with the class while not giving them too much pressure with one or two exams throughout the semester. The clarity with which the professor talked abut the final exam which was cumulative also helped guide our studies and focus on the really important concepts and be able to apply the concepts rather than just being able to regurgitate information on the exam. Weaknesses - sometimes the lectures seemed very disorganized and he would often add additional slides impromptu, making it confusing to follow. The book helped a lot.",
    "The course is very well taught and the format of 6 quizzes spaced every two weeks helped to solidify the material.",
    "I think that the way this course is structured is somewhat confusing. Every other week we have a quiz to test our knowledge on the course, but the final exam is problem based, which is a completely different format from everything else that we are required to do. I would recommend that the quizzes be replaced either with problem sets that are due that day, or that the quizzes have the same sort of question that will be on the final exam.",
    "A strength of this course was that there was NO section and NO problem set, so it there was no busy work or unnecessary commitment to the course. The special Tuesdays every other week were quiz\/paper discussion days with a TA, but ours (Saige) was kind and helpful, so I had a good experience. A few weaknesses are as follows: the course was divided between three instructors. THREE INSTRUCTORS who had completely different teaching styles. The final exam had three vastly different parts written by their respective instructors. It was very difficult to know what to expect for the instructors, as one focused on applications (math) and the other focused on memorization of the slides. It also seemed as if the main instructor wasn't available much - he was always traveling when he wasn't teaching, and he was completely unreachable when the other professors taught their sections, so it felt like he didn't commit much time to the course.",
    "My only concern with this course was that it was taught by three different teachers, all of whom had very different teaching styles. In that sense, I thought that Professor Acar and Professor Dawson's lectures were very disjointed from Professor Dellaporta's lectures, which made up the majority of the course. I understand that these professors all study different parts of genetics, and that fundamentally, the field of genetics is extremely vast. So it makes sense that different professor taught different sections. I suppose I only wish the three parts were somehow better integrated in teaching style or format.",
    "Strengths: well-taught, engaging, nice structure of the class with a special Tuesday every other week involving quiz and journal discussion Weakness: quiz questions were not based on problems assigned from the textbook, also I wish that the quizzes were handed back so we could see and go over the questions that we missed and learn from them",
    "Strengths: learned a wide variety of material, Dellaporta is nice and enthusiastic Weaknesses: hard to engage at times, sometimes the lecture felt like we were learning way too much extra stuff that wasn't necessary, if I hadn't taken the lab I wouldn't have been able to survive genetics, zero feedback on quizzes so I never improved from one quiz to the next",
    "It seemed like there may have been a sight lack of communication between the course director and other lecturers in terms of material we would be tested on. The discussions every other Tuesday were really great to bring the course material into a different context and still understand it. This was a very fair course.",
    "I really liked how the section was built into the class. I think more classes should follow this format. The quizzes were great markers of understanding the material, but the correct answers weren't made available immediately. The teacher often went over them briefly, but he did so before class officially started and while some students were still walking over from a previous class.",
    "MCDB 202 is a solid course, with enthusiastic, engaged professors that are eager to help students. One possible improvement is that sometimes we wouldn't finish the lecture before the class ended, so it would carry over to the next class.",
    "I think the main weakness is that a lot of the times the questions on quizzes\/the finals are a bit ambiguous. Also prof. Dellaporta's slides are pretty ambiguous with hardly any notes which probably doesn't facilitate student learning outside of class. Makes it more difficult to study. I think scores would increase if slides had more detail. Strength is that Prof. Dellaporta is pretty good with meeting with students outside class.",
    "This course offers a good overview of basic genetics concepts and covers very interesting topics, but the teaching can be a bit chaotic at times. This was especially the case with the quiz questions that were often poorly worded. The quizzes are given once every 2 weeks and count for 50% of the overall grade. Another downside was that paper discussions after each quiz tend to get monotonous at one point. Other than that, I generally enjoyed the course, although the lectures are definitely not as impressive as some other MCDB courses.",
    "Strengths: - Dellaporta's lectures are awesome! He's really dynamic - Problem set questions are very helpful - Good textbook -- explains things well if anything in class is confusing - Weekly quizzes are great! - No section outside of normal class time!!! Weaknesses: - The TAs are awful and do not know anything about genetics or the class material -- the review sessions are useless and the TAs can barely explain the review problems - The other professors aren't nearly as good as Dellaporta - The inclusion of some of the more molecular bio topics (DNA replication, repair, etc) are not well integrated with the other modules - You don't get your quizzes back, and he doesn't announce every quiz average -- would really appreciate these things! - HATE that the TAs randomly call on people for paper discussion",
    "I really like the concept of special Tuesdays but I think a lot can be done to improve them in practice. The quizzes were hard but fair and I liked that they helped me keep up with the material. I also appreciated having a handful of lower stakes quizzes instead of one very high stakes midterm. I liked that we were exposed to the different papers but the way we discussed them in section was not useful at all. People were able to just rephrase the legend provided in the text when they were asked to explain the figures, which is not a useful exercise, and in fact, a complete waste of time. It would be much better if people took turns explaining the methods, results, and discussion in addition to the figures. Furthermore, I HATE when TAs cold call people. If one aspect of the final grade is participation, it makes no sense to call on people randomly. If I choose not to participate, I shouldn't be forced to participate and I have to be willing to accept a lower grade. If I do want to participate, I should be able to answer the questions that I feel comfortable with instead of being called on to answer questions that I don't understand, which is not only extremely embarrassing, but absolutely discourages people from wanting to voluntarily participate in the future.",
    "This course broke down genetics in a very manageable way. Although I learned so much by the end of the class, I never felt overwhelmed. It was especially rewarding studying for the final and realizing the interconnectedness of the various topics we discussed throughout the class. I also liked the format of the course. Biweekly quizzes and discussion sections really helped solidify my understanding of the material and gave me an opportunity to see basic genetic concepts applied in ongoing scientific research. In terms of improving the course, I would suggest seeing our quizzes shortly after taking them. Although we had the option to review our quizzes with our section leaders towards the end of the course, I would have learned so much more from my mistakes if I saw them earlier.",
    "The format and organization of this course is terrible. The course grade breakdown has 50% of the grade based on \"quizzes,\" 25% of the grade based on \"discussion,\" and the remaining 25% of the grade based on the final exam. First, since the quizzes (six of them total, drop the lowest score, average the highest five scores, so that each one is effectively worth 10%) are such a large portion of the grade, they should not even be called quizzes - they are rather tests; more importantly, the multiple choice format of the quizzes (11 multiple choice questions, one \"extra credit\" so that the grade is out of 10) neither encourage learning the material thoroughly from lecture, nor do they effectively test your knowledge of the lecture material. Having more open ended questions, for which students have to write explanations or calculate\/determine answers, would encourage more thorough learning of the material and also be a more effective gauge of how well the material has been learned. It seems that the format arose partially because of laziness with grading; it is obviously easier to grade multiple choice questions. The fact that there were multiple instances in which a question or two on a quiz had NO correct answer choice (none of the answer choices given contained the correct answer to the question) is both a testament to the laziness and sloppiness of the assessments, and an example of the course's poor organization and thoroughness. Another big issue with the quizzes is the fact that they are not returned, ostensibly in order to protect the integrity of the quiz questions. If the main purpose is to allow for questions to be recycled the following year, and prevent sharing of those questions with people who take the course that following year, however, then it seems illogical to announce that all quizzes can be picked up and kept after the final exam. In terms of learning, not being able to easily pick up a graded quiz after taking it (only the grade is posted on Gradebook in classesv2) is detrimental to student learning. A large and important portion of the learning process happens through review of previous tests, by looking at the questions that were answered incorrectly, learning from those mistakes, reviewing that material, as well as reviewing the questions answered correctly, since it is not infrequent to get lucky and by chance choose the right answer without actually knowing how to answer the question. Instead, it was a hassle to view the quizzes, necessitating a meeting with your TA to simply see and review your quiz, which, as mentioned above, you could not take home. Second, The discussion grade was opaque, and given the large amount of weight given to attendance of biweekly discussion sections (around every other week there is a discussion section with your TA instead of class) and participation, there should have been more clearcut feedback in order to have a better idea of how we were doing. Instead, we had no way of knowing how our performance was being judged, and the number score posted in Gradebook in classesv2 AFTER the final exam (during winter break), on a scale of 5, seemed to suggest that this portion of the grade was simply a 0 or 1, 1 if you showed up and said something in section (which gives no proper weight\/acknowledgment of students who prepared more thoroughly by spending more effort reading the papers). The final exam (25%) was the only part of the course that seemed decently fair and straightforward. Questions on the final were open ended, which were a better test of our knowledge. It is understandable that no final can cover every single topic taught in a course, but this final seemed quite limited in scope, in that it ultimately only tested a few topics taught in lecture. This seems unfair to students who spent more time studying thoroughly all of the lecture material, and not conducive to learning the material. Needless to say, much improvement is needed to make this course better.",
    "The strengths include Prof. Dellaporta, who is fantastic. The lectures are engaging and well-organized. The weaknesses included some of the other professors, including Professor Acar, who was not as clear or engaging. The quizzes could be poorly-worded for both professors, and therefore it sometimes felt like you were not getting the grade that you deserved given your mastery of the material.",
    "A strength is the low workload. Professor Dellaporta assigns problem sets that are optional, which is nice to have if you want to practice. A weakness is the switching of professors throughout the semester, which I found to make the course feel discontinuous.",
    "Strengths: A strong lecture on a very interesting topic. This class was all around great an fun to learn. The expectations they had for us was clear and the papers we read were relevant. I felt I learned a lot Weaknesses: Maybe the toughness of grading, but this isn't really a weakness because it is fair",
    "The only issue I had with the course was that the quiz didn't really assess the material covered. Also the switching of professors made it difficult to prepare well for the quizzes and anticipate the style of questions.",
    "Participation kills your grade",
    "I wish the class talked more about current technology in genetics and we read more recent papers. There was so much potential to the class and I feel like the class didn't reach that.",
    "This course was strong in that I felt like I learned a lot. However, there was a lot of information so in order to gain the necessary grasp of the concepts I needed to do a lot of reading and researching on my own.",
    "The material was interesting but the way it was presented was not always clear.",
    "Overall the class was excellent and I enjoyed my time. One improvement would be to allow us have our quizzes back in order to use the quizzes to ask question and study for exams.",
    "Overall this course was amazing. The lectures were great and the material was really interesting. I appreciated learning how to read and understand scientific papers. I wish there had been more feedback about our performance on quizzes, and during discussion section as well.",
    "I think one weakness of this course was its evaluations. While I appreciated that the quizzes were biweekly and section was built into class time, I did not like the disconnect between the quizzes and the final exam. The quizzes were different in content and style from the final and that made it challenging to know what material I should learn and how I should be learning.",
    "Although the course content was interesting and I liked the set up of biweekly quizzes and discussion sections, I didn't feel like it was obvious what we should know. A lot of questions on the quizzes wouldn't correlate with lectures, or would be badly worded, or have two correct answers.",
    "The information in this course was presented in a very engaging way in lecture. I enjoyed the papers that we read during section and the discussion was helpful in allowing me to understand the research. The papers were also a great supplement to the lecture. A critique of the course is that discussion sections often felt stressful because we all knew we were graded on how much we participate, so it sometimes felt like everyone was fighting to get called on, and then after we speak once or twice, we can sit back and relax for the rest of discussion, which doesn't seem like the most efficient way to learn. Otherwise, the biweekly quizzes were great in that it kept you studying but didn't stress you out like a midterm might, and your grade is spread out across a number of quizzes.",
    "Great instruction. Lots of material.",
    "A lot of the content is review from Bio 103. It's frustrating that this course bills itself as the next level but doesn't go a lot deeper in a longer amount of time. The quiz grades are low, not because the material is difficult but because the questions are frequently poorly written. Overall, however, the class was interesting once we got beyond review material.",
    "Strengths: The structure of assessments was a good way of encouraging students to keep up with the material. Weaknesses: The material tested did not match the problem sets and thus it was hard to know what to study for the quizzes. The answers to the quizzes were never made available and so students could never really learn from their mistakes on the quizzes.",
    "Could be improved with better TA involvement.",
    "The strengths are that genetics is an inherently interesting subject, so lectures were generally engaging. The papers were also fascinating even though some were tough to understand. Weaknesses include the lack of clarity with grading. The quizzes often followed the logic of the instructor and would frequently have more than one right answer. The resources we had did not always prepare us for the quizzes because the line of thinking was so obscure. Also, the discussion sections were too big for meaningful discussion and turned into a cold-call answer format that did not demonstrate anyone's true level of understanding of the papers."

    "Yes, would recommend! If you werent sure about the material when it was taught in the intro bio sequence but want to explore genetics a bit more, this is the class to take! Dellaporta is the star of the show, even though he sort of vanishes for a couple of months towards the tail end of the semester, after the first four modules. Its ok, though, he comes back from top-secret, super-important genetics conferences and teaches you all about CAS9\/CRISPR. The other lecturers we had, like Murat Acar and Ian Dawson, were also great, and all the lectures were organized in a way that made sense. The textbook is worth its weight in gold, you shouldnt require much beyond that to clarify any lecture points. Good luck!",
    "I took the class as a senior, so genetics was helpful to me for filling in gaps left in my knowledge base from previous courses. In that sense, it was very successful and I highly recommend it.",
    "Don't bother. Take something more interesting and useful.",
    "Genetics is without a doubt an important topic in biology, so probably a very useful class to take! Nonetheless it's rather poorly managed and organized, so it's really confusing-- not as in difficult, but as in lost.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student - especially MCDB students looking to fulfill major requirements.",
    "I'm a psych-neuro major and I took this course. I wish I had taken developmental biology instead of this class, but I think it comes down to preference. If you need an advanced science credit, this class or dev bio should be perfectly fine. I don't come from a strong biology background or am premed, but this course was really clear and the professor and the book really try hard to make sure that you understand the concepts. With the psets and the biweekly quizzes, this is not an intensive course, which I really liked, allowing me to focus on my other classes as well as this class.",
    "I recommend this course if you are interested in learning about genetics. Prof. Dellaporta is a great professor with a lot of insight on current technology and research in the field of genetics and genome analysis. However, it does take some self-studying on your part at home to be able to keep up with the course schedule and understand some things that the slides do not present comprehensively.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to people who don't need to take it. It's not particularly difficult, but the things we learn don't seem to be particularly useful. I took it for one of my science requirements for the PSYC Neuroscience track, and I don't believe that it was relevant at all to my psych neuroscience classes.",
    "It's a solid course, but it's not life-changing. If you need it for MCDB requirements, or for the MCATs, it's better than the rest, but it's still another MCDB lecture. I'm very grateful that the class was low-workload (no problem sets or mandatory section) - you have bi-weekly quizzes\/scientific paper days called Special Tuesdays, but besides that, there was no outside work besides studying. Professor Dellaporta was entertaining and a fun lecturer, but the other two lecturers, READ: THREE DIFFERENT LECTURERS, had vastly different styles which altered the focus of the exams, which was difficult to study for. Take it if you need the requirement, as it's definitely better than the other MCDB core courses.",
    "The format of the class is a little different than others: there are six modules, each consisting of three lectures followed by a mandatory session every other Tuesday. These \"Special Tuesdays\" consisted of an 11-question multiple-choice quiz (out of 10) for 25 minutes, and a discussion of a research paper for 50 minutes. You drop one quiz and the remaining are 50% of the grade, discussion attendance\/participation is 25%, and the final exam is 25%. Overall a good survey of genetics, although some modules were more detailed\/interesting\/compelling, and others were not as well taught\/wishy-washy. I was annoyed with the quiz format at first but have to admit it's a good way to space the material and have you keep up. Also if you're on the fence about taking the lab, take it; it's a good one, and helps you a lot with the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students! I thought it was engaging and was an essential step in my progression as a student and as a scientist. It challenged me just the right amount; I never felt like I was bored in the course, and I also never felt that I was completely floundering. It introduced me to the complexity of genetic information to a degree that previous intro classes never reached.",
    "Yes I definitely recommend! This course gives you a good overview of traditional topics in genetics and you will come out of this class with a better understanding of how genes work. The workload is not too bad--no psets, just recommended textbook problems and reading. There are special Tuesdays every other week where you have a quiz and journal discussion. No midterms, just 6 quizzes and a final. Quizzes were not too bad, multiple choice but be prepared for section as participation takes up a good portion of your grade.",
    "It's an ok class, would def recommend taking the lab along with this.",
    "This was a solid MCDB course. Grading is very fair. There is no mandatory section outside of class, yet there are discussions during class time about every other week. If you think you might be interested in genetics, TAKE THIS! Even if you're not that interested in genetics, as an aspiring scientist you gotta know about genetics and how we understand them. So you should take this before you graduate if you are MCDB. Dellaporta is chill and also has done some impressive work with some impressive people, and on top of that realizes that we are all college students and respects that, but also wants you to learn genetics because its awesome and fundamental.",
    "The information taught in this course was very technical, so I would not take this course if you do not have an interest in genetics, I would not recommend it. If you do have an interest in biology though, you may enjoy this class and be surprised about how much there is to genetics.",
    "MCDB 202 is a great MCDB core class and a great class in general. The format of the class is conducive to keep students up-to-pace with the material (biweekly quizzes) and discussion sections during those biweekly quiz days made the class seem fresh.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are good with studying regularly throughout the semester without slacking. Then by the end of the semester, it would take much less time and effort to study for the final (which is only 25% of your grade). Quizzes are worth a lot (50%). They are actually quite fine, although sometimes it can be a bit ambiguous. I actually self studied a lot because sometimes prof. Dellaporta's lectures can be a bit confusing. But he goes by the text book a lot so although his lectures slides hardly have writing on them, you can basically get almost all of it from reading the chapters. TIP: Do the problems as you go along! Sections are worth 25% of your grade. I have no idea how our TA rates us. But make sure you take time to read the paper and participate\/volunteer a lot in section. It was fine for me. Also Dellaporta was very good with meeting up with students, so you should definitely take advantage of that.",
    "Good class, not crazy workload, interesting material! Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend Genetics to another student. The topic is important to understand because it at the forefront of innovations in biology and medicine. The course is well-taught and the professor is clearly very passionate about the topic.",
    "Genetics is a pretty straight-forward intermediate-level MCDB course. Although it took some time to study for the bi-weekly quizzes and to read the scientific papers, you learn so much from this class! The workload is reasonable and Dellaporta\/Acar truly cares about the course. I would recommend this class for students interested in learning more about genetics and in gaining more skills in reading scientific papers.",
    "Course organization and format is absolutely abysmal. Would not recommend taking this if you are actually interested in genetics. It is low workload and not time intensive, but not worth a full credit in terms of what you learn. A lot of the material is covered in MB&B 301, so students who took that course should be wary of overlap. The course breakdown has 50% of the grade based on quizzes, 25% based on discussion, and 25% based on the final exam. The quizzes are 11 multiple choice, one extra credit question with the grade out of 10; the lowest quiz score is dropped and the highest five are averaged for a quiz score. They are worth a lot of your grade, yet do not appropriately assess your understanding of the material, and moreover often have such ridiculous mistakes as a question or two for which none of the answer choices provided are correct. The discussion portion of the grade revolves around a biweekly discussion section (around every other week, you have a discussion section with your TA in place of class), in which you take the quiz and then discuss a paper assigned. There's essentially no feedback on your performance during the course, and the number scores for attendance and participation posted AFTER the final exam during winter break, on a scale of 5, suggested that they were graded simply 0 or 1, and if you showed up and said something, you got a 1. Based on this kind of grading, there's not much incentive to read the papers that thoroughly or understand them that well, with no reward for spending more effort to understand the papers better and making more informed comments during section. The final exam is the only part of the course that was relatively fair and straightforward, with open ended questions, but seemed to focus too much on just a few topics taught in the course. The actual lecture material is OK, but could have been more organized and lecture slides could have been more detailed.",
    "Definitely. A great introduction to genetics, beyond the bio 103 offerings.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in genetics. I learned a great deal and the teaching was very good. Much better than the introductory biology courses at Yale.",
    "Do take it. It's a very competitive class but you will learn a lot. Dellaporta is amazing and the other lecturers are good too. You will learn a lot but please do actually study for the quizzes. There are many but they end up counting for most of your grade. Study hard.",
    "Yes if serious about genetics",
    "It's a really chill MCDB class",
    "I would recommend this course only if it is necessary in your major. While I felt that I learned a lot, it was not very interesting nor would it help in a lot of facets of life outside of a major.",
    "Yes, an excellent MCDB course that is organized and very well-taught. The material is very interesting and they class is set-up in such a way for the student to get the most out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is fascinating and well presented. You will come away also knowing how to perform some statistical analyses, and will be more comfortable reading scientific papers.",
    "Genetics was one of the easier MCDB classes. If you have a choice, take Developmental Biology instead.",
    "Yes, but you will find this course to be deceptively difficult. The material isn't hard, but you don't know what will be on the quizzes. You can study for hours and still do poorly, or not study at all and do well. I personally love genetics as was very engaged by the course content, I was just disappointed in how grading and testing was carried out.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Genetics is fascinating and Professor Dellaporta is clearly very passionate about what he teaches, which engages the students in the class. MCDB 202 was a wonderful introduction to genetics that covers both breath and depth. We started with Mendel's Laws and expanded onto gene and allelic interactions and how those can alter Mendelian ratios in offspring. We also learned about topics including population and developmental genetics. This course gave an introduction into more quantitative skills involved in genetics (like conducting a chi-square test or using the Hardy Weinberg equation), but the math was not overwhelming and the class did a good job of walking students through the analysis. I feel that I now have the foundation to understand and learn more about new technologies and genetics research.",
    "Yes, great instruction and very interesting.",
    "Yes, it is not",
    "Fantastic course. Dellaporta is an amazing professor and great person to get to know.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are passionate about genetics."
