   "comments": [
    "Take this class! If you love watching and talking about good movies then this is the class for you. The time commitment is large (2 lectures, section, 3 hour film screening and around 100-150 pages of reading every week) but it is so worth it. Ron is a great professor and you will learn so much from him. This has definitely been my favorite class this semester, you won't regret taking it.",
    "Good if you want to learn the technical terms and to see films that you might now otherwise see. However, screenings do require a lot of time outside of lecture.",
    "Film was an excellent class. The lectures are extremely enjoyable, and at fifty minutes twice a week is not much of a time commitment. Although, added to the movies, it is a bit of time. The movies, with the exception of a few, are excellent and very enjoyable to watch, especially on 35mm. The workload is not bad, a lot of non-required reading and four papers which get progressively longer (2-3 pages to 10-12 pages, though writing ten pages on a film is not as hard as you would think, plus it's a very doable writing credit).",
    "Definitely a good class; not every film is all it's cracked up to be, but odds are you'll love at least one that you probably wouldn't have chosen to watch on your own time. Readings and work are fairly light and interesting, and Professor Gregg gives interesting.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in film, and as far as writing credits go, it's not overwhelming at all.",
    "The class does a very good job as a survey course for film studies, and yet is able to tie together all the subjects covered into a cohesive, connected thread. Having taken previous film studies courses, parts of the class were more familiar, and could have been overwhelming otherwise. Though Professor Gregg does a great job covering so much material during lecture, the papers and exams do expect you to do some individual work to fully understand the material.",
    "Great.",
    "Great introductory and interesting Film Course whether you're a film studies major or not. you watch one or two great movies every week, discuss them in section, and learn more about the history\/directors\/styles\/etc. of the movies in class. It'll give you a new appreciation for film and film art, and the workload is definitely not too bad--and the readings are really interesting. The final is definitely fair and not too challenging (there are a lot of choices, so it's not like you have to know everything on it) and you are given a lot of freedom and room to work on the papers. definitely take it if you're looking for something interesting and fun this semester, and if you're a film major who has to take it--well, it's a great class! enjoy",
    "A great overview on film, both theoretical stuff and technical knowledge. If you like movies at all, give this class a shot. The readings aren't ridiculous and the assignments are fun.",
    "This is a pretty interesting class if you want to learn about movie vocab and different film movements over time. The readings are often long and not overly engaging or easy to extract important information from. You learn how to write film reviews and do in-depth film analysis. You start looking at films in a whole new way afterwards.",
    "Watch many good movies, a few horrible movies, and learn a little bit about the way they are put together.",
    "I took this for the writing credit, as a pre-requisite for other film classes, and because I am interested in screenwriting, film direction, and editing.This class almost stripped bare any interest I used to have in film. Lecture was frequently a waste of time, and the class was composed of many, many obnoxious hipster-types.There are 2 film reviews (~6 pages), 2 analysis papers (~6 pages) and 1 final paper (~10-12 pages). Section meets once a week for 50 minutes.If you already drool over the magnificence of Godard or Eisenstein then maybe you would enjoy this class. Otherwise, prepare for a lot of BS work and pretentious subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in film but has never taken a film class before. It's fun and interesting, especially the later sections about digital cinema, but overall not a very serious course. You really will get out of it what you put into it. If you do the readings the class becomes fascinating and informative, but if you plan on just watching some of the films and going to occasional lectures then you're probably wasting your time and annoying everyone else.",
    "It was a great introductory course to film. You learn a lot of the basscis and get to see a lot of great films. I reccmoned it to anybody who enjoys film.",
    "Take it only if you have to take it as a film major. If you're merely interested in film and think this course will help you understand it from an analytical point of view, you might find yourself losing interest halfway into the course.",
    "this is great class to develop a film language and understanding of film analysis to take to all other areas of film production.",
    "FILM 150 is an introduction to all of the various aspects that constitute a film, and forces you to think about every one of them. Yes, I would recommend FILM 150 to another student, not only one who is interested in the academic study of technique but also those who are seeking to learn more about the physical aspects of production. I felt that the reading had a lot to offer someone who would aspire to become involved in film as a career.",
    "Film 150 is a great introduction to film and film studies. You'll get a comprehensive history of film and a thorough overview of the terminology and techniques of filmmaking. You'll also get a fairly easy WR credit, given that there are only four writing assignments, two of which are very short. Ron Gregg is a very interesting and organized lecturer, and he's also very willing to make a personal connection if you meet with him or just ask him a question over email. I would definitely recommend Film 150. Be aware, though, that between two lectures, section, three hours of screenings one night a week, and a fair amount of reading, the course does take up a lot of time.",
    "Good intro film course. Will either be a first and only film class or will inspire you to take others.",
    "Take it, it's tons of fun.",
    "Film Studies was a great class, well taught, and exposed me to a whole new way of watching films.",
    "Yes, if you want to take more film classes or if the movies on the sylabus really appeal to you. The lectures aren't wonderfully insightful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, if you are interested in being a film major or if you have no interest in the film major whatsoever. This class will completely change the way you watch films - useful to anyone who watches movies in general. It is also a great way to satisfy a writing requirement for those students who do not love to write, not because there is little writing to be done, but because they actually teach you how to tailor your writing when writing about films.",
    "A class involving the study of film - every form. Not much contemporary film, but that is the best part. Learn about the roots of film and the way a film is put together. Absolutely take this class. Loved going to it every time.",
    "Great class. Great homework. Most students would enjoy it.",
    "If you've ever been interested in film or film theory, this is an excellent foundation course to get you started. Professor Gregg's lectures are often whimsical and hard to extract information from. Nonetheless, his enthusiasm for the subject is evident and enjoyable to watch.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to explore film, especially if they are looking for a WR requirement. However, since it does fulfill WR, there is a lot of work, and weekly class time adds up from lectures to screenings to section. However, the topics of the papers aren't too difficult, so as long as you plan ahead of time they aren't that difficult.",
    "Take this course if you want to watch great films and learn basic film terminology and history. Show up to screening as often as you can, but do yourself a favor and sign up for Netflix--a lot of the films are available through instant streaming, which takes some of the stress out of having to make it to screenings. Also, the Film Study Center has all the films shown in class and you can check them out for a day at a time. This class is totally what you make of it. I did hardly any of the readings and admittedly got quite lax about showing up to class--it turned out fine, but I wish I could've devoted more time to it.",
    "This class is fun, go to lecture, even though it's easy not to.",
    "A great way to begin thinking about film from a technical standpoint. The benefits really manifest themselves when you watch films independently, after the course. It might seem like the material is straightforward, but having section and regularly discussing and writing about film really gets you to see films differently in the future. Great for film studies majors and non-majors alike. If you love film and love talking\/writing about it, take this course.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it if you have any interest in film. It's about the basics of film analysis, not film production--so if you're looking for a hands-on production course, this isn't it. Also, only take it if you know you'll have most of the screening nights free. If you miss a couple, it's tough to motivate yourself to go and get the DVD and find time on your own to watch it--and the syllabus has a lot of great films that you really should see.",
    "I would say it is a good class that is captivating and easy to understand and use after the class is over.",
    "Yes! Whether you are interested in the major or just in watching films differently, this course is a very interesting one. There is a ton of class time though, when you include the weekly screenings, and a lot of reading to go with it. You don't really have to do all of the reading, although most of it is quite interesting. Professor Gregg is very interesting and an animated lecturer. The films are great, and not your typical selection for an intro film course.",
    "I would definately recommend this course. It is really manageable and the screenings were usually pretty good. The essay prompts are flexible and the professor is great.",
    "I would recommend Film 150 to other students. It is writing credit with interesting subject matter.",
    "It's a bit of a heavy workload. If you're a film major, you'll enjoy going back to the basics with this one. Prof. Gregg is a wonderful person. If you like theory this film will focus more on the technicalities - defining the terms you need to critique a film, for example.",
    "Film Studies 150 is a requirement for the film major - don't take it unless you have to. If you're looking for a relatively easy class or a writing credit, you won't be disappointed, but there are much more interesting ways to do both and much more interesting ways to get involved with film.",
    "Yes, if you can undertake the course load.",
    "I was considering being a Film Studies major before taking this course. No longer. That being said, it's not a bad class. The material you learn is important and the films are (for the most part) great. It's just really time consuming (especially if you do the readings) and the lectures aren't very informative or inspiring. If you're interested in taking a film studies class at Yale, take something more focused and specific.",
    "It is certainly an amusing class, but after a while becomes a little tedious. Most of the movies are exciting and the course is a writing credit.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting film survey course (though there is a large time commitment)",
    "This is a great class for beginning to understand the basics of film in it's most general sense. Taking this class helps you think about film the way a good literature class makes you think about books, but it also gives you a taste of the huge scope of film studies, and how much you can't cover in detail. It gives you a great chance to watch a bunch of films you might not otherwise watch. Seeing them on the big screen is infinitely better than trying to watch them on a little tv, and having the opportunity to discuss those films with your peers makes you notice things you might not otherwise see, and forces you to voice your reasons why you did or did not like a film, rather than just going with your gut feeling.I would say take this class. It's a great way to approach the writing credit if you want something fresh, and it provides you with some basic knowledge for discussing film.",
    "Basic film course. Your grade will depend on how much you can conform to your TA's preferences."
