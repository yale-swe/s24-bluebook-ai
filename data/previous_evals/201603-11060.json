   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "How Catholic thinkers throughout history relate to each other.",
    "I never learned anything about Catholocism before this course, except what was taught in European History courses. This course taught me a great deal about the tradition of the Catholic Church, as well as gave me the insight to evaluate the meaning and context of documents in the history of the Catholic tradition.",
    "Growing up as a Catholic, I never really got the chance to really delve into the intellectual tradition. This course helped me better understand why I believe what I believe by presenting works from a wide scope of authors, lectures on the time period and intellectual tradition of that time, taught by very insightful professors.",
    "I learned about the beauty of the paradoxes within the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. As a Catholic, I got to read some authors essential to my faith that I never would have had I not taken the class. As someone who did not take DS, I think this class also improved my writing skills in working to articulate arguments about ancient philosophical texts.",
    "This class was great. Even as a non-Catholic with no experience in the rites and history of the Church, this class taught me a large amount about both the history and philosophy of the Church. As a freshman, this class also gave me an intro to classes in history and classes with a heavy reading load.",
    "This course was a wonderful overview of the history of Catholic thought. It does not deal much with doctrine or practice, but provides insight into the Catholic worldview and metaphysics in a very useful way.",
    "In this class I gained knowledge of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition through reading a wide variety of Catholic texts. I gained insights of several different authors and the skill to read text critically.",
    "Philosophical thinking, argumentation, theology, sprituality",
    "I gained a greater perspective on faith and the many paradoxes present throughout the history of Catholicism.",
    "I learned a lot about the Catholic intellectual tradition and how to engage with theological and philosophical texts.",
    "I gained a greater appreciation for the rich intellectual tradition of the Catholic faith.",
    "I learned about the development of Catholic thought from the formation of the church onwards.",
    "Fascinating overview of the rich diversity of catholic intellectual tradition. Sometimes courses with a number of guest lecturers are weakened by that, but in this case they were great additions. Enjoyed the essays, and the exams were fair and relevant.",
    "I received a robust understanding of the intellectual development of the Catholic Church, and how that development both affected and was affected by its surrounding environment.",
    "I was able to learn in depth about the catholic tradition. As a lifelong catholic, I was always told what to believe, but never really taught it. This class helped me tremendously on my personal journey, not to mention helped me refine my arguing skills.",
    "Although raised Catholic, this course provided a look into the intellectual tradition of Catholicism that I had not been exposed to. In addition to providing context about people, places, and events throughout Catholic history, this class allowed deep study of various primary sources that provide a unique and rewarding look into the Catholic faith.",
    "I took this class fall semester of my freshman year. I can honestly say that it was a life-changing experience. I have never been so engaged with the material, ranging from Augustine to Aquinas to Dante to Dorothy Day, in any other class before. Professors Eire and Brenzel truly brought the texts and authors to life in biweekly lectures and discussion sections. The concepts and theories we explored were so interesting, and I came away with a much richer understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of Catholicism.",
    "Really interesting knowledge about Catholic thought and Christianity in general. Critical reading skills and writing.",
    "I was introduced to a diverse spectrum of texts concerning the intellectual history of catholicism. Both professors did a fantastic job of emphasizing the multivalent history of the religion, exploring Catholicism's formation, its major actors throughout the centuries, its longue-dure and its modern importance.",
    "I learned to think about theology in a whole new way. I also learned how to do intellectual history for the first time!",
    "This class obviously taught me a lot on the subject, but I think it also taught me how to more thoroughly identify individual author's style and the role that plays in how they convey their messages.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the history and formation of my own Catholic faith in terms of the people who shaped its ideas and doctrine and the issues and questions that they grappled with. I came away with knowledge and appreciation of Catholic intellectuals stretching from the early Church fathers to the 21st century, and I gained a further understanding of the perspective of those who criticized or broke from the Catholic Church during this time period."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of Professor Eire's lectures could have been more focused and organized. For instance, the lecture on Reformations took us through the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and many more large historical events that I did not feel were sufficiently brought together at the end. I enjoyed how in-depth and researched Professor Brenzel's and the guest lectures were. I am also grateful the professors committed to leading the sections as it greatly enhanced discussions.",
    "There are very few weaknesses with the course. I thought it was excellent overall. The course's strengths are its level of involvement with students, in and out of section. The course is also exceptionally strong because of the reading selections, which are both engaging and enlightening.",
    "This course is great and doesn't require any particular familiarity with Catholicism, though that might help. The professors really just want the students to see why they believe the Catholic intellectual tradition is worth studying, and they're very intentional about the speakers they bring in, and which readings and lectures they present...and even acknowledge that they know they're not able to present the depth of material that they want to. I think they did a great job with the time they had! One weakness might be the difference in discussion sections. I think the way discussions were held and what was expected in them varied based on the professor you had. Sometimes readings wouldn't match up with lectures...but usually we'd be able to get through what we want to talk about. I didn't really get to know the people in my discussion section--I know that is not solely the course's responsibility, but if there was a way to provide more structure to discussion sections, it might be something good to look into?",
    "This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. It is the perfect combination of a low-stress environment and and fascinating material that leads to great learning. The passion of Professors Eire and Brenzel are the best part of this class. The two of them love the material like no other professors I've had at Yale. They also love teaching undergrads which I've found rare at Yale. Their energy is contagious and I've never been more excited to attend section because they are led by the professors. I honestly have no complaints about the class. Maybe more criticism of the papers that would help students improve their writing.",
    "Strengths:Professors Brenzel and Eire have an important mix of knowledge, interest, and investment in the subject which means that they are as interested in the class as their most interested students are. Weaknesses: To fully appreciate Catholic Intellectual Tradition, one requires background knowledge in fields such as Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy, and the basic rites and practices of the Church. It seems to me that it would have been helpful to have perhaps focused slightly more on these topics.",
    "Professors Eire and Brenzel taught both the lectures and the sections, and they are wonderful. They are the strength of the course. Sections are about the readings and how the readings fit into the world and tradition in which they were written, and thus there is a lot of opportunity to see how this plays out in the modern world and Catholic faith. As both professors are Catholic, they are quite knowledgeable about such questions and a wonderful resource. The only bad time I had in this course was when it came to the Reformation. As a Protestant, this was the first time I had heard a Catholic give a lecture on the Reformation, and he clearly was not a fan of the Protestants, especially Luther. It is a good thing though, that everyone has actual stakes in the material and cares about the project of the class.",
    "Strengths: The variety of the texts, the passion of the professors, and the knowledgeable guest lectures. The lectures were jam packed with interesting material from people who were clearly passionate about the subject material. Weaknesses: Sometimes disorganized or disjointed. There was little feedback on written assignments and always went over time.",
    "Absolutely fantastic course. Could not be improved more. Just make sure you take it with Brenzel and Eire. The pair are incredible.",
    "This was probably the best course I took at Yale.",
    "This course was well-designed with great professors. 8 wish there had been a greater writing component.",
    "Fascinating overview of the rich diversity of catholic intellectual tradition. Sometimes courses with a number of guest lecturers are weakened by that, but in this case they were great additions. Enjoyed the essays, and the exams were fair and relevant. A couple of the readings got really long, would be worthwhile to take a look at the longer works on the syllabus and see if they can be parted down for better engagement with them.",
    "Really, I cannot think of a weakness of this course. I only wish it could span two semester in order to increase the amount of time it is able to devote to the expansive list of material it covers.",
    "Could have had the readings in a course packet at tyco. It was great that the professors themselves led discussion sections.",
    "The class has countless strengths. From the professors, to the readings, to the pace, I really have nothing negative to say about this course.",
    "I loved how Professors Eire and Brenzel chose to focus almost exclusively on primary sources - except for one text, we read original sources, which really brought the ideas and issues we were discussing to life. I also really appreciated how discussion sections were led only by professors and not by teaching fellows.",
    "Very very well done course. Great professors, interesting subject, and a good balance of workload.",
    "I loved every aspect of this course. I felt the selected readings were diverse yet worked well together. The length of the reading was appropriate and both instructors pointed us in directions for further research. Both Professor Eire and Professor Brenzel did a fantastic job creating engaging lectures and a communal section environment. And, of course, the guest lecturers were incredible!",
    "I would like it if our lectures engaged more with the readings. The lectures mostly gave contextualization of the time period, but I would prefer to go in depth on certain passages of the readings.",
    "I think discussion section was fantastic, professor Eire was also super enthusiastic and friendly! On the other hand, I felt lecture had little to do with what we were tested on and often seemed to drag on. It was often unclear to me why I should care about the plethora of details we were given.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale, and there are so many things that make it so. I learned so much from lectures, and I really liked how, in addition to the lectures provided by Professor Eire and Professor Brenzel, the course also brought in guest lecturers who were experts in particular topics. I am a STEM major, and yet not only were the readings manageable, but I hugely enjoyed them too, especially the ones from the ancient and Medieval time periods. The variety in readings was a huge plus. Section was a valuable time for questions and hearing others' thoughts about the topics. I like the structure of the assessments-1 midterm, 2 papers, and a final is very manageable and wraps up the learning well. I cannot think of weaknesses to the course. There were a lot of authors they could have selected, and perhaps the professors may make changes to that if there were better ones, but overall I was very happy with the selections.",
    "The discussion section is enlightening, though lectures are often hit or miss."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommmend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in history, or other humanities. The insight of the professors and the content of the course are extremely useful in generating an informed view of history and of Catholicism.",
    "It's an interesting topic, and the professors are great, so I'd recommend it. The midterm and the final were only 50 minutes long, which was nice, but I'd be aware that there are also 2 short (5 page) papers and a section. The section was held by the professors instead of TA's so there was a little more pressure to actually do the readings, but it was great to be able to discuss the topic in depth with the professors themselves.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can, regardless of your religious background. I found it extremely enlightening. The professors are great fun and they're very open about their purpose and intention behind the course. Completing the readings was difficult for me, but definitely worth it when you can understand the time period, purpose, and intentions of the author--the lectures give you a great background to frame the readings for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is low-stress and very interesting. The midterm and final are straight-forward and the papers have really interesting prompts and manageable length (5 pages). The readings aren't too dense and the lectures are the most interesting I've had at Yale. Professors Eire and Brenzel are so passionate about the material and teaching this class. They bring so much energy that it is contagious. Also, at least a third of the lectures are taught by guest professors who are experts in their fields and as passionate if not more passionate than Eire and Brenzel.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for a freshman as an introduction to history lectures, and to other students as a genuinely interesting class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! This may be the best course I have taken at Yale. The course is an opportunity to put real thought into important religious questions and to engage with authors and professors who have done the same already. (Brenzel was a monk for a few years!) The investment made into the course is wonderful, and I wish that all courses were taught with such care. As a Protestant, the course raised serious questions for me about the origins of the Reformation and the history of the Church which I am glad to have had experience with.",
    "Please take this course! It will be an intellectual challenge for any student of any major and will leave you with a deeper understanding and hopefully respect for the Catholic Tradition. It is a great fifth class.",
    "Yes, a thousand times over, especially if you are secular. It will change the way you view Catholicism and faith.",
    "Yes, I would. I found that the amount of reading was a lot but it was all very interesting and useful.",
    "This is probably the best course I have taken at Yale. Take it.",
    "Fun, easy class with interesting content. Good fifth class.",
    "definitely",
    "Absolutely. This course introduces students to a major player in the development of the western world, i.e., Catholicism and the Catholic Church, that is often ignored in other Yale courses.",
    "Definitely. Everyone, especially the Catholics, could benefit from learning the foundations of the most prolific religion in western society. If you are a Catholic, you will probably never have read\/heard about any of this material. If you are not, some of this stuff may be confusing but it will be very enlightening, as Catholicism has a strong intellectual tradition that is not often discussed.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you are not Catholic take this course! The professors make the material easily digestible, and this class was never a bore.",
    "Whether Catholic or not, I highly recommend this course. I had attended Catholic school up until attending Yale, and I still gained a plethora of information from this class. If you want to learn about context as well as delving into important texts throughout the course of Catholic history, I would highly recommend this class. The professors are excellent, too.",
    "I would urge any student at Yale to take the class - it was an absolutely incredible intellectual experience for me.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. I really enjoyed all of the readings, and Professors Eire and Brenzel were excellent. One of the highlights of this course was also the many guest lectures.",
    "Yes, it was a very fun and engaging course with exceptional professors.",
    "Absolutely!!! This course is mind-opening and challenging in the best of ways. It is the kind of stimulating course I hoped to find at Yale, and certainly one of the best courses I've taken thus far. I knew very little about Catholicism entering the course, and I feel I've learned a tremendous amount in a short time. Many of the readings, I think my section would agree, are simply tremendous and even lifechanging!",
    "If you are interested in theology, take it! These works shaped modern western thought. It will blow your minds how much these works shaped the way you live your life everyday without you even knowing it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have interest in Catholicism, philosophy, or scholarly work. I found some of the readings and a good amount of the lectures dull, but some people found them fascinating. That being said, I greatly enjoyed my section and overall I would say I enjoyed the course.",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is a wonderful, wonderful class, and I highly recommend it to Catholics and non-Catholics (including non-Christians). It will make you rediscover or rethink everything that you know about the Catholic Church, as well as teach you a lot that you didn't expect. The readings were varied and manageable, and there was only 1 midterm, 2 short papers, and a final. Professor Brenzel and Professor Eire are both great, and they gave fantastic lectures.",
    "The professors are very knowledgable and easily approachable, and always willing to answer questions. I would recommend this course for the enlightening reading."
