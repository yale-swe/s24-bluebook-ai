   "comments": [
    "This a great class that really melds two different disciplines: English and film.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "A great way to fulfill the senior requirement. Walsh was incredible at directing class discussion",
    "Decent class some of the movies are weird.",
    "Take it!! The class was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. The syllabus had an interesting mix of films that provided a fruitful comparison to the original plays. The structure was really manageable (weekly screening and seminar), and I really liked Professor Walsh's analysis of the films. I feel more comfortable not only with my analysis of Shakespearean films, but also with cinema more broadly. Prof. Walsh really gave us the leeway to explore parts of class discussion that we were interested in in greater depth, which I think really motivated us to engage more deeply with the material. Prof. Walsh has been one of my favorite professors at Yale. He has a kind and supportive demeanor that really makes you comfortable in challenging yourself and taking on harder materials. He led seminar well, really getting people to thoughtfully contribute.",
    "A great senior seminar. Come wanting to talk, come wanting to learn about film. Make sure you know the plays, and actually watch the movies. Go to the screenings once in a while. It's quite fun!",
    "Take it! It's a fun senior sem (although I'm not a senior) that involves watching a fantastic array of Shakespeare films (many of which you'd probably never have watched otherwise!). Walsh is a great discussion moderator and is full of knowledge about the film and the plays they are based on. I'd recommend this class to anyone looking to see Shakespeare in a new way (or to anyone looking to watch some killer films all semester).",
    "Study of how Shakespeare on screen has evolved from the 1940s to today, and what it means to view Shakespeare out of contextual time, geography, culture, and and\/or language.",
    "Shakespeare on Film is a course that explores a modern history of Shakespeare plays as portrayed on screen. The class deals with American films as well as adaptations based in other cultures such as Japanese and Indian. The course poses the question of why Shakespeare films are worthwhile and whether they offer anything that cannot be provided on a stage. Also, the question of adaptation versus appropriation is considered over the arc of the course. I would absolutely recommend this class. The workload is incredibly manageable, especially if you are already familiar with the plays, and Professor Walsh is wonderful. The movies are really good for the most part as well."
