    "Yes, good 5th class",
    "I really loved this course. I think both Prof. Bhullar and Prof. Briggs were great lecturers and cared a lot about the class. The other students in the class, however, were really disengaged which was incredibly frustrating and nearly ruined it. The TFs said this term was an anomaly and I hope that is true because it bordered on disrespectful to the TFs and professors.",
    "The second half of the class is interesting. Take it if you're interested in dinosaurs and how life evolved, but don't expect this to be an easy science credit. I would recommend this class, but with a warning.",
    "This class is excellent for majors and nonmajors alike. It is a well taught and well organized class. The lecture slides are all posted online, but it is very difficult to learn without attending lecture regularly. However, for those in the class who attend regularly, the class is simple and clear.",
    "This class is a great class! There is very little written work, but you don't find yourself wanting for any enrichment. Professors Briggs and Bhullar are incredible and the curriculum is really fun. It's great for humanities majors if you need a science credit, but I imagine STEM majors will get even more out of it.",
    "Very interesting class. The midterm was very difficult, but you are able to save your grade with the 5 page paper and other in class assignments.",
    "History of life has many interesting lectures involving the history of our world and you learn a lot in the labs and are able to see very interesting and rare specimens. There is a lot of information to know for the exams, but at the end of the course I felt like I had learned a lot.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, this is certainly not the easiest. There's a lot of memorization that covers a HUGE amount of history and the lectures can seem a bit dry and super long at times. However, the labs and the few sections really help round out the course by providing a hands-on element to the class. If you do take this class, note that there are very few opportunities for grades which can be nice when you don't have weekly work\/readings, but very stressful come midterm and finals time. You'll spend a lot of time the week before cramming. If that suits your style, then you'll be fine.",
    "This class is great.",
    "This class will change your life, irreversibly. What could be more important than understanding the history of life?",
    "I would recommend this class for people who need a SC credit or a fifth class. If you do decide to attend lecture, make sure you attend lecture and section.",
    "You'll learn a lot in this class. If Anjan is still teaching second quarter (he was new this year), you're probably going to enjoy it. Apparently we talk more about dinosaurs now than in past years, which doesn't seem like a big deal but trust me it's tough to talk about microscopic organisms for longer than is absolutely necessary. The two quarters, the first taught by Professor Briggs, the other taught by Anjan, are very different, so it was never boring (v much a concern I had going into this class). I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but I had to take it so I did, and I ended up genuinely enjoying it."
