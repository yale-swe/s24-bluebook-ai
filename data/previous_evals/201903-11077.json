   "comments": [
    "Frankly not too sure. Be wary of data? Make sure people aren't doing funny business with alpha levels? Use large sample sizes?",
    "This course gave me a newfound interest in statistics and decreased my fear of quantitative work. I feel more prepared to evaluate statistical analyses and move down the path toward performing my own.",
    "I learned to analyse whether the results from a study are accurate and reliable. I learned to be more wary of the conclusions in publications, and how to analyse whether their conclusions are warranted from the data.",
    "I started from a base of 0 stats knowledge, so this was probably the most useful of any course I took this term. I learned a ton about both the intuitive understanding of basic statistics as well as actual practical application.",
    "I came into the course with no knowledge of statistics. For that reason, it's difficult to compare to this statistics class to other classes. However, I feel that Justin provided us with a deep understanding of all the concepts we learned, from things as basic as the mean to more complex analytical methods such as bivariate regression. I think the concepts we learned naturally built on each other and that the class was clearly designed with care. Even though I came in with no background experience, the class taught me tools for critically evaluating research by examining assumptions and by learning the potential and pitfalls of drawing inferences from samples. While I'm nervous for the work ahead, I plan to take the plunge and continue on to the next level of stats with Justin.",
    "Without any previous background besides High-school Stats (I didn't even know what a p-value was), I learned how to estimate confidence intervals and conduct significance tests for means and proportions, as well as the basics of linear regressions, and how to use Stata. But more importantly, besides conducting them, I understood what they were and why they are calculated the way they are estimated. While studying for the final exam, I was truly surprised to realize the number of things we were able to learn in four months. Although I have not received my final evaluation, I felt great satisfaction while reviewing for the test and while conducting the final exam, because I realized how worthwhile taking the course had been.",
    "I learned about statistical and quantitative methods and research. We covered basic concepts, estimation from samples to populations, to comparisons on means, associations with degree of strength and regressions.",
    "I learned how careful you need to be when you're doing statistics or reading statistics; I learned to be skeptical and to look at methodology and to fact check",
    "A very comprehensive understanding of basic statistics and their application.",
    "An introduction to statistics, including data collection, data description, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, measures of association, and regression. The examples were clearly oriented toward policymakers.",
    "I believe the most valuable takeaway from this course was the skeptical, analytical mindset that Professor Thomas trained me and my classmates to harness as \"consumers of research\". The ability to intellectually criticize unscrupulous statistical publications is rare among policy professionals and I feel uniquely capable in this regard as I think about my post-Yale career. This skill is above and beyond what I expected from the course, adding layers and depth to what I thought was going to be material identical to my AP Stat class. Personally, I greatly enjoyed the theoretical deep dives the class took into understanding the reasons for and implications of making assumptions for conducting various inference tests. It was a helpful learning technique that made the requirement to memorize all steps of every test much more easy and logical. Review questions littered throughout the PowerPoint slides were excellent checks for understanding. In a general sense, the knowledge and skills I gained were how to conduct various tests to determine whether a sample statistic was statistically significant, how to produce an interval estimate for a population parameter, and understanding how to evaluate measures and strengths of association between different types of variables and which tests to use for each.",
    "How to think about research methods in social science",
    "In-depth knowledge of statistical measure and theoretical uses of each; introductory skills into analyzing regressions.",
    "A solid foundation of statistical theory.",
    "a respect for statistics and its complexity, the important of questioning assumptions and thinking critically about conclusions",
    "Not just a basic understanding of stats but about the assumptions that underpin the calculations we make. How to be a careful researcher and understand what we can and cannot conclude from various tests and intervals.",
    "A greatly improved understanding of the fundamentals of statistics, despite having had 4 years of stats-heavy economics undergraduate training. By far the most useful course of my first semester at Jackson and at Yale.",
    "I had no previous stats experience, so I learned a lot throughout the semester.",
    "I really didn't have a strong statistics\/analysis background, so this course was absolutely beneficial in giving me some basic skills needed to evaluate research. It had great carryover to other courses - as the semester progressed, I was able to apply what I learned in 802 to better understand and critically think about the materials and papers in front of me. Overall, this course really taught me that those \"results\" paragraphs in research papers really need to be viewed with a healthy amount of skepticism, and that there are a host of options out there to evaluate and compare data - and not all are equal.",
    "Better familiarity of Stata; much better understanding of the logic underlying popular statistical methods, which I find extremely helpful.",
    "I left the class with a basic understanding of what key concepts to keep in mind when presented with data.",
    "The foundations of statistical inference and some tests for simple statistical analysis.",
    "A very strong basis in stats theory was provided. And i now feel equipped to pursue stats further at the graduate level"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course used Stata the exact wrong amount. We had to buy access to this program, and all we really used it for was a handful of homework problems. I did not walk away from the course with any real understanding of how to use Stata. The instructor should either lean into Stata, and make it an actual part of in-class instruction (section doesn't count; that's not actually a part of class) so we get something out of it, or eliminate it entirely. This sorta halfway point we've settled on is the useless either way.",
    "No weaknesses; Justin Thomas is a wonderful instructor and the structure of the class is extremely clear and logical.",
    "Professor Thomas' teaching is excellent and I am fortunate to have been one of his students. Overall, the course was a bit too strongly theoretical; integrating more practical activities (such as reviewing published papers together and assessing the strength of their inferences - especially later on in the class) would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: JT is a fantastic, engaging teacher. He knows just how much to explain in one go, and is able to make dry content seem interesting and relevant. Weaknesses: The course workload is quite high - problem sets take a very long time to do, and seem at times repetitive. I would have also appreciated if we had spent less time on different types of significant tests\/ CI and more time actually analysing the results from policy papers, seeing as most of us will be interpreting and not running the studies ourselves.",
    "To be honest, I found the class tedious at times, particularly when we got into more theoretical concepts. However, by the end of the semester, I came to really appreciate how the material built on what came before it and how thoughtfully ordered the material was. Justin hammered home points that I didn't fully appreciate at the time but when it came time to apply our knowledge to more advanced concepts, it felt easier because of that preparation. That being said, I found the problem sets a little long and repetitive. While I get that Justin was trying to ensure we fully understood the material, I think that could have been accomplished with fewer problems. I would have liked to see more real-world applications, particularly since the class was oriented towards policy. Focusing on real-world examples might have clarified things more those without a stats background or those struggling with the concepts. I thought the exams were completely fair - not too easy but the amount of time you spent reviewing the materials was correlated with success on the tests (which is more than I can say for other classes).",
    "The main strength is having such a fantastic instructor. I also think that the course is well designed, with well-thought problem sets that (although sometimes a bit too long) really help us make sense of what we are learning in class. The course requires a lot of time and effort, but I always felt it was necessary and worthwhile. The main weakness is probably the lack of time to cover all of the subjects. The course can feel too stacked at times and at some point it seems inevitable to feel a little bit lost. That being said, there are always resources to get back on track. Slides were definitely the most useful tool for me to do so. I also would have liked to practice how to use the skills we learned in evaluating data analysis on a paper. It would have been interesting to talk a bit more in class about that with real examples of good and poor analysis.",
    "The course is very organized and it goes from the very basic concepts to very complicated ones. It can be very difficult for people who don't have any quantitative background, but Justin is always available. As someone with no quantitative background, the problem sets were essential for me to understand what was covered in class. The readings in the book were not as useful, especially if read before Justin's lecture. The lecture notes are amazing. The course goes extremely fast and sometimes it's hard to follow in class, but lecture notes and problem sets help with this issue.",
    "The material is pretty complicated; it was helpful to have teaching assistants and to have a focus on why each thing we were learning would be relevant to our future work; it would've been nice to look at a specific study or two to try to analyze how the statistics are calculated and interpreted in a real scenario; it was nice having two short classes per week",
    "An amazing course. I have taken introductory statistics several times in the past, and it has never been taught as deliberately and with so much thought to pedagogy as this class. Professor Thomas is an amazing communicator and has clearly thought a lot about how to teach the material in a way that is both useful and built on a strong theoretical foundation.",
    "One clear strength of this course was the volume of content it managed to cover in only one semester (without feeling rushed). On finishing the course, I felt as though I had developed some very real technical skills that I would be able to apply in a professional context. On a (very small) number of occasions, the course was let down because the teaching fellows didn't have a background in the course material. At times they struggled to answer questions, and there were errors in how assignments were marked. However, to their credit, they made every effort to fix these issues.",
    "The problem sets are too long. It is pointless to do computations by hand. More emphasis should have been placed in software. It is pointless to use paid software, when most in the real world use open software.",
    "STRENGTHS: I am an enormous advocate for how lectures were conducted, particularly in regards to: (a) Questions over fundamentals that went along the lines of \"now I know you all know this and don't be offended but humor me and I'm going to ask anyway to make sure...\" and \"Lionel Thomas says we can eyeball the difference - why is he wrong?\"; (b) Professor Thomas always responded to student questions and answers with respect, positivity, and compassion; (c) LIFE AND TIMES! Outstanding transitional technique to help me get in the headspace for the incoming hour-and-a-half of class. The material can admittedly be quite dry but I never felt bored or disinterested in class. Problem sets were helpful tools to reinforce class concepts and prepare for tests. WEAKNESSES: I enjoyed being introduced to Stata but felt the amount we used was not necessarily optimally balanced. I kind of wish we either went all-in on the statistical package and did everything in Stata or we dropped it from the class altogether. Also, I believe R to be a more useful package for researchers.",
    "Strengths: He makes you really understand the assumptions and reasoning behind statistical rules and formulas. So even if you don't remember the formula, you still learn how to critically think about research methods. AS a person who do not plan to take any advanced statistics course, I feel like I learned something that will sill stay relevant to my studies and work. Weakness: Some problem sets took way too long (~6 hrs) to finish, and the questions were a bit redundant. The grading scheme for problem sets was a bit unclear. To the extent possible, using other programming languages could have been more useful, but this is not a major issue.",
    "Strengths of the course are the quality of the instructor, the constant engagement with the students throughout all kinds of material, and the appropriate difficulty of problem sets and exams. The main weakness of the course was its pacing: at times the material moved very slowly, and the lectures spent a long time with the theoretical foundations of the concepts. While this is good for most statistics courses, this seemed to take time away from the end of the semester that was dedicated to regressions, which is of more use to most policy students. The course would benefit if students were required to complete a \"math camp\" of some sort prior to the start of the semester, which covered basic calculus (for the economics course) and basic statistics (like mean\/median\/mode, variance, etc.). If this were the case, this course could jump right in to more complex material from the start (such as significance tests\/confidence intervals), and more time would be left for the more advanced material. Another suggestion would be that the course involve reading and analyzing one academic paper per week, that would use concepts learned in class and have students analyze results. This would be difficult with the start of the semester if the material is still basic, but if the last 4-6 weeks were all devoted to linear regressions this would align better.",
    "Strengths- - Excellent professor - TAs were rigorous in reviewing problem sets, which was very useful Weaknesses - Limited office hours: schedule allowed for only 10 minute meetings per week, way too short (though the professor was quitw accesible and tried to set up extra time when needed) - Problem sets were reviewed with several weeks delay (we did not receive the last two before the exam) - TAs were had limited statistical knowledge: they had not taken the course previously, and in several times could not respond to questions from students (though they did check with the professor and came back with the answer afterwards) - We werent able to finish analyzing real-world statistical evaluations in academic papers which, given the nature of the course and the students (future policymakers), should the whole point. It would have made all the difference in the world: one didnt come out of the class feeling he\/she had learned practical knowledge.",
    "JT has to teach this class. He taught it in a perfect way given the various backgrounds we all came in with at Jackson. Even as someone who has a stats background this was an incredibly valuable class to think about why we are able to conclude what we conclude, and when to use a certain test. Weakness - felt like some people just asked too many questions and we didn't cover as much as we could have. Really think we need to have a follow up course here because there's so much more that we need to dive into with multiple regression, etc. Think Jackson should make students take a full year of stats because as great as this was, we just need more time to get into the weeds.",
    "Justin Thomas is the best statistics teacher I have ever had. He was engaging, is a natural at explaining difficult concepts to people at all levels, and the course was built to deliver value to both the stats-uninitiated and those with many years of economics\/econometrics training.",
    "Strong class conceptually, but a lot of one's success in the class depended on attending our \"optional\" section, which was scheduled after we had set the rest of our schedule. So if you were unable to attend section, you would be in a rough position. Also, there should have been some more time dedicated to how to run things in Stata in the lecture, rather than section.",
    "I see why we spent a lot of time with some of the basic areas - ensures that we are all on the same page, provides a solid foundation, etc. But I think we spent so much time on the first 1\/3 of the course, that it prevented us from maybe going a little farther later on. I understand that there are possible follow-on courses that address this, so that is probably not a big issue.",
    "Improve: practice applying what we learned to actual papers",
    "More time spent on linear regression would be helpful since most social sciences research nowadays use that. But otherwise, I love the course as it is--it has the right blend of homework assignments, which I find integral to developing better grasp of the materials, theories, etc.",
    "Professor Thomas was very well organized in his approach, and did a really good job of explaining how the lessons we were learning could be applied to a potential professional context. I also really appreciated how dedicated he was to making sure we understood the theoretical grounding of the various tests we were asked to run. Weaknesses -- we never got a chance to evaluate research papers in this class. I think that should be prioritized in the future either during lecture or in problem sets. The Stata component of the course was a bit haphazard.",
    "Strengths: Justin is an excellent and engaging professor. He focuses on not only teaching you what to do, but why you do those things and what happens if key assumptions are broken. Weaknesses: The problem sets were a little long. The teaching fellows were excellent but it would have been better if they had more background in statistics."

    "Yes, although I think it would be more relevant for someone if there was more policy-interpretation in the course.",
    "Yes. This was excellent at giving me a solid, practical foundation for understanding and evaluating others' research.",
    "This was a required class for Jackson students so it feels a little funny to recommend it to others. While I haven't taken Justin's advanced class, it may be more practical for students to take two semesters' worth of stats because the more applicable analysis seems to be concentrated in the second semester. I think this class provides a solid foundation for future work in stats. However, I'm not sure we went far enough for the class to be a game changer in terms of statistical analysis.",
    "Yes. I would recommend to any student, and particularly one without previous background experience on the subject, learning statistics with Justin Thomas.",
    "Yes, definitely recommended. It helps students gain a broad understanding of research language and fundamental methods of analysis.",
    "Yes it was a very helpful course and very well taught",
    "Certainly. I cannot imagine a better statistics class.",
    "Yes. The content covered in the course is a helpful introduction to statistics, analysis and interpreting analysis conducted by others. It also did a good job of building rapport for first year Jackson students in their \ufffdfirst semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The knowledge is fundamental for most career paths, the professor is a kind, knowledgeable, and effective lecturer, and the assignments are fair and constructive.",
    "N\/A",
    "Yes, if they are looking for an introductory crash course into statistics and have little to no experience with the subject.",
    "For those without any statistical background wanting to learn the basics, yes. It is a very friendly way of learning.",
    "Jackson has to keep stats in its core requirements. It'd be crazy to get rid of it.",

He was engaging, is a natural at explaining difficult concepts to people at all levels, and the course was built to deliver value to both the stats-uninitiated and those with many years of economics\/econometrics training.",
    "Yes, although it had a very fast pace, so I would recommend someone balancing their semester with some less intensive courses.",
    "Yes - especially if that student is going from a baseline of zero in this realm. The course work, problem sets, and exams really reinforce each other to teach the material effectively.",
    "Yes, I think all global affairs grad students should take this course even if they do not plan to use statistics in their work in the near future.",
    "I would recommend this course. From what I could tell, students with little quantitative background left the course feeling more confident about their ability to make sense of statistical data, while students with a quantitative background left with a stronger theoretical understanding of the concepts they had learned previously.",
    "Absolutely. I came from a background in econometrics and didn't expect to enjoy this course or learn anything from it. But Justin managed to unveil a deeper layer of understanding of and appreciation for the subject matter. By far the best statistics class I've taken.",
    "Very much so. Prof Thomas is an engaging teacher and the course is very well structured to allow for stats knowledge building."
