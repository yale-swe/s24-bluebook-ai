    "Well, if this is offered in the future, I would say make sure to do all the readings and really dig deep into them. You get out of it what you put into it. Also, get started on the paper early and be sure to meet with a librarian about it. Professor Snowden will give you all the help you need.",
    "Readings every week (often an entire book) and then discussion\/debate about them during section. I was hoping the professor would share his own experiences with the topic during class, but he definitely came at the subject as a historian, not a field expert. Only work besides readings is the 20-25 page paper at the end. I honestly learned just as much in writing my paper than in all of the classes. The professor tries to make the paper-writing process as painless as possible, and it is indeed painless if you pick an interesting topic, but 25 pages is 25 pages.",
    "Great class, though I think Snowden is retiring after this year. I enjoyed learning about the history of malaria and loved a majority of the books that we had to read for class. The only downside is that I couldn't anticipate how Snowden graded because we were never graded on tangible assignments, so I left the class feeling very uncertain about where I stood. I really enjoyed writing the paper (I know--who says that?) mainly because it was interesting to dive so deeply into this subject and the length of the paper allowed me to explore more on the topic than I would in other courses. Also, no matter how much Snowden encouraged us to start writing the paper early, everyone ended up finishing it at the last minute. Overall, good class, good discussion, lots of insight!",
    "Interesting class for anyone interested in global health -- does a great job of incorporating political history with public health campaigns. not a huge workload, but the final paper is a lot of work. the good thing is you have a great opportunity to go really in depth on a topic.",
    "Would highly recommend. Although Snowden is leaving, I hope that another professor will offer a similar course on a disease like malaria that still has such an impact on society today.",
    "If you are looking for a survey course in history of medicine this is a really good course. You learn a lot about malaria, but also come out of the class learning about how the history of medicine is written and how it is relevant for contemporary global health. The final essay is a lot of work, so if you are not a paper person, this might not be the class for you.",
    "Great overview of the history and modern challenges of malaria, though the latter part is a little lacking. I would recommend this course to another student, and I hope another professor will take up the reigns or start a similar course now that Professor Snowden is retiring. Manageable weekly readings and a 20-25 page paper that ended up being stressful, of course, but surprisingly fun.",
    "You learn about malaria in different places and different approaches to tackling the problem. Really great for those with an interest in public health, infectious disease etc.",
    "It's really fun and engaging. However, the final paper (usually a 20-25 page paper) tends to be the biggest struggle. Do take it though, malaria is more than just a mosquito biting a person."
