   "comments": [
    "Straightforward lecture to learn microeconomics. You'll get good notes -- it'd be important to go to class and actually take the notes, if not to just first get exposed to the material to study later. For me at least, I couldn't learn at all in class, so I basically read the entire textbook and studied my notes, which worked but wasn't the easiest or most enjoyable process.",
    "Great course. You will have to study a good bit if you want an A but nothing is horribly hard. You will walk out with a strong base in Microeconomics",
    "The curve often scares kids away, but in my experience, kids often come away with a stronger understanding and a better grade than they would've in the lecture class. And even if you're not extremely interesting in Econ, I'd say take it just for Tolga--he's a professor who's there to teach and who's there because he's interested in you, and that makes all the difference in the world. A great class to get acclimated to college with, and to test your study habits.",
    "I believe I learned a lot in the seminar because I feel more connected to my professor. I would recommend the course. It is not the most exciting class I've ever taken, but it definitely provides a solid foundation for many majors besides just Econ.",
    "I would definitely suggest the seminar format for another student interested in microeconomics or in the economics major",
    "I would recommend ECON 110 only for those who really want to delve into economics. I've heard that this course is much more difficult than its lecture counterpart, and that the grading system is harder too. However, you do get a more detailed and thorough introduction into economics.",
    "I would summarize the course as an intensive, systematic approach to introductory microeconomic analysis. Students interested in this course should we willing to show up and engage fully in all the seminars, be dedicated to going to office hours and commit themselves fully to studying. Overall though, the reward is well worth the work.",
    "ECON 110 is an amazing introductory course to Micro economics, and I definitely recommend it to any student who might be interested in studying econ. I will say that there is a very tough curve in the class--you will need to work for your grade, so this won't be a course with a light workload. I came into Econ 110 with no background in economics whatsoever, and I definitely came out of the course having learned SO MUCH about econ, and I definitely enjoyed the course very much. Tolga is an absolutely amazing teacher who really makes sure you understand the concepts of micro economics, and uses a lot of real life applications to supplement the lessons. If you are truly interested in economics, then you should definitely take Econ 110. If you're scared about the curve or concerned about the workload, then maybe the lecture will be a better fit for you.",
    "Econ 110 is a great course if one wants to dip their feet into the field of economics. I would recommend Econ 110 if a student wished to learn about economics and in a more personal setting. It is a difficult but interesting course, so it is definitely worth the effort and time of any student.",
    "Econ 110 is an in-depth survey of microeconomics, simple as that. I'd recommend this course to any student who plans on majoring in economics, has a background of high school economics, and is confident in their mathematical and graphical analysis skills."
