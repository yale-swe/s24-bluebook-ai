   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Performance Studies. The papers are really great and leave you a lot of room to explore your interests. The readings are long, but they frame the class very well. Most of all, take this course because Professor Roach will challenge your observation skills in the most interesting and unexpected ways.",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "Interesting (if dense) readings and interesting discussions. Class discussions slightly different than readings, because class discussions seemed to be about ordinary things (the apple store) that were performances in some way; however, the readings concentrated on the analysis of actual performances...although there were still some ordinary things thrown in. Course is new so there are some things still to be worked out. For example, there was the option to create a performance at the end, but nobody took it. I think people would have been eager if the guidelines were laid out in more detail. Professor Roach's words are poetry. The man can spin a sentence like no other, instantly causing you to re-evaluate your preconceived notions. Also, easily one of the kindest, most thoughtful human beings around.",
    "This is an absolutely phenomenal course and one which any person interested in the arts or in modern sociological studies should take. Professor Roach is the course's greatest strength as he is one of the foremost experts in the field in the world and has a wealth of knowledge at his fingertips that make each class session fascinating. An absolute must take course for any theater studies student.The class discussions were lively and engaging and vacillated from the completely mundane to absolutely perplexing archaic philosophical tracts in the blink of an eye. This frustrated some students, but for a self guided student willing to invest themselves in their papers and choose topics that really fascinated them, this could be one of the best classes you take at Yale.",
    "The course lacks a little structure, but the field of Perf Studies is a big one to be covered by one class. Roach is one of the pioneers of the subject, so to discuss these topics with him is pretty cool. Changes the way any artist views performance.",
    "Performance Studies is an unusual course that draws on many different mediums in order to widen the field of what is considered \"performance\" and investigate the ways performance influences all of our lives. I would recommend it to any open-minded student interested in the arts.",
    "Introduction to Performance Studies explores a burgeoning field of research at the junction of performance and research, of theory and practice. The readings lay out certain principles that the discussions -- generally about immediately relatable subject matter -- drive home with an efficacy I've never experienced. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who wants to be constructively confused, for whom the question, \"What is performance?\" is not merely a prerequisite for exploration but the site of investigation itself.",
    "Yes, definitely. I think it's useful for anyone interested in theater, and definitely anyone interested in teaching theater. It also draws in a lot of significant work in other fields i.e. anthropology and linguistics. It's also a very enjoyable seminar."
