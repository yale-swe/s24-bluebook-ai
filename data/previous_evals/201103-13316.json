    "I think it was great and definitely reccomend it!",
    "I would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are more interested in literature and its critical analysis than the mechanics of paper writing. For me, I chose this course due to the interesting content covered in the reading material that I felt would be stimulating and motivating while at the same time allow me to learn the ins and outs of writing at Yale on an introductory level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The poetry packet is kind of boring, but the other readings (especially Watchmen) are so interesting. The workload is manageable.",
    "The reading material gets more interesting as the course progresses. The papers are difficult but get easier once you understand what the course wants of you. It is a difficult course but its enjoyable if you like english.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to improve their writing and likes dissecting literature rather than non-fiction. The reading is also not overwhelming, but well portioned and manageable.",
    "English 115 is a great class because of its small size and specific seminar topics. It was great to be in a discussion based class in which one could listen to everyone's ideas and interact with both the professor and fellow students. The writing component of the class definitely helped me improve as a writer. English 115 is a great way to fulfill a writing requirement while exploring an interesting topic.",
    "Heroes and Hero Worship was an excellent course. If you have an opportunity to take a seminar with Justin Sider, do it. He is friendly, helpful and a great teacher. He is accessible, provides good feed-back and in special instances will bake cookies. He is not overly critical, and will help you form your ideas both in class and in papers.As for the class, it's a great introduction to analyzing many forms of literature and how to form coherent arguments using your writing. You will become a better reader and writer. If you considered yourself an inexperienced writer, you will see quite a bit growth when you compare your first and last papers.The workload isn\u0092t too bad, so much as you manage time well and don't procrastinate. The paper deadlines are generous and pre-draft exercises keep you on track. Some of the course-packet readings are a bit dense, but are things you should learn how to read anyway. Many of the main readings required are pretty interesting and in the case of this past seminar we analyzed The Hurt Locker (the movie) and Watchmen (the comic book). Class discussion is interesting, but you have to do the readings and be willing to participate (otherwise there will be awkward silences).In terms of grading, you will get what you deserve. Put in the effort and make sure to make your papers coherent andinteresting and you will get a good grade. It's very fair. Overall I really enjoyed the experience."
