    "If you are interested in UN peace operations, or even more generally, how to thoroughly analyze and critique governmental organizations, this is a great course. If you want every question to have an answer, this might not be the class for you: there's a lot of \"it depends\" conclusions in class.I have learned a lot about how to clearly communicate my ideas about course concepts over the course of the semester, and I feel that I received honest and thoughtful feedback from the instructor throughout (more truly helpful constructive criticism than I've encountered elsewhere in the department). It is not a light workload either, but it is manageable.",
    "Overall the course was very interesting. I learned a lot about peace operations and felt I gained a lot from the class. However, the discussions sometimes felt repetitive. Also, there were a lot of assignments (2 memos, 2 presentations, and a 15-25 page paper or final exam). I'd recommend it if you want to gain a broad understanding of the role of the UN in international conflicts.",
    "Recommend, if it is to be taught again.",
    "Inspiring professor and must- take class about world affairs",
    "This course was a great introduction to UN peace operations and provided many opportunities to delve into their different facets. The course actually has a higher than average workload, so definitely take this class if you are truly interested in the subject. I feel very good having finished, and like I learned a lot. I would take it again and I would definitely recommend it to someone else!",
    "Introduction to UN Peace Operations and core concepts current policy makers face in approaching conflict resolution. Would definitely recommend for those interested in learning about the UN.",
    "It's a very interesting course that discusses different un peace operations on a theoretical level and through case studies.",
    "Take it!"
