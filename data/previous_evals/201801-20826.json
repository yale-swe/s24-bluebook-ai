    "I learned how to compare past institutions with new ones and see their application for today",
    "I learnt about institutional change over time, how to write an economic research paper applying models and research methods from earlier papers. I also learnt how to read a complex economics paper and identify the key messages and points.",
    "I really appreciated that the class went through the models and regressions as well as the historical context for each aspect of institutional design",
    "I learned about a very distinct, interesting field of economics. I developed a framework for analyzing \"institutions\" in the economic sense of the word.",
    "This course challenged ideas on institutions, their longevity, their responses to shocks and their changes over time. It was, to some extent, an Economic History course. The papers were often very engaging."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Broad reading materials, mix of different forms of assessment and testing (problem sets, papers, presentation, participation, reading response), the way the final paper is worked on throughout the semester. Weaknesses: In class lecture style of teaching for a seminar was at times boring and not as engaging as I hoped.",
    "Strengths - I greatly enjoyed the material in the course, and I thought it was well-organized into different topic-areas. Prof. Espin-Sanchez was super helpful in explaining the overall argument in each paper. I also really enjoyed the final project and presentations (and thought it could have been expanded or stretched over several weeks). Weaknesses - The topics covered sometimes felt too broad or too large-scale to really be able to discuss the mechanisms of any particular economic institution. There were weeks (technology especially), where I felt while the topic was important, they didn't really fit with other weeks. It also meant that not everyone was interested in each week, because it spanned so many topics. Despite being an upper-level seminar, it ended being a more general survey course on \"institutional economics\". I think the structure of the economics program is actually partially to blame for this, since many people in the class came in with relatively little knowledge of formal political economy (since it is not really taught in micro\/macro). I feel like the class\/topic area could be split into a lower-level survey on say, economic history(much like this class was), and a higher-level focused on some particular aspect of economic institutions.",
    "Firstly, the second half of the semester's topics and readings were significantly more engaging than the first half. However, the concepts we learned in the first half gave us a more nuanced understanding of the broader concepts in the second half. In addition, the final paper is fun to write as you are encouraged too write about anything relating to institutional change. The final presentations were a great way to learn about the ways and the industries in which we can view and analyze institutional change. Would have liked more in class discussions."

    "Yes. Interesting and not super workload heavy senior Econ seminar.",
    "This class was one of best classes I've taken within the Economics department. I felt like I learned a lot, applied methods and knowledge from earlier econ classes, and was constantly engaging with the material. That being said, do not underestimate - the class does have a heavy workload which is a mix of busy work and application based\/ intellectually challenging assignments. Prof. Espin-Sanchez is so cool, he is down to earth, realistic about his expectations (which are high!) and wants the best for his students. He focuses on making sure that we have learned and prioritizes that over grades, while still grading our work fairly. He is relaxed but still expects a lot from us. Take this class but go in with a good attitude about approaching the sometimes dense and dull material, also PARTICIPATE, it only makes class more entertaining. The worst classes were the ones in which barely anyone spoke besides the teacher. Also not very quantitative if that's your vibe.",
    "Yes! Would recommend if you want to acquire skills to read econonetrics papers and if youre interested in economic history in general",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in economic history, or just a slightly different framework for analysis than taught in intermediate micro\/macro, take this course.",
    "If you are interested in institutional change, take it! Really interesting material and the course demands are not unbearable."
