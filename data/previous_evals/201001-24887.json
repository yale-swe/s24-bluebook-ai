   "comments": [
    "yes!",
    "I would summarize Classical Civilization 255 as a pretty straightforward introduction to Latin literature. I would recommend it to non-Classics majors interested in the subject. My advice to Classics majors (for whom this course is required) is to read as much of the material in Latin as possible and to devote time to studying secondary literature on subjects of interest. Professor Freudenburg is very laid-back, intelligent, and approachable, and I would count him among the course's greatest strengths.",
    "The class isn't very hard... reading load is very manageable, Freudenburg basically reiterates the important points of the reading in class. There isn't really a lot of pushing in this class. You read the books, and if you've read them, you do well. Not a whole lot of close reading necessary. You'll get to read a bunch of the highlights of latin literature, which is a good experience.",
    "It's a requirement, but yes, I'd recommend it. It's fun, you learn a lot, and it's not a ton of work.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "I imagine the only people who would take the course are people required to take it, but I would absolutely recommend it to any and everyone because of the way it contextualizes important Latin texts.",
    "It's a little weird that these (along with CLCV 254a) are major requirements rather than prerequisites or something - Most of the class was juniors or seniors, which meant that for the Latinists especially, a good deal of this was probably incredibly redundant. As someone who was more familiar with the Classical Greek canon, though, it was definitely helpful.",
    "Most of the students who take this course won\u0092t have a choice, as it\u0092s required for both classics and classical civilization majors. Students from other disciplines might also get a lot out of this course \u0096 no Latin is assumed and you will be immersed in some fascinating literature \u0096 but be aware you might feel like you\u0092re competing with people who do have more background. I took this course my senior spring, but I think it could certainly be taken profitably earlier \u0096 maybe not freshman year, but certainly asa sophomore or a junior. The professor\u0092s great, the workload is reasonable, and the readings come from all different genres, which mean at least some will really pique your interest.",
    "For majors, luckily you're stuck taking this class. For non-majors, it's a pretty cool chance to read a wide range of Latin literature.",
    "If you're worried this class might be really boring, don't worry: it isn't at all. So long as Kirk Freudenburg's teaching it. It's hard to make a survey of works in translation compelling, but he did it! I took this class as a disillusioned senior Classics major and it almost single-handedly rekindled my interest in the field. It's that good.The books are wonderful, of course, especially if you can look at the Latin originals too. Freudenburg does a terrific job tying all the works together and giving you a sense of the Roman mindset and world. I really, really enjoyed this.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to expose yourself to the most influential works of ancient Rome."
