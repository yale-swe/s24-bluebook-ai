    "If you are in this class, it is extremely likely that you have taken a previous Japanese class at Yale. If you have, you basically know what it is like. This class is heavily based on the textbook Sura Sura (amazing), which focuses on readings on a broad range of topics. The course also focuses on many media assignments from Japanese movies and TV shows, and introduces some long form writing assignments. Of course, the skits are always fun!"
