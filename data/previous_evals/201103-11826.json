    "I would summarize this class as an introduction to film studies and African American culture. Though the course focuses on Spike Lee, I found that I learned a lot about other figures in the history of filmmaking and African American history. I would recommend this class to another student, especially if they have an interest in African American studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course and freshman seminars in general! It was a great way to meet people from different colleges in our class. While you engage in intellectual discussions, it is a very different type of class which was very nice.",
    "I highly recommend this seminar for other students. The students in my class enjoyed it so much that we went to Brooklyn to meet Spike Lee. Take this course if you can.",
    "I came into this class not watching a single Spike Lee Joint and I barely knew who Spike Lee was. However, I had an interest in his film's themes and controversial messages and style. This class opened my eyes to the world of film and how to analyze along with engaging in interesting discussions of race, sexuality, and film! Professor Francis is very knowledgable and relates to her students. Plus, watching a film with your class on a weeknight is fun and a chance to step out of your Yale bubble and step into the world of Spike Lee. Take the class if its topics interest you. Ya dig?",
    "The freshmen seminar on Spike Lee is a really interesting course because it focuses on a person who is still producing films today, so the study is continuously changing and is not based on textbooks. I learned a lot not only about Spike Lee, but also about racial issues facing today's society so I would definitely recommend it to another student."
