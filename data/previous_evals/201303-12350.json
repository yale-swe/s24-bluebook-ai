    "This class is very helpful and I recommend it to students major in EE, Applied Physics and Chemical Engineering.",
    "Recommend",
    "Yes, I would recommend",
    "It was a great course covering a lot of important topics in APHY so I'd definitely recommend it to other students...I think I already have multiple times in fact.",
    "It is a terrific introduction to solid state physics. I would highly recommend taking this class to any student with an interest in solid state physics.",
    "Yes. This course is helpful for students whose major is material science. Because knowledge of crystals is very foundamental to study the properties of materials.",
    "Solid undergraduate condensed matter course that is absolutely necessary to a sound physics education. Come prepared to motivate yourself on occasions when to going gets tough.",
    "Yes, of course. This course basically covers all the fundamental ideas of solid state physics, paving the way for further learning of more advanced courses.",
    "ENAS 850 is a lecture based-course discussing solid state physics. The lecture rigorously discusses ranging from basic to complex topics in solid state physics. I would recommend engineering& applied physics students to take this class since the course material is very important and are the basics in many material science-based research.",
    "Yes, because from this course I learn a lot"

   "comments": [
    "It's very helpful. Although I am doing optics, it helps me understand photonic crystals better.",
    "Very Helpful",
    "This course helped me get a better grasp on reciprocal space as well as diffraction and semiconductors. However most of the rest of the course wasn't too relevant to my field.",
    "I think this course is an essential part of a physics education. There are analogies to and from solid state in numerous different systems, and it definitely has helped with my optics research, from deepening my understanding of light\/matter interactions to giving me the simple realization that electron energy bands are just due to Bragg reflection, just like a photonic band gap in a photonic crystal. Physics is pretty cool.",
    "This course provided further insight to fundamental techniques of evaluating solids that is readily useful in research.",
    "The knowledge I learned from this class helps me a lot on my Special Investigation. Some of the chapters serve as the theories of the introduction part ofmy presentation. So it greatly helps my projects.",
    "My first solid state professor was an experimentalist, and very much focused on the electronics properties of solids. Consequentially, a large proportion of our time was spent discussing the DOS and Fermi surface. This course definitely shored up my understanding of the phonon-related properties of solids that I was admittedly rather weak on.",
    "I should say it is definitely good to review what I've learned in college solid state course. Without these foundations, it will be hardto proceed to Solid State 2, which is more advanced. But actually we used to cover more topics in a detailed fashion, due to adequacy of time.",
    "Overall, the course was very helpful for my research. Since my research is based on material science, the materials learnt from this class will be extremely helpful in understanding the nature of the materials I use in the research.",
    "Yes"
