    "Yes, but the course requires you to spend a lot time reviewing the lecture by yourself (besides reading).",
    "Most of the class, including myself, was taking it cr\/d, so section and such (which was run by the prof because the course was small) was awkward. There's a lot of reading but it wasn't particularly necessary. Otherwise there's a 5-page midterm paper, 10-page final, and a final exam, which was rough mostly because the amount of terms we were expected to know wasn't narrowed down at all (there was a semester's worth to learn). It was a fine 5th class but it wasn't particularly inspiring, and Professor Friedman was pretty intense when leading section.",
    "Yes, soviet history is very interesting",
    "This course is pretty good for soviet history. The teacher speaks very quickly and has some pretty strong biases about the course. Expect to learn a lot about China and the eastern bloc.",
    "It was a very good class, overall. The readings were very well-chosen and interesting. The course might get a little challenging if you don't have any prior knowledge in Soviet history, but I would say it's totally worth it! Totally take it if you are into Soviet history!",
    "I would caution other students that it's a lot of reading but if you're into Russian history you get a pretty full story.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN RUSSIAN OR SOVIET HISTORY. It is entirely focused on details which made it hard to learn anything. I have come out of the course feeling like I learned a lot of useless dates and names, but I dont really fully understand what exactly happened. It is also a lot of work for this class."
