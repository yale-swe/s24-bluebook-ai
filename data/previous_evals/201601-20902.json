    "This is an awesome introductory course to photography! Take it with Ted because he is awesome!! You will learn so much about art and photography and your way of looking at this world will never be the same.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're willing to put the time and effort into making photos. It's definitely not for someone looking for a gut, as it is very time consuming. That being said, I was pushed farther artistically than I had been pushed in any of my other classes.",
    "take this class. this art should never die.",
    "Really great class; one of my favorites I've taken at Yale! You learn a lot, and the assignments are very fun. Be warned the class is very expensive though--I probably spent $400 total on materials for the class not including the $150 materials fee from Yale (which doesn't cover paper, film, or cameras--I guess it is for chemicals? unclear). There really should be a way for students on financial aid to have some of these costs covered by financial aid, because I ended up spending a big portion of my income from my student job on this class. I'd love to take more photography classes at Yale in the future, but I'm really not sure I can afford to. I would recommend it if you can afford it.",
    "Yes. It teaches you a lot in a really short time."
