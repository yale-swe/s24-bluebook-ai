    "The class is definitely recommended to anyone in Comparative Literature or Slavic whose focus is on the modern novel (i.e. from the nineteenth century onwards).",
    "In its current form, I would not recommend this class. If the syllabus is re-vamped and the workload reduced, maybe.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student, it offers an opportunity to re-read the Russian classics and become familiar with the key theoretical approaches to the novel. But i would warn a fellow student that the course is very demanding and one should be prepared to work very hard, no exceptions."
