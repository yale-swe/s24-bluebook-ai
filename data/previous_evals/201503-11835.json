   "comments": [
    "Learn how to write a college essay through drafts, peer revision, and critical feedback. If you feel that you're writing essays at a high school level, take this class.",
    "It's a great intro writing class, and I would recommend it.",
    "A walkthrough of the mechanics of writing, informed by a topic with some disciplinary focus.",
    "It is largely dependent on whether the student would enjoy the subject matter. If one is interested in working in a cross of human psychology, social science, and political theory, then this course is perfect for that.",
    "This course is great for workshopping your writing. Sometimes it's possible to get lost in the real meanings of the readings (they aren't always thoroughly gone over during class), but overall readings are on the shorter side and manageable. Grades for the class include 4 papers (Paper 3 being the most important, a research paper), but also include participation. As with most seminar courses, it's best to be prepared and ready to converse with your classmates and the instructor.",
    "English 114 is an adequate introductory English course that instills good essay-writing techniques that will carry over into other classes and disciplines. Due to this, I recommend this course to students who are seeking to improve their writing ability.",
    "Good course that improves basic writing skills",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material can be dense and intricate but it is not too challenging - especially with the many opportunities to email the professor with questions or ask them in class. There isn't much hand-holding in the writing process but it's easy to get a second opinion on writing-in-progress from the instructor and from peers in the many in-class workshops.",
    "It is essentially a class that teaches you how to analyze material more deeply and draw in-depth conclusions. In turn, it that helps you be able to synthesize information more clearly and structure your essays better."
