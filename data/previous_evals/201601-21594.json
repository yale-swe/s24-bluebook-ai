    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to speak Chinese. If you are looking for an easy language credit this is not it.",

Given the fact that I decided to take Chinese for fun and that I've been dealing with issues of mental health, etc., I was not able to perform as well as I could have. However, if a student has the time and energy to dedicate to this class more than they do to anything else -- they will certainly gain a lot from it.",
