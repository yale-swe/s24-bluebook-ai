    "I gained great knowledge, skills, and insights from taking FES 977. More than any other course, FES 977 effectively married theory and practice, allowing me formulate a vivid conception of humanistic communications in the real world and a clear-eyed understanding of why narrative engagement tools are so effective and desperately neededparticularly in the fight against climate change.",
    "I learned the different tools for communication and systems thinking and how they're applicable in different settings outside of environmental settings.",
    "I feel much better able to understand the tools to identify pilot projects that tend and trend towards a desired outcome through an A story, particularly with regard to the different language determinants to engage different sectors.",
    "How to engage people along their value lines and how to deliver an experience to them through networks, all while achieving some climate change or sustainability outcome that the individual players in the network may not even be aware of. A new approach to environmental communications that doesn't ask for anyone to change what they belief or how they act, but makes it favorable and convenient for them to do so in accordance with positive environmental outcomes.",
    "I learnt how to engage with systems thinking.",
    "Was introduced to a new form of communication skills specifically designed towards enhancing awareness of environmental issues.",
    "I gained some insight into how to communicate and frame environmental issues to a diverse set of people and worldviews, and build programs and networks to take constructive action. Mostly, these came from the readings, which were excellent.",
    "I learned about alternative strategic communications strategies for addressing environmental problems, as well as real-world examples of where such strategies could be implemented. I appreciated the project-based nature of the class, which provided the opportunity to test our application of the concepts described in class, but the project portion was largely unsupervised and thus missed an opportunity to be more closely interwoven with the class lectures and concepts.",
    "This course helped me to develop a wider approach to communicating environmental issues and to think more holistically about the people to whom I am communicating, as well as what makes them tick.",
    "I gained knowledge of network frameworks and other approaches to upstream communication, which I will be able to apply to future projects. I gained insight into my own standpoint when it comes to environmental values and outcomes, and I better understand now why that standpoint may conflict with the values of other players within my networks.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It helped me improve my communication and teamwork skills and I learned useful tools for building engaging narratives on different topics and to approach different types of stakeholders. The opportunity of applying those tools in a real-world project was enriching.",

    "Fusing project work with the theory felt at times disjointed but eventually the theory clicked into place, a little later than I would have liked.",
    "It was much more difficult to grasp in my mind than I had anticipated but through discussions in and outside of class with Professor Lussier and classmates I understood the tools and concepts better.",
    "I feel that the class largely lined up with my expectations with regards to the broad themes covered in the course, though it was more difficult to keep terminology clear than I expected.",
    "I expected much deeper engagement with the content of the class, given that the class was intended to be project-oriented and practically-applicable rather than lecture-based and theoretical.",
    "They aligned very well.",
    "Considering I knew next to nothing of the subject, thought it was highly informative.",
    "Not very well. I thought the emphasis would be more on language and communications, rather than network building. That in itself was not bad; I liked the concept of what the class was intended to be.",
    "Not very well -- I expected this class to deliver more clarity around the communications concepts discussed; however, the class felt very rushed, and the manner of instruction made it hard to establish a clear sense of definitions and applications for the course material. I think the communications ideas were interesting, but could have been presented in a way that avoided confusion and the need for the professor to repeat concepts multiple times.",
    "While the knowledge I gained aligned somewhat with my expectations, I think I could have gotten more out of the class with better communication from the instructors as well as a more well-defined project component.",
    "I think that this course could have gone deeper into providing skills around narrative development and network building. We certainly covered a range of topics and frameworks, but I don't think we spent enough time discussing or practicing methods of narrative development or the act of network building. I often wanted Paul's lectures to provide concrete examples and case studies of network efforts that we could compare to our own projects, but we didn't get much of that. Instead it appears the course was designed such that the class projects would be the practical component, but without other examples to learn from I think our projects weren't as successful as they could have been. See below answer to Question 4 for more information.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- dynamic lecturing; very applicable theories to work beyond this classroom, a real toolkit to carry forth in our careers Weaknesses -- rushed powerpoint presentations, longwinded lecturing,",
    "The Strengths: -I really loved the seminar format of the class. Professor Lussier was a whiz at blending lecturing with classroom engagement. He quickly learned everyones name and made sure to include everyone in our discussions. -The team project component of the class was a hugely rewarding experience. I loved working with my team and applying the theoretical concepts from the classroom to real-world projects. -The Friday workshop was a highlight. Having the opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts to a new case study (i.e. using the story of Santa Claus to engage children around climate change) was very illuminating -I found the readings on stygmergy and the global brain to be particularly insightful Areas for Improvement: -I think it would be helpful to receive a sample network map at the start of the semester (along with a corresponding toolkit guide). This way, as we learn new material, we could better understand where it fits within the larger constellation of humanistic communications and network building -I wish there were more opportunities for collaboration between the grad class and undergrad class -In future years, it might be nice to have a class dinner to celebrate the end of the semester.",
    "I wish we had seen the map of the tools in the beginning so that we could connect each lesson with where we were on the map. Additionally, for me I wish I had more time to have the tools sink in. The class felt a bit fast-paced but considering we were trying to cover each topic in a timely manner it could not have been helped. I also wish we had more time to work on our projects during Thursday classes.",
    "I think this course presents a very compelling new way of thinking about climate communications. I think the course would be strengthened by settling on a clearer set of terminology (even if just for the purposes of the course, as I recognize that this is an evolving field). Additionally, I sometimes felt that we rushed through slides that would have been helpful, which may have been a product of the course being a combination of narratives and networks.",
    "The course has important content but was largely disorganized.",
    "Strengths: If you end up in a solid project group, despite what is happening in the class or whatever the professor is trying to explain, you will invest yourself in your stakeholder project and likely see tangible progress. It can be all consuming, but if you like the people you are spending multiple hours a week working with, it is definitely worth it. Also, the concept behind this class, of networks communication, is fascinating, and although you may not understand it at the time, you will probably be thinking about months or years later in whatever field you enter. Weaknesses: The professor is hit or miss given a number of circumstances. Some days the lectures are so amazing you never want to leave and you're having like a mind-blowing experience. Other days you are so fed up and confused you will do anything but pay attention, until you get cold called of course. The unpredictability can be very frustrating and the class takes great patience.",
    "Strengths The course introduces a new ways to address and manage problems. Weaknesses This should be a 2 semester long course. It felt crammed and rushed. I did not feel like I had time to engage with the material.",
    "There was some issues with organization. Assignments were decided at the whim of the Professor, as well as lectures on occasion. When this worked it worked brilliantly, when it didn't, it led to much confusion and the necessity to spend more time covering old subjects, which severally impacted the pacing of the semester. As well the focus on the final project should have been paramount, with the subject matter that was learned being persistently applied towards the work. The division between days learning and days working on the project seemed to be problematic. A possible solution would be to combine the two segments into one larger class so that the theory could be taught, applied, and questions could be answered in the context of the classroom before progressing.",
    "All the tools of the course were valuable, but there were too many for us to effectively learn to use each one. I actually felt I understood less as the semester progressed. If we had stopped learning new tools about 3\/4 of the way in and consolidated what we already had, the course may have been more meaningful.",
    "The semester project and readings were the strengths of this class. Developing a communications & network building plan over the course of the semester was fun and valuable, but I often felt we were not applying the concepts from class that we were intended to. Class readings were fascinating and engaging, but we often were derailed from talking about them in class. This class needs more organization, clarity, and formalization. Throughout the semester, we realized over and over again that we did not understand key communications toolkits in the way Paul intended, especially the ABC narrative structure. From my perspective, it appeared that Paul contradicted himself trying to explain this toolkit a number of times, often leaving the class in more confusion. The PESTEL toolkit was never fleshed out in detail, and independent research led me to believe it was a toolkit developed for SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, not the communications applications we were learning from Paul. I'm not sure if there was a connection there to be made or not, but if so, it was never made clear.",
    "The strengths of the course are the ideas behind the communications approach (the need to appeal to people's deeply held values and identities in order to move them to act on environmental issues) as well as the projects established with clients that had innovative communications needs. All of the projects were interesting and engaging to students, and appealed to a range of interests in the environmental realm. The weaknesses are the disjointed and disorganized manner of instruction, which left students confused and added to the rushed nature of the course because concepts had to be reviewed and repeated multiple times. I also felt the professor was not as on top of supervising and advising students on their projects as he could have been. My group was largely self-directed, and ran into a number of questions where we would have benefitted from deeper engagement on the part of the professor, whose busy schedule seemed to preclude him from having the time to engage. The course could be improved by introducing better names for the communications concepts discussed, as well as clearer definitions and examples of the concepts during the lecture portion of the class. I also think the class would have been better if the professor had spent more time spent organizing the flow of the lectures before the semester began; he got side-tracked and off topic on a regular basis, which added to the confusion,",
    "The course, ironically, really struggled with communication. From week one it was unclear what the assignments were and when they were due. Throughout the semester, assignments were made up on the fly, and the new assignments were not recorded with TAs and instructors, leading to confusion when they were turned in. Additionally, this course introduces many new terms, which were defined differently by everyone on the teaching team and every time they were mentioned throughout the semester, meaning that people generally did not know exactly what they were talking about and used terms in vague ways. Finally, the tone and temperament of the teaching team were not always conducive to a positive learning environment. Tensions ran high often, and challenges to new information were not welcomed with open discussion, but rather were taken with offense and reacted to defensively. While the new information was a new way of thinking about communication, I don't think it would have been nearly as difficult for most students in class to grasp if it were better and more coherently communicated, and if the big picture idea (i.e. the \"metatransition\") were better outlined from the beginning. I really enjoyed the readings and found them insightful and engaging, possibly the best part of the course.",
    "The primary strengths of this course are that the material is critically important to the environmental movement and applicable across a range of student interests, and that the professor cares deeply about the content. However, the course is severely lacking in organization, such that concepts were taught in contradictory ways and the practical application suffered. While I believe this course has the potential to be an incredibly useful experience for all students, and I believe the content is important for everyone in the environmental field to study, I think that the current format needs restructuring and I offer suggestions below. First, let me say that I appreciate that the course combined narratives and networks into one semester. I think that the two ideas are so linked that it is important to discuss them simultaneously -- I don't believe that splitting them back up would serve a useful purpose. Additionally, I appreciated that some class periods were dedicated to group work time -- it was very useful to be able to work and discuss issues with the professor and TAs in the room. I think if the course were structured more successfully, the TAs would find it easier to be useful in those conversations. The main issues with this course I think are the organization of the various concepts, the contradictory nature of the concepts, and the lack of teaching examples. To elaborate: We began the course and the group projects by looking for an \"A Story,\" broadly, only to later learn that the A story applies to a specific group and that other players in the network, who are the \"B stories\" for our chosen group, consider their own stories to be the A story. This awareness could have come sooner and allowed for more thoughtful narrative creation had we begun the course with a network mapping exercise, using the language determinants, to determine stakeholder values and recognize how the various goals in play relate to each other. The fact that our class of highly skilled graduate students struggled with the concept of the A story for so long does not show that we were not putting the work in, as Paul at times suggested; instead, it shows a failure of the concept of the A story to stand up to our scrutiny, or a failure of the teaching of the A story to demonstrate its usefulness. I think organizationally the change that should occur is a switch from discussing narratives first to discussing networks first. Rather than asking, \"what's the story?\", begin by asking \"who are the players? Who isn't involved who should be? What would bring them in?\" Such questions then will lead to more fully realized narratives. Some of the concepts also contradicted themselves. The A stories and B stories, named as such and then often described as actions rather than stories, are one example. The connection from Cognitive groups to PESTEL also needs attention I think. PESTEL is an economic framework for assessing the factors influencing a particular project; we were using it more as a tool to describe values or needs, which is not what it is for and created confusion among the class. I think a new component describing needs or goals can follow PESTEL, and can be framed such that cognitive groups react to PESTEL factors and determine their goals as a result. Around those goals, network hubs can be built. The only real example that we were able to study and discuss around network building, besides short mentions in readings, was Mainstreaming Green Building in Turkey. This example also contradicted the frameworks we had been told, with network elements grouped in ways that didn't make sense. I think the course would benefit from a clearly defined and well organized example that could be presented from the beginning, and from including more practices around network building -- i.e. how do you reach out to new possible stakeholders and draw them in? I am running out of room but those are some thoughts. Thanks!",
    "Strengths: - The course content and the readings are very interesting - Real-world examples given by the instructor continuously - Useful assignment that made apply the course concepts - Feedback on project work and progress Weaknesses: - Too much material to cover during the Tuesday session, some times the professor did not have enough time to finish the lecture - I would recommend splitting the content into 2 courses, one on narratives and have another course on networks",
    "It would be well if the course was taught over a year as previously, there is a lot to be covered over a short period of time"

   "comments": [
    "Take what works for you and leave the rest. Talk to your peers about what you're learning before approaching Paul, they are great translators.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If you care deeply about climate change, but find the politics surrounding it bafflingly, maddening, and seemingly intractable, look no further. This course is a breath of fresh air. As Professor Lussier outlines in clear-eyed terms, the chief obstacle to addressing climate change is one of communication; the current discourse, far from being just ineffective, actually entrenches climate denialism and political divisions. In turn, crafting new narratives and networksbuilt around the principles of humanistic and values-based communicationis essential to unlocking fresh thinking and forging a new climate consensus across industries, religions, cultures, and political parties. Fortunately, FES 977 gives you the tools and perspective to do this. Through a combination of theoretical study and real-world projects, FES 977 brings the practice of humanistic communications into vivid focus. Moreover, the skills you learn are not just applicable to climate change but to nearly every public policy issue. The material you learn in this class will have life-long value. To top it all off, Paul Lussier is a terrific professor. His passion for the subject is absolutely infectious, and he is an articulate and engaging lecturer. He really strives to know each student individually and always includes everyone in the discussions. He cares deeply about his students and works to help all of them succeed. In sum, FES 977, both in substance and style, is an excellent class. If you have the opportunity, definitely take it!",
    "It is a useful class that I think I will be using for the rest of my life!",
    "The material is very interesting, but be prepared for it to be a bit scattered and willing to go with the flow.",
    "Have personal goals to start and be prepared to self-guide yourself through the class.",
    "Be prepared to be confused, recurrently. Be patient.",
    "Find another course in communications to take.",
    "This class was challenging and frustrating at times, but overall I appreciated the ideas presented and found the concepts useful to my intended future path as an environmental communications professional. If you can get past the confusion and disorganization of the lectures and assignments, and just take the course for the exposure to the ideas, which are really innovative, I would recommend it; however, if you're looking for a more concrete, well structured class on communications, with more direct and facilitated real-world applications, this probably isn't the best fit.",
    "I would advise fellow students to shop the class and see if they jive with Professor Lussier's lecture style and personality. If not, don't take it, no matter how patient or interested in the subject matter they are. I would also advise them to take the project proposals with a grain of salt, as some are more defined and concrete than others. It is quite possible their project will be a theoretical project without real end goals throughout the semester.",
    "Take the course! because of the great discussions and readings, and the opportunity to participate in great projects. The professor is open to questions, he cares about each of the students and he is very passionate about his work."
