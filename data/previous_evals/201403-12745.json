   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this class. It was interesting if you like math and problem sets (they're weekly). The two midterms were very fair, and if you don't go to lecture or don't understand, the textbook is good at explaining.",
    "Math 222 is linear algebra without proofs. Take it if you want to learn computational math, rather than theoretical math. Overall, it's a good class.",
    "A great class! Seriously, my favorite math class I took at Yale. The material was not too hard and not too confusing and not too boring. The professor was a very good lecturer, and the homework was fair. Overall, no complaints at all. I am happy I took it.",
    "Absolutely! This course was great. The homework every week isn't bad. The midterms and the final carry most of the weight, but they are overall fair tests!",
    "Nice class.",
    "A pretty conventional computational linear algebra course. Nothing too difficult and you do get a pretty good understanding of the course material by the end of the semester. Casson is quite a good lecturer who explains the material clearly. I took the course in order to satisfy some requirements for my major (which is not math); I guess if you're looking for something more theoretical, then you may consider looking elsewhere. Overall no complaints about the course; it's a computational course on linear algebra and that's what you'll get.",
    "Linear algebra is not the most stimulating subject I've ever studied, but Casson made it somewhere between bearable and enjoyable. He is fun to watch, his lectures are clear, and his exams are fair. Do not be lulled into complacency by the first midterm: the second was harder, and the final was harder still. However, the material was manageable. There are also a lot of resources available to help you: the peer tutor and Casson both have frequent office hours, and the TF's weekly review session is worth your time. This class is a requirement for a lot of different majors, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer through it; for me, it was a positive experience.",
    "I would recommend it! It's not too hard, especially if your other classes are not too hard and you have time to put into it. The tests are fairly straightforward and very fair. Casson is a fairly good lecturer. The only thing is that the book is worse than infantile scribbles. But that's okay. The class is very well organized and it's not too much work, although sometimes the psets may be worded in really ambiguous and weird ways.",
    "An alright class, I guess. I wouldn't take it for fun if I were you, and I'm guessing that you have to take it for your major requirements if you're reading this. Casson is okay, and the class is generally really slow. If you pay attention like half the time in class and can come up with a counterexample once in a while, you'll be completely fine in this class. The curves on the tests aren't generous at all, so you should study hard and get a good night's sleep because one dumb mistake can screw you.",
    "Great math class, you can't go wrong if you need it. It's well taught and reasonable with the workload. Weekly psets, 2 midterms, and a final.",
    "Math 222 is a really straightforward introduction to linear algebra. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who is generally interested in math or who plans to study math, science, or economics (it's really very applicable to all sorts of problems). Professor Casson is not the most exciting professor you will encounter at Yale, but he does a great job of presenting the material in a clear and straightforward way. The \"with Applications\" part of the course title is not taken all that seriously; although some applications are presented, this is certainly not the focus of the course.",
    "Even if you're not a \"math person\", I would recommend taking this class, especially if Casson is teaching it. The lectures are incredibly well done, and the material forces you to think in new ways. Every problem set feels like an interesting puzzle, and they're fairly low pressure (only 10 percent of the grade, and collaboration is allowed). Of course, that puts a lot of weight on the exams; if you think you can handle your grade being determined by two short tests and a final you should be fine.",
    "A good math course to have under your belt. And anyone who goes to all the lectures and does all the homework should find the course to be very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend Linear Algebra. It wasn't too much work, but I still came out feeling I had a strong grasp on the material. Prof. Casson is a great teacher.",
    "This is a strong intro class. It isn't super exciting, but you will learn a lot and Professor Casson makes it pretty easy to understand.",
    "Take it if you need to, avoid it if you can.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is required. Because of its lack of practical application, Im not sure how much of it stuck. It also seems as if the material covered is intrinsically dry.",
    "Math 222 is a fairly standard introduction to linear algebra. I actually found it easier than Math 120. It's mostly taught from a computational perspective though, so it's not really an interesting math class if you're looking for proof based math.",
    "This is a straightforward math course. It will be particularly amenable after high school. It gives good practice on the processes of problem solving in linear algebra, but also some conceptual idea of why linear is so cool\/useful. It is not too much work if you keep up on it, and it gives you skills which are really quite useful in any stem field.",
    "Applications are missing from this class, even though it is called \"linear algebra with applications\". We only did one problem all semester involving an application. Otherwise it was all pure computation. Casson was fine, but is rather dull. The material isn't too difficult, and I am told it is useful in a lot of real world applications, but I have no evidence to that matter as we did not cover ANY of them. It might be more useful to take 225 so that, if you can't learn about any of the applications, you can at least learn more of the theory.",
    "Take it if you have to, or if you find the material intrinsically interesting. The instruction does little to add interest to the course, though on the upside, the workload is very small.",
    "Doable and accessible linear algebra class.",
    "A pretty good course that gave a nice overview of linear algebra. Casson is slow and very easy to understand but the course could definitely get boring at times.",
    "It's a survey of linear algebra. It's a fine class, but I would only take it if its a major requirement.",
    "Very standard class in linear algebra. Quite useful, very clear, very fair",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who needs to fulfill their linear algebra requirement. From what I've heard of MATH 225, this course (MATH 222) is more straightforward for non-math-majors. You are not required to do any serious proofs, and the material is interesting at times. Mostly though, this course is very dry and has boring (and sometimes tedious) problem sets, but it's not painful.",
    "Yes. Highly recommended. Professor Casson is a clear, interesting lecturer. The material is interesting.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to. If you are interested in math, the proof-based course (225) would be far more interesting and would provide a deeper, more complete understanding of the material. I took 222 because 225 didn't fit into my schedule, and because \"with applications\" sounded good, but it's not good. We did only one application toward the end of the semester, but it was small and not even covered on the final exam. The large class size and nature of the lecture hall made it near impossible to meet people to form a study group, so it's a lonely class if you don't already know other people taking it. All that said, linear algebra is a fascinating subject with plenty of applications you can learn in higher-level math classes. Take it if you must. The p-sets aren't bad and the discussion section is good.",
    "If you are deciding to take a linear algebra class, I would recommend this one over 225. 225 is much more proof based, and linear algebra can get into some fairly dense concepts. Casson does a fair amount of proofs in class, and puts a few simple ones on exams, but both he and the textbook are very good at explaining things. However, if you don't consider yourself a math person, I would steer clear of linear algebra altogether. I loved it, but I am a math person. If you prefer to take 225, I would look for Asher Auel--he came of as excellent from the first two days I shopped his class, and a few of my friends affirmed my first impression.",
    "It's a mediocre class that has an average amount of work. Nothing to get super excited about, but very manageable.",
    "Yes - Casson's course in Linear Algebra is a clearly-presented introduction. Everything you need to know will be explained (very well) in lecture with copious computational examples. The course follows the textbook (Strang, 4th ed) quite closely, so use as a resource if you prefer. Although perhaps not as easy as the 222 of past years, the curve is quite fair. More computational than 225, but with a fair share of True\/False-Explain questions that test concepts. Applications were really limited to Markov Matrices, though this may change.",
    "I would only take it if you need to learn linear algebra. It's a pretty standard course, but would get annoying when problem sets were due on the days of the midterm. The book we used this semester was extremely unclear, so hopefully they change that.",
    "I would recommend. It's about what you'd expect. Linear algebra can be kind of boring, but can also be very cool if you can give it time and get into it. 10:30am MWF makes it easy to skip, but especially with Casson I would recommend attending lecture. Problem sets are somewhat frustrating but not too hard, and exams start easy but get progressively harder.",
    "It's a simple introduction to key concepts in linear algebra. Eigenvalues, diagonalization, determinants, etc., all stuff that's useful in various branches of the sciences. It's not very challenging, with straightforward problem sets and exams, so it won't be a big time sink. Lecture can be a little dry, but I thought Prof. Casson was actually good as a lecturer: he moves slowly and steadily, and he seems fairly organized. Plus he's very nice if you come to office hours, and he writes pretty good exams. All in all, not a bad option to take if you're studying a field where linear algebra is used.",
    "Homework doesn't help too much with tests. Book goes in more depth, and topics sometimes don't overlap with class.",
    "Just show up to class and you're fine. Pay attention to the little summaries he does at the beginning of class, they're very useful.",
    "MATH 222 is what you would expect out of a linear algebra class - lots of theory, lots of proofs, lots of qualitative mathematics. The tests and material got increasingly harder as the semester progressed (also to be expected, I guess), resulting in a final that was truly challenging. In my opinion, the problem sets are extremely simple and didn't prepare all too well for the exams. In conclusion, from someone who had a strong background in linear algebra from high school, MATH 222 ended up being harder than it seemed during the first part of the semester.",
    "Yes, if you need to take it for your major. Not a great class to take as an elective."
