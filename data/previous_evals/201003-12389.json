   "comments": [
    "Yes, good class to do if you have a chamber group, just to get some coaching if nothing else.",
    "Linden Quartet is great. Wendy and Ryo are great. The music's really great. This course is tremendously great!",
    "If you like playing chamber music with other good musicians, there is really no reason not to take this class. It's not a huge time commitment, and it's just fun.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you love chamber music - one of the best classes at Yale",
    "Great class to perform with fellow students.",
    "Great class if you enjoy chamber music with other high level musicians. I plan on taking it every semester.",
    "Anyone who is serious about music should audition for Chamber Music and not miss this opportunity. Instrumentalists seldom have the opportunity to have the artistic control over their music that is given by chamber music performances (unless they are of soloistic caliber).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you like chamber music. I'm not a music major and couldn't see myself not taking this class even though it's not going to do anything for my degree.",
    "One of my favorite music classes! Super fun and the coaches are all really great. Especially, if you really like your group, you'll get to know them really well. It's fun and sort of like a break from the rest of your classes.",
    "MUSI 220 is an excellent course for those wanting experience in performing chamber music. The weekly coaching sessions from multiple coaches are beneficial. I would definitely recommend this course to fellow musicians.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class! It is a lot of fun. Monthly masterclasses are a wonderful opportunity to practice performing in front of a group.",
    "It's a great class of COURSE you should take it! You get to play chamber music, and have really fabulous coaches (from the graduate quartet in residence with the Tokyo Quartet and the music teachers who run the course). You are supposed to rehearse with your group twice a week and have one coaching a week, and there's a studio class about every 3 weeks where groups play for each other and receive comments when they've prepared a movement or so. It's basically like having an extracurricular chamber group, but for credit.",
    "Take this if you want chamber music to be a major part of your time at Yale. It is totally what you make of it but has the potential to be truly rewarding.",
    "Absolutely. It was probably the highest quality music I have found at Yale, and would recommend the class to anyone who is serious about music.",
    "I would recommend this course only if a fellow student was really dedicated to chamber music. To really get everything out of the class and be fair to the other musicians in the group, one really has to practice and go over the score a fair amount individually. There could potentially be problems if group members did not do this, but I didn't hear about this happening."
