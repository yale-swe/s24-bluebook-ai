    "It's independent science research. You should read the publications of the lab you intend to get involved with, and prepare early in your undergraduate career if you want to actually have a good research project for your senior year. Otherwise, it is easy to get caught up in a project you don't like if you didn't think too hard about what you were getting involved with. A full year of research is a long time!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Research is the best way to solidify what is done in classes. I urge everyone to get into the lab.",
    "Great to learn lab techniques.",
    "Working on research was probably the most important part of my education. I highly recommend that students get involved with research as early as they can.",
    "I would recommend this course to E&EB majors.",
    "Getting the chance to conduct my own research I saw myself grow alot in the lab and gain alot of independence in my research. Jumping into a lab in the beginning of 2nd semester meant that I was joining a project that had already been started but I was still allowed to make it my own and had incredibly amounts of support from the grad students, post docs, PI, and other undergrads in the lab.",
    "Standard, independent research. Find a professor, work in a lab, and that's that!"
