    "ECON 252 is a good introduction to financial markets for those of us (myself included) who don't know anything about them. You learn a lot in this class, but there's also a ton of reading. Exams also ask you for minute details and have somewhat arbitrary grading. But all in all, I'm glad I took this course.",
    "sure you learn a lot from the book",
    "You WILL learn a lot in this course, but Robert Shiller will not be the one who teaches it to you. He will mostly just slowly read from outdated PowerPoint slides (one slide was on Lehman Brothers and the caption was that they were \"rumored to be in trouble\"--Please update your slides for your classes, Professor Shiller. We're paying $50,000\/year to go to this school).Nevertheless, if you do the reading, and you are good at teaching yourself, I reiterate, you WILL learn a lot. I am definitely glad I took the course, but I'm not sure I'd take it again. If you want to go into finance though, I'm not sure there is any lecture class as useful. Also, if Oliver is still TA-ing the course, TRY TO GET INTO HIS SECTION. He was AMAZING.",
    "Do not take this class if you aren't sure you want a perhaps overly elaborate introduction to the financial world. It is also a big time commitment.",
    "As Prof. Shiller says on the first day, this course will introduce you to all of the things humans use to manage risks. You'll learn about everything from insurance to mortgages to options to stocks. Note: this is NOT intro to investment banking so don't take it if that's all you want to learn about. If you want to learn more about all of the innovations in the financial markets then take it. It's not too hard because of the curve, only 6 p-sets, and the material is much more interesting and applicable than most econ courses.",
    "This class is not as hard\/bad as everyone says. I was worried about taking this class because of all of the negative responses about how boring\/hard it was. First of all, although Shiller is not a dynamic lecturer, the information he covers is important, relevant, and interesting. Second, this class is not hard at all IF you stay on top of your work throughout the year. You don't need to do anything besides go to class, do the problem sets (which are easy and also a small percentage of your grade), and stay on top of the reading for the Fabozzi textbook. You really don't need to read the Siegel book or Shiller's book. I spent about 4 hours a week reading the Fabozzi textbook, and I went to most of the classes. Also, the class is on open courses, so you can just watch them online if you miss a lecture. Doing that, I made close to a perfect score on both midterms. And I am not a rocket scientist. This class was surprisingly easy.",
    "The course gives a comprehensive overview of the financial market and is a good window that opens onto the different areas within financial market.",
    "If you're interested in finance then yes, if not I'm not sure what's in it for you. But that's sort of obvious isn't it.",
    "sure, lectures are boring but overall the material is interesting and useful",
    "Yes, take it to learn a lot about finance",
    "Yes I would recommend Econ 252 to others.",
    "If you want a crash course in everything financial I'd recommend taking this course, even if you have no plans to work in finance.",
    "Eh.",
    "Eh, don't take it because you've heard good reviews about it. Shop it for a week and see if you like it.",
    "Yes recommend for those interested in finance.",
    "Good course for Cr\/D, I'd say.",
    "The course focuses a bit unnecessarily on laws and institutions that affect finance, rather than teaching about finance itself. However, the course will teach you the terms that you need to work in the financial sector.",
    "Yes. You want to or need to learn about the financial markets. Take it Credit-D-Fail and don't worry about anything. There is a ton of reading, however, so look around for study\/reading guides from people who took it the prior semester.",
    "Only if you're majoring in econ\/are taking it credit\/d. There is more workload in this course than in any other course at Yale. Everybody fails the exams, and whoever fails least gets a mediocre grade.",
    "A bunch of info - take it if you want to go into finance, even if its just credit\/D. You pretty much have to do the reading because Shiller doesn't cover everything in lecture. And its a bunch of reading.",
    "No. Avoid it like the plague. Just read some books about finance.",
    "Great course, recommend wholeheartedly.",
    "An insurmountable amount of material to memorize for exams and mid-terms. Problem sets were short and not too difficult. You will financially savvy at the end of this course.",
    "Lots of information, although the class has been getting more reasonable of late. Take this before Financial Theory, if you're planning to do both.",
    "Really tough",
    "Honestly, there is no incentive to take this course. If you are taking this course to have some background knowledge for your career prospects, you can learn the materials by reading Wikipedia pages. I was duped by Professor Shiller's reputations and decided to take the course, but it is a poorly taught course and does not deserve any merit. The exams cover minute details from his lecture slides and the textbook, and I always felt like taking the exams was very counter-productive. Do not make the same mistake that I made and stay away from this course.",
    "Get Oliver Bunn for your TA and go to all of his sections. The greatest TA I've ever had. He will make your life so much easier with both the psets and exams.",
    "Financial Markets was a solid survey course on the financial world. It's greatest strength was the combination of a genius lecturer (Shiller)and a wonderful TA (Oliver Bunn). It's greatest weakness was the tests' focus on rote memorization.",
    "It is an awful course, in that you just need to memorize EVERYTHING. But, if you do, you get a strong foundation in finance. It is just very difficult to motivate yourself to study forever. The amount of material is simply absurd.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have any intention of going into investment banking, or maybe you don't have to take this class if you can motivate yourself into reading Fabozzi's textbook on Financial Markets from cover to cover. Shiller's lectures really added no substantial value to your knowledge, but I found his stories entertaining from time to time (whenever I was awake enough at 9 am). It's virtually impossible to finish all of the readings Shiller assigns, because apparently he spent all of his time in the library back in the days and expects everyone else to do the same, but reading the textbook is pretty much enough. Try to get Oliver Bunn as your TA if he's coming back next year, he did 10 times as much as the other TAs and was a good part of why I had kept up with the class. Overall, one of the more practical econ classes I've taken here. Even if you have no explicit interest in Wall street, it will make you feel much more confident about discussing the economy and understanding business news.",
    "lectures are pretty bad, but content of the course is important for people interested in finance. take only if you plan on doing a ton of reading in order to learn the material. you learn everything from the book and nothing from the lectures. tests basically require you to memorize the 400 page textbook",
    "Take it only if you're truly interested in financial markets. Otherwise, it's just a LOT of reading that you won't care about.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to go into finance but not to others, simply because the course requires one to memorize a ton of details, which bore most people but finance fans.",
    "This class is a big disappointment after financial theory. You may as well just buy the textbook and read it.",
    "great way to study useful subject but poorly presented and the tfs are pretty lazy and unresponsive",
    "as a non econ major, I really liked the course as credit\/d. There is a lot of information covered that is very informative in the finance world.",
    "Not bad; the tests are pure memorization but they're not too bad if you go to lecture (or review the powerpoints carefully) and read the textbook at least somewhat thoroughly. Guest lecturers are generally a plus though (although it depends on who is doing it that day).",
    "It is a class that teaches you about financial markets and the interactions between all the varios players in todays world. It is a good overview of how everything works in the finance world.",
    "Not as bad as people claim it to be. A lot of materials, but a lot of useful and interesting materials. Very useful for anyone interested in a career in finance.",
    "Overall a super worthwhile class that will probably help a lot if you are remotely interested in finance after Yale. Shiller's voice is slightly dull in lecture but the material covered is really ccool and he is perfectly understandable.Problem sets are very easy as long as you have a good TA and go to section (math is quite simple but it is covered in section usually, not lecture.)Tests are a bit difficult because they are based on the readings which are a LOT of work. Nothing in the class is super difficult--just hundreds of financial terms and events that you need to memorize for the tests. So you just need to NOT PROCRASTINATE. It is too hard to learn all the terms the night before the test like you can for many classes.",
    "2 midterms and a final with bi-weekly problem sets that weren't that hard. exams are a lot of memorizing",
    "Strongly recommend taking this class Credit\/D",
    "Take it credit d if you are not an econ major. It's really interesting stuff, but the tests ask such detailed questions that whether you do well or not on the test is more based on luck.",
    "It is a great course if you are interested in entering the world of finance. I took it to prepare for my Sales and Trading internship this summer and feel much more comfortable with the lingo of the Street and with basic financial concepts. Watching CNN now, I understand more accurately what the broadcasters are talking about when they mention crude oil futures, credit default swaps, and the basics of pricing assets.It is a brutal amount of reading, but if you want a crash course to prepare you with a basic understanding of the world of finance for a summer internship on the Street or even to gauge your interest in the field, take the course! One benefit is that the readings - although ridiculously long and tedious - are highly recommended readings for nearly any financial industry, whether it be asset management, investment banking, or sales and trading.",
    "The class itself is very good and lectures can be interesting. There is quite a bit of reading, and the structure of the exams tends to encourage rote memorization rather than deeper thinking regarding the relevant issues. That being said, it did help me to learn aboutthe financial system. Learning about finance from Shiller's perspective was a great experience, and I value the fact that it was he and nobody else who introduced me to the field.",
    "Don't take it just for Shiller. He's not that great.",
    "This course was really interesting. It is a lot of work, but I essentially feel comfortable with every sector that we covered. Shiller's stories and reviews of current events are fascinating and he really is a great lecturer. The course is fun, if you're willing to put in the work. It's definitely a once in a lifetime experience.",
    "You'll have to do a lot of reading, and the math is a bit tedious, but Professor Shiller is an amazingly interesting person and listening to him for 150 minutes a week is quite a privilege.",
    "interesting class. tests are hard and there is a whole lot of reading, but shiller is really quirky and interesting!",
    "No, buy the book he assigns and read it. That'll give you the whole of the course.",
    "For someone who wants a basic Finance 101 class, this works. there is an absurd amount of textbook reading, although i did pretty well without doing much of it. some lectures are better than others, and it can be tough to wake up for them at 9 am. i would say that you have to be very interested in finance to like this course at all.",
    "Great class for an introduction to almost all aspects of financial markets. Professor Shiller is great and the guest speakers are always interesting.",
    "Financial Markets will teach you a lot about financial markets and the way that they work. I really liked this course. There was a TON of required reading, but for someone who is interested in the subject matter, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, take the course - useful, relevant and interesting.",
    "A good, non-rigorous survey course in finance. Its strengths are the Fabozzi textbook, the Professor's lectures and, for me, my TA, Oliver Bunn.",
    "This course will teach you a lot about financial markets if you put in the work. So if that's your goal, take it. If not, don't take it.",
    "Financial markets is a great course. You learn A LOT! and the math\/problem sets aren't that hard. Everyone complains about the text book but if you concentrate on the lectures and attend every section you'll be fine. I'm really glad I took it!",
    "No. I would not recommend it. Shiller is pompous and annoying to listen to. The lectures are pointless. Save yourself some time and just read a finance book instead.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class for a grade. Take it credit\/D so that you don't allow your grade to be determined by getting lucky and knowing random terms on the exams.",
    "CREDIT\/D",
    "Since there are only two finance classes offered, you don't really have a choice if you want to learn about the subject. Take it CR\/D if you want but you won't really learn much that way. Otherwise stay away if you're not an econ major.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Boring material but you learn a lot."
