    "I think that I didn't learn anything new, though I imagine that it could be useful in evening out the playing field. Seriously, though, it seems better fit for three quick orientation meetings or something... For example, the library session where we learned how to use library resources was absolutely ridiculous. If we haven't learned that PubMed exists so far in our career, I can't imagine how overwhelming everything else would be.",
    "I think this course was relatively helpful for the presentation side of things and also the grant writing side of things. It was not, however, particularly useful for the library research\/how to search for papers\/maintain papers, because one of the instructors didn't seem to know her stuff very well and the other really only presented one of the many options available to us for maintaining our paper libraries.",
    "I did not find it very helpful and I don't feel that I learned much.",
    "It helped to improve and highlight the importance of skills not normally covered in a typical class (i.e. communication \/ writing \/ publishing \/ etc.)",
    "prepare for the potential questions during scientific research."
