   "comments": [
    "Very good class, but stay on top of all the reading and be prepared to work your behind off. Start lab reports early.",
    "The material is very interesting and Professor Reed does an excellent job of explaining everything. The class is basically a seminar and you can just fire off questions whenever you need to. Overall, it's a great course. The only thing is the lab reports are incredibly tedious. It's possible to learn the material in a much shorter time period.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is well taught, and the material is interesting. The exams are manageable. The majority of the classwork comes from the weekly labs, and staying on top of the material. Mark Reed is a great guy, and will help you with any questions.",
    "Good class, lots of work. If you read the book it'll be pretty straightforward",
    "This is a gem of an EE class - recommended to anyone who wants to know more about crystal structure, band structure, and device physics. Just beware of the lab reports. Especially the one on FETs.",
    "Great course! Definitely take it! This was by far one of my favorite classes at Yale, and Prof Reed is awesome and super willing to help any student with any questions (about class or otherwise). I'm a physics major, so just took it for fun, and definitely thought the material was very doable and reasonable, but super interesting. Very glad I took it. The lab aspect is A LOT of work, but worth it in order to get the most out of this course. Don't get scared of, the course load isn't too too bad, and the problems are very manageable, it's just long labs and theory, but all manageable. And if Mary is the TA, she is amazing! If anything, take the course so you can get to know Prof Reed. And semiconductors are really cool, everyone should know at least a bit about them, right? Take it!",
    "EE 320 has the potential to be a fantastic course but is held back by severe drawbacks, specifically the lab component. The material is great, exams are based on material we learned, and the professor is a solid lecturer, but the labs are horrendous and detrimental to the class. Even though performing the awfully-prepared labs themselves provides absolutely no educational benefit, the worst part of the lab component is the extraneous lab reports, which can exceed 20 pages in length and over a dozen hours to write, and there are seven. Disregarding the lab component, this would be a 5\/5 class. I would recommend being highly cautious in taking this course as it really about 2 credits of work and the labs will be highly unpleasant.",
    "Mark Reed is one of the best professors in the department, interesting material, very reasonable exams and psets. The labs\/reports are killer and should warrant another credit."
