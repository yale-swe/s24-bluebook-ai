    "The lectures are great! All of them are very impressive. But I hope the lunch could be better. We like pizza but can we change to something else?",
    "I think it would have been more helpful for second years if the seminar was not before a required class we needed to take. Many times I was forced to leave early in order to make it on time to class.",
    "It's useful but we do need some guidance on this",
    "Good.",
    "Though it's only been this one semester, I've enjoyed the speakers we've had thus far in the seminar series. The journal club has been a bit hit or miss, especially since there is little precedent. While it seems to be a valuable time, a lot of the student response has been rather lackluster, with little student participation. This is frustrating to see from my peers, but I don't know what can be done about that.",
    "This seminar series had a very impressive group of speakers. A broad range of topics gave us a strong supplemental education about environmental health that I felt was really lacking in the course load for the semester.",
    "I am enjoying the EHS seminar\/journal club. I appreciate the overview of different areas of EHS.",
    "The seminar series provided depth and breadth that supplemented coursework well. Sometimes, the seminars didn't feel very relevant and it was difficult to engage in the speaker's presentation.",
    "Great guest lecturers who gave very interesting talks about a variety of different areas in environmental health. Only critique: Since the seminar takes place at noon, it would be nice if lunch would continue to be provided, but please, no more pizza!",
    "Having Journal Club is helpful for being prepared for speakers' talks."
