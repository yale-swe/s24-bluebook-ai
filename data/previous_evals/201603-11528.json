    "Understanding of nonviolent political theory",
    "I learned so much about Gandhi, as well as others who practiced non-violent resistance. I also learned about historical movements, etc.",
    "I strengthened my conviction that conflict is a reality that should be dealt with and the best possible way to use conflict constructively is through nonviolent protests. I learned a lot from the readings of Martin Luther King, Reynold Niebuhr and Stokely Carmichael. I also had an introduction into political science, although I realized history is more appealing to me, since context is important to me, whereas in AFAM 195, while we considered the importance of context, I felt we also talked in very general terms, that would not necessarily be true to all societies and countries if applied. Reynold Niebuhr's text \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" was the best essay I read in this course.",
    "I learned about Gandhi, King, and the political environments surrounding them from a political-science standpoint.",
    "Interesting information on the lives of MLK & Mahamta Gandhi",
    "Whereas I had know superficial details about Gandhi's and King's political movements, I gained lots of insight on nonviolence as a philosophy in addition to its alternative movements.",
    "The ability to sort through dense political theory texts.",
    "This class taught the general foundation of nonviolent theory specifically related to that of Gandhi and King and their beliefs. It taught different forms of nonviolent protest, civil disobedience, etc and a history of how these movements have shaped protests today.",
    "Very interesting course about the nonviolent politics of Gandhi and King. A very thought provoking class in which you are forced to think critically about the ideals of traditional conflict solution and Gandhi and King's ideals.",
    "I learned a little more about the specifics of the Civil Rights Movement and Satyagraha. I learned how important strategy was in these campaigns, not just the philosophy of nonviolence.",
    "Loved this course -- amazing reading list.",
    "Amazing course!! Really enjoyed all the content thoroughly, workload was not a burden, and it pushed the boundaries of my writing prowess.",
    "Critical thinking skills and history and effectiveness of the act of nonviolence",
    "I learned about the history of nonviolent protest in India and in the United States; in particular, I studied the nonviolent campaigns organized by King and by Gandhi. I also learned about how a theory of nonviolent resistance is formulated by social scientists.",
    "The ability to formulate and defend political philosophy arguments and develop own opinion off of (Gandhi and King) historical events, primary sources, secondary analyses of the development of nonviolent politics.",
    "Learned about the history of Gandhi and King in terms of their non violent resistance movements. Gandhi was first part of the class and King was second part of the class.",
    "I learned that non-violence can more effective than violence.",
    "Great course that emphasizes taking insights gained during discussion and forming them into argumentative writing.",
    "As someone who has never taken a political science class before, I found that this course to be a good entry point into the field. I felt like I got a fairly good handle on how to deal with some pretty tricky theoretical work -- through really good guidance by Prof. Mantena and my TA. Plus the material was really interesting.",
    "I learned how to analyze different texts which was interesting.",
    "Strong analytical skills",
    "I learned about not only Gandhi and King, but nonviolent movements in general and the theories behind them.",
    "I learned a lot about the philosophies of Gandhi and King, as well as other prominent figures writing on nonviolence.",
    "Understanding the roots of nonviolence, the logic and morality behind it, and its use in two mass movements.",
    "I learned a lot about the impact and importance of nonviolent resistance in our history."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the connection between Gandhi, King and the movements aimed at overthrowing communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe. I felt, however, that the lectures were a bit dry, because they talked about general concepts, that are not necessarily identical when applied to different societies and different countries. I came out of this class not with a crystal clear idea of what political science is, but with a strong appreciation of what Prof. Snyder said in Eastern Europe since 1914: \"The reason this is not a political science class is, because we are talking about things like time and forests.\" I very often felt we never talked about time in this class and about circumstances and although we read an essay on \"Moral Imagination\" (a great text), I felt political science was the total opposite of history, because while in history putting yourself in someone else's shoes was encouraged, that was almost never the case in this class.",
    "The lectures were somewhat dry, scripted classes. It grew hard to pay attention during some of them.",
    "Strengths: Good section leader(s?) Good selections of readings, from interesting texts Weaknesses: Often the lectures, on topics that could be exciting, were tedious instead--charisma!",
    "Great class, great professor, lots of fun",
    "This course is wonderful, but struggles because not enough people come to lecture. The section (with Hari!) was my favorite part of the course, and one of my favorite classes of all Yale. The readings were incredibly valuable and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in the section. Class participation is worth a huge amount of your grade and there's not much feedback given, so it can be difficult to gauge how you're doing. I have no idea how I did in the class even though I did reasonably well on the midterm.",
    "I wished that the lecture could have been more engaging but I did enjoy section thoroughly.",
    "The lectures were not very engaging, and the texts could have been better pieces chosen, especially the secondary sources. There are so many great writings on nonviolence and social movements, and I thought the pieces we had to read were not the best.",
    "This course reading was incredibly interesting and engaging. I think lectures ruined a lot of what was interesting and great about this class. The prezi's were cool but you never could get what you needed to down and it was hard to feel like you could ask questions and fully be present with the material.",
    "Really interesting lectures. Great topic and Professor is great at lecturing. Sometimes the powerpoints were hard to follow. Those could be more clear.",
    "While the material that we read for class was interesting it occasionally seemed as though the lectures were summaries of the readings instead of providing additional information.",
    "People view this class as a gut so they do minimal work. But surprise! It isn't graded as a gut, and there is a lot of reading that is necesssry to participate in section. (Section participation is very big). I really enjoyed the readings I just other people had been as engaged as I was.",
    "I was able to read only half the material and still do pretty well in the class. While that made it an easy class, I still felt that there was no motivation given by the class to really delve into this immensely important topic. The only suggestion I have for that though is maybe including more quizzes or assignments that require students to actually read the material.",
    "Strengths -- the reading list & section discussions! Areas to improve -- I think lecture can be a bit more engaging but other than that, I absolutely loved the class!",
    "Excellent content, may be beneficial to interrelate this content with current events.",
    "Interesting topic, but not always interesting lectures",
    "The readings were consistently engaging, and the lectures were usually interesting. I thought that the discussion sections could have been better organized -- in particular, they should have been more interactive. I also think that the course should have required students to write more papers: maybe three over the course of the semester, in addition to the final research paper. Personally, I find that writing papers is one of the best ways to engage with other peoples' ideas, and consequently I think that most of the students would have thought more critically about the readings if they had been asked to write papers about them.",
    "S - paralell analysis of Gandhi, King, and current nonviolent political movements W - dry lecture that is taken away from by powerpoint presentations",
    "Lectures were sometimes very boring. Very dry material and the slides did not help at all. Almost all of the course was based on the readings which were very dense",
    "The strengths was the interesting material assigned to us, and the weaknesses was the blandness of the lectures.",
    "The course fails to provide a very nuanced exploration of the work of Gandhi and King because of the amount of material the course aims to cover. 50 minute lectures simply aren't long enough to cover the major points of their timelines and theories as well as that of their contemporaries.",
    "The professor was a great lecturer, but most of what we were tested on did not include the lectures which made most kids not as inspired to keep good attendance.",
    "Strengths: interesting\/relevant material with TAs and Professor who were engaged and excited. Not a crazy amount of work by any standards but you still get a lot out of the course. Weaknesses: It can be easy to disengage if you don't keep up.",
    "In all honesty, the lectures were not hugely engaging. As it was solely based in lectures, it was tough to remain interested.",
    "Class wasn't super relevant to the readings but some of the readings were interesting",
    "The class had lots of information but would be better as a seminar",
    "The sections were very engaging, I wish the lectures would've been a bit more engaging.",
    "The lectures seemed scattered at times and the class seemed heavy on the Gandhi side. I wished for more nuance and complexity on the half of the semester focusing on King and the Civil Rights Movement.",
    "Section was absolutely fantastic (especially with Hari!!). Readings were incredible and have totally changed my world view. Didn't go to lecture a ton and don't feel like I missed out.",
    "Strengths: my section was awesome, we got into some really good discussions and it is definitely a course that leaves room for extensive discussion. Weaknesses: the second half of the class was harder to follow, chronologically, everything under Gandhi made a lot of sense, but the timeline was much more confusing when we turned over to King."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this class if someone wants to have an idea about how nonviolence is treated in the context of political science, but I would not say it is best way to be introduced to the field. Many of the ideas introduced in this class are important to consider, but I found the class not to be very engaging and concrete.",
    "Definitely recommend, very interesting to learn about MLK and Gandhi and how they employed nonviolent tactics to achieve social change.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course, especially as a fourth or fifth class for people needing social science credit. The readings are interesting but not overly demanding. The people studied--Gandhi and King especially--are worthwhile additions to any intellectual vocabulary.",
    "Absolutely take this. Prof. Mantena may be the nicest lady on campus and is very helpful with papers.",
    "Very much so!",
    "Great readings, great conversations, great topics.",
    "If you need an easy fifth class, definitely take it. But the information could be SO interesting, and just falls short. But either credit\/D or easy A, absolutely take it! You can skip some lectures and there are only two assignments - a take home midterm and a 10 page paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who will actually go to lecture. Don't take it if you won't go its not worth it. THe lectures are far too interesting to miss and it was pretty upsteting that more than half the class wouldn't show up. There shouldve been incentives for those who did show up.",
    "Absolutely. Very interesting topic with a manageable workload.",
    "Only if you can get a tf that encourages lots of learning and participation!",
    "This class is DEFINITELY a gut, so if you need your Social Science credit, this is an easy way to do it. However, don't expect any in depth study of the material in the class; if you want to do that, you'll have to do it outside of class.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course because I don't feel like I gained any concrete skills\/knowledge from the course. Most of the material is incredibly theoretical and I never felt any of the nonviolent philosophies between Gandhi, King, Tolstoy, Niebuhr, etc. were really clarified in a productive way. I felt lectures difficult to engage with and the reading to be dry.",
    "YES. Kings writing is amazing and everyone should read pretty much everything on this reading list at least once in their life.",
    "Yes; best class for a student interested in Political Science!",
    "The course is topical and interesting, and Gandhi and King are both fascinating figures. I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
    "If you need an easy class with a light work load i would take it but you have to do the readings to some extent. Take home midterm which is about 7 pages of writing and a final 10 page paper which is not terrible but you need to read a good amount in order to grasp the topics. Section response was due before every section which was not too hard but again you need to read a little. I would take.",
    "I do not think i would because i found it hard to stay engaged in the lectures.",
    "Beauty",
    "No. I don't think the class does the material justice.",
    "Yes, an interesting course regardless of your field of study!",
    "I learned so much about nonviolence and was able to apply it in other PLSC classes VERY frequently. I was truly amazed at how applicable and relevant the course material is.",
    "Yes! A good but engaging gut.",
    "Gut gone wrong.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It's a very approachable class through which to critically think about a distinct aspect of political history in greatly thought-provoking ways. If you really engage with the course, you'll find yourself really questioning your own views on things well beyond the class material.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about nonviolent theory. It is much more philosophy than practice, but still a good intro class.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes, if you can get Hari as your TA. The readings are the main attraction. So rich and will change the way you understand the world, especially contemporary activism such as Black Lives Matter.",
    "Yes, I loved the class, especially the readings. It was fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable to read works by Gandhi and King."
