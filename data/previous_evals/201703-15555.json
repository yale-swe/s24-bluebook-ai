    "1. I learned a lot of English learning tools and methods and resources. For words, now I know where I can look up new words using Dictionary.com and other good dictionaries. To have a good pronunciation, I can use the website howjsay.com. To improve my pronunciation and accent, I can use the nativeaccent3.carnegiespeech.com. Since I have known them, the only thing I can do is keeping practicing and making progress everyday. I am sure I will become a good English speaker soon. 2. This semester I had three presentation and two news report, which benefits me a lot. From the presentations I had, I know what aspects I should pay attention to and how to give a good presentation from the preparation to the rehearsal then to the presentation. Also, I know how to improve the presentation by recording it and self-evaluate and ask others to give feedback. For the news report, I learned how to read news and present it others. I will also keep doing that."
