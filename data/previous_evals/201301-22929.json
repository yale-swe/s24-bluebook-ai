    "This class should be titled: \"how to direct short films\" you do a different film project each week using the DMCA cameras shooting everything from documentary style to drama. The assignments are challenging but do-able - although Sandra does not put up with half-efforts on the assignments - if you come in with a half-arsed assignment she will tear you to bits so don't do it! If you don't think you'll be able to handle the work load then don't take on the course.",
    "I recommend it, but if you have no experience with film making like I did, prepare to have a love-hate relationship.You will have no idea how to work a camera, you will experience technological difficulties (one of my assignments had no sound), and you will know that your projects look bad. Then you come to class and Sandra will tell you in no short detail about everything you did wrong.If you can handle criticism without taking it personally, learn from your mistakes, and just keep trying, Sandra will really teach you a lot about film and what looks good on-screen.",
    "The class is a great way to begin experimenting with filmmaking. It will give you a good basis, but don't expect your work to look like Hollywood. It is definitely humbling in the sense that you realize how much further you have to go. I highly recommend it to any art or film student.",
    "Take it take it take it. You learn so much about filmmaking. But you have to be open to critique and criticism."
