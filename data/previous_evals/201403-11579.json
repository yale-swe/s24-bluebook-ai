    "- Professor is incredibly knowledgeable in craft. - Professor is highly intelligent and seems to readily grasp all issues being written about in the course. - Professor's comments on articles are very helpful. - Professor is very dedicated.",
    "Fred spends an incredible amount of time reading every student's piece and providing incredible commentary and feedback. He sees potential in every student and piece and pushes each student to write the best piece they can.",
    "Fred is a thoughtful, inspiring teacher. The best aspects of the course include: reading and critiquing good writing, learning applicable techniques for writing engagingly about the environment, receiving extensive feedback on one's own writing, and building a single piece over the course of a semester.",
    "The readings are well-chosen and engaging. The small class size and late hour gives the course a homey feel. The tools you will learn are tried and true. Engaging with them may seem formulaic at times, but for me, pushing myself to write within the framing devices provided helped me think more critically about my writing and write more intentionally. It's also just really fun to engage with a different type of reading and writing than what we normally get to do in grad school.",
    "The ability to get feedback on your writing, the in-depth look at other papers which really does give you ideas for your own writing, breaking down the parts of the paper and giving each a purpose (lead, scene, persona, etc)",
    "Professor Strebeigh provides a very supportive atmosphere for a writing course. I liked the organization - working on different parts of our article each week. Professor Strebeigh provides extensive feedback on each draft version that is very helpful.",
    "I leave this course with an understanding of the anatomy of an environmental article. Fred is an enthusiastic and highly engaged instructor. WOrking with peers was fun and helpful in the process. I am impressed and grateful!"

    "- Some of the class discussions were inefficient and unhelpful. Many of the lessons could have been condensed by about 40% and been more helpful. - It sometimes seemed as if professor lost interest in my piece, though he did continue helping me with it.",
    "Not directly related, but I suggest getting together with your fellow students and devising some sort of group food ordering\/provisioning scheme. You will get hungry. Otherwise, any comments I might have are stylistic, and therefore unlikely to alter.",
    "Self selection of the writing groups worked fine. I'm not sure this is the best approach though. Would it be better to somehow group students by the kind of writing they are doing or by similarity of topic?",
    "This is a difficult question to answer! The only thing that could add to this course would be a formal discussion of the publication processwhat editors generally look for, good strategies for submitting pieces, and maybe an assignment to write a \"pitch\" for our piece to the editor (imaginary or real) of our choice."

    "I am in a science-based PhD program, so this course was completely different than anything I've taken at Yale. It was also the most incredible course I've ever taken. This is a great opportunity for scientists\/students in quantitative fields to learn how to write about their work in an appealing way.",
    "I think it's valuable to learn how to write in all different formats, and I had little experience with non-fiction popular press. The course also makes you engage with your own ideas about one particular topic for an entire semester, and I found that kind of long-term development very valuable.",
    "Nowdays, policy and science is clearly no longer \"neutral,\" and in many ways, it never was. However, the politicization of science and policy means that experts need to be more clear in advocating their research, their understanding, their efforts. This class definitely helps you learn how to do that in a more effective manner.",
    "This course provided the skills and confidence that enabled me to feel like I could write for a general audience as opposed to solely a scientific audience. I think that will be important in the future for me. I want to be able to transfer what I have learned to a broader audience.",
    "This course ties together a corrolary interest of mine, to become a better writer and communicator of environmental issues. It also challenged me to approach my work from a challenging but fresh angle that I found very enlightening. I couldn't be happier with the course."

You will be well rewarded by a fun experience with one of the most responsive, kindest professors I have had at FES.",
