   "comments": [
    "This class taught me multiple theories for creating and analyzing phonological rules and gave criticism for each theory's strengths and weaknesses. It also briefly bridged phonetics and phonology and more clearly defined their differences, and it did the same for morphology.",
    "I learned so much about the basics of phonology; this course was also really useful in solidifying my knowledge of the IPA.",
    "I learned a lot of really cool phonology. The course covers mostly distinctive feature phonology up to autosegmental phonology (which involves analysis of stress, tone, and other really cool phenomena in language!), and a small introduction to Optimality Theory.",
    "A good general introduction to phonology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is effective in teaching the practical parts of creating phonological rules, but it does so through somewhat excessively long and harshly graded homework.",
    "Initially I took issue with homework being such a major portion of the grade (60%), but Ryan and Chris (the TF) were so accessible via office hours and appointments that in hindsight I understand. Otherwise, taught well. Ryan is a great instructor.",
    "The course was extremely well organized and made it easy to follow the material over the course of the semester. We covered a broad range of topics in a natural progression. It was consistently challenging and enjoyable. Grading was somewhat inconsistent but ultimately the course is very strong."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as a second course in linguistics. It dives right into phonetics and phonology with little introduction (and I think the course requires a previous course in linguistics). If you're not majoring in linguistics, I'd recommend it if you're interested in the parts of linguistics that have to do with sound and sound change, but note that it's different than phonetics, which spends more time analyzing the sound itself, whereas this course focuses and contextual change of sound.",
    "This is a really good course and I would really recommend it especially for linguistics majors looking to fill their breadth requirement!",
    "This is a required class for the linguistics major. I would recommend this class to non-linguistics majors only if they have a strong interest in the subject or have taken phonetics.",
    "Take this course. It's such a beautiful way to think about the psychological aspect of sound as meaning in an analytical\/linguistic frame. Also, Ryan is a fire teacher with so many relevant examples. And, he's a phonologist by trade, so he's truly into this stuff!",
    "A great introduction to phonology. The class is difficult but always interesting and the teaching is excellent."
