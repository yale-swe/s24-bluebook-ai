    "The class revolves around the life and works of Bolao. Because it's a literature course, your spanish reading abilities will improve.",
    "This course focused solely on the life and works of Roberto Bolao. Being that Bolao died in 2003 at the age of 50, there is still a lack of criticism and analysis of his writing, which gave Professor Gonzlez less material to work with. Regardless, Professor Gonzlez developed many interesting lectures that offered a better understanding of Latin America's situation during Bolao's lifetime, as well as a familiarity with Bolao's models and inspirations.",
    "Despite the course being focused on Bolao, I learned all about literature. I specially learned about all the different ways to look at a piece of fiction writing.",
    "In this course you learn an incredible amount about the writer Roberto Bolao and become familiar with many of his unique characteristics as a writer. However, you are also able to explore other topics such as other writers who influenced him, literary themes youre interested in and much more.",
    "Literary analysis and essay writing skills, and knowledge specific to the content of the books we read in class.",
    "learned all about Bolano, who is a very important writer in Chilean history",
    "I gained the types of skills needed for analyzing Latin American short stories and novels.",
    "I read a large part of Roberto Bolao's works, mostly his fiction, and learned a great deal about his life and the times in which he lived. I felt like I got to know Roberto quite well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Gonzalez-Perez clearly knows a lot about the subject, but most of the 75min classes were spent with him talking for 75min straight. It's easy to lose focus because the student engagement is low.",
    "This course is very interesting, but it is a course focused on a single author, which means that many of the themes discussed will be repeated in discussion and lecture throughout the semester. Although this class was first perceived to be a seminar, it was very much a lecture course in which the professor spoke for most of the class. Students did not speak much during class, which could be frustrating if you expected the course to be seminar-style.",
    "This course is interesting and well organized. I have no complaints.",
    "The class was enjoyable because of the professor's vast knowledge about the content matter and his explanation of the relation between historical trends and the texts we were reading. Sometimes I felt like the analysis in seminar focused less on the text itself, and more on cultural context, influences, etc. More detailed literary analysis could make this class more interesting, though there was a lot of it as well.",
    "It's a very good course! I loved the professor a lot and the materials we read were quite interesting and informative",
    "I thought the course was really well-run.",
    "The strength of this course is the focus of the material: a single author. This is great because you have an entire semester devoted to that person alone. But the weakness is that the course is not particularly focused in lectures, which tend to meander around peripheral topics not all that germane to the book or theme at hand. This could be improved by making sure that the texts are analyzed deeply instead of being replaced by a recitation of facts about Bolao's life that have already been repeated several times. There is tremendous potential in this class, but it has yet to be realized."

    "Yes! Bolao's works are fascinating and have a lot of depth to them. Anbal is one of the kindest professors I have ever had at Yale and his thoughtfulness will enrich your reading and discussion of Bolao immensely. This has been my favorite Spanish course at Yale to date.",
    "Yes! I feel like I learned so much about Roberto Bolao and am excited to read more of his works in the future.",
    "Roberto Bolao is an amazing writer, but many of his themes are dark, so if you do not like to read about violence and hate, or if you don't like storylines left unfinished, this class will not be for you. But, if those themes do interest you, this class will be a great way to delve into some of the violence, hate, and marginalization felt not only in Latin America, but throughout the world.",
    "I would. It was one of my favorites of this year.",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "If you are interested in the author or in contemporary Latin American literature, yes!",
    "Yup, would definitely recommend, even if you have not had too much experience with Spanish literature. Gonzalez-Perez is amazing and the things you read are quite thought-provoking. Not too much work either.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was very fascinating, and fun.",
    "Yes! Professor is amazing",
    "Yes, if you like grappling with dark themes and real-world issues. The problem is that you might be doing it sort of by yourself, because Profesor Gonzlez can be reticent to dive deep into the literature. I don't believe this class was the professor's top priority. However, if you feel comfortable thinking through the questions Bolao poses on your own time, this class is great."
