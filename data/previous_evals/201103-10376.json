   "comments": [
    "Cell& Molecular Physiology 550 01 is a broad overview of physiology, covering a majority of the systems of the body. It is a broad, rather than deep course. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in medicine or medical research because the course teaches how all the major systems work which is necessary for any doctor or researcher.",
    "Good class. You learn a lot of information. Not that big of a time commitment. The book is useless, so buy another book to read.",
    "Physiological Systems is a lot of work, but extremely interesting for those interested in biology. It succeeds in being both challenging and stimulating, although at times feels slightly overwhelming.",
    "Its a good primer for people who don't have any physiology experience. Unfortunately since it is primarily an undergraduate course, the aims are very different. For an engineering student, it doesn't have as much of an engineering spin and if students already have physiology courses may not be very useful.",
    "A thorough physiology course from an engineers perspective. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the medical sciences or engineering but would warn them for a lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it gives a great introduction to a broad amount of material."

   "comments": [
    "From this course, I have a deeper understanding of physiology of the whole body and how different organ systems work. This knowledge is contributing greatly to my research, because I am now able to place my research in a whole body context.",
    "It gave me knowledge of physiology that will be helpful in the future.",
    "This was a good refresher course from the physiology that I took as an undergraduate and a good reminder of some of the biology that I will be working with during the course of the research.",
    "The course is useful for understanding general physiology, however, for me a more specialized approach may have been more useful."
