    "Strengths: The flexibility to take assignments down any rabbit hole you want, with the emphasis on learning and the investigation rather than the grade. This does mean you get what you put in, and it is a lot of work, but very rewarding! Roy was also awesome and was super helpful and willing to give feedback if needed. Cons: I think at the beginning of the course, it would be helpful to have a more clear direction from the instructor on how the class is to function. Often we were encouraged to utilize Github and slack to discuss assignments and projects, but that didn't go far and the instructor may need to take the initiative on it. However it's definitely a tricky balance between giving students freedom to explore on their own but also encouraging discussion and collaboration."
