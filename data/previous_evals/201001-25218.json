    "I recommend the class, but if you don't want a heavy workload your senior spring, take it credit\/d\/fail!!!! I took it for a grade and regretted it until I just got my final grade (an A), so I'm really happy about that. The big paper is due the Weds before the senior essay, and the 2nd test is the Weds after, and we are all senior Psyc majors in the class, so that's kind of unnecessary (read: cruel). However, it worked out for me. You learn SO much about how to change others' behavior. I'd say it will make me a much better teacher and parent. Definitely worth it!!!! Kazdin is so funny.",
    "I would recommend it if you ready to do the work.",
    "PSYC489 is a fantastic course; it's behavior project component allows students to take their 'book-learning' and immediately apply it to an interesting, everyday situation\/problem. The reading is certainly doable, lectures are interesting and energetic, and overall the class is a fun and manageable one for seniors. Highly recommend it.",
    "This is a class designed for seniors in the psych major. You learn how to design a behavior modification program and then carry one out. It was really fun and the first psych class I've taken in a while where I didn't feel like everything was repetition. The are two exams, a short paper, and the behavior change project. Use the study questions at the end of the chapters to study for the exams. And memorize those vocab definitions!",
    "Take it. Easy, fun, and very useful.",
    "Yes. Cause it's cool.",
    "FABULOUS course! Thorough, complete, compelling. I appreciated that this course didn't just tell me what to think, but allowed me to learn through experience. Professor Kazdin is an inspiring professor. He's a captivating lecturer with a knowledge of the subject matter that is unparalleled. It is rare that one gets to learn from such an expert, and I feel so lucky to have learned from Dr. Kazdin!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Amazing- you are a fool if you don't.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take this (or any) class with Professor Kazdin. It's an experience worth having. Beyond that, BCT is fantastically interesting. A great class all around for anyone even a little interested in psychology. Good luck getting in!",
    "YES. It's one of the bestEST courses at Yale, and it makes amazing senior seminar. The readings are incredible, and Prof. Kazdin is funny and approachable. I realize I may have used too many adjectives here, but the class was really THAT GOOD."
