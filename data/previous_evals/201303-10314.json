    "The capstone wasn't particularly hard or time-consuming, but it did feel like a waste of time. Our entire case consisted of analyzing two data sets on youth violence that combined had about 300 respondents, a size too small to make any claims and have it be ethical. Our client was absentee and didn't provide us with very clear information. Most of the capstone was spent wondering what we should be doing. The main thing I learned from the semester was how NGOs create programming that they know isn't really the most effective because that's what donors want. Eye-opening to know, but shoddy work experience. Overall the capstone was extremely frustrating and not a good experience at all.",
    "The course is very different given what project you are doing. This is for most people the last course of the major, so it is not really something you \"choose.\" It is a great experience working with practitioners and professors. We had a data driven project based on surveys done in Zimbabwe and South Sudan. Unfortunately, the data was pretty bad, but the rest of the experience was great.",
    "It's extremely hard to work in such a capstone. The department hasn't worked the kinks out yet and just don't know what is going on.",
    "After being given datasets on two nations, our capstone class performed background research on our client and on conflict in the two given settings. We created theories of change (hypotheses), analyzed data for trends, and created a report of our findings. Because our data was weak, we critically assessed our clients current survey and research methods and researched alternative data methods that we then used to create recommendations for our client.We worked indivually to create brief papers throughout the semester of related topics, traveled to NY to learn about the strategies of a competitor client, and went to DC to present our findings to our client.I still learned a lot from this class, and recommend the capstone (the idea of a practically applied project), but must note the serious flaws in this course.With improved focus on giving students a clear objective, a leader with the time to be highly involved in students' work, and a stronger vetting process to weed out clients who can't provide data strong enough to fulfill the class's objective, this a course similar to this one could be truly great."
