   "comments": [
    "LATN 131 is an interesting course...you focus on translating classical texts like Caesar's Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile, Cicero, and Augustine. The work is not too bad; one quiz every Monday on the previous week's translations, informal translations due on Weds and Fri, two midterms and a final that is essentially another non-cumulative midterm, and a couple of short, 1 page writing assignments. Make sure to keep up with translating everything yourself first before you get to class though, because you will be called on. Additionally, the quizzes consist of a section of the translation in Latin which you have to translate once more and then parse\/explain certain words, so it is useful to have attempted the translation yourself first instead of blindly copying down the translation you hear in class. Overall, it is not a difficult course, and this is coming from a person who did L1 and L2 freshman year, stopped taking any language sophomore year, and then resumed Latin junior year.",
    "Solid class. Nothing particularly special; nothing to really complain about. Came in after dropping Latin after sophomore year of high school (had taken since 8th grade), and felt reasonably well prepared.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this class!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for students who wish to fulfill the Foreign Language requirement and have already taken Latin\/AP Latin during high school. We translated from Caesar's Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile, Cicero's Somnium Scipionis, and selections from Ovid and Augustine. The course was not too much work and was not stressful at all, since the grading was distributed between quizzes, two hourly exams, participation, and the final.",
    "Very good course for learning about the intricacies of prose writing of Roman authors. Typical readings are Caesar's gallic warsa and civil war along with Cicero's dretam of scipio from his treatise concerning the state. Class is taught very methodically as Latin classes tend to be.",
    "If Professor Kraus is teaching this, definitely take it. I have been taking Latin since grammar school, and I was not truly confident in my Latin until this year. We read Caesar and Cicero mostly. If you have taken the AP, the course starts with Caesar you have read which is a nice refresher, but we also read a lot of Caesar not on the AP plus the Cicero, so I was never bored. Not an extremely difficult class, but make sure you keep up with daily translations (they are not hard, but you'll be doing yourself a favor come quizzes and tests).",
    "As someone who doesn't love Latin, this course was tough, but not unmanageable. HW was very time consuming and we were quizzed weekly, which was challenging but forced you to stay on top of the work.",
    "Improve your translating and read some more latin. Be prepared to study hard for quizzes and tests.",
    "I would recommend LATN 131 for anyone looking to continue their study of Latin and improve their reading and translation abilities. The theme of the course (self-presentation) also provided an interesting lens through which to interpret the texts and made the works more meaningful than they would have been as a mere translation exercise.",
    "Latin 131 is a great introduction to Latin prose. I came into the course not having taken Latin for 3 years and Professor Kraus did a great job of reviewing relevant grammar while also teaching you how to read Latin. The course can be a good amount of work in preparing translations, but it is worth it to better understand what goes on in class. If you take this course, take it with Professor Kraus! She is an expert in Latin prose and also a great teacher.",
    "This is a great introduction to actual texts (not just short passages) and will bring you up to speed in terms of reading real Latin. I would recommend the class one hundred percent for those interested in learning Latin."
