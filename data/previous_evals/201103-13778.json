   "comments": [
    "Poor studio location. Not enough storage given the obvious studio needs. Made for a frustrating semester.",
    "With such large models, we needed more room. Our photo lab wasn't in very good shape when we really needed it to be.",
    "Not having the space to set up our large models (upon which the studio was predicated) was a constant problem. If feel like I am nit-picking because the resources at this school are consistently amazing, but it was a big problem.",
    "Completely. I can't think of any thing that I might have needed, except a stipend for the model materials which for my project came to about 1,200 USD for the semester.",
    "I was always running out of space to build the large models we needed to build and to store them somewhere. Our critiques were also difficult because we had large site-models that needed to be set up and transported and needed a lot of space in the pit. It was unfortunate 1) that we had to move everything to the 7th floor for our mid-review and 2) that we didn't have more space for our final review."
