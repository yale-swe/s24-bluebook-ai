    "This class was an absolute waste of time",
    "I learned about issues pertaining to ethical conduct in the scientific world (plagiarism, falsification of data, the issue of over publishing and peer review, etc.).",
    "Definitely developed a more nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations involved in many situations. Things aren't always as clear-cut as they seem at first.",
    "This course gave me valuable exposure to all the problems facing academia at the moment. In addition, I found the modern examples of questionable ethical conduct helpful in understanding where improvements can be made.",
    "Much too little was learned considering how much class time we had. Many of us know what is expected from graduate students and giving us a bunch of case examples is not going to change whether people will cheat or not. People know cheating and plagiarism is wrong and they do it because they think they can get away with it not because they think it is socially acceptable.",
    "This course exposed me to real-life ethical conduct issues that were directly related to chemistry research.",
    "This course taught the \"objectively correct\" answers to ethical questions and posed interesting questions that were outside the normal scope of ethics that we (as students) are subject to.",
    "Ethical conduct in research",
    "I learned more about what it means to be ethical as a scientist.",
    "How to better recognize different scenarios involving plaigerism and ethical misconduct",
    "know basic ethics",
    "I learned about the ramifications of one's consequences as a leader in scientific research. A researcher has the ability to do great good but can also cause great harm if they are negligent or intentionally unethical. I think this is a valuable lesson that all future researchers should be exposed to."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course just seemed to say, in many words, don't plagiarize. I understand why this course is necessary in terms of really getting to the nitty gritty of what is and isn't plagiarism or ethical, but it felt like just another professor reminding us not to cheat or something, which made me basically not engage in the course at all.",
    "The course has some value to it but the professor's attitude towards our responses discouraged students from participating.",
    "The readings were often pretty interesting. However, I think the way in which discussion was facilitated during class should be changed considerably. I'll discuss this more in question 10.",
    "This course is valuable, as everyone should have exposure to ethics. Class engagement, however, was very low in this class. I think more active assignments such as finding a retracted paper and presenting it to the group would be interesting. A big takeaway from this course was that where the blame lies for infractions is not always very obvious, and often graduate students shoulder an unfair load. Not much time, however, was spent on how this problem can be ameliorated, either through group culture or departmental efforts. I think this could be an interesting thread.",
    "Covered the basics of ethics. The only weakness of the course was the lack of participation from the class. Although this is mostly the fault of the class, it should be noted that many of the students were uncomfortable with speaking. This could be alleviated by making the class a more comfortable environment.",
    "Instructor could be more clear on the format of the class",
    "The readings and examples brought up in class were very interesting and had a lot of points worth discussing The course did a strong job of showing the \"grey areas\" in cases of ethical mosconduxt",
    "Fairly strong course,probably improve organization of material",
    "None",
    "I would have preferred more small group or group-oriented activities since I find those to be most engaging. For a lecture-based course it was definitely engaging and I found the way in which the information was presented to be informative, useful and even mildly entertaining"

   "comments": [
    "No, aside from being talked down to like I was an insolent child the entire time, the course offered nothing but common sense scenarios that could be solved in a matter of seconds rather than an hour",
    "If you want to be in a research lab you have to take this course, so.",
    "I'd probably only take it if required.",
    "Yes, all students should have a background in scientific ethics and know how to approach ethically \"sticky\" situations.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. The course is interesting.",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely. Arguably this course could be offered as a workshop or series of a few lectures but the information within the course and the way in which it was presented served as an excellent experience of which I think all future researchers should be made aware."
