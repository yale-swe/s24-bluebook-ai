   "comments": [
    "In EEB 246 you will essentially create for yourself a map of the plant world. Expect to learn lots and lots of names. It will be worth it.I highly recommend this course.",
    "Fantastic survey course discussing plants and their phylogenic relationships.",
    "This was a great course! I highly recommend this class to anyone! The material is interesting, practical, and accessible, and to top it off, the workload is light and lectures are fun. The only thing I would warn you of is that there is some memorization involved, but not an overwhelming amount. I did not take the lab course, which meant it was harder to visualize some of the things we were talking about in class and it took me longer to get used to plant terminology. In the end, I do not think it hurt me academically, but I did feel like I was missing out on a fun experience. There are fun field trips which are very low-key, definitely go to them if possible.",
    "Take this class, it is laid back, fun, and will make you amazed by the world! Taught by the best professor.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student. Professor Donoghue is a great professor. Very clear and relate-able and he's obviously very passionate about what he's teaching. While I wouldn't say this is necessarily the most \"practical\" biology class offered, it is interesting and you'll learn a lot about plants.",
    "Absolutely fantastic! You have to work hard, but it's a wonderful class, you learn so much! Both the professor and teaching fellows are great. My only suggestion would be to only take it if you're able to take the lab too, they really depend on one another.",
    "A great survey course. Although sometimes it felt a bit like straight memorization, Professor Donoghue did a great job connecting all the facts to a larger picture of plant evolution. Lectures were pretty interesting, and the material itself is really cool!Professor Donoghue is incredibly knowledgeable and a great teacher. Take the class with the lab!",
    "I am not an E&EB major, but I very much enjoyed this class. I suppose if you don't like plants, you will not like this class. But even if you have the slightest interest in botany (as I did), your 'plant blindness' will seriously be wiped away (even if you didn't know you had 'plant blindness'). There is a fair amount of memorization, but so worth it.",
    "The class is incredible and interesting but the lab is pretty much necessary, even if you aren't taking the class for a grade. Otherwise, it's pretty difficult with lots of memorization but worth it.",
    "Absolutely. You might think that plants are boring, but this course will change your mind. Professor Donoghue is an awesome lecturer who will make you realize just how cool plants are, and also a really great person to get to know. Just take it. It was always a highpoint of my day--I wish I could go back and take it again!",
    "I loved this class! I would definitely recommend taking the lab with this course; it makes the midterms and finals so much easier, and I think you end up getting a lot more out of the class.",
    "E&EB 246 is a fun way to learn more about the plants that we see every day. You will learn more about the world around you and plants than you ever thought possible. Professor Donoghue is amazing and will do his best to make sure you understand all the material covered. The midterms can be rough, but this is a great class that you do not want to miss out on, as well as the accompanying lab.",
    "This class includes an overview of the phylogenetic tree of vascular plants (starting from algae and working through complex flowering plants) as well as a discussion and explanation of major topics in evolutionary botany. That might sound dry but it was far from dry! The class was incredible--probably one of the best I have taken. Prof. Donoghue knows so much and is happy and excited to explain everything and anything that you have questions about. The field trips are a lot of fun--walking through the NY Botanical Gardens and exploring part of the forest in Connecticut lead by Prof. Donoghue and his infectious enthusiasm. Even though there are midterm exams (2), a short paper and a final, I never felt like this class was about grades. The subject is fascinating and makes you notice the beauty of the world so much more than you otherwise would. DEFINITELY take the lab along with the lecture if you are considering this class!!",
    "This course was a wonderful class. The lectures were well organized and presented and I felt well prepared for the tests and paper. Not only were the lectures well structured and easy to follow, they were engaging and a delight to attend. This class taught me an amazing amount about plant phylogeny (and phylogeny in general). It is accessible to science and non-science majors and fun!It might be nice if there was a little more plant identification involved, though that might fit better in the lab component.I highly recommend this class, it will broaden your view of the world and you'll have fun taking it. The amount of work is not too much, incredibly manageable."
