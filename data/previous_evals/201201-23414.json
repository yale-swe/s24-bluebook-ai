   "comments": [
    "If you really want to learn about animation from both the conceptual and technical standpoint this is the class for you. But the workload is HUGE, so be careful if you are not willing to commit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! So much fun! You'll learn After Effects and Maya and will actually be able to make something you're proud of. Can be a ton of work depending on what you make.",
    "It's the only real animation class at Yale. If you're interested in animation, definitely take it. But know, like any art class, that you will have to put a lot of work into it if you really want to come out with something that your proud of.",
    "It's great exposure to alternative forms of animation, and the fluidity of the programs you learn allows you to push the content and form of your work. Absolutely take this class.",
    "First half is mostly 2D animation and some background\/history of animation. You watch some fun videos of old vs new animations, the history of how the industry has grown\/changed. Midterm project is really open ended, mostly 2D animation techniques. Second half is learning Maya, a 3D animation program, much more complicated but you can do the coolest things. Final project is also really open ended. Highly recommend this class.",
    "Digital Animation was a lot of fun, and you should be prepared to work. Because the art department does not offer much in the way of animation, a lot is crammed into one semester, but it's totally worth it. Johannes also allows for a lot of freedom on the midterm and final projects (by this I mean they are entirely open). There are a few assignments designed to build skill (such as bouncing balls in After Effects and Maya), but these are really enjoyable and worth it in the end. A great course!",
    "If you love animation, just take it. It'll make you happy. If you don't know anything about animation, just know that every second is 24 frames, and that for certain things you need to draw every single one of this. What I'm trying to say is that this class is time consuming like nobody's business. Be prepared for late nights. Take the class with friends.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. While the class will take a LOT a LOT of time outside of class, it is probably the most valuable film production class I have taken at Yale."
