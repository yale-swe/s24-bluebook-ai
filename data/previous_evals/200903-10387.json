    "After taking alot of programming-intensive courses, it can be good to work out your brain differently for a while. You will learn about planning, and it will not take up 20 hours a week.",
    "If you love AI and want more, then you should take this class. You will learn what planning is and the many different ways to do it. It's initially a little shocking to discover how much time and effort on the topic but once you take the class you'll realize that the planning problem encompasses a lot of other ones too.If you hated AI, then you will hate planning for the same reasons. There are not many elegant results. Most of the papers rely on using experimental data to show that planner X works better planner Y on a specific set of test cases. There is a lot of bickering over the right way to measure success and the bickering is generally (but not always) less interesting than the planning."
