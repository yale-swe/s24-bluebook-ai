    "A really useful course and a good place to learn things you probably haven't seen yet.",
    "Essentially the 2nd part of Quantum Mechanics fundamental for grad students. Worth taking whether the material is related to the research topic or not.",
    "PHYS 608 with Professor Harris covers a lot of important topics, but did not treat any of them with much depth or with the rigor characteristic of Professor Appelquist's PHYS 508.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn about approximation methods, etc. Unfortunately it likely won't convey much underlying understanding of the theory you are studying, but you can always do extra reading on your own.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone interested in QM."

    "A lot of course material was very directly applicable to my subfield, which I appreciated. Probably the course that has contributed the most to my understanding of the field in which I work.",
    "Not directly related to my research topics, but approximation methods can always be helpful.",
    "I was introduced to several important topics in quantum mechanics, but I don't feel like I'm able to understand them in very much depth or that I'm more prepared for future classes than I was prior to taking this course.",
    "It made me realize that physics research involving QFT is not for me."
