   "comments": [
    "This isn't really an introduction to poetry but it is a really fun class and will teach you more about your own writing.",
    "If you want a pretty low-pressure class where you just write a poem every week and get it workshopped, take this class. It does improve your writing and it's really fun to read others' work.",
    "The class was divided into two segments: an anthology where each student brought in a poem of their liking and a workshop to revises student poems. As a class to develop your own voice, ENGL 246 was helpful. Anthologies are always fun because I found other poets through poems that others brought in.",
    "In general, it is a fantastic exercise to write a poem a week. Not a huge amount of work, but enough to really get you thinking about the kind of poetry that you are writing, and want to be writing. But in general, this class, as it is primarily a workshop, really depends on the Professor and on the group of students taking it--and for me, the workshop vibes were often slow, and often frustrating in that people didn't seem to put that much thought into the poems before arriving at class. Professor Zarin didn't really seem invested in our work, or in the class in general. I think the class structure, etc., has a great deal of potential to be really great, but didn't full realize itself, at least this semester.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in writing poetry."
