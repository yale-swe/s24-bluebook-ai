    "IP Law meets Memes meets the cupcake fairy. Enough said.",
    "A class about some of the problems with the internet, and how we confront them day to day. Additionally, you deal with a lot of the law in relation to the internet, and how we still have a long way to go in that regard.",
    "CPSC 183 is a great class. It's got a good bit of reading, but it's really interesting, so it goes by fast. Brad's class is all about how much you put into it, and there is a lot of room for expression in this class. I highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. I think I was just so fascinated by the material--it is so different from everything else you learn at Yale. Part free speech, copyright, and policy law-style class. Part tech industry& cultural analysis. There is a lot of readings, but you don't have to read every single line of the readings, and you'll want to do them all. The reading responses were a little annoying, but the midterm wasn't too bad if you were paying attention and staying on top of the readings somewhat. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about Brad in the beginning, but I ended up really liking him. If you participate and show that you care, he can be a really amazing mentor.",
    "Great survey course on law and technology. You have to shop it, but don't be put off by Brad - he's actually nice and will work to give you a good grade if you participate and engage with the material, which you should, because the material is really important for the world we live in.",
    "This class is definitely not your typical Yale class. It is a high energy, very entertaining, sometimes disjointed class, but with all of that said the class is phenomenal, and I think that most people really enjoyed it.",
    "This course was an absolute blast, and the classes quickly became a regular highlight of my day. Every class felt like a comedy routine, but each time I walked out with a very solid understanding of the material. He brings in a few interesting speakers but I always preferred the normal class to any of the guest lectures. Every assignment is designed to be as enjoyable as possible, and in my experience everything has been graded fairly - as long as you put some thought into your work you'll do fine. One thing I would note is that participation is everything in this class - if you participate well and like to join in class discussions you'll do great, if you're someone who likes to sit in the back anonymously, take notes, take exams, and move on, this class isn't for you.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Its a good class with some interesting material, and isn't that hard to do well in if you do the reading. The reading responses are a bit on the long side, but the final is just a video project which was great. Brad is definitely one of the most unique professors at Yale and he brings cupcakes to every class, if that's your thing.",
    "This is a very fun and interesting class. Brad is very enthusiastic and the topics are very intriguing and often applicable to your life.",
    "Honestly, this is one of the best courses I've taken! However, it's probably not right for everyone. If you like what's considered a \"normal\" class with strict deadlines and teacher standing in front of board, this is not for you. Brad has a very lively teaching style which requires you to get involved with the class discussion. As far as workload goes, there are 4 reading responses, a blog post, a midterm and a final project. It's really manageable, but sometimes you won't really feel like you know how you're doing in the class, and deadlines are somewhat flexible. This wasn't really a problem, but just something to keep in mind. Overall, I would really recommend looking at this class! Shop it, and if it's not for you, it's not for you. (Brad is the best!). Oh, and there are cupcakes in every class..just sayin.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It covers topics that I think everyone should know about, and Brad Rosen is an amazing instructor who makes the class extremely enjoyable.",
    "Take it.",
    "Fun, educational, occasionally silly. This class is 50% law school, 50% an overview of modern cyberculture. If either interests you, take this class.",
    "Definitely! Best class at Yale! If you do the readings and keep up with the material, you will learn a lot! It's not much work, but you need to put in the time when it's needed.",
    "Class material is very relevant in today's world, but be ready for an unstructured style of teaching. If you need structure, don't take the class.",
    "Take this class if you are ever remotely interested in technology or law, you won't regret it.",
    "Know what you want out of a class before you commit yourself to Law Tech, it is really a mixed bag. Some critical questions you should ask yourself before signing on: Do I care if the professor makes up the syllabus as he goes along, often assigning reading a day in advance? Am I bothered by not knowing the due date for ANYTHING more than a week and a half before it's due? Do I feel comfortable writing 1,000 word reading responses? Am I willing to plow through often excessive reading to prepare for a participatory lecture, where the professor expects everyone to speak up? If any of these things make you uncomfortable, do not take this class-- you will be very frustrated. On the other hand, Brad is really awesome. You watch silly YouTube videos most days, he brings cupcakes to lecture EVERY TIME, and you learn some pretty relevant stuff about law and the internet. Do the pros outweigh the cons? You decide.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the law or the internet or really anyone looking for a fun class.",
    "Okay, TBH, this felt like a waste of a semester. It's a \"fun\" class with not that much work (very open ended reading responses, and a metric ton of readings) and no final (there is a final project). The lecturer thinks he's God's gift to man just because he's charismatic. He claims to be open but tends to shoot down students if they express a view he doesn't agree with. His lecture style is very entertaining though, if a bit hard to follow at times (because of all the references). It's extremely American-law-centric, and assumes prior knowledge of how the US legal system works. It's about culture, but relies way too heavily on getting inside jokes mostly centred around memes (which I'd say I have average knowledge of) and American pop culture. By the end I didn't really feel like I had learned anything other than what Fair Use is, and whether my YouTube uploads would be copyright infringement.",
    "It's not an awesome class, but has the potential to be much better than it was this year if Brad focuses a little more on the actual material and he doesn't run into the same scheduling issues.",
    "Good class, take Cr\/D if you dont want to do the extensive reading.",
    "Interesting class if disorganized at times. Get to know the professor- he is great. Take it if you want to know more about tech law and you don't mind disorganization. Quite fun.",
    "First things first: Brad is awesome. He's very eccentric but knowledgeable, and his teaching style is unlike any other I've ever encountered. It takes a bit to get used to, especially if you're a 'classic Yale student', but he really pushes students to think critically about issues while keeping a fun atmosphere. HOWEVER, this is not necessarily a good thing. Too often in LawTech, the discussion went off on a tangent that did not relate at all to the day's material. As the term went on, some students became more comfortable with derailing the conversation into things like Ke$ha's trashiness (seriously). It was all fun and games, but as I sat in class I couldn't help feeling like I was wasting my time. Even if you manage to do all of the (many, MANY) readings, they're usually not all discussed, especially when Brad brings in guest lecturers (which he did three or four times). If you end up taking LawTech, it's not hard to do well \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0just come to every lecture prepared and raise your hand a lot \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0and you'll probably have fun. I know I did, and I learned some neat stuff, but I don't feel like I got 100% out of it, so it was a bit disappointing in that respect.",
    "Law, Technology,& Culture is definitely not your average course and Brad Rosen is not your average professor. His energy and passion keeps the class exciting. I would definitely recommend it. Brad has an amazing understanding of a very large range of issues, from complex court cases to remixed Lady Gaga YouTube videos. You'll learn things that are extremely relevant and topical - information that will inform your world view for years to come. It's essentially run like a large seminar class. The expectations are reasonable and designed so that you take a lot out of the course. But because his teaching style, you'll only get out of the class what you put into it.",
    "I showed the course title and description to my father, and he told me to watch out because it might be bone dry. So I went in expecting to suffer through a course that would be useful in the future. But Brad makes this course entertaining. Brad makes this course. At least shop this class.",
    "Good class for students considering Law School or intrigued by the intricacies of law and technology in the current society.",
    "TAKE IT. Brad is the best. Lecture is extremely enjoyable. There's not much work outside of class - just readings for each class, 4 2-page reading responses, a take-home midterm and a final project.",
    "Take this class. Take it now.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Brad really makes the class. He is not the typical professor by any means, and may come off a bit crazed, in a wonderful way. He does bring cupcakes or other Claire's treats to every class, which is a definite plus. He has intense amounts of energy, and if that scares you a little, maybe this isn't the class for you. But if you enjoy a high energy professor who clearly cares about what he's teaching, come get a cupcake.",
    "You've probably heard a lot about this class already if you're considering taking it. Yes, Brad brings cupcakes to every class; yes, you spend half of your time in class watching youtube videos; yes, the class veers towards the absurd sometimes. That said, if you put in effort, you will learn a decent amount about subjects such as copyright law, privacy, internet freedom, net neutrality, and so on. However, if you don't do the readings, you won't get much out of the course, because classtime is often very unstructured and spent watching videos\/discussing hypotheticals as opposed to going over the day's readings\/material in detail. At some points I thought that we could have benefitted from a more conventional\/dryer class experience, but overall it is very refreshing to have a Yale class with a young professor who knows what students are interested in. The guests that Brad brings are also very interesting. As a student in this class, you will have the chance to connect with Brad in a way unlike any other Yale professor - he is interested in being friends with students, and even takes groups of students out to dinner after class. Very reasonable workload - 4 reading responses (4 pages each), take home midterm, a blog post, and a final project.",
    "I would highly recommend it. This course is at the cutting edge of the clash of technology and culture as we know it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. DO IT!",
    "It's a lot of really useful and interesting material with a totally manageable amount of work. Definitely take it if you can.",
    "This class is a blend of computer science, law, and popular culture. You need not be tech savvy to enjoy and understand it, though if you seek to be, it is a great place to start. Very good class, and a lot of laughs, must take!"
