    "As a future archival researcher, this course was critical for understanding the theory underlying empirical research methods. Although I would have liked for the course to sacrifice some of the theoretical approach in favor of practical applications, I believe that knowing the theory will help.",
    "Very helpful. Required by the program.",
    "I don't have the math background in the materials of course. My research interests are applied econometric analysis. I think the course prepare me really well with understanding research in the field of econometrics and its techniques, which is incredible tool to have for my own research."
