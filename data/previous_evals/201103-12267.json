    "Broad and long history of US foreign policy. I wouldn't go either way in terms of recommending the class. I think that I didn't enjoy it very much, but I'm sure others did and I do think that it would be a valuable class in lecture form.",
    "Much more boring than it sounds",
    "Take it if you reeeeeeally enjoy reading primary sources. There is a ton of reading, but it's interesting. Probably not the first class I would take for American History though. Cohrs' lecture is better.",
    "Take it. -",
    "Take this course if you are interested in international relations or America's rise as a world power. Cohrs is a great adviser, he is very thorough in his readings of papers and has a great wealth of knowledge on the nature of American international relations.",
    "Yes, a good survey of ideas in American foreign policy and how they evolved over time. There's a lot of focus on what makes American foreign policy uniquely American, how American ideas and ideologies influenced foreign policy decisions. It does go rather quickly because the course covers the entirety of U.S. history.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're willing to commit a significant amount of time to it instead of breezing through. While the actual paper and presentation assigments are not inordinately time-consuming, the reading each week is substantial, and the majority of it is dense, priamry source material. In addition, Prof. Cohrs challenges you to really do deep readings of the material (analyzing the audience, language, historical context, as well as connecting them to past readings). So some extra work is required to really engage with Prof. Cohrs' questions above and beyond the assigned reading for the week. But Prof. Cohrs is extremely knowledgeable, accessible, and kind, so if you're interested specifically in ideas and ideologies in history, this is a great course to take."
