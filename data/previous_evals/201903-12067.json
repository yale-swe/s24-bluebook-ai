   "comments": [
    "I thought it was really great. It would have been helpful to have the course notes given out sooner, as sometimes I felt that the notes were posted online just after turning a homework where they would have been helpful. I'm not sure if it would make the course better, but following a textbook more closely could have made it easier to follow and review everything.",
    "The structure of the course is very thoughtfully organized, and the notes are very concise and organized in a more thought-provoking way, both Prof. Appelquist and Jingping are also very responsible and helpful",
    "The rate of equations per lecture is pretty high. Theres nothing wrong with this, but it's something to be aware of going into the course. Prof Appelquist's rate of speech is fairly usual, so it can be easy to fail to notice the rapid pace at which he is going through the material. The PSets can be sometimes disconnected from the material covered in class, which can affect one's ability to connect them to everything else we are learning. For instance, there was a question on the Casimir effect that appeared to come from nowhere, that no one knew how to even begin approaching. Then everyone did some googling to understand the context of the question and the surrounding material, we answered the question and then never thought about the topics in it ever again. The only other thing I want to comment about is unclear emphasis. There was a term 'X' used on our final that someone asked a clarification about. He explained that since he had spent substantial class time on studying 'X' he was unable to provide a further clarification. I didn't recall what the term meant, but dropped the matter assuming that that was just a me problem. When I went back and looked through my notes, the topic was indeed covered. The next day, he sent out an email to the class saying that \"no one was able to say much of anything about ['X']. This is an important topic that I covered in some detail in class [...]\" The fact that no student in the class was able to say much of anything on the final about a topic covered in some detail strikes me as concerning. The strengths of this course are definitely how interesting the material was and how available the professor and TA made themselves. The TA especially, went out of his way to schedule additional office hours when we needed them even beyond what was required of him.",
    "The homeworks for this course are very helpful for learning the material.",
    "It's a hard course and naturally moved at a pretty quick pace. I think I would've benefited from a slower pace, but I also knew what I was getting into when I signed up for the class.",
    "The course is fairly standard in its presentation with a few modifications, but I felt that the material could have been covered slightly more quickly.",
    "The course was planned out very well, and the material was presented in a very thought out way. The biggest weakness of the course was that I felt it moved very quickly. To be fair, if I was actually taking the class and doing the homeworks that could have helped me there."
