    "Not a lot of work and you do some hands on bio stuff. That's all you can expect. Maybe you'll learn something, but not much.",
    "There is absolutely no reason anyone should take this course- it was by far the least fulfilling, most disorganized class I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Blake was a poor teacher. She did not seem engaged in the class- she habitually was late (20-40 minutes; our final was delayed by 45) or didn't show up at all. She forgot about assignments we had turned in and sometimes asked us about assignments she had never actually assigned (including a lab we first learned about the day AFTER reading period ended, based on an exercise we had conducted in January). She didn't learn our names (there were 5 of us), as based on her passing out the graded midterms to the wrong people in late April. She posted lecture slides the night before the final (which in part covered material we never discussed in class). I could go on and on. As a result of this disorganization, we learned very little in class. Some class periods consisted of us sitting around for half an hour, doing nothing until Professor Blake arrived because the TA didn't know what was going on, and then looking at bacteria under a microscope for an hour. Others consisted of us trying to do lab techniques on which we received no instruction- just basic guidelines with no explanation of the biochemistry behind each step. There are so many other bio classes at Yale that have to be better than this one- do yourself a favor and avoid GG 255.",
    "Don't take this class. Professor Blake was very frequently late to class, almost never prepared, unclear in her assignments and expectations, and often very harsh in her demeanor. It seems like she knows her stuff, but taking a class with her is an ordeal."
