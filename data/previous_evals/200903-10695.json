   "comments": [
    "Something you have to suffer through (no choice in taking the course), but that through your own ownership of work and reading, you can shape your own experience.",
    "It is a requirement, but perhaps the best requirement there is. I wish we had more semesters of methods ahead of us.",
    "A broad-based course in the historiography and various optics applied to art objects. I would recommend it with the changes suggested above.",
    "this course is mandatory, but i don't think i would take the course if it were not required. i am sure enough in my investment in art history as a discipline that i intend to pursue many of the aspects of the course in the more specialized courses the department has to offer.",
    "It was an excellent course-- provided a very comprehensive overview of material within and beyond art history.",
    "I would summarize the course as an extremely broad introduction to the field and to a selection of critical theory that has informed the humanities more generally over the past 50 years. As the course is mandatory, I would probably describe it as helpful background for other work and reading, as well as a good opportunity to get to know classmates."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not only did it deepen my understanding of the disciplineas a profession, but also helped me work through ideas that will serve as the epistemological framework that will help to guide my research and dissertation work.",
    "The exposure to readings I hadn't been privy to previously, especially the early historiography, gave me a more solid basis of understanding the discipline. The \"object paper\" was incredibly helpful as I continue to refine my voice.",
    "the course, like many seminars in graduate school, depends on the investment of the student. i found the most exciting aspects of the course to be the moments when i could engage my own research. i loved some of the reading and thought much of the reading was essential for anyone starting out in the field. despite that i had read much of it previously, there was certainly no harm in reviewing it.",
    "Excellent methods course. Great preparation for future studies in art history.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the origins of the field. My research for the final paper was also quite informative for my own work, in that it prompted me to look at art history in relation to other disciplines--always a welcome move. I also felt the course gave me frequent opportunities to bring my specific interests to bear on paper assignments, which I really appreciated. I tested out various ideas in the shorter course papers in a way that proved helpful later in the semester, and, I am sure, as I move forward int he program."
