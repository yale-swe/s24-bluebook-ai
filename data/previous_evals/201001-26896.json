    "This course was very different from most of my graduate school studies, which have been science-based and fairly directed to my research. However, I learned many things about how science is applied by lawmakers and others working in the \"real world.\" This information is very useful to know, though most scientists tend not to think about it.",
    "Definitely saw some overlaps with my discipline and public policy development in other sectors (health, international relations, human rights). Appropriate class given recent talks on climate change."
