   "comments": [
    "If you're in the major, you have to take this. If you're not, you'll be one of maybe five people. This doesn't mean that the course material is inaccessible, but rather that it is perhaps only valuable to those who are interested in architecture (this probably isn't one of those classes where you can apply your new skills to the rest of your academic career). Prof Sherer is a hit or a miss in most cases, but entertaining for sure.",
    "Would probably recommend--very, very interesting lecture. Useful and not too difficult homework. Professor has a habit of running 5-10 minutes overtime. Professor not very good in section--not very good at interacting with students.",
    "Overview of primarily Western European architecture. You write a midterm paper and a final paper on a topic of your choice, and reading responses for section each week, so the workload is manageable, and the potential for interesting paper topics is immense.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, one interest in either history or architecture.",
    "Despite the shortcomings of the professor, this class is still interesting if you have an interest in architecture. I don't feel like I produced anything interesting because of the course, but I learned a lot about the broad strokes of styles and mentalities that make up the history of European architecture.",
    "ARCH 260 is a very straight forward history course, one that progresses through a broad period of History, hitting only the Architectural highlights along the way. If you want a basic competency with architectural history this is a fair course, but for its wide breadth it sacrifices a great deal of depth in the subject matter.",
    "Professor Sherer is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject but sometimes abrasive as a lecturer. Not much work--mainly one long essay.",
    "If you're an architecture major, you'll be taking this course - so not too much freedom there. For anyone not an architecture major, you have to really love history to appreciate this course. Professor Sherer's lectures were often more focused on the historical aspect of what we were studying in each lecture, which often leaves you with a feeling of longing for more information, and sometimes confusion, about the architecture itself. The workload is not heavy so the class is manageable, as long as you do the readings every week."
