   "comments": [
    "Understanding of development of the humanitarian response system. Current issues of humanitarian operations and coordination.",
    "a nuanced understanding of the humanitarian sector, a comfort with the literature surrounding humanitarian aid, and the ability to confidently identify and assess gaps in policy frameworks",
    "The role of humanitarian agencies in relief efforts, the history, challenges, and possible paths for change.",
    "learned more about the nature of the humanitarian aid sector",
    "Humanitarian history",
    "A deep insight into the actions of humanitarianism and a lens through which to critique it. It is a fascinating course to take that changed the way I think about the complexity behind certain structures of power and how decisions are made.",
    "Develop a critical thinking historical contextual framework for relevant literature , news and future planning",
    "By the end of this course I became keenly aware of the historical and present day dynamics influencing humanitarian aid. This was an incredible journey in this regard.",
    "History of the humanitarian aid system, critical perspectives to the current humanitarian aid system.",
    "I learned A LOT about humanitarian aid. I didn't come from this field and feel I understand its development, challenges and opportunities much better. It was a great overview which really makes you think long and hard about some of issues you might have to face working in crisis zones.",
    "A really thorough understanding of the history and challenges of the humanitarian aid space.",
    "Understanding global ramifications of strategies and operations that are implemented by foreign aid agencies.",
    "How humanitarian practices and principles diverge due to inherent challenges in how existing systems operate.",
    "The class overviewed the history of the humanitarian system, highlighting key trends in development and critically examining key successes and failures. I learned so much about the modern humanitarian system, how it came to be about, and its implications for the rest of the world.",
    "I received a comprehensive view of humanitarian aid, development, and its history in a way I never received while working in the field. The course readings and discussions clued me into macro-level changes in the world of aid that are not always apparent on the ground. I also learned many details about cutting edge innovations and risks introduced by technology in humanitarian aid."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Students can deepen overall analytical insight as well as practical knowledge on the current humanitarian issues.",
    "The biggest strength is Nathaniel himself. He's just a great professor, so engaging to listen to and incredibly accessible to his students. Because he's a practitioner, the course feels a bit disjointed and disorganized at times when he's busier. But it's worth the patience to learn what you can from him. The biggest structural weakness of the course itself is the crisis assignments -- we talked for way too long when we did them, and then basically stopped doing them for the second half of the semester. I didn't feel like I got much academic value out of them besides a bit of independent research.",
    "Strengths: nice immersion into course content; excellent professor; I like how it's seminar style \/ classroom layout Weaknesses: didn't discuss the readings much; posting of grades and feedback were very delayed",
    "the course was too big for discussion; I wish it was smaller or that we had broken into groups when we tried to have discussions the best part of the course was just hearing Nathaniel talk about his experiences and the current state and the history of the field",
    "World class instruction by Nathaniel Raymond. Could be improved with a little more structure.",
    "The course is disorganised, scattered, doesn't follow the readings, filled with moving deadlines and miscommunicated assignments, and is absolutely brilliant all in one. Nathaniel holds a lot and has a lot to teach. Once you accept the disorganisation and breath into a different way of teaching and learning, this course gives you so so much depth to explore.",
    "Strength : discussion , material , lecture , guest speaker Weakness: the first 1-2 week can seem disorganized which may led to some students dropping out.",
    "Strengths: * The course was an amazing platform for discussion * One of my favorite aspects of this course was the realization that the work we accomplished in this class could be applied outside the classroom. * The professor is extremely knowledgeable and engaging. Weakness: * Organization and expectations for assignments.",
    "The content is amazing and combines history of humanitarian aid with current issues through discussion. The only way in which the course would be improved is if it was a small seminar so that students would be able to participate more proactively.",
    "Strengths: Professor Raymond! I also enjoyed writing my final paper and learning more about the crisis I followed. Weakness: We were a lot of students this year and the weekly crisis updates were hard to excute. This part should possibly be structured differently because the assignment itself is great and I feel I could have learned more about crises other than my own.",
    "Excellent professor with field experience and passionate about the topic",
    "Strengths: class discussions, informal lecture style, constant connection with current events. Improvement: The class is currently divided between the syllabus and personal research on paper topics related to certain countries of focus-- I would have enjoyed diving into my research topic and discussing it more, however, I know that there are limitations with a large class size. Overall great course.",
    "Strengths: The content was fascinating and Nathaniel was very knowledgeable. He genuinely values the solutions put forward by students and gives them the attention and space to produce genuine recommendations for big problems. The fact that he made students feel as though they could make a difference made the learning experience more immersive. Weaknesses: Nathaniel is an excellent teacher but had a lot of things on his plate. The class would benefit from having a course administration assistant to support the organization of the course.",
    "The course provided a comprehensive review of aid history using the best texts available. Class discussions allowed Professor Raymond and my classmates to share their own experiences. We could have spent more time focusing on the individual assignments and research allocated in the syllabus."
