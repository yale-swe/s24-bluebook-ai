    "Decent class for the language requirement. It is not always a blast, and is a good amount of work, but you do get better at the language.",
    "Great class. A lot of work, but ultimately worthwhile.",
    "For those continuing their French studies, I enthusiastically recommend the course with Mme Burton. While challenging and with high expectations, those who have had her will know that she is very caring towards her students, helpful, knowledgable, and enthusiastic for the language. Overall, workload was, on a daily basis, somewhat less than FREN 130, though definitely present. Readings tended to be longer and more challenging than 130, but were often clarified well in class; the Diversit readings gave very interesting perspectives on other Francophone countries not often discussed. Grammar tended to often combine topics from 130 with slightly new topics. Tests could prove tricky (especially with Identifications), and point deductions can add up. Cinema often emphasized in course as well, and was well-incorporated into study and enjoyable. Particularly enjoyed WWII unit, and while time-consuming for research, the presentations were definitely rewarding. Overall, course makes evident the strength of Yale's French department, and has deepened my passion and interest for the French language.",
    "You get what you put in to it. A standard language course."
