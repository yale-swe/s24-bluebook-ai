    "I think this is a great class to take if you want to improve your drawing skills, whether you are an art major or not. The class is very enjoyable, and I really liked the change of pace that an art class provides. It's very nice to have homework that isn't a problem set or a paper.",
    "It's very hard and takes a lot of time, but it was a very rewarding course.",
    "Yes! Natalie was awesome, she really cares about your progress and how you approach each assignment, not just your objective skill level. She'll find your strengths and weaknesses and show you how to improve in ways that affect all your drawings, not just that specific assignment. The work load is also very reasonable, nothing to be wary of!",
    "Take this class if you're thinking about it. It takes work, yes, and sometimes it's stressful due to the critiques. But boy oh boy is it worth it. Natalie will push you hard, and she might seem overly harsh in the beginning, but by the end of the semester, you'll have blossomed into a much improved artist. Finally, there's nothing like spending hours DRAWING for homework. It took a long time but it was very enjoyable.",
    "ART 114 03 is a very basic class. It's designed for those who have little or no experience with drawing before. You will learn a lot if you have never drawn before in your life. But beware if you are already confident with your drawing: you will still improve, but not so much."
