    "I very much enjoyed this course. Professor Lalli catered the course to our strengths and weaknesses. The rhythmic exercises were fun and sometimes challenging. I'd recommend this course to anyone looking for a better understanding of musicianship and a great course. Lalli is a great professor. He made the course just as challenging as it needed to be. He has immense knowledge of the vocal repertoire and exposed me to great music I never knew existed. I like Josquin des Prez now.",
    "Definitely take this after 219 if you're interested in improving your sight-reading and your ear (and musicianship in general). You sort of never know what you're going to get from Professor Lalli, and you often have to figure out how to go about difficult tasks on your own. But I definitely recommend this class!"
