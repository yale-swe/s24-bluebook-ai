    "Well if you're taking this then you probably have to. Good luck",
    "I think most students who take this course have no choice to take it.",
    "It was okay. There are certainly more interesting classes out there, but it's required if you want to do more econ so...",
    "Interesting but difficult introduction to graduate micro. I would only recommend the class to those with a sufficient math background.",
    "Yes",
    "focus more on the lecture notes, and try the understand the theories well. That's the most important thing for this course.",
    "Yes, if they re interested in advanced economics, definintely",
    "I would recommend Econ 500 01 for graduate students in the economics department (since it is required), and I would tell them to have no fear. I found the class very pleasant. The class might also be useful for interested undergraduates.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to first year Ph.D students. It helps deepen my knowledge of economics.",
    "Yes, I will. It's very useful.",
    "Economics 500 is a good graduate level introduction to microeconomics. I would recommend the course, but I would be sure to also explain the limitations of the professors described above, as they were frustrating at times.",
    "It's a required course for economics PhD students. I'd recommend it to other people who are certain they will go to school for an economics Ph.D.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because I find the contents covered useful.",
    "It is a important course for further study of economic theory. The instructors can help you better understand the contents.",
    "I would recommend for someone without any training in gradaute Micro."

   "comments": [
    "Teaches you the theory, yeah.",
    "It helps me a lot.",
    "It has not really helped improve my broad view of micro, but has trained me to be able to solve a lot of the basic problems.",
    "Helpful",
    "I believe this course was useful and helped me grasp concepts of equilibrium in papers that I did not fully understand before this course.",
    "I took this course because it offered more advanced theory than my own department's courses. I intend to use the skills&knowledge learned in this course in my own future research.",
    "This class is absolutely essential for my profession.",
    "This course greatly deepened my knowledge, as it is part of the foundation of any research I do in the future.",
    "Most of the theories and models introduced are used in our research. So it's useful to know.",
    "The course greatly deepened my knowledge of microeconomics. I cannot comment on its contribution to my research, as I do not have a research topic in mind.",
    "It's hard to answer the second part of the question since as a first-year economics student I do not exactly have a research program yet. I feel that I learned some important tools that economists use.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think very little.The second part helped me in valuing simple models to present strong arguments."
