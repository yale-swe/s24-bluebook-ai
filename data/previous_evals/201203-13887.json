   "comments": [
    "This course should probably come with prereqs, and is not ideal for those without some background in genetics.",
    "I think some background in genetics is necessary to hit the ground running in this course. Occasionally, I misunderstood some of the concepts due to my limited background knowledge of the subject matter, but overall the course wasn't so advanced that I struggled significantly.",
    "The class only meets once a week, and I found that the material presented was usually rushed. I felt that I did not take away all the concepts I wanted and at times struggled to catch up. Nonetheless, the professor was very helpful in answering students' questions.",
    "Strengths--the weekly homework paved the way for the midterm, so even though it took a long time, the concepts had been reviewed sufficient times before so the test felt really straightforward. The readings were interesting and a nice complement to lecture.Weaknesses--office hours were the day before the homework was due so you figured out what you did wrong with little time to fix it before it was due.To improve--It would have been interesting to learn about the genetics behind specific disorders.",
    "Excellent course. This provides more depth about common topics in genetics these days (linkage analysis, association studies) and will be very useful going forward in terms of understanding these studies better.",
    "Very good course; only improvement would be to transition more effectively between relatively basic material (meiosis, mitosis, etc.) and advanced material. Even after completing the readings for the course, it was difficult at times to follow along with some of the terminology towards the end of the course. However, Dr. Dewan was always available to answer any questions at the end of class.",
    "The lectures and readings were very interesting. I appreciated that the course was not focused on memorizing small details, but rather understanding the main concepts. This was reflected in the choice of midterm and final exam for the class.",
    "This was a great course, and great introduction to genetics. The readings were on target in terms of their accessibility to students learning about genetics. We covered a great deal of information, but because the transitions from week to week were seamless, the logic in how the material was clear. The course typically attracts 15-20 students. As a student, you'll be able to ask questions and engage in discussion during class time - a big advantage over larger classes. Also, the professor has a great teaching style, and does a great job of preparing the lectures in a logical and coherent way. Overall, great course.",
    "Best course I have taken at Yale!"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan is an excellent instructor. He is approachable, fun, and very patient. I cannot emphasize enough the patience he has for his students and their many questions.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy did a great job at providing feedback and answering any questions both inside and outside of the classroom. He was always very accessible. His detailed knowledge of the subject occasionally made the lectures go fast and sometimes concepts were moved over quickly, but he always took time to answer questions and clarify any misunderstandings. He did a very good job teaching this course.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan is a delightful professor who cares a lot about his students. He is very prompt with his emails, and he helps steer his students to the right path. However, his lecturing style is a bit quick paced, and given his topic of genetics, I felt that this complicated subject should have been made more simple, especially since it was written as an introductory course for genetics.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Great professor. He responded emails quickly. He was always available for his students. He explains the material in a clear and straightforward way. He answered every question regardless of their simplicity or not. He knew everyone's name, which is highly appreciated as a student. He is very organized and posted slides and homework consistently at the same time every week.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy is possibly the nicest professor I've ever had. He knows his material well and explains it very well. He is very responsive to students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Very excellent instructor! Only comment would be to explain more of the terminology towards the later lectures rather than jumping into the lecture; was confusing even after completing the readings.Other than that, he was always available for questions\/comments and really helped us understand the material...also increased interest in genetic epi.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan is an exceptional professor. He is extremely helpful both inside and outside of class. He created homework assignments that challenged me, but also reinforced what we had learned. His feedback was very helpful. He is very clear in his lectures and brought in outside sources that were very helpful for supplementing what we learned.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan clearly enjoys teaching and mentoring students. He also is clearly an expert on genetics and knows the ins and outs of the field at every level. These two qualities are a big part of what make his lectures engaging. In addition to time spent in lecture with Professor DeWan, I found that his office hours were very helpful and provided a space to discuss applications of the material we learned - I would definitely recommend regularly attending his office hours as it provides a platform to engage in great discussions. Overall, the instruction for this class was exceptional.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor Dewan is by far one of the best professors I have had at Yale. He is so ever dedicated to helping his students succeed in his course. I always knew I could go to him whenever I needed clarification on course topics or even career advice."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This course moves a bit quickly for those without a background in genetics. For those without such a background I would suggest taking another more basic course first.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who has at least an introductory background in genetics. Andy was a very competent teacher and did an excellent job communicating with the students.",
    "Although this course is designed for those without much genetics background, I would suggest to have some background in genetics to fully gain the most out of the class. There is a lot of material to digest, and it will take extra effort to reach out to the professor to really appreciate it. Overall, a good course for those interested in genetics and intrigued by science beyond the central dogma.",
    "Amazing! This was my favorite course during Fall semester and I had not genetics background. Would definitely recommend it, even if you do not want to go into this field. It provides a general introduction to the biological aspects of genetics, as well as the epidemiological and research aspects.",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in genetics, or if you know that you will be performing (or even reading) linkage or association studies in your field. In my opinion, this course was easier because I had prior coursework in genetics. I know a few students who did not have prior coursework in genetics, and theyfound this a challenging course.",
    "Very good course - would highly recommend",
    "This course is excellent for someone who does not have a strong science background and is looking to understand the basic concepts of genetics. I would absolutely recommend it to another student looking to refresh basic biology concepts and learn about the concepts of genetics and the ethical implications of genetic testing.",
    "This class provides foundational knowledge for anybody interested in genetics. We covered everything from the analysis of genetic data, to the ethical implications associated with advancements in genetics. The course provides feedback on knowledge gained throw weekly assignments, as well as the freedom to apply that knowledge in a final term paper. Because the course is small, you'll have the opportunity to really dissect the material with the Professor both during class and during office hours.",
    "This is an introductory genetic epidemiology course. We began by an overview of genetic topics (central dogma, inheritance pattern, genomic analytical techniques, for example) and then focused on linkage analysis and the design of association studies, two methods that have been used to find links between diseases and different genes."
