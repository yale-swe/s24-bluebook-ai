   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "You learn about the design process and what makes for a \"good design\" for a good human experience. Unlike many courses, you spend the entire semester focusing on a product from start to finish, and you get to interact with many people who are innovators from all different fields. The skills that you learn may be ones that you are improving upon or new ones that you have never touched before. Students delved into mechanical design, electronics, coding, graphic design, and AR.",
    "I learned framing, how to organize a design process, I learned a lot about the Smithsonian, about existing technologies and somewhat of what goes into making them, and many other things. I learned a lot about teamwork.",
    "I learned all about the design process, the history of museums and the smithsonian, how to work for a client, how to build stuff, and what innovation looks like in many different fields.",
    "I learned SO much about the design-thinking and iterative design processes in this course. Professor Zinter gave us crucial skills\/tools to understand how best to tackle a client's challenge, interact with and be accountable to that client (and navigate the relationship between their needs and your ideas), and translate abstract ideating into high-quality, innovative execution.",
    "This was one of the most incredible classes I have taken at Yale University. If it is offered again, definitely try to take it. If you have any interest in design or engineering this is the course for you. It posed the rare design problem of letting your imagination run wild and then refining and turning it into a viable, desirable, and feasible product. You will come out of the course feeling like you can achieve anything and this is in no small part to how great of a professor Joseph Zinter is. You will learn design thinking but you will be able to tackle and analyze problems in an entirely new and exciting way which can be applied to any field and not just engineering."

   "comments": [
    "This course will drives you to work your hardest without Joe really needing to say anything at all. As a team, we know what we have to do to even out the work and to ask for support from each other. The only weakness was that half of the class lacked a Joe\/Teaching Fellow to give constant constructive criticisms and supporting ideas to move us in the right direction. We needed someone with more skill than we did and someone whom we could access 24\/7. Joe did an amazing job even with the lack of a co-instructor, if this has not been emphasized enough.",
    "The course is excellent at motivating you to give it your all. If you didn't, there is something wrong with you, because it has been a privilege to be in the same room as the Director of the Arts and Industries Building, as well as many other Washington personnel and the guest lecturers the Prof. Zinter managed to bring to our class every week. The course was not paced ideally, but that is a by-product of the fact that nothing of the sort has yet been done. I'd have preferred less ideation and more production, but in most cases, it has turned out quite well. I'm happy with the idea and physical creation of my project.",
    "I think this class was very strong overall. The only weaknesses came from the unavoidable uncertainty of working with an important client on a somewhat undefined project, such as the AIB.",
    "I wish we had more time to complete and round out our final projects and that the timeline for work and feedback was more structured.",
    "Although this course was very much student driven (and experimental), I wish there had been a little more structure in the layout of the latter half of the course. As it was I felt very stressed toward the end of the course to the point where it was unhealthy. Of course much of that could have been avoided by advance or better planning from our team, but I did feel a lot of pressure from the instructor to do well. Additionally the first and last halves of the course seemed disjointed. I think we could have had more work to complete in the beginning of the course so that we could have been even more engaged with the Smithsonian content throughout the rest of the semester.",
    "The only weakness of the course is the amount of time required. This isn't a weakness so much as a requirement that you will want to fulfill to deliver amazing products by the end of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Everyone should take at least one class with Joe. He pours his heart and soul into every class that he teaches and really pushes to move everyone in the right direction. He spent countless hours on the weekend and after work hours to help everyone out and always gave us the design reviews that we needed. You will work hard, not because Joe tells you to, but because you want to.",
    "It's hard to evaluate this class without talking about Professor Zinter, but there is another section of evaluations for that. We had a trip to the Smithsonian with all expenses paid, including a nice hotel. We met the Director of the Arts and Industries Building at the Smithsonian and other amazing people. We did tons of research about what an anti-museum to the future could be and put in tons more work into making devices that try to make that vision a reality. You will get a ton of support and guidance, even from the visiting guests that come from innovation and design fields. I hope there are many more of these courses to come, and honestly all of the CEID staff needs a raise.",
    "This class will probably never be offered again, so I was very grateful to take part in such an unusual and fantastic opportunity. If you can take Making Spaces, do it, but it will probably be hard to get in!",
    "Yes! It was a very challenging course - teaches you to manage your time effectively and work efficiently and thoroughly while also giving you such a unique opportunity to work directly with an institution like the Smithsonian. Definitely be prepared to invest most of your time in this class, especially towards the end of the semester - but also know that there is much joy\/pride at the backend after you present your final project.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student at Yale. It is tailored to engineering students but the broad set of knowledge, creativity, and perspective needed for a class like this makes it suitable to any major."
