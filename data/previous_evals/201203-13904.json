   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- Learning from some of great minds at Yale Hospital and few of the guest speakers. Kwaku does a good job.Weakness- The way the course is structured.",
    "Strengths: well-planned series of lecturers. I like that the content was organized--in particular I like that the module focused on NCDs. NCDs are not my main interest, but I am glad to see that we thoroughly covered a topic rather than jumping around in the many areas of global health.Weaknesses: the group project of the NCD module went very poorly for me. While I understand the importance of collaboration with colleagues and working through the challenges this poses, this project proved to be the most challenging of any group project I've ever done. One group member dropped out (this should not be possible once the module starts), one did not show for the final presentation, and one was incredibly hard to schedule with (showing up 40 minutes late to a meeting, not showing on another occasion). I think the lack of motivation was a problem for a few group members, so I recommend setting benchmarks\/due dates along the way. Hopefully this will keep students engaged and not leaving their colleagues high and dry.",
    "Overall, it was really phenomenal. I have to say, however, that I was disappointed with the existence of the module - I was prepared for (and excited about) learning a little about a lot, getting exposure to the myriad of issues that we can tackle globally. Instead, we spent half of the seminar on non-communicable diseases, which while interesting, took up time that could have been devoted to other exciting developments and pressing issues.",
    "The guest speakers were very interesting.",
    "No time commitment at all, just in the last 2 weeks or so with the group presentation. The class brought professionals who are doing amazing things in their field, but sometimes I felt like time was wasted by very general presentations. I would have preferred to spend an hour learning about something very detailed and specific in their work rather than an overview (short overview would be good in the beginning, but not an entire hour).",
    "I found the course to be slightly disorganized. The readings weren't posted in advance and emails about the sessions were generally not sent in advance. This makes it difficult to plan your time and prepare adequately. Overall, the content was very interesting!",
    "I don't feel like I really gained much from this seminar. It's quite basic in it's structure. While some of the seminar presenters were more engaging and talked about more interesting topics, I really don't feel like it contributed much to my knowledge of global health.",
    "The presentations at the seminar were hit or miss, with more misses than hits. You get a strange smattering of global health issues that aren't put together in any seemingly cohesive way.The module topic of non-communicable diseases was very ambitious because it encompasses a variety of very different health issues. I do think that there is some use to thinking about NCDs as a whole. However, the guest presentations varied widely in terms of quality and detracted from the cohesiveness of the class. I thought Dr. Schwartz's presentations and the presentations from other members of the Chronic Disease Network were the best at creating a cohesive message.If you're going to serve dinner to a bunch of MPH and medical students, serve something healthy dammit!! I got so tired and frustrated with the Yorkside pizza.",
    "Great course that brings in experts from a variety of fields.",
    "I thought the seminar was ok - I heard from a number of people working in global health and learned what their projects are. I didn't feel as though I got any tangible information from the course - none of the presentations taught me any real skills for working in global health. Nor did I particularly feel like I learned any lessons from their experience. It seemed as if everyone just presented what they did abroad, what they found, and there was not much take away if you did not work in that very narrow area of global health. There were a few exceptions - the into unit on chronic diseases and the chronic disease network was good and provided more actual information, and Allie's talk on gender and reproductive rights was very good.The module was ok, but kind of a lot of ask of students on top of the 1.5 hr lectures each Monday night considering we receive virtually no credit for the seminar. And, I didn't feel like I got much out of it - it seemed like a fake sort of exercise that I didn't particularly have the skills to complete. As a thought exercise it was ok, and I enjoyed working in the group of students. But it just didn't seem all that beneficial overall.I think the following improvements could be made:1. Make it shorter! And feed us beforehand. Sitting for an hour and a half on Monday nights through a lecture you may or may not be interested that goes straight through all possible dinner times is excruciating - you're tired and hungry and agitated all at once. And 7:30 is too late to be eating dinner. Few of the presenters really had a whole hour of material that was necessary to share, so 30-40 minutes + questions would have been quite enough.2. Let the module replace the lectures. There are PLENTY of lectures on campus, we don't really need to hear the 4 or 5 more that would go on during the module. Just let us work on it over dinner for an hour during the time the lecture would take place. And, then we would have more time to go see some of the other fantastic people speaking all around campus.3. Let us skip a couple. I don't actually know what the attendance requirements are for the seminar, but it would be good to have a few we could miss and still get credit for the seminar.4. More interactive sessions - lectures are fine, but I get a lot more out of discussion with others, breaking up into small groups to talk about things, writing down questions on the topic or answers, walking through case studies etc. The current format seems too passive.",
    "This course was great because it exposed us to a ton of new fields and popular areas of research. It was great for exposure, but I felt that the lectures were a bit disjointed and it was sometimes difficult to remain engaged in the long term.",
    "Strengths great exposure to diverse topics in Global Health",
    "It's a really interesting class and I've loved all of the speakers that have come. I did not think the presentations we had to give at the end of the semester were helpful. Considering the class was so big and the presentations went well over the time allotted to the course I think some sort of small group work where people could discuss the various interventions would have been more beneficial. Whilst the presentations were interesting the time crunch made it difficult to pay attention and really get the most out of them.",
    "I was really excited to take this course, but ended up being quite disappointed in the end. My career interests lie in Global Health and I intend to take as many Global Health-focused courses while at YSPH. This seminar, however, is repetitive and unengaging. There are too many people in the course to allow for real interactive learning. Further, the speakers, all experts in their fields, are forced to explain their careers or their research in ~45 minutes to an hour. As a result, they only share the basics, which are usually axiomatic truths of Global Health theory that I have acquired through my undergraduate coursework and time spend working abroad. I feel like I'm just being hit over the head with really depressing statistics about widespread mortality in the developing world with few practical solutions about how we, as future Global Health practitioners, can venture out and create positive change. Also, I really did not enjoy the module. I recognize that NCDs are a growing concern globally, but I am not particularly interested in pursuing a career in NCD prevention and treatment. Also, the timing of the course was unfortunate. I know it is hard to get a time that works for most, but evenings are awful. I always had to miss a meeting for a club I am in to attend class.",
    "Overall the seminar series were great. It would be great if the students could be involved in picking the future speakers",
    "Lecture based and very hard to pay attention.. mostly unorganized",
    "Strengths are the variety of speakers and information learned from different perspectives about a topic. Weakness was disorganization of student presentations.",
    "Strength - Different topics by different speakersWeaknesses - Inconsistency in style of lecture by the different speakers.The presentations at the end of the course did not seem well supervised",
    "The major strength of this seminar is the assignment on non-communicable diseases that required student participation. Without this assignment the seminar would not have been interactive (an important part of learning). The course could be better organized; at times there seemed to be a lot of confusion about the assignment and lectures. My only additional suggestion is that they continue the module assignment andbroadened the topic or switch the topics every semester in order to keep it fresh and interesting.",
    "Interesting speakers, love how food is provided",
    "The course offered some very interesting and inspiring speakers and talks. Also, some of the readings were good.",
    "I like the structure of the course, which provides ample time after each seminar for the students and speakers to engage in lively discussions. That helps the students to know more about the topic and explore the possibilities of some collaborative work.",
    "The NCD module was a great addition to the course. It allowed for students participation, I would improve it by distributing student's presentations in more than one class.",
    "Excellent.",
    "STRENGTHS: Having the opportunity to listen to the speakers, ask questions, and then meet during dinner was nice. Great format. WEAKNESSES: The project portion of the seminar was a little disorganized in terms of understanding exactly what was expected of the groups, but the instructors were always willing to answer questions and, in the end, I think every group did a great job. IMPROVEMENTS: I only wish there could be even more speakers!"

    "Yes I would recommend it for the experience of learning from some of the great doctors at Yale.",
    "Really, really great course. Well worth coming in on Monday night.",
    "I probably need to commit more to this course for the next semester.",
    "Interesting professionals that are doing lots of amazing work in their field, free dinners, get to work in a group on a presentation that is just for credit. I think it's worth it, though sometimes it seems like a waste of ~2 hours. Broad overview of different topics in global health, definitely brings your attention to something you didn't know was happening or you weren't interested in before.",
    "It provides a good overview of current global health topics.",
    "There is an overall theme for the course, and the instructors and TA's bring in speakers every week. Depending on what your interests are this course would bea great assest.",
    "A lecture series in global health. I would not recommend it to another student - I would instead recommending attending the few lectures you were interested in and using the rest of your time to see the other great things going on at Yale each week.",
    "Take it! It's a great environment for gaining exposure to critical public health issues.",
    "A great seminar about global health issues with some incredible speakers.",
    "Not helpful if you have already studied global health",
    "Yes. Course has lots of good information and chances to interact with speakers in small group discussions.",
    "Maybe",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Ultimately it was the lectures of a few inspiring professionals that led me to apply to the global health concentration. I believe that this seminar can contribute greatly to the education of all health students.",
    "Yes. However, the module must be improved. Presentations ran extremely overtime. There should be more structure (i.e. splitting into separate presentation classrooms, eliminating Q&A, etc)",
    "This course offered some interesting and inspiring speakers and talks. I would advocate for this course to be taught during the daytime hours, say 4-5:30pm. In addition, as this course did havean attendance requirement and a requirement to do a project, I think it deserves some credit - maybe a 1\/4 credit.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested in global health work",
    "I would recommend this course to students with an interest in global health. It is a great way to learn and interact with individuals that are currently working in this field and posses have hands on experience.",
    "I would recommend it to another student as an introduction to global health.",
    "I would recommend this course to ANY STUDENT looking to hear about the work being done by some great individuals in the global health field! Some of the speakers were very inspiring! The different topics also gave me more to contemplate in terms of areas of study."
