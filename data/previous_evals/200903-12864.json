    "I think the course, overall, is fine. I wish we could have read more interesting stories and poetry. A lot of the stories we read didn't seem to reveal much. I like stories with depth and character, so I was a little disappointed with that because I think I read more interesting poems and stories in L2 than L3. However, other than that, it's a good course.",
