    "My Russian language skills improved dramatically. Thank you so much Prof Muravnik!!",
    "Vastly improved knowledge of Russian history and key vocab.",
    "I further developed my Russian language and knowledge in a practical, interesting manner.",
    "This course helped further my understand of Russian. It was very helpful in further developing my speaking and writing skills especially. The writing assignments were very helpful and interesting and the home reading assignment was very helpful in developing my reading skills further.",
    "The course helped me really get a good grasp on verbal aspect, having learned many of its principles somewhat haphazardly in the past. Constantine's insistence on the frame of the action gave me some degree of clarity, over criteria like \"completion\" or \"change of state.\" I struggled a bit more with verbs of motion, insofar as it was hard to square both the imperfective\/perfective paradigm with the choice between mutlti-directional and unidirectional. I still think I benefited from simply reviewing verbs of motion, and covering their conjugations and prefixes. I definitely think that I better understand the use of arriving and departing prefixes, especially insofar as there's a criteria of expectation for something like -, and the prefix - has a far wider range than I at first thought. I was hoping to really push the limit on my speaking abilities, but felt that I simply consolidated the ground I made in the first sequence (RUSS 150). I continued to rely quite heavily on our stock-in-trade phrases like \/ , \/ , \/ (), , \/ , \/ , \/ \/ (or simply, \/), \/ , \/. The was helpful in that I think it improved my reference reading: quickly scanning the text for sections that jumped out at me, that I knew and could understand, and could latch onto to help make meaning of the text at large."

    "Professor Muravnik is a wonderfully experienced Russian language teacher. He is very helpful, calm, and very understanding and accommodating of graduate students who have different work commitments and busier schedules. Always willing to help and returns our homework on time, with feedback. Really appreciate his dedication.",
    "Great course. Very few weaknesses.",
    "Interesting combination of linguistics, grammar, literature, and Russian history.",
    "I loved the format and instruction of the course, but there could be more of an emphasis on vocabulary memorization.",
    "This course made me become even more confident speaking Russian. Everyone was very engaged and it made for a great class setting. The only drawback is there is a lot of work to put in, but that's true for any language class.",
    "I don't think that the various weekly were particularly effective for me. I really did enjoy attempting to give a coherent (albeit abridged) conference-style presentation on one of my research topics last term--the task that the were meant to replace. (I expect that in the near future I may be asked to articulate myself in a similar way in Russian, and that presentation immediately gave me some clarity as to how to accomplish that!) Admittedly, the were probably more useful for students of the social sciences, or Russian politics or economics. I definitely saw some of my classmates get joy and pride out of explaining fluctuations in the exchange rate or the latest chapter in a pipeline contract's negotiation. Yet, the came at a steep cost: cutting into the time that we'd usually spend discussing the course's 19th century history texts. I think that my performance on the orals--where we were asked to explain major concepts from these readings--was weaker for not hearing Constantine speak about them as much, and then being asked to rehearse these ideas in turn. (He modeled a lot of great, simple Russian expressions that could capture the big ideas of the readings within the kind of semantic range we have as third year students. I tried to oftentimes transcribe a lot of what I said, simply because I knew how to say it already, and could then redeploy it myself!) More generally, I felt that the course was somewhat asymmetrical, and accepted that this was just a result of the Yale academic calendar. We dedicated weeks 1-8 to verbal aspect and the rule of I, and then shifted to the between weeks 9 and 13. The second half of the course felt significantly more fast-paced, and down-to the-wire than the first half. I felt I could have given a better showing on my exams if we had more time. I also would have just enjoyed getting to meet again with Constantine privately to leisurely talk over the , and to have sat my orals and my written exams separately. Sadly, the term just came abruptly to a halt, and I had to cram it all together onto one day. I think Constantine did a great job working as much of the fourth unit into the year as he did, and only regret that we didn't have two, or three extra weeks of instruction!"

    "Absolutely - challenging and time-intensive, but well worth the effort.",
    "I absolutely recommend taking Third Year Russian. Professor Muravnik is excellent and the course is set at a reasonable pace.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to continue Russian.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Muravnik is incredible and this course really helps improve language ability",
    "Absolutely. I feel that Constantine's insistence on aspect, and his sets of 10-verb lexical-grammatical activities have widened the range of my speech. I feel I'm less likely to make glaring mistakes in aspect, that I'm better able to get at its nuance and use that nuance to build meaning. I can't but reiterate how our constant use and redeployment of phrases like \/, , , ... has given me so much extra mileage in my speech: allowing me to explain complex problems with more sophistication than I had at the start of RUSS 150 in the autumn."
