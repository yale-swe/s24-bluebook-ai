   "comments": [
    "This class is not a gut. You have to work to do well and must keep up with the reading to fully feel like you know what's going on. I managed to keep up with the reading and attended every lecture but still had no idea what was going on in the exams. Luckily there is a nice curve for the class but I wouldn't just rely on the curve for this class.",
    "Astronomy 110 is a GUT course. The class is easy but I'm disappointed for not getting to memorize the constellations. I recommend if you want to take it for science credit.",
    "Yes. As long as you think rationally and take notes on the textbook, you'll do well without really putting effort.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a Sc credit and don;t mind doing some math",
    "It would be an easy class for someone who studies a bit (maybe, maybe an hour each week). However, it was sometimes hard to study because of the general lack of applicability of the material to any future courses (for me).",
    "If you're interested in Astronomy but don't intend to be an Astronomy major, this is the class for you. It's interesting and challenging. Take it!",
    "Astro 110 is an entry level, theory based approach to the science of astronomy. No labs, no lab reports, but you really have to know your theory in order to do well.",
    "Yes.I learned a lot from this course and the Professor's amazing humor made the course even more interesting. Great course for non-science majors looking for a science course that you can learn a lot from.",
    "Yes.",
    "It was kind of miserable. I don't recommend it for a gut course, but for people actually interested in pursuing this field of study.",
    "Lots of material, some of it difficult to grasp due to the sheer scale of what you're grasping. Weekly problem sets a bit challenging, which is why you should start them early on. Readings are manageable; again, start early. Professor is really knowledgeable, not very personable. Tests are fair and course overall is very interesting. Worth taking for a different perspective on science.",
    "If you're vaguely interested in astronomy, as I was, and would like to no more without needing to do crazy math and physics, definitely look into this course. It's fun and interesting, and Dr. Faison is hilarious and great at keeping the class engaging. You'll learn the basics of how \u0097 surprise \u0097 planets and stars work, as well as a lot about the workings of our own solar system. You'll also get a good sense of how exactly we know what we know about astronomy. Have you ever wondered how we can tell the mass of the sun? Or the mass of Betelgeuse (3,773,000,000,000 miles away)? Take this class and find out.",
    "I would recommend it, the class was fun, interesting, and insightful.",
    "This course is interesting only if you are already interested in the topic, and even then the professor will probably fail to raise your level of interest. Not recommended to anyone who isn't very keen on Astronomy.",
    "It is an interesting class but many concepts are confusing and sometimes difficult to grasp.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in astronomy, but not if you want a science credit or sth. You can get most out of the class only by assiduously do the reading. But of course this class is very time-consuming.",
    "It's a good general course for students interested in astronomy or looking to fulfill science\/QR requirements. I wouldn't recommend it for students looking for a gut class, though, since this course does require studying for tests and going through the psets (those are really difficult sometimes). This class was one of my hardest ones this year not in terms of work load, but in terms of understanding the material.",
    "Hard class not a gut take at your own risk",
    "I would recommend ASTR110 to anyone interested in astronomy but not wanting to take a high level math course or any non-science majors needing a science credit.",
    "ASTR 110 is a great introduction to astronomy. If you have any interest in astronomy whatsoever and need a science or qr credit, take this course. It's not an easy class, but it is a very valuable course and changes the way you see the universe and the sky.",
    "it's pretty well pitched for non-science majors, and really doesn't require very much quantitative reasoning at all - the hard part is the scientific concepts. lectures are mostly engaging and it's probably a good idea to attend all of them. don't make the mistake of reading all the assigned reading, just focus on what's covered in lectures. also go to section for help with psets.",
    "It\u0092s a good introduction to astronomy, and you learn a lot of cool stuff. Dr. Faison is very amiable and enthusiastic, and I found his lectures fairly engaging. I took it for the QR, but it\u0092s the science that\u0092s interesting and yes, often difficult. (Don't be fooled by Dr. Faison's encouraging voice - some of the science is harder than he makes it sound. Also,I got in the habit of putting off problem sets until the last minute, which made the course more stressful than it should have been (and meant I didn\u0092t do as well as I should have). If you would avoid this mistake and are interested in astronomy, go ahead and shop it. And go to the observing session\/planetarium show if they have one - we got to see Jupiter through the telescope!",
    "Planets and Stars is a decent class to take if you need a QR\/SC credit. As long as you keep up with the class, it isn't that difficult, but don't go into the class with the \"gut\" mindset. The Qr part of the class is pretty easy, but if you aren't science-minded that part can get pretty difficult.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit, but it's not a gut. You can still do well though, just put aside sometime for the problem sets, then go over your answers at section.",
    "This is not an easy science credit class. Problem sets and exams actually require a lot thinking, and you shouldn't expect this course as a \"gut\" class.",
    "This is not a gut, but it is a pretty easy class. The psets take some time, but the fact that they're weekly is actually advantage because it means you can make up for bad grades. You definitely had to put in study time for the tests, which are more difficult than the psets or the lectures. Keep up with the readings or you'll get lost. Professor Faison is great, though; he also took us on an optional field trip to Yale's observatory, which shouldn't be missed.",
    "Planets and Stars is not bad for a QR course, but it definitely isn't a gut class. Even though the math is pretty simple, the concepts are difficult to understand, and a lot of the questions on exams are based on the concepts. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't want a heavy math course.",
    "This is a fun, managable class. I would recommend it of you are at all interested in understanding fundamental concepts about our universe and need a QR. Or even if you don't need that QR.",
    "definitely not a gut course, interesting but requires some studying and astronomy is not very straight forward",
    "Science classes are a real drag if you're not a science major, not because they're uninteresting but because non-science majors rarely get the hang of doing problem sets or thinking like a scientist. This class covers some very fascinating material, and you'll enjoy the lectures, butthe psets are always a massive headache and the questions are poorly written. You'll lose a lot of points for no good reason and you'll be exasperated.",
    "I would not recommend ASTR 110 to most non-science majors because despite the occasionnally interesting material on the sun, star formation, star death, planet formation, planet differences, the moon, and the frontiers of astophysics, I did not find the material engrossing or stimulating enough for the time I had to put in.In fact, I had non-science and science major friends who discouraged me from taking ASTR 110, and it was a huge mistake not to listen to them. Although I knew the class was not a gut (it isn't!), I just wanted to knock out a QR\/SC distribution requirement. Eventhough I'm happy I accomplished that, I recommend that others seek out better options than ASTR 110.The math and little bit of astrophysics are not that difficult if you took trigonometry\/precalculus in high school, but understanding and using the equations are not the challenging parts. The hard part for me was translating between complicated and new conceptual information to mathematical calculations.The questions on the exams and problem sets are not that difficult in and of themselves, but to do well in ASTR 110, I would have needed to put in a lot more time and effort than I was was willing to for a class I was not at all passionate about."
