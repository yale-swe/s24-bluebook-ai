   "comments": [
    "such a boring lecture at a super early time... classes were not engaging at all and homework had little to no correlation to textbook or classroom material. no homework solutions were ever posted, and notes\/homework were filled with typos.",
    "The lecture notes were very good but the lectures were sometimes difficult to understand and the lectures were very early.",
    "I wouldn't really say this course had any weaknesses. The professor was great and took time to explain everything in a way students could\/would understand, both in class and in office hours.",
    "I dont know if it was just me, but I thought the class was pretty boring. At times only 4 or 5 out of ~25 kids would show up to lecture, and even then theyd sit in the back doodling or looking on their phones. This was probably a result of lectures not actually being that helpful, and following a very heres a technique, now use it path. This might be fine if you honestly just care to solve the equations, but Im coming out of the class still having next to no idea why some of these things work. The greatest asset to this course was the graders, who stood as a beacon of hope for our confused asses. God bless you, kind gradersyour feedback and charity was the only thing sustaining us through the back stretch of this course.",
    "Strengths: Most of the PSETs aren't too difficult, the exams are reasonable as they are open book, the lecture slides he uploaded for the first half of the semester were helpful Weaknesses: There are A LOT. For starters, this class was at 9am and the lectures were insanely boring and confusing. Imagine, by the end of the semester there were days where like 3\/30+would show up to class. His lectures were incredibly hard to follow as well because his writing was illegible and he hardly looked away from the board when speaking. Honestly all of my learning in this class came from Paul's Online Differential Equations notes. If you want to learn Differential Equations in an organized and guided form, literally just do that.",
    "strengths: -time proven curriculum - slow and thorough look at ODEs as opposed to ENAS 194 which is quite fast. weaknesses: - Potentially too easy and could perhaps make the material more in depth - psets did not feel helpful",
    "The course was very well organized in general and it was very easy to learn. It was not always the most exciting class but I learned a lot and it was very interesting!",
    "I think it was hard to translate what we learned in class to our homework, but I appreciated how the professor was so accommodating."

   "comments": [
    "No, one of the most boring and useless classes I've ever taken... there needs to be more engaging math classes to take for non-math majors!",
    "This is a good Math course to take for people studying the applied sciences. You learn lots of useful tools in mathematics.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Math is generally not well taught at Yale and usually leaves students traumatized\/ fearful of progressing to higher leveled classes. Well this isn't one of them. If you attend class and go to office hours when u aren't understanding, you should be fine. The professor is great and will know how to explain things based on the questions you ask.",
    "If you need it, sure. Its not that hard, but its just SO uninteresting. The prof said attendance was mandatory halfway through the semester despite that not being listed anywhere in the course materials, so I dont know to what degree you can skip, but I really wouldnt worry if you zone out during class, as 90% of what you learn will be from the textbook anyways.",
    "NO! NO! NO! Absolutely not. This class is insanely boring and not worth taking. Differential equations is already a tedious topic and this class was not well taught. Honestly all of my learning in this class came from Paul's Online Differential Equations notes. If you want to learn Differential Equations in an organized and guided form, literally just do that.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to learn differential equations but wants to do it in a more relaxed manner than in ENAS 194 and wants to focus on other classes - this could be a decent 5th classes, if that's possible for QRs.",
    "Yes! If you wanna learn about differential equations this is a very good course",
    "It's a course requirement and it's pretty thorough."
