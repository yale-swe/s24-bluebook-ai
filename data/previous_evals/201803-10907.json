   "comments": [
    "The strength was the lecture notes, which covered thoroughly the topics seen in class. Then, it has lots of opportunities to improve. First, each session was not well designed (some of them we would spend 1 hour in a topic that could have been explained in 10 minutes). This lead to the sylabus not being followed, and we had to rush the last week to cover one more topic. Second, many of the last topics which were more complex needed some references, which were not provided (and we had, by then, little time to explore them).",
    "Biggest strength was the rigor I think. This class forced me to expand my economic intuition in order to keep up. I think less focus on the Slutsky equation could be helpful going forward though. It felt like we spent half the semester on the one topic, which took away from our ability to discuss game theory or other useful topics.",
    "Great instructor and challenging questions.",
    "The course material is very dense and does not follow the syllabus very well.",
    "Mike does a very good job starting from the basics, which is incredibly useful for someone with little knowledge coming into the class. Mike obviously cares about his students as well.",
    "The course was structured with accompanying notes, but the order in which the material was taught was confusing and the pace of the class was inconsistent. Some material seem redundant with undergraduate material."

    "Actually, not. I wished the Economics department offeres another Microeconomics class for Master's students.",
    "I'd recommend for a master's student who wants a very theoretical dive into microeconomics and who has a very strong quantitative background. Otherwise, probably just take an undergrad or PhD level class. If you need or want to know about producer theory, this isn't the class for it either.",
    "Yes. Really broadens your mind and makes you think.",
    "No, this class is not very practical. The lecture material is very abstract and theoretical, and I don't see how I'm gonna utilize this class material for my future learning.",
    "Yes. As a way to get economics knowledge as fast as possible, while starting from zero, this is a great place to start.",
    "No unless required.",
    "This is a great course!"
