    "I am a STEM major and this was my favorite class. A few things made this course great. First of all, the subject matter is super interesting. Social Media (which I would say our class ended up focusing on during essays and class discussions) is obviously incredibly relevant to today's world. Taking a class on it was incredibly enlightening. Additionally, the usage of technology in class (real-time class polls, etc.) was fun and engaging. Lastly, although the essays were certainly difficult (a major step up for me since high school), I felt like I gained a lot from them at the end of the day. I am a much better essayist now than I was before. Professor McKendry is awesome! From an academic standpoint, her comments are very helpful, she induces great class discussions, has really well planned PowerPoints, creates productive (and fun!) workshops, and is clearly a very intelligent human being. Additionally, Professor McKendry does a great job of connecting with her students. We all joked around together (this certainly made my classmates and I more comfortable with each other and contributed to our ability to have really interesting discussions) but were also able to be serious when we needed to. Professor McKendry doesa really great job of cultivating a class culture\/dynamic.",
    "Death in 140 Characters is a writing course on social media. I genuinely loved the course because we had so much fun every day together, and the topics are very interesting and relevant. So, I'd definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Not a gut Workload adjusts throughout the semester. You would always have something to say in class.",
    "This is a great section of English 114, it offers you not only tools to be able to become a better writer, but also covers interesting topics. With the technology use, including Twitters and blog posts, this course is not like a conventional course, which keeps students focused and eager to see what is next. I would recommend this course to anyone, as it is truly a great course!",
    "This was one of my favorite classes this semester! It was well taught and the class really connected. If you are considering a writing credit, take this or at least shop it!",
    "This class improved my writing skills and taught me the basics of college-level writing. I also thought that the incorporation of technology in the classroom made this class really interesting and fun. While analyzing social media was sometimes challenging, the process gave me a new perspective on our world of rapidly changing technology. This class was difficult and time-consuming, but ultimately I learned a lot and enjoyed the experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because it is an intriguing class about a very current, modern day topic. The relation between death and media is not something that most people think of so it was a new approach to understanding and analyzing, the way that we interact with technology.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It was interesting, engaging, and really improved my writing."
