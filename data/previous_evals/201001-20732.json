    "Aquatic Chemistry provides a great overview and detailed descriptions of all processes occurring in aquatic systems drawing on pertinent environmental examples.For those interested in water chemistry, environmental consulting, and\/or remediation, this is a good class.",
    "This is a good class to learn about Aquatic Chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course only to someone who has not had a sufficient chemistry background and wants to work in the field of environmental science. It doesn't seem extremely relevant to much of what graduate students are doing in environmental engineering.",
    "I would recommend this to a student that plans on working quantitatively with water chemistry.",
    "The course could be very helpful for many types of research, but I'm not really sure that the pace or teaching style is appropriate for a graduate student."

    "This course basically re-taught college level chemistry. I don't think the material is that relevant to my current research. It teaches you to sole chemistry problems, but isn't necessarily useful for the research areas in environmental engineering.",
