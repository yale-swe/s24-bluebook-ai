    "Major English Poets is lovely in both semesters, and 126 is an exciting continuation. You'll probably prefer some poets over others, but Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Yeats, and Eliot are so consistently engaging that it hardly matters. If you can, take the course with Professor Nicholson, who is unfailingly kind, insightful, and generous.",
    "As a non-English major, I greatly enjoyed this course. You spend a lot of time reading, writing, and thinking about great poetry. Nicholson is a wonderful, caring instructor who was a great guide to the material. If you're worried about your GPA, take care or take the class Credit\/D\/F, since she is a difficult grader.",
    "Necessary medicine, but what a restorative!",
    "Incredibly difficult but you need to take it for the English Major.",
    "English 126 is an intensive class in English poetry. If you're not planning on being an English major, I would only take it if you're really into poetry.",
    "A survey of notable English poets from Milton to modern poetry. I would recommend it if they are interested in such material.",
    "It's required for the English major. That pretty much says it all. I enjoyed the readings and discussion, but I don't really see it being too appealing to those outside the major. Plus, about 80% of the people you encounter in there will be English majors (or at least prospective ones) so be prepared for all that...",
    "This course was actually a very enjoyable overview of some major poets. The readings were interesting, and the professor was great, but I felt that the grading was a bit harsh. The final also seemed a little unfair. But overall, great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in English poetry. Professor Nicholson is great, and I really enjoyed the class.",
    "This is a perfect class for students who love poetry and dealing with texts in close discussion. If you are not comfortable with your writing skills, I would recommend taking a different class first. Overall, a great class for those interested in the English major.",
    "A great intro to English poetry. If you are interested in the subject it is very worth taking.",
    "The course description suffices. Absolutely, yes, I would recommend 126 to a fellow student, English major or not."
