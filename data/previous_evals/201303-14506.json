    "Amazing course. Seriously. The best I have taken at Yale. Challenged me to no end, but was worth it. I learned so much about an amazing President. These kinds of classes are not taught very much at Yale any more--take it while you can! What a gem.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 277, and especially have previous experience in this area. Profesor Bromwich takes his approach to Lincoln very seriously, and he tends to focus on his own interpretation during section, but you learn a lot from him so it's worth it.",
    "This course needs to be renamed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAge of Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094we spent a total of 2 classes on Whitman. If you want more Whitman than that, this is not the class for you. However, the course itself was definitely interesting and worthwhile in its ways. If you want to get a grasp on Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy, which is a very interesting one, this course will give it to you. You read almost all of Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important works beginning in the 1830s and up until the end of the Civil War. Bromwich is an interesting character. He is very articulate, clearly cares deeply about Lincoln, and is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. However, he is one of the most terrifying professors I have ever had. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not mean or purposefully scary, but he nonetheless gives off really intimidating vibes. He definitely cares a lot about his students, but he also pushes back a lot during class discussion and often has a very specific (and equally obscure) answer that he is looking for. You should go to the first class and see how you like him, then decide whether or not to take it. All in all kind of ambivalent towards this class, but it was definitely an experience and now I know EVERYTHING Lincoln has ever said.",
    "As it stands now, this course was okay. I am not at all sure what it was about, which is why it wasn't a very good course. Was it simply for the pleasure of reading great prose? Was it to understand mid-19th century America? Or was it a class about Lincoln? Not knowing what the class was about made it difficult to pay attention sometimes, because I didn't know what was important.But, at the same time, it wasn't worthless at all. We read great stuff, and Professor Bromwich sometimes had illuminatingthings to say. Other time, though, I had a difficult time understanding what Professor Bromwich was saying.",
    "Another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our national affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.",
    "A great class. Bromwich is likely not everyone's taste, but what you might first take to be arrogance turns out to be mostly awkwardness. He's brilliant, and completely obsessed with Lincoln. Though he is not the most accessible\/helpful in terms of meeting to talk about papers, he listens very carefully to students during seminar and doesn't hesitate to tell you if your reasoning is off, or get excited if it's good. The course title is misleading--you spend one week on Whitman. The material is overwhelmingly Lincoln, though the non-Lincoln readings are also quite good. Somewhere between a history class& a literature class--perhaps one of the true humanities classes.",
    "This class is a way to get into the head of one of the greatest political thinkers in history, Lincoln, while also getting a flavor of other thinkers from the time. If you already have a background in 19th century American history and are willing to work very hard on papers, you will learn a lot from this class and will love it.",
    "A class for the self-directed student. There won't be much guidance, and make sure you know your philosophers (DS would have helped me, I feel).",
    "BEST COURSE I've ever taken at Yale. You'll walk away with a thorough understanding of Lincoln as a complex character, and an introduction to the unique age in American history that was Transcendentalism. This is everything that a Yale course should be; we learned concrete history about the Civil War and Lincoln and examined the language of Lincoln's speeches and critiqued his rhetoric, while also comparing Lincoln in greater context and even reflecting on war, something that is too often ignored in regular political science courses. Bromwich is fantastic. A must take if you get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you are interested in Lincoln. There is a lot of reading, but I enjoyed it and felt like I actually learned from it."
