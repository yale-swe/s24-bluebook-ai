    "This is a very useful class and it is taught incredibly well. Tomlin is one of the most generous human beings I have ever met in addition to being an excellent conveyor-of-knowledge.",
    "Great",
    "The only things I would recommend are: !) another TA is a MUST - one TA is absolutely inadequate for a class this size and with a course load as heavy. And 2) The course should have more than 3 credits. It was an incredibly time-intensive course.",
    "Thanks Dana, great class.",
    "This course is most useful if you use it as a vehicle for exploring your personal interests in GIS. Use the weekly projects as means to pursue your curiosities regarding GIS -- go above and beyond the course requirements and you'll really get a lot more out of the course than you would otherwise imagine.",
    "Question 10: For students interested in policy or business, this course is potentially interesting from an intellectual perspective, but mostly a big waste of your time. In reality, one who works in policy may make use of GIS, but he or she will never be the one manipulating the software to create maps. Therefore, all the time spent struggling with ArcGIS software in this class will essentially be a huge waste of time. On the other hand, if you think you will want to actually use GIS in your work or research, the class is likely to be very useful to you.",
    "Never used the TA",
    "WORKLOAD WAY MORE THAN A 3 CREDIT CLASS!!!",
    "This is one of the most well taught classes that I have taken at FES, and Professor Tomlin is one of the most clear teachers I have had at any school to date.",
    "It's nearly impossible to understand GIS from sitting in a lecture. It is better learned by hands on training, so having students sit for 3 hours was not conducive to learning the material at all.",
    "The course is one of the most valuable that I have had in my life",
    "I thought this course is great. however I think one thing should be noted. We don't struggle conceptually to understand these topics. while we struggle more with is how to apply them. I think it would be really useful if we were required to bring our computers to class and follow along with the examples you are doing Dana. sometimes small things like on unclicking something in a random toolbox are done too quickly. You miss it and then you're behind and you can't follow the rest of what's being done. Even if we were asked to do a small tutorial before class and turn it in just for credit\/ no credit I think it would be really helpful.",
    "The only reason I gave the course a rating (in Question 8) of 2 instead of 1 is because the volume of work actually detracted from learning. The volume was extremely high; as a result, many students started to feel rushed on assignments, took less time to think, felt lost, and spent less time exploring the GIS program. I felt that the volume of work was so high that I had less time to digest and process what I was learning and less time to let it sink in.",

    "Dana Tomlin is a fantastic teacher. I appreciated the fact that he (apparently) does not teach the same pre-rehearsed course every year - he keeps it alive, even if that means we kind of experiment with him on an assignment design now and then! He is incredibly giving of his time and expertise. His approach to grading and makeup work shows that he really cares about you learning the techniques. I also really liked the optional Python assignments. Although I didn't end up having a ton of time to work with them this semester, it still gave me a foothold into a programming language that I'll be able to pursue more on my own.",
    "hard to say - the lectures were crucial for me to understand the material in order to be able to do the assignments, but the hands on assignments were fundamental to me learning how to actually implement what we talked about in class.",

   "comments": [
    "not sure - maybe some lab time but there are so many students that this is impossible.",
    "I feel I have more to learn for GIS. Maybe more tools should be introduced for the semester.",
    "The group project was frustrating.",
    "The best thing about the fall course was the final project, which allowed us to take all of the material covered in the class and apply it to an area of our choosing. The final project for this semester was not as effective at doing that.",
    "Lab Sessions",
    "The homeworks were extremely challenging and the grading was almost too subjective.",
    "Not much, maybe more background on data preparation.",
    "We need at least two TAs because one is NOT enough...",
    "Teaching GIS in a lecture format is a bit strange, but considering the high demand for the skills taught in the course, the lectures are of very high quality considering the complexity of presenting GIS in a lecture format",
    "The 3 hour lecture is very, very long and hard to focus through.",
    "More engagement with class",
    "assignments should be much clearer in their goals and requirements, and the tools we should use. the assignments that had a clear goal or set of criteria we needed to fill were more manageable and i believe we learned more from them. but the assignments with vaguer goals were frustrating, because maybe we never got to the steps or tools we should have, and we spent lots of time clicking aimlessly. ArcGIS is also very frustrating to learn how to work with, but nothing can be done about that. i would also introduce the Model Builder tools much earlier, which would help us organize our thoughts.",
    "Lecture. It was quite tedious. In addition, in my experience and in the experience of other students with whom I've spoken, the most difficult part of the course is NOT understanding the concepts--i.e., what each function is \"doing\" with the data you give it, or how one would solve a particular problem with the functions in the software. Rather, the most difficult and frustrating part of the course is actually figuring out how to get the software to run the functions that the user wants it to do. Therefore, lecture would be MUCH more helpful if instead of spending hours talking about the concepts, Prof. Tomlin would focus on showing students how to execute the functions, how to trouble-shoot errors, and generally how to manipulate the software. Generally, when Prof. Tomlin would do this in class, he would do it so quickly and with so little fanfare that students would miss half the steps he took, or fail to notice what options he was turning on and off to get the results he was displaying on screen. We would all have been much better served if Prof. Tomlin taught by showing us a function, then asking students to try it on their machine, and then asked if people wereable to reproduce the results that he had produced on his own machine, rather than spending hours and hours explaining concepts that, frankly, most of us get the first time around.",
    "Some of the assignment required massive amounts of time, often it felt like busy work where I wasn't really learn much.",
    "Group assignment at the end.",
    "If you have to do the \"bonus problems\" in order to do even moderately well in the class, then they are not really optional. They just increase the workload.",
    "The surprise group assignment at the end of the semester was not appreciated. While the assignment was enjoyable and educational, the fact that it was announced as a replacement for the previously announced end-of-the-semester project caused a great deal of stress at the busy end of term. Announcing this ahead of time would allow students to incorporate this into their schedules more easily. This surprise change of the syllabus has made me hesitate to take the fall semester GIS course next year.",
    "There needs to be a lab for the course. It could be optional, but it should be more formalized than TA office hours at the computer lab. it's tough to get a grasp of the program during a 3 hour lecture.",
    "assignments that required brute force.",
    "There should be more than one TA for the course. The TA spent office hours helping 10-15 students giving each student 10-15 minutes overall. Even by email, it was too difficult to help students with a computer program.The class needs to have less lecture and more lab classes to help students learn.",
    "At times (perhaps 25% of the time) assignments were so vague that the process of figuring out what was actually being asked did not facilitate learning, but instead frustration. I enjoyed having to figure things out, even when it was hard. I didn't enjoy trying to guess what the heck the assignment even wanted.Also, having extra credit available is great - but there was so much of it it ended up feeling mandatory rather than supplementary just to get a fair grade.",
    "Nothing",
    "I think I covered that in question 11.",
    "The volume of work actually detracted from learning. The volume was extremely high; as a result, many students started to feel rushed on assignments, took less time to think, felt lost, and spent less time exploring the GIS program. I felt that the volume of work was so high that I had less time to digest and process what I was learning and less time to let it sink in.In addition, some of the assignments (especially the longer ones) were less clear about what skills and tool knowledge they were specifically trying to build. Because they were nebulous, I came out of those assignments feeling shaky about my understanding of the concept, when to use it, and my overall abilities with GIS, especially if it were a requested skill for a future job.Also, it would have been great to get more tutorial on how one actually accesses and acquires data and builds a Dataframe from scratch. If a job asked me to make a map, my biggest problem would be where to begin and how to get data.",
    "There were a couple of mid week alterations to the homework assignment that threw me for a loop. When I leave class on Tue afternoon with the assingment, I immediately start to budget my time to balance with my other commitments. I know I will have bosses in my work career that will be doing that it the future, but I don't think it creates a better final product in either professional or academic work.",
    "I had trouble learning in this course, I think there are different methods and ways that people learn best. For computer programs like GIS, I would learn best if I was taught directly what to do and then given a chance to try and replicate on my own perhaps with new data. However, the course was structured to teach a few elements needed for the assignment and then tasked with figuring it out on one's own and the professor was reluctant to give too many details that \"would give a way the answer\". So, I think the course could improve by allowing students the freedom to be given all the answers they need from the onset, and give them some new data slightly different in order to practice it on their own.",
    "Split it up into two days. The pace on the computer is too fast to follow along, but too slow to watch for three hours."

Yes, those details will be part of the real world but there is no reason they should be added to a school project. Plus, in the real world we will likely have better tools for collaboration at our disposal (like programs you pay for).",
    "There was a large multi-part multi-week group assignment at the end of class with UPenn students and FES students. 4-8 per group. It was supposed to give an idea of real world GIS work. I dont think it accomplished that, instead it frustrated many students. In the real world a big GIS problem might get talked about in a meeting, but afterwards one or two people would just do it and everyone else would approve or make suggestions. Here, because of grades, everyone had to participate throughout the process which was a waste of time as only one person can be driving the mouse at a time. While the first part of the assignment with only FES students went fine (although not everyone participated), the second part with UPenn students was a disaster. Not that this is true of all groups, but the 3-4 UPenn students we were unfortunate enough to work with, stood us up and keep us waiting for hours after procrastinating up until the due date. Furthermore they were unable to actually complete their portion of the project leaving the FES team to hold their hands and complete the assignment for them.

    "The group work was difficult and at times very frustrating. It was useful because we were able to see how difficult it is to do GIS with other people but very difficult.",
    "The advantage was being able to tackle a much larger project scope - including learning about modeling - and the disadvantage came in slower progress by group decision-making and in heaping work within a two-week span of time (and disproportionately on those who happened to have freer schedules that week). The advantage to students' schedules was that the course ended before finals ramped up for other courses.",

    "Work though all tutorials to fully understand assignments",
    "Be prepared for brainteasers and a wonderful journey in the world of geospatial tricks!",
    "Do the problem sets before class, refine them in class, and turn them in right after.",
    "If you can only take 1 GIS course, this is the one to take. But many of us might audit the vector class in the fall to have access to the data, handouts, and dana's insight, without having the burden of assignments.",
    "Only take it if you think you want to use GIS in your career. Otherwise, it'll be a frustrating waste of time.",
    "Don't get behind. I only figured out to take notes on the agenda he gave near the end, but that was the best strategy.",
    "Take it and do the reading. If you can pick some problem or location coming into the class to think about the tools and techniques Dana teaches.",
    "Go to the TA often.",
    "don't spend inordinate amounts of time on this one class even thorugh its easy to do so.",
    "Block out half of one day (5-6 hours) a week to get assignments done. Email Dana if you need help, he will get back to you!",
    "Please take it in one of the best courses taken at FES",
    "This is a great course to take if you want to build your resume and portfolio of marketable skills. In addition, if one is working with any kind of land-based issue (forestry, conservation, etc.), understanding how modern map-making and spatial data analysis is done is essential for today's informational fluency, really. This skillset is key. It will be a lot of work, but you're taking the time to learn a computer program too.",
    "you will need a lot of time, but is worthed",
    "The first couple of weeks is critical, make sure you spend enough time on the preliminary assignments or you'll sink later in the semester."
