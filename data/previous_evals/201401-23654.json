    "An introduction to issues of post colonialism and colonialism in art history, both in scholarly and museum contexts. I would absolutely recommend it!",
    "Yes. The clarity and organisation of the class, along with its relaxed atmosphere which allowed for interesting conversation offered much more than what was to be expected in the syllabus. The careful planning along with the well directed readings gave the classes much depth in exploring specific artworks."

    "This course was really useful - although I am outside of the art historical discipline, I was able to work through some of the issues I have been encountering in my own work regarding inculturation and its colonial implications with a different medium.",
    "It offered an excellent overview of the main issues pertaining to Colonialism, Hybridity in the study of Art History. I also gave a chance to explore the scholarship of African art from the Renaissance to the present."
