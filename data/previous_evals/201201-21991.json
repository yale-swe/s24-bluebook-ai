   "comments": [
    "Prof. Harries is a very interesting thinker who presents a clear interpretation of the readings. Regardless of whether you agree with his interpretation it is very rewarding to take his course and think about his theses. Aesthetics is an important topic in philosophy that is more readily accessible than a lot of other stuff taught in the philosophy department. Take it if you're interested, but be aware that despite being cross-registered this is mostly a philosophy course with occasional forays into art history and theory of art.",
    "wholeheartedly.",
    "TAKE IT ! The syllabus and the content of the lectureare really really worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this course - it's an excellent window onto one of the most problematic, interesting areas of modern thought. Professor Harries is an extremely thoughtful lecturer.",
    "Definitely, definitely, recommend it. Too bad it's not being taught again.",
    "This course was interesting and engaging. It's basically Prof. Harries teaching a long book he hasn't yet published. The reading is really cool, and if you like aesthetics, you'll get a lot out of it. Prof. harries says he's never teaching it again, but apparently he says that every time he teaches it, so who knows.",
    "Great course, take it! workload is not bad at all (3 7 page papers) but I learned more than in many of my other classes nevertheless.",
    "This course is designed as a very broad introduction into the foundational texts of aesthetic philosophy and some more recent texts that have built on them. That said, Professor Harries has a specific interpretation that he is putting forward which encompasses all the texts and makes this less a general introduction and more the development of an idea.",
    "The course became very repretitive in the middle, but the beginning and ending were quite insightful. One word: DO THE READINGS FOR THIS COURSE. I know you don't have to, btu you will get much, much more out of it if you do so. Professor Harries' lectures are only a very specific interpretation of the philosophers, so you're not getting the full picture if you just focus on class. Also, section was horrible.",
    "If you are at all interested in the Philosophy of art, I highly recommend this class. It taught me a lot about big questions in the field and how to better understand artwork in the context of the western cannon. The syllabus was also great.",
    "Yes! Absolutely.",
    "Great if you are interested in talking about art philosophically especially in understanding the relationship between love and beauty in terms of why we like to look at art. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it provides such a great background for students interested in aesthetic theory.",
    "It's a good class, but not so stellar or inspiring. I suppose this isn't so useful though...is this not the last time he's teaching the class EVER?!",
    "An overview of what makes art art, what makes beauty beautiful, and why these things are that way. An 'anti-aesthetic' approach is taken.",
    "Karsten Harries is incredible. His lecture style can be dry, but his insights into this kind of philosophy are very astute and at times quite profound. If you are an artist of any medium, you should take aesthetics with Harries!",
    "I took this course credit\/d\/fail and was glad that I took the initiative to explore some philosophy. While the course was not always enjoyable, it's good to have been exposed to some seminal texts and thinkers such as Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Plato. I think the only reason I enjoyed this class was because I have interests in the Philosopy of asthetics and art. If you do not, then this course will probably bore you greatly. Professor Harries's lectures can be beautiful, but they sometimes can be a little drab as he is not a very livley lecturer. I also found section to be rather tedious. But there are only 3 papers so the workload is quite manageable."
