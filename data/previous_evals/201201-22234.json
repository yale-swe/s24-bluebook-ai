    "Yes--but only if you are a lit major.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "No. If you're majoring in Literature, take it. But you won't like it, I promise.",
    "This is a survey course on world literature and, as far as survey courses go, this one is quite good. Both professors (Trumpener and Hagens) were engaging and really put a lot of thought into the structure of the course. The material is hit or miss, but you are constantly exposed to new literatures throughout the course so it certainly is interesting. If you are doing the lit major, you'll have to take this course. If you're interested in the lit major, I'd suggest taking a more advanced course and returning to this one if you like the major. Overall, great course though.",
    "This is a good survey literature class, about as good as I can imagine any survey literature class being given that you only spend short amounts of time on each text. Not every work is engaging but there were some great ones, such as Gilgamesh and the couple weeks we spent on Japanese No dramas.If you're a lit major, this class isn't a pre-req that you have to dread, as I did before the semester started. If you're not a literature major then I wouldn't default to this just to fulfill a requirement (although there wasn't much work) or to sample the humanities at Yale. I'd try to find a more specific course that you actually think will hold your interest more continuously throughout the semester - as a survey course trying to encompass many different traditions, there are bound to be at least a few dry moments and, at least for me, the general aftertaste of only getting to touch just below the surface of the texts, at best.ONE COMMENT FOR EVERYONE: if you can at all possible, try to get in Trumpener's section. Write to her before the class, figure out why you would compliment the people in her section, whatever. As a graduating senior in the lit major she was easily one of the best section leaders that I've had. Obviously I wasn't in Hagens' section but I know people who were and they weren't as enthusiastic.",
    "This lit course was a whirlwind tour of (mostly) unfamiliar genres of poetry, drama, and epic. The format of the course made it generally quite productive considering the necessary discontinuities between texts. A typical week had one day of lecture from a specialist (on the culture from which the text was taken) and then one day of seminar-style discussion. I think the two parts complemented each other quite well. I would definitely recommend this to another student. It doesn't hurt that the professors are knowledgable and approachable as well. It's definitely worth taking.",
    "a good survey of literature and performance, mostly non-european works which provides a new and interesting understanding of literature, lots of reading at times but the professors try to make it manageable",
    "World Poetry and Performance was a compelling course. Most of the readings were very interesting. I liked that some of the works we read were obscure; they were like hidden gems. We read some well-known works such as Gilgamesh, but also wonderful epics from South India and West Africa, Japanese dramas, and beautiful Arabic poetry. The discussion with Prof. Trumpener was good,although her questions were sometimes confusing, so people didn't really know how to answer. Overall, though, I enjoyed the class. It greatly broadened my literary sphere. Having 3 papers spread evenly throughout the semester was manageable. This course is also self-improving, as Prof. Trumpener asked us for our honest opinions on the last class.",
    "this is the worst class ever, but you have to take it for the major. i'm sorry. take the trumpener section if you plan on attempting to care\/try\/learn."
