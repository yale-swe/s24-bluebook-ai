    "I think Action and Metaphysics is a not-to-be-missed course for philosophy majors: it's a very important field that isn't often taught, and opens up lots of new possibilities. Professor Della Rocca taught very well, and the readings are good. Definitely take it if you can",
    "Two main answers to the question of why we call certain events \"actions\" and other events not (i.e. i.e. how to explain which events are done by agents and which simply \"happen\"). then we talk about why Della Rocca thinks both these theories are wrong. It's a great class; Della Rocca has some bizarre ideas, but he's very clear and the material is fascinating!",
    "Starts with mid twentieth century philosophy of action and progresses to the present day with a dose of criticism from Della Rocca's historical perspective.",
    "This course will give you a pretty faithful idea of what analytic philosophy is all about. Personally, I realized this is not exactly what I want out of philosophy. Our discussions got extremely technical at times and sometimes the subject felt painfully uninteresting. What was great about this course though is that, in a very rigorous way, we evaluated some of the shortcomings of the traditional reductionist building-block approach to philosophy. To explain the futility of the project of trying to answer what it means for an event to be an action was the main topic at the end of the course, and this I thought was quite good. A worthwhile course for all philosophy majors though, at the very least to truly figure out whether analytic philosophy is something that you're really interested in."
