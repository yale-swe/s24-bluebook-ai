   "comments": [
    "An incredible class from start to finish. This class, with its AMST\/EVST crosslisting actually contributed to my decision to switch to EVST from AMST. I learned all kinds of new ways of interacting with places that I had though I was familiar with but wasn't at all. The classes assignment structure with its culmination in a study of home was perfect and engaging and I ended with a project I was proud of.",
    "philosophic appreciation of land, better understanding of geographical justice and spatial justice.",
    "I think my biggest overall takeaway from this course was learning how to think critically about space and place. I did not know what this meant before I took this course, so I feel grateful that I have the conceptual tools now to analyze the spatial elements of the world around me.",
    "I learned a new way of thinking about the built environment and the world around us. A fantastic course to introduce you to critical geography.",
    "Learned critical geographic skills that are incredibly useful to bring to any area of study",
    "I honestly can't express how much I learned in this course. My mind is totally blown, I'll never look at natural landscapes or built environments the same again. I learned how to be really critical of and attentive to the forces at play in a given place or landscape, even when those places are constructed to erase or obscure sociopolitical forces. And on a more practical, every-day level, I got better at listening to others in a seminar format, since everyone was so engaged with the material. I also became more critical about my writing, since Professor Barraclough was a hard but very fair paper grader. Learned a ton overall!!",
    "The course was a wonderful introduction to cultural geography and the theoretical frameworks used to talk about space. The flip side of that was that the readings were complicated and often it felt like our class time wasn't rigorously enough structured to actually address those ideas fully.",
    "I developed a lot of personal insight about my home and my position in larger social and cultural context as an Italian American. This course was an incredible opportunity to explore both my personal definitions of home and larger cultural and social forces.",
    "I learned how spacial relations between different entities can shape a landscape and how it functions on a broader scale. Power dynamics exist on a spatial and temporal scale that can only be understood with an analysis of the owner of the land and those that interact with it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great (and manageable) readings, good discussion, productive excursions, a great project\/assignment concept Weaknesses: sometimes overwhelming jargon (especially with little\/no experience in the critical theory)",
    "The readings were very interesting and insightful, and Prof. Barraclough is great. I think the weakness of this course was the class discussions, which I often felt deviated so much from course material that I did not know how to engage or what we were learning from the discussion. To improve, I think staying more on track to discuss the readings and course concepts in class would really help. Another strength were the field trips to beinecke and the walking tour, which I thought were wonderful.",
    "The selection of readings was great. Just about all of them were interesting to read and introduced me to some new ideas or ways of thinking. I actually looked forward to doing readings. Class was never boring, whether it was just discussion, our visit to the YUAG, or walking tour of New Haven. The only weakness I can think of is that it would be beneficial to do a first draft and peer review of the final paper like we did the earlier papers.",
    "An amazing class that deepened my understanding of spatial knowledge and analysis. Syllabus is incredible and so is Prof B. Only change I would suggest is sometimes having more facilitated discussion, in (classic Yale seminar style) it often became people just talking for the sake of making their point, not really engaging with what had already been said",
    "Super-strong course! The workload was very fair, the discussions were engaging and lively, and Professor Barraclough was very supportive and compelling in class. I honestly can't think of something I would have added.",
    "This course is important because it addresses radical theory that isn't much taught. However, I felt as though the classroom time and discussion could've been more rigorously structured to actually address the readings.",
    "This course is very well organized. The readings are amazing, even though class discussions didn't always focus on them. The papers were difficult to write because of the subject matter, but it was a great challenge.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed our excursions to analyze our spatial surroundings using maps at the Beinecke, walking around New Haven, and observing art at the YUAG. It would be interesting to bring in photos or a map of our hometown and have the whole class give an analysis on them so that we can further strengthen our series of essays. On another note, it did not seem like we drew much of our in-class discussion from the texts we read from homework; instead the text was a jumping off point for questions we had and space-related experiences we each had had.",
    "Strengths: - Variety of classes (walking tour of New Haven, highlighting portraits in the gallery, splitting up into our essay workshop groups) - Consistent essay workshop groups -- I felt deep trust in and fondness for my people (and their homes) by the end - The opening class in which we talked about our homes -- this proved to us all that we already had plenty to say and it set a precedent of honesty and sincerity that made the class feel so cozy - The articulation of the essay prompts. I found them so clear and generative, and I loved how they never prescribed that we use a certain number of readings. Basically, we just had to do whatever it took to answer the question, which is what real writing consists of. - THE FACT THAT WE HAD GENUINE CONVERSATIONS. THIS ALONE MIGHT HAVE MADE THIS CLASS THE MOST IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD TO DATE. Before taking this class, I had never been in a seminar where our discussions were genuine \"conversations\" -- I had written this off as an unattainable ideal. But thanks to the candor of my classmates, the captivating readings, the fact that we were writing about home so personal experience was fair game, and Professor Barraclouggh's sincere listening and provocative questions, the discussions in this class were indistinguishable from my most cherished conversations in the dining hall. Our discussions meandered and circled back to questions that had stumped us before; there would be moments where two people would work something out together in an eager back-and-forth; we had moments of real confusion and real discovery. In other words, this was the first class where I practiced habits of conversation that I'd want to transfer out of the classroom. Area of Improvement: My only suggestion would be to find a way to let us return to some of the earlier readings and explain the relationships among them. I loved the feeling of revisiting readings for my final paper, and I just wish I had had the chance to create some kind of flowchart or written response that linked the readings together. I appreciated the order of the syllabus, but I think I'd have a bettter shot at remembering these precious readings if I had a chance to organize the readings myself."

    "Absolutely. With high demand it's tough that admission isn't guaranteed but it's definitely worth shopping. My worldview has been completely changed and I go about my daily life with all kinds of added context and lenses with which to view my surroundings.",
    "better know yourself as a writer. this class sometimes can be very confusing",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a course that teaches you new frameworks for understanding and analyzing aspects of the world. I would recommend to someone looking to learn more about their home and self as well.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely take this class!",
    "Take it if you're serious about the topic. Otherwise, it's a little intense for anyone who want to chill.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Barraclough is the bomb, she's so smart and wonderful and funnyand while she's a hard but fair grader, you WILL become a better writer. The course material also regularly blew my mind. I'll never look at a landscape, built or \"natural,\" the same way again.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes!",
    "This course provides a good look into how we build spatial relations and how we give a place meaning and how in turn that affects inhabitants of the surroundings and tourists. It was a very \"liberal-artsy\" kind of course, which might make it initially difficult to settle in to class discussions.",
