   "comments": [
    "This course was so well taught I was in disbelief. I think Orgo, or at least Orgo I, receives a bad reputation, but it is a great class that is taught well. The only weakness is the speed through which the material is moved through. But I definitely think, that with professor Ellman, this class is doable.",
    "It's orgo. Take it with Ellman, and you'll get through it and like it and learn a lot.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Ellman is a great teacher, and the material was not as difficult as I was expecting it to be.",
    "impossible. no.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone that does not need to take it simply because It is very difficult and not enjoyable",
    "A well-taught course that takes some work around exam time. The rest of the time it is a relatively easy course.",
    "Don't be scared by the title! Orgo's not that bad, and Professor Ellman's fantastic - a really great teacher who makes organic chemistry doable!",
    "Would recommend. Good class, but fair amount of work.",
    "Orgo isn't an easy subject but mainly because it is material that you have never seen before. Take advantage of office hours! I hope you get a good professor because that could really make or break or class.",
    "Organic Chemistry is not a cakewalk anywhere in the world, and it certainly isn't here at Yale. However, if you have the good fortune to take Organic Chemistry with Professor Ellman you should. The material isn't easier with him, it's just better taught. And that's enough to keep you from despair and defeat with Orgo.",
    "Intro to orgo",
    "Orgo is a difficult but manageable class if you keep on top of the material. The practice tests are really reflective of the concepts and the actual exams. Ellman is a great professor who does a good job of explaining the concepts in a clear and concise manner.",
    "CHEM 220 is a challenging but rewarding class. I'd recommend it to anyone who is considering being pre-med or a chemistry major. Professor Ellman did a fantastic job of explaining the course material. He was clear and concise in lecture and always wrote out everything on the board in a very organized fashion. Organic Chemistry can be hard but professor Ellman made it much more enjoyable. If you're going to take orgo at Yale, be sure to take it him.",
    "This is a pretty typical organic chemistry course. Professor Ellman is great and explains concepts clearly. He even sends out 3 practice exams before every exam, so the content that will be covered on the exam is very clear. He's also extremely helpful in office hours, so I'd recommend going.",
    "Take it if you need it for pre med or your major. Try to take the course with Elman. He was incredible.",
    "I didn't expect to like organic chemistry, but I ended up finding Chem 220 really enjoyable and intellectually stimulating.",
    "If you're taking this it's probably because you're a pre-med and you have to. But it's a good class and Ellman's a good professor who really cares about making sure the students learn orgo. Exams are very very hard",
    "Organic chemistry is challenging, but worth while. I was a tentative chem major before this class. Now I am a chem major. It's possible to enjoy this class! If you enjoy puzzles and details, this class will interest you. There are 3 midterms, one dropped and a high stakes final. Realize the best way to do well is to do amazing on the first 2 because they are less difficult, study for the 3rd to prepare for the final. The curves are strange, everyone in my class did amazing on the first two and that was intimidating. This year had no Psets to be handed in, which means flexibility with the workload. However, not doing the Psets vastly accumulates, especially the last month of the semester. Do try to keep up!",
    "It's a good course - taught by the best professor you can get for orgo. Take it if it's with Ellman.",
    "If you have to take CHEM 220, please take it with Ellman. It's the way to go.",
    "A great intro level orgo class if you take it with Ellman. He's extremely organized and presents the material clearly. There are textbook readings and problems assigned essentially every lecture, but the psets are essentially optional because the problems never get checked. Do them if you feel they'll help, but after the first week or so, the problems got too tedious for me to do. Unless you have a ton of time to devote to orgo, the number of problems assigned were just a bit much. There are 3 midterms (1 dropped), 4 quizzes (1 dropped), and a final. Ellman posts practice tests before every exam. They look almost identical to the real thing in terms of format and type of questions asked, which is super helpful. Going to lecture, staying on top of readings, and taking the practice exams seriously is enough to do well (the exam questions tend to be much easier than the pset problems).",
    "CHEM 220 was a stressful course that required an average of nearly 2 hours of work a day in order to do the readings and homework problems thoroughly for complete understanding. For those ok with settling for a B+\/A-, it is possible to get by with attending lecture and doing the practice problems for quizzes and midterms, but it won't get you a complete understanding of orgo, or a grade better than those who put in the work. There were many practice problems in the book that were completely irrelevant, yet took hours worth of time and long nights to pour through. The worst part about this class were the other students - mainly premeds - who didn't seem to want to study in groups or help each other out. This class was a dog-eat-dog kind of class, where everyone looks out for themselves at the expense of others. Not recommended unless you're an obsessive premed or a chem major who likes doing this stuff.",
    "I actually enjoyed orgo - it's one of those classes that's very hard but feels really rewarding once you understand a concept. Just keep on top of the coursework (do the practice problems and don't slack off just because you don't have to turn them in!) and go to lecture, and you should be fine.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory course to organic chemistry.",
    "Take Orgo with Ellman and keep up with the hw problems and you'll be set",
    "Very straightforward orgo 1 class",
    "It's a really difficult subject with a lot of memorization, but once you get it it's actually really fun.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Absolutely take it with Professor Ellman if you can. He gives very fair tests and his lectures are both engaging and make sense.",
    "You probably have to do it if you're looking at this course. You'll take it. You'll feel weak after the final. You'll feel strong looking back at the semester, and all the reactions\/trends you made your mind absorb.",
    "This course was the first part of organic chemistry that introduces organic molecules, their reactions, and their mechanisms. I would recommend the course to students who are interested in a very challenging, problem-based life sciences course.",
    "You might think you have to take orgo just for your major or a pre-med requirement, but with Ellman, you'll actually enjoy it. It shouldn't kill your GPA (I think about 60% of students get As) and as long as you put in the effort, it is not that hard to get an A in the class.",
    "This class is actually somewhat enjoyable because of Professor Ellman. I hated gen. chem and definitely thought orgo was a step up. It's definitely challengingthe semester begins deceptively easy and becomes almost overwhelmingly difficult (esp. for someone like me who didn't really do optional homework problems) but Ellmam is very clear and straightforward in his teaching. I probably wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, but I thought it was a pretty good class overall.",
    "Although many people would not take Chem 220 by choice, I have to say it was not half bad. I obviously wouldn't recommend this course to someone who isn't already science inclined, but for those that like the subject matter, I would absolutely recommend trying to take this course with Professor Ellman.",
    "Organic Chemistry I. If Ellman is teaching it, take it!",
    "solid course, gives a good understanding of how and why reactions work\/don't",
    "Definitely take it with Ellman.",
    "Organic Chemistry can be challenging, but it is a worthwhile course. I have definitely learned a lot over the course of the semester. If you take the course with Ellman, you will be tempted to not do the homework assignments because they aren't graded since you don't hand them in. However, it's crucial to stay up to date and not fall behind. A lot of students didn't do the work and really had to struggle to catch up for midterms and quizzes. I would definitely recommend it with Ellman though, he was really great and definitely cared a lot.",
    "Look, I know most of the people taking this course are required to take it, but it's really a fabulous class. Professor Ellman absolutely knows what he's talking about, and explains it very well. You're asked to learn a lot over the semester, unsurprisingly, but if you like puzzle solving, most of it makes a lot of sense. Problems are assigned in every class, but you never have to hand them in, and so almost all of your work is studying for the tests, which Professor Ellman prepares you for extremely well. It's totally worth your time to work towards it, and if you come in looking to learn something, you'll have a great time.",
    "Yes! It's surprisingly painless. Definitely take it with Professor Ellman and if you can, get Corey as your TA. I absolutely dreaded taking orgo, but I surprisingly like it.",
    "This course is difficult, but not unmanageable of you stay on top of the material. That being said, it is incredibly hard to always stay on top of the material, and it often felt like as soon as you fell a little bit behind, it was nearly impossible to keep up. Professor Ellman was absolutely wonderful, though, and always explained the material in a way that was as clear and easy to follow as possible, as well as being very receptive to questions. So if you can, definitely take orgo with Prof. Ellman! Overall, orgo I was incredibly stressful and could sometimes feel unbearable, but at the end of the day I actually enjoyed the material and felt that I learned a lot and would have enjoyed it even more had I kept up with the material better.",
    "This course is very challenging and time-intensive but rewarding as you learn an incredible amount. Lecture is engaging thanks to Professor Ellman and you gain a solid basis of organic chemistry.",
    "Its difficult but doable. Much more interesting than genchem.",
    "It covers the fundamentals of organic chemistry I well. The midterms and tests are fair. The professor is great! I would recommend for anyone who needs it to fulfill a requirement."
