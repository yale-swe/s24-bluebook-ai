   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT. I'm not even an art history major and have no knowledge of photography, and it's been an amazing class.",
    "If you like photography at all, take this class. You'll learn everything you need to know, and then some. Prepare to work hard and soak in every word Nemerov says.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend. It's an entertaining and eye-opening class, especially for those who haven't yet taken an art or art history class. Depending on your TA it might take a lot of effort to pull off an A, and the exams require a lot of memorization--not ideal for C\/D\/F. Still, take it!",
    "Lectures are fun to listen to. Relaxing way to start your morning. Sections tend to devolve into BS. Midterm not that hard, final shouldn't be all that hard. Paper....eh.Take it. It's interesting.",
    "American Photos is an exploration of American History shown through the eyes of some of America's greatest photographers. It's a wonderful insight that I've never before experienced, however, students should be prepared for a highly subjective grading of papers with the ability to bullshit as an essential skill for the class.",
    "HSAR 220 is an introductory survey of American photography. I would recommend the class to anyone of any major. It is interesting and enjoyable, and the workload is much less than other classes.",
    "I highly recommend Art History 220 to any student at yale. It is thought-provoking and really worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend the class to those students interested in art history; I think it is important to note that this is very much an art history course (the American Studies label might be confusing) and that one needs to be able to think in as an art historian to succeed in the class.That being said, it is a very interesting class and will enlarge your perspective on American history!",
    "I would recommend this class. I chose to take it Credit\/D since art history is not at all my thing, and that was the right decision for me since I probably would have ended up with a B. It was great just to be able to experience the lectures and learn the material without the added stress.",
    "That the class is filled with students from a wide variety of departments as well as non-student New Haven residents is a testament to Professor Nemerov's unique greatness, his ability to make the history of art about something more than names and dates, but about something that grabs a listener and simply will not let go. There was a lot of gasping from the class, students coming to view an image in a completely new light or startled and caught off guard by Professor Nemerov's humor, depth, or turn of phrase. I don't know that anyone else in the world could make those images speak to us as they did.",
    "I WOULD. It's not a history course...and its not quite art history. I don't know...very ethereal. You should aim to be inspired.",
    "Yes take it for a fun class, it's good for a fifth class too. One short, one long paper, midterm and final are straightforward and easy to study for.",
    "This class is a gem. Even if you aren't interested in art you should take it just to hear Nemerov lecture. Both the content and the presentation of this class are excellent.",
    "This is one of the gems at Yale, folks. Nemerov is a god. Although if you're not one to appreciate art, you might get bored in lecture. The workload is very manageable and the midterm was fine.",
    "Take this course. Don't even think, just take it. You don't have to have an interest in photographs. This course is not just about photographs anyway. It's about history, art and life. Yes you will sometimes have to invent things in your analysis, but this itself is also a skill. If none of this has convinced you yet, then take the course for Nemerov, who will become your hero. You will be hard pressed to find a better lecturer at Yale. If you are still not convinced, then shop the course and see for yourself.",
    "A really fun class, interesting and unique and not too much work. We covered a lot of history and I learned about a topic I was really unfamiliar with so that was really enjoyable.",
    "You HAVE to take this class before you graduate. At least take something with Professor Nemerov... but this one is especially interesting and unique from any other Art History class you will find. It's a lot of work and pretty tough, so it would probably be great as a Credit\/D, but it's completely worth it--it's material that you will remember for the rest of your life.",
    "Good course. Nemerov is great. Find a good section, some can be better than others.",
    "Introductory art history class- great first art history class to ever take. Definitely recommend. Nemerov is fabulous.",
    "Absolutely recommended! I am a History of Art major focusing on American art, and this class is not to be missed. Outside of the fascinating material, the lectures are great and the work is not that much. His tests are very straightforward.",
    "A great class.Sometimes the analysis is kind of unbelievable and I find it hard to take the class seriously. Nemerov regularly drops phrases like \"ravening maw of the lens\" and \"to capture what floats and swims liquidly on the eye itself.\"However, you learn a huge amount of interesting stuff about the history of American photography, about what makes a good photo, about what makes a good photographer, and about American history. You also learn a new way of looking at an image, which although you might reject in the end as kind of ridiculous, is interesting to learn.And Nemerov is a really invested, emotional lecturer and is worth seeing.",
    "Amazing. Take it.",
    "Fantastic survey of American photography. You learn so much and really appreciate it. Great art history class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as an introduction to American photography. The lectures are relevant, interesting, and very organized.",
    "Best class ever. The photographs are super interesting and it changes the way you look at photography. You actually leave this course knowing a lot. Nemerov is fantastic--you will leave lecture with chills because each class is so wonderful. I wish I could take it again! The class is not too much work and you will love it so much--the perfect combination",
    "It's really a lovely course- the lectures are moving, the images are beautiful, and there is enough freedom in the assignments to write about something you enjoy",
    "This class is definitely worth it. Nemerov is a fantastic lecturer. I personally preferred his spring survey course, but this class is great.",
    "Interesting, great class. Recommended for any fan of art, photography, or American history.",
    "Great class. Immensely fun to listen to, and you cover a really important part of American culture. Nemerov is a hoot. Watch out for the TAs; grading is inconsistent across sections. Be aware that grading for art history is seriously subjective.",
    "Nemerov IS this course. He is a giant. He is a poet-god. He is a wanderer, a lost soul, a gaunt memento mori, a primary source, and an exceptional eye. He is also a strange man, and he would certainly fail his own final exams, because 3% of his ideas are supported by strong visual evidence. But who cares! That doesn't mean that he is wrong; he only rarely says something that no one in the room buys. And more often than not, he says something that makes the study of photography seems like a necessary part of our survival as humans.So TAKE IT, humans! You don't have to do the reading (although it may come back to bite you on the final), the essays are an exciting way to get engaged with the material, and the exams are a good example of the kind of communal event that reassures you of your existence.Why are you even thinking twice? There is no better lecturer out there.",
    "I took it credit\/d and I'm not sure if I'm glad I did. Lectures were fascinating at times, overly poetic at others. It was often an insight into Nemerov's mind rather than the history itself. But his mind was sometimes really beautiful.I dunno. Shop it and see if you like it. I'm not sure what I'm taking from the course at this point, but it was sometimes a really moving lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student. One of the best courses I have ever taken.",
    "American Photos is an Alex Nemerov course, which, for me at least, means TAKE IT. He is a fantastic, moving lecturer. If you are skeptical that photography is an art, you should take this class, because that is definitely one of the themes of the course. I thought that the earlier parts of the class on older photography would be boring, but some of the photographers that Professor Nemerov talked about ended up being my favorites of the semester. Take the class!",
    "TAKE IT. PLEASE. Its a breath of fresh air and it sheds light on art as a tool for understanding American social dynamics.",
    "Take this course. Whether you're a seasoned art historian or new to the discipline, you will get something out of this course. Professor Nemerov is one of the best professors at Yale, so especially if he's teaching it, don't miss out.",
    "Definitely. I went into the course with very limited knowledge of the subject, and came out feeling like I learned more than I did in any other course this semester.",
    "I would recommend the class for the lectures. Find a TA who will help you, not confuse and frustrate your introduction to a new field.",
    "One of the great lecture courses I've taken at Yale, and I'm a senior History major. Nemerov makes every minute of lecture worth your while, spinning a brilliant web of cultural history--and, actually, political and social history--through America's great photographs.If you're taking it for a grade, be ready to work--the papers are no cakewalk, and the midterm and final are really hard. I probably should have taken this course Credit-D, which almost all my friends did.",
    "This is the best class ever. Professor Nemerov is an unbelievable lecturer. I highly, highly, highly recommend it.",
    "It's great for a student interested in american history of art. don't take it if you want to learn how to interpret and analyze photos on your own. take it credit d.",
    "Must take class, especially for art history or amstud majors.",
    "A great class, a Yale classic.",
    "Definitely take this course. It will open your eyes.",
    "A good fourth or fifth class, especially nice to take Credit D, as you can enjoy the lectures without having to stress over the two papers, midterm and the final. Credit D also helps if you've never written an art research paper, which can be a little tricky. Overall, a good class, and although not all lectures will blow you away like you might expect, there's a couple that will stay with you.",
    "fun class, not too much work, fun lectures-",
    "A study of the important American photographers and photographs of the last century. Great lectures. Easy tests and papers. But the info and subject matter of the class seems irrelevant.",
    "American Photography is an excellent survey course. However, be aware that you are going to get the History of American Photography according to Alexander Nemerov. That being said--Professor Nemerov's history of American Photography is a ONCE IN A LIFETIME CHANCE to hear an incredible professor lecture passionately about a fascinating topic. His lectures will move you to tears, make you laugh or sometimes just make you angry--but either way you're guaranteed to leave this class having thought deeply, learned a lot and seen some incredible photographs.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Nemerov is the most amazing professor at Yale, you will be missing out on so much if you do not take a class with him. American Photos is interesting, beautiful, and constantly surprising. The workload is completely manageable, the papers are fun, and the lectures are not to be missed.",
    "A great class to take Credit\/D.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. I often left the class in chills.",
    "Take it. One of the best classes I have taken.",
    "The course is a survey of American photography from 1850-1970. It covers such photographers as Walker Evans, Gordon Parks, Robert Frank, and Diane Arbus. Every single lecture is interesting and easy to understand. Professor Nemerov is just magnificent. There are reasons why other people from New Haven sit in on his lectures.",
    "Take this class Credit\/D! It's great and very interesting, but not worth the stress of working for a grade.",
    "Take the class, even if you know nothing about art, photographs and American history, or if you know something about any of those topics, or if you think you know everything about them. You will get something out of it. This is one of the rare classes at Yale where listening to the professor is the best part of the experience, and one that is uniquely rewarding every time you go. Very rarely do professors let you into their minds to get a sense of how they are thinking through their interpretations and analyses; Nemerov is open, but at the same time controlled. He speaks beautifully and I wanted to transcribe and record every one of his lectures; I also know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Great class! Really interesting material, extraordinary lecture. You will never want to miss a lecture. You learn about history, photography, art history, life. Take it! I took it for a grade, but if you want to avoid memorizing hundreds of photographs, this is a great choice for Credit\/D.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in photography. I knew nothing about it and absolutely loved the class. I would say that it is one of the best I have taken at Yale, and I am a senior. You learn a lot about different photographers staring with early daguerreotypes (early photographs) and the civil war, and then you get up to the 70\u0092s and really social and political photography. It\u0092s a great mix of things and Professor Nemerov is always entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this class but warn other students not to have high expectations. It's a good class to take Credit\/D. Don't expect this class to be life changing, but it is an interesting way to view America. Often it is too pretentious, though.",
    "Great. Take at least one art history class to become a better, more informed human. And take it from Nemerov.",
    "Wonderful! A very interesting and unconventional way to survey American history. Nemerov is intelligent, thoughtful and approachable but sometimes the conclusions he draws seem a little iffy. However, you get used to it and can easily abstract a great deal of value from the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this survey of major American photographs to other students. Although it seems like a very particular topic, it is made meaningful by the cultural and social connections that the photos make to the broader world.",
    "A great class that gets you to look at photographs in a completely different way. Professor Nemerov's lectures are phenomenal, and each one is interesting and something to look forward to. I am very glad I took this course. I am not an art person, and art history is foreign to me, but I was surprised to find American Photography my favorite course this semester. Take it! You won't regret it.",
    "Take this class, without hesitation. Even if you think you may not be interested in photography, you will become convinced of its unparalleled power by beautiful and fascinating lectures. It covers the history of photography in America from its beginnings in the mid-nineteenth century until 1971, the year of Diane Arbus' suicide. It examines how photography was used to different ends at different times and how it poignantly mirrors cultural evolutions.",
    "I hereby recommend this course to you! Yes to any of you, it's that versatile a course. You can bring whatever angle to this course that you want--American photography exposes a number historical, social, and even scientific issues, and is interesting to anyone who enjoys looking at pictures.",
    "Great class if you enjoy photography. you see history through a different lense afterwards.",
    "This class is a survey introduction of American Photography. The readings are supplemental but necessary for the final, the sections take place in the gallery. Take this class if you are interested in photography or if you'd like a lecture art history class, because Nemerov's lectures are incredibly engaging. If you do not like to memorize slides (artist, title, date), you may struggle. I would absolutely recommend this class",
    "Yes! Interesting lectures, not too much reading or work.",
    "I can't speak to the class from the perspective of an art history major, but as a senior with no experience in the field, I enjoyed it. I was only really able to enjoy it, however, because I took it Cr\/D. I would highly suggest this option (or just auditing lectures) to people without experience in art history classes. I loved attending lecture, but in the course of completing the papers and exams, I was left with the feeling that I could never, no matter how much I studied, write what was expected.Lectures with Professor Alex Nemerov were stunning. There are some in the middle of the class that are less interesting than others, but overall the quality of the lectures is superb and there are some gems that I will remember long after I graduate (hint: don't miss the last lecture).Having never taken an art history class before, I made the right choice to pick one focused on American photographs, since photography is a medium that we all have daily experiences with and American culture is something most of us are fluent in. I would definitely suggest this class to someone looking to branch out into a new subject area because of these factors.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This was my favorite art history course taken at Yale. If you have any interest in art history or even American cultural history take it, you won't regret it. Professor Nemerov is amazing.",
    "This course could not be any better. I have to say, I think I learned more in this course than I have in any other course at Yale. I know I've learned things that will help in LIFE forever. this was THE BEST class i have EVER taken at yale. I never wanted to miss a lecture because I was so anxious to hear Nemerov speak. He such a wonderful intelligent guy. Unbelievable course--you'll regret not taking it before you graduate!",
    "Definitely take it! Even if (or especially if) you've never even thought twice about photography. This course will change that. Prof. Nemerov's lectures are AMAZING, but you've probably heard that already.",
    "Great course, made for everyone, very interesting.",
    "Maybe the best class I've taken at Yale. It opened my eyes to an art form and many artists that I will return to for many years to come. A truly great class. Nemerov was fantastic. I felt that the lectures were for my personal benefit, not for a requirement or for an exam. A well balanced workload too, with a final paper that can be challenging but also really fascinating, as it isbascally open topic. Section is pretty useless, and I had a miserable TA, but overall, I could not recommend this class highly enough.",
    "Should be called \"How Alex Nemerov's favorite photographs make him feel.\" Cool class, but make no mistake you will be disappointed if you've taken a photography class in the past. Still a good class, Nemerov is first-rate entertainment, and seeing boring photos can make you more clear on what you like about good ones. Also, be aware, some TAs have outrageous demands. This class screams credit\/d.",
    "This is an excellent course! You should definitely take it if you have the chance - if not, clear your schedule so you can. Professor Nemerov is an incredible lecturer - every class was different and enthralling. The course is very interesting and very reasonable - a short paper, medium-length research paper, and midterm and final. There is section, but it meets in the art gallery and you discuss photographs every week, so it is enjoyable. Also, the reading is very interesting. You definitely learn to think differently about photography and art.",
    "A fantastic class. Nemerov's style--definitely on the looser end of art history, most of his lectures, though captivating, are personal\/emotional interpretation--really appealed to me. The material is fascinating and the format great. One 5 page paper, one 12 page paper, and a midterm and final that consist of slides, comparisons, and an essay. Section met in the study gallery of the Art gallery, which made for great sections--actually getting to look at the art you were discussing. Readings were manageable--no more than 40 pages a week, generally, and were relevant and helpful. I learned a ton from this class, and it really increased my interest in and appreciation for photography.",
    "It's a great class! Take it for a unique exposure to art history and a new way of viewing American history. Workload is reasonable--- lots of photos to memorize for tests but just put the time into it.",
    "You have to take this course! It's unbelievable. Nemerov is a god.",
    "This class is an absolute sham. There were two separate questions on our final asking us how particular photos \"define photography.\" How about we get Nemerov to define \"joke,\" because that's what this class is.",
    "Take this course if the material interests you. Especially take it if you've never taken and art history course before -- it will teach you to think differently. Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely take this course! Just make sure to get a good TA. Section takes place in the gallery and is actually interesting to attend.",
    "Great way to learn about a range of American photographers....Nemerov does have a very specific thesis for each of the photographers which you might now always agree with, but it's still fascinating to learn the argument.",
    "Take this course. You won't regret it.",
    "Even if you're not particularly focused on photography, Nemerov makes the course interesting. It may not be the most realistic way to present a history of photography, but the emphasis on individual photographers makes for an intriguing narrative. Highly recommended. Only caveat: The YUAG auditorium doesn't have WiFi.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Nemerov is an amazing lecturer, the readings are short, and the subject matter is extremely interesting. Grading can be really random though and it depends a lot on your TA, so it's a good class to at least start out Credit D.",
    "highly recommended!!!",
    "American Photographs is a wonderful course that all Yale students will enjoy regardless of major. Professor Nemerov's knowledge of the material is inspirational and it was a pleasure to attend each lecture. Weekly reading assignments are manageable, but get ready to study hard and memorize a lot of material for exams.",
    "Definitely. This class is fantastic. It's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Nemerov is an excellent lecturer. The material is fun and interesting. And the class is not difficult!",
    "If you know nothing about photography, you will come out knowing a ton that is great for conversations and can be related to a lot of things. Take it for credit if you have a tough course load because there is a lot of work in the class (5 page paper, midterm, 10 page paper, exam plus section). They seemed to grade easier on the exams than the papers.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Nemerov is amazing and the material is fascinating. You maybe should take it Credit\/D though since your TA is either a hit or miss.",
    "If you are interested in art history and criticism, take the class, but if you are interested in purely photography, take caution. There's a lot of artsy babble that may bore more than inspire you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take this course. You will not be disappointed. You will not miss a lecture and Nemerov will be fabulous every class. It is not easy and requires a lot of memorization but the material is interesting enough that you won't mind. It is one of the best classes I've taken here at Yale so don't graduate without it!",
    "This was a really fun class, although midway through the semester it got a little boring. It is fun to take if you are not an art history\/remotely arty person, although be forewarned it is NOT a gut!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It doesn\u0092t matter that you\u0092re not an art history major \u0096 each lecture is beautifully crafted and cohesive and meaningful beyond memorizing titles\/dates\/etc. Some hear Nemerov speak and are immediately mesmerized by his poetic, precise style, always pushing to form just the right phrase to capture what\u0092s going on in the photo. Others think, \u0093I don\u0092t see it\u0085\u0094 or \u0093Thaaat\u0092s kind of a stretch.\u0094 But I think anyone who wants to see and think in a coherent, deeply intricate way needs to take this class. In lecture, students are pulled to wrap our mind around the position of the photos in art history, the cultural\/political world they each existed in, and the connections between them. Readings, papers, and exams were all well designed \u0096 I felt that everything mattered. **First time in a long time I cared about what I was thinking\/writing.** Words of advice: Do not take papers\/exams lightly (though they are reasonable) \u0096 I\u0092m a history major, and even though I\u0092ve had experience in art history, art history papers require even more precision of language and strength of argument because you can\u0092t jump to conclusions without bridging the visual and contextual analysis. I found myself referencing photos in conversations outside of class. And I wasn\u0092t one to worship and copy every single word Nemerov said \u0096 I felt empowered to trust my own vision and yet to not ignore everything else that influenced the life and work of the photographers. Take this class. You will be changed.",
    "Nemerov's lectures were good but not life-changing. On a good day, he will open your mind to new ways of thinking about art and photography and life. On a bad day, he will stray from the photographs, lecture for fifteen minutes after the end of class, and use the sort of anachronistic reasoning that would give most history majors stomach ulcers.The best part, by far, of the class is the photographs. If you get nothing else out of the class, you will probably enjoy the photos. They are logically organized and the class hits most of the highlights. Many of the readings, I found out far too late in the semester, are enlightening and provide a nice concrete counterpoint to the lectures.The first lecture was very similar in style to the rest of them, so it will be a good indicator of whether you'd like to take the class.If you don't like classes that are a little fluffy then you should run away. Otherwise, the lectures are often engaging and who doesn't like looking at photos for a couple of hours a week?",
    "I would recommend this course to majors and non-majors alike. Professor Nemerov is outstanding, and will change your lecture experience.",
    "This is an excellent class. The material is interesting and fresh, and although studying for the tests is sometimes tedious, the lectures are exciting and engaging."
