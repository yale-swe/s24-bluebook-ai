   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're interested in the material, but be aware that there will be grad students and undergrads doing this kind of research in their labs, so unless you have a strong interest in the topics, you might get left behind during discussions. Readings are reasonable each week. We had no grades all semester, so it's hard to know how our final papers will be evaluated though, so don't take this if you're the kind of person that likes to know how they're doing all semester.",
    "Great class- in each seminar, students are responsible for reading a few articles and presenting the findings, which are then discussed. Very much a discussion-based seminar so expect to talk a lot. One 20 page final paper on the topic of your choice. Professor McCarthy is great!",
    "Highly recommended",
    "This is a fantastic class. If you're interested in neuroscience at all and are looking for an engaging psych senior seminar, I highly recommend taking it. I learned so much from the course and the final paper for the class was one of the first papers I've ever written that I thoroughly enjoyed writing because I actually felt like I really knew what I was talking about.",
    "Sure, very interesting material on the neuropsychology of various topics such morality, empathy, etc.",
    "Great course for those who enjoy social psychology issues and neuroscience. Highly recommended.",
    "A great way to learn about social neuroscience. Reading load is medium but the discussion is really helpful to learn about each topic in depth.",
    "Good course but not a great course because it was far far too big. Prof. McCarthy is great one-on-one but he had a hard time keeping everyone engaged in such a large class. Still, the topics are very interesting, and if you take advantage of his office hours, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Great seminar. The readings are interesting and you get some choice in which ones you are responsible for. You will be expected to contribute to the discussion each week based on your individual reading. This year most students in the class were engaged, which kept the discussion lively. Prof. McCarthy knows his stuff, and he's a very friendly, approachable, helpful person.",
    "Take it if you are a neuroscience major. The final paper is unpleasant to write but otherwise the workload isn't bad. There are lots of section assholes, but the course is really interesting.",
    "This class covers a wide range of topics in social neuroscience, beginning with social perceptual processes - face perception, biological motion, gaze perception - and moving to higher-level processes such as theory of mind, empathy, social decision-making, moral judgment, etc. I highly recommend this course to any student interested in either neuroscience or social psychology."
