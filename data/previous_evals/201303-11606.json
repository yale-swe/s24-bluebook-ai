    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student! The book list and class discussions cover fascinating topics in global politics, Professor Kalyvas is amazing, and I've learned so much throughout the semester. A fun and rewarding class overall - one of the best I've ever taken!",
    "Definitely recommend it if you can get in. A book per week seems like a lot, but it is more manageable than I thought and we only read current and interesting books. Stathis makes sure the class is always upbeat and the discussions are always a lot of fun.",
    "Absolutely, take it if you can! The books are almost all terrific, even the ones on really random topics. Professor Kalyvas is fascinating and often very funny, although if you can't handle having your ideas shot down, this class isn't for you.",
    "A book a week, and a really nice environment for class discussion.",
    "YES!!! This is one of the best and most enjoyable political science classes in the major, and you learn a lot about different topics and read a lot of interesting books. The workload is really fair, and reading the books is easier than you would expect because they are not dense academic books, but rather interesting and contemporary ones written for broader audiences. I would definitely recommend it!!",
    "Professor Kalyvas is a delight, but be wary of the book list, which is interesting but includes books that are almost entirely unrelated to one another. Trying to make connections between such books, which was the project of the course, made us come up with vague generalizations about the current condition of society when it would have been much more valuable for us to delve into any one of the topics. If you like the idea of learning a little about many random topics, take this course; otherwise take something more focused. There is alot of reading but few assignments. You have to do a couple brief presentations, write weekly one-page memos, and come up with a fairly short final paper.",
    "This class is fine - you read a bunch of current events books and write about 500 words about them every week. While discussions were often good, it was hard to get a sense for any underlying themes or take-aways. Professor Kalyvas also gives no graded feedback whatsoever during the semester, so it's very hard to know where you stand.",
    "Yes yes yes. A must take before you graduate--you'll learn so much more about the world and get to read those books you've always wanted to but never did",
    "Stathis Kalyvas is a rockstar, and easily the best professor I have ever had so far at Yale. He does not stand for bullshit, which is refreshing. You may think you know what not standing for bullshit is, but until you've had Stathis, you don't. I dare you to get 3 minutes into your presentation without him interrupting you to tell you what's wrong with it. And he is always right!There is a disease among polisci students where we're convinced that we're brilliant because we've taken all these seminars and we share long-form huffpo articles on Facebook and we know who we're voting for. Stathis is having none of it! If you want to be a better thinker, a more aware individual, and less full of bullshit, take a class with Stathis Kalyvas and let him rip you to shreds. If you can get into the seminar, and if you let him, he'll put you on the path to being the best version of yourself. Don't show up thinking you already know what you think about the world, or you'll be wasting your time. He's magic!! Also, actually put aside the time to do the reading, otherwise you're just going to be another polisci student arguing about something you think you understand, and doesn't the world have enough of those already.",
    "Global Politics is a course that seeks to learn about and connect a number of major issues in the geopolitical sphere. This semester we read about and discussed issues from the financial crisis to the Haqqani Network. The class reads one book a week, and each student makes one book presentation and one 'connections' presentation (to the other books) over the course of the semester.",
    "Take it",
    "I would recommend it to another student if the student wouldn't be very bothered by the one book per week style of the class \/ learning things by the skin, rather than deeply delving into each subject. I personally felt like many of the thing we learned in class were common-sense \/ not very enlightening even if it weren't common sense. I expected the class to be more about IR theory, but the class just turned out being read one book per week about a different country and later putting the books together to compare them (when they really can't be compared). Other than that, the class does teach you some of the major trends in current and future global politics and you do get to read a lot of books (some good, some not so good) and discuss them with Professor Kalyvas. You also do get to ask interesting questions about global politics \/ different cultures of countries that you wouldn't normally ask. Overall, I'd say the course definitely has some strengths and some weaknesses. And one more strength about the course is that Professor Kalyvas is awesome.",
    "A course about major issues that you need to know about the state of the world, ranging from the financial crisis to the inequality between the rich and poor to the drug war."
