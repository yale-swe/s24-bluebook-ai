    "I think if you're a linguistics major, you have to take it. If you're not a linguistics major just looking to learn something cool about languages, phonology is very technical and another class might be more interesting. Also the take home final took forever!!",
    "LING 132 is exactly what it sounds like - introductory phonology. You learn about phonemic inventories and phonological representations, and learn to write rules (and at the end, OT hierarchies) to model changes. There is a lot of hands-on data analysis both in the problem sets and in the lectures.If you're a linguistics major, you have to take this class. It's not a burden at all because the problem sets are straightforward and fun, and Gaja teaches the class in an engaging and accessible way. If you're not a linguistics major (and not planning to become one), I would still recommend it if you're interested in language or cognitive science.",
    "It's required for the ling major, so you probably don't have a choice about taking it. It's fun though! It's small enough that the \"lectures\" can be pretty interactive and Gaja makes them interesting. I did not take phonetics before hand and didn't know anything about the IPA, so there was definitely a learning curve for me and I struggled at first. Make sure you take it with a group of people you know so that you can all work on the p.sets together, otherwise it's miserable. Overall: good, solid class. You'll learn a lot, and enjoy doing it. The process that you use for derivations and rules and all the analyzing can be tedious, but it's really really satisfying if you like logic. Definitely recommend.",
    "An introduction to Phonology, taking most of the course to explain a rule-based approach, but introducing optimality theory at the end (the most exciting bit!). It's a required course for linguistics majors, but it's also a So credit that is nicely QR-y - problem sets are enjoyable if you like logic puzzles...",
    "The material itself is good to know I guess, and the course is taught in a way that makes it interesting and accessible.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was a lot of fun, and it was a great way to become closer with a lot of the other linguistics majors. We got to hang out once a week to collaborate on the problem sets, and for the most part, everyone contributed throughout the process. This was especially helpful for those occasional rough weeks when you just could not start the problem set at all beforehand, and you just needed a \"boost\" from other people to get up to speed quickly. The weekly problem sets were fair and on average took between 3-6 hours total per week (which is not bad). Class was not bad, didn't really fall asleep (like I do in every other class), since it is a little more dynamic than a lecture, but not quite an intense discussion. Some fun examples and exercises.Phonology might also be the linguistics class that you can apply the most easily and instantaneously in every day life to any language you know.",
    "I thought this was a reasonably interesting course. You do learn the basic theories and methods in the field and apply them to a wide variety of languages. The weekly problem sets were not impossibly difficult, but were often just challenging enough to still be fun. You could get by without doing the readings and she gives out note-packets in class, so the course overall is not a whole lot of work. But it's still interesting and the professor is accessible and willing to help if you ask for it. You probably have to take this course anyway, if you're a ling major, but I would recommend it anyway.",
    "Phonology is a core sub-field of Linguistics, so anyone seriously interested in Linguistics should take this course (for majors, it's a requirement, anyway). It can be interesting, but most of the time, everything was presented in a pretty dry way. Because of this, I would not recommend the course to non-majors.",
    "The material is very interesting and the workload is very manageable (the problem sets are not too long and the readings are fairly straight-forward) but the lectures can be boring sometimes. I would definitely recommend the class if you are interested in phonology."
