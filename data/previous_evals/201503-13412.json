    "This course is excellent in arming students with knowledge surrounding sexuality, health, and HR. While Ali is a great mind and an even greater lecturer, the amount of reading in this class was a bit overwhelming. By the end of the course, I was barely skimming the readings. It would be helpful if Ali could give 2 readings that are required to ground students, rather than listing a large number of dense readings.",
    "This class is discussion based and requires a lot of student participation - which isn't something everyone is comfortable with. While I can understand the purpose of this teaching style, it's definitely not for everyone. Overall, the class was engaging and very interesting and definitely worth the time put into it.",
    "Excellent course. Really enjoyed the breadth of topics covered and the opportunity to explore sex, gender and human rights from various disciplines. The seminar format provides a useful way to learn from the instructor and fellow students."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Incredibly well informed on various topics regarding human rights and sexuality.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is amazing. Take this class just to hear her speak. I hope one day my mind works like hers.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is an incredibly accomplished, smart, intimidating woman who is clearly passionate about the material. She's a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller is an excellent professor. She has extensive academic and professional experience in the subject, and she is very committed to her students.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller is an excellent professor. Her in-depth knowledge across so many topics and disciplines is extremely impressive. She provides a space for students to express their views and treats students as adults and equals in the pursuit of knowledge. She is tough, but fair. She inspires me as a woman, academic, and crusader in the fight against social injustices, including gender inequality."

    "Professor Miller is awesome! Highly recommend.",
    "Take this class! It's a lot of work, but truly inspiring.",
    "Recommend!",
    "Definitiely take it if you're interested in gender and sexuality studies or human rights law. It's well taught and the readings are fascinating.",
    "For students interested in sex, gender, and human rights, I highly recommend this course. The course largely blends the fields of law and public health, offering students from diverse disciplines the opportunity to engage with the course topics from different perspectives. Due to the breadth of topics covered, not all of the content may be as relevant to all students, but there is certainly to the opportunity to be exposed to new information. Be prepared to read a lot each week in preparation for the seminars. Also, start your final paper early as it counts for more than half your grade. Overall, excellent course and professor."
