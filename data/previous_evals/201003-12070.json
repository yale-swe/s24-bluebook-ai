   "comments": [
    "If you are sure that's the path you want to take, if there is no alternative, take it...but beware you are going to have to study really hard for this class in order to get a decent grade.",
    "I would recommend that you take the lecture course actually. the seminar is not that close knit and the teacher probably teaches about the same as a teaching fellow would.",
    "It's an interesting subject that people should have a basic understanding of, whether they are thinking of a major in economics or not.",
    "Do not take the seminar if you did not take AP Economics. The class is fast-paced and you cover one topic a lesson. If you have trouble with the first topic, flee to the lecture otherwise you will lag behind all semester and hate school.",
    "It is overall a very good class.",
    "I would recommend it as as stepping stone within the Economics Major. As a class it is interesting but not thrilling; the teaching is not great enough to justify taking the class as a standalone class instead of as part of a sequence.",
    "Take this class. I prefer it to the other seminar because i think my professor went more into theory and covered more aspects.",
    "Definitely recommend it. I think it's very important to have a basic understanding of econ, and though this class was probably harder than the lecture, the better knowledge will pay off.",
    "Good class, very poorly taught by Katerina Simons. If you are going to take the seminar, take it with Tolga. Otherwise, take the lecture. Professor Simons has trouble drawing graphs, explaining them, and explaining math -- all vital parts of economics. She got derailed from the syllabus around the midterm and was days ahead of schedule, causing everybody to fall behind, and never gave us time to catch up.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are considering to major in Economics, or if you just really have an interest in the subject. It is a good class and Simons does a good job, however it does get dry at points.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 for other students, but mostly to those who have taken Econ before. I went into the course without Econ experience and felt that I struggled greatly despite all the time and effort put into trying to understand the material. I feel it is important for everyone to at least take an introductory Micro-econ class before graduating.",
    "This class is probably much better than the lecture alternative.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It will provide a good foundation for future classes and is generally an informative class to take.",
    "If you haven't taken econ before, but are interested in learning it, take this class. It might be a tad boring at times, but is never too difficult and will set you up for the more interesting classes that come later.",
    "If you do well in her course and participate during class (that means taking risks and answering some questions) she will like you and class will be fun. Although the curve is pretty unforgiving, I would recommend taking this course if you have a genuine interest in econ and are thinking of pursuing it further."
