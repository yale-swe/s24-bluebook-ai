    "I learned about Python and Jupyter Notebooks--this helped with my very basic understanding of coding which was really useful! I also learned about different methods in the Digital humanities like web scraping, text analysis, OCR and geocoding. I really enjoyed this accessible introduction to these topics!",
    "A lot about research methods and the ways in which they can be applied to complex research projects.",
    "I learned about how to apply digital methodologies to problems in the social sciences",
    "This was a terrible, waste of a class. You learn nothing. The professor makes creepy sexual comments throughout the semester. 0\/10 would never take a class with this guy.",
    "I learned a lot about the digital humanities, instead of the role they are playing in todays academia. I also learned a little bit about China, and also the use of computational methods in different forms. But it was definitely a top line approach."

    "I think the biggest strength and weakness is the briefness of our explorations of different topics. We kind of breezed through a lot of things that could all have their own class: i.e. web scraping and geocoding. I wish we could have taken more time to understand those methods more, but I understand that the ambition of the class is to expose students to as many methods as possible, which I also appreciated. I do wish, however, that we had discussed Chinese history and culture more!",
    "Really eclectic survey of research methods and of modern China (and the complexities of doing research in China).",
    "Great syllabus, interesting readings, reasonable and engaging assignments, great project",
    "Shorter class time",
    "Charles is very well-intended, but the discussions seem a bit shallow and repetitive, sometimes. The coding workshops could be a little more complete, most of the tutorials could be found online with solutions.",
    "This was a terrible, waste of a class. You learn nothing. The professor makes creepy sexual comments throughout the semester. 0\/10 would never take a class with this guy.",
    "Strengths: it was just such a great tasting platter for different computations methods. It was also a little workload, which was a bonus. I kind of love the fact that we got to envision a project, and that I think shouldve been the extent of the class, I dont think the actual execution is necessary and actually held me back from thinking big.

Weaknesses: The class really favorite people with computational backgrounds, which you promised it would end at the beginning. I think that if the class just had us come up with a research design, as opposed to actually doing it, then people would think much bigger and be more invested. It was just a lot to ask of us, with very little structure."

    "I would! I really liked Professor Chang and I think it was a pretty low-stress classroom setting where students are free to engage with the material as much as they want and that was really apparent in the final presentations. Everyone was really excited about their projects and topics.",
    "Yes, if they are looking for an opportunity to apply research methods to self-guided projects.",
    "Yes, very much so!",
    "Yes! If you want to have an honest conversation about China's government, take this course.",
    "Only if you're an independent learner and want to take the most out of the opportunity of doing a final project of your choice.",
    "This was a terrible, waste of a class. You learn nothing. The professor makes creepy sexual comments throughout the semester. 0\/10 would never take a class with this guy."
