    "TAKE THIS COURSE. So good, you will learn so much about modernity, memory and narrative with one of the most intelligent and caring professors I have met at my time at Yale. Basically going to write my thesis on this topic because of Denise Ho.",
    "Ho's class offers a very unique view on China, particularly the different ways that China has viewed itself over the past century. Basically an art history course of 20th century Chinese architecture seen through the lens of Chinese state-building. I would recommend this course to anyone who is studying East Asia. The course, as a writing credit, is a lot of work. However, this was perhaps one of the best discussion seminars that I have been in, so I would say that the workload is worth it.",
    "Great history seminar. This class is not too challenging--the reading load is very doable, as are the weekly 1-page reading responses. Professor Ho has put together a fantastic syllabus that deals with 20th century Chinese history and broader themes of history and memory.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Ho is fantastic. You will learn to think about recent Chinese history in ways that may not have occurred to you.",
    "This is a great class. The readings were well-written and varied, giving a sense of the different approaches one might take to the material each week. A few students submit discussion questions each week, but Professor Ho still leads the seminar, which worked really well. Everyone spoke and contributed a lot, but we still got to hear from her about her experiences and perspectives too. The class just felt very well-run and worthwhile. The material was fascinating, challenging, and not so voluminous that it felt like people weren't finishing it.",
    "If you have a good foundation in 20th-century Chinese history, this is a must take class. Professor Ho is wonderful, organized, and a dynamic seminar leader and I sincerely believe she is a rising star in the field. The readings draw upon architecture, journalism, sociology, history, memory studies and more to create a holistic picture of uses of the past. Widely applicable to other fields of interest too.",
    "I believe this is Professor Denise Ho's first time teaching this course at Yale, and she maintained a learning environment that invited any and all contributions to come together for some really great, organic discussions, which she gave us so much room to navigate whatever our interests were. I'd recommend a student take her class to engage with memory\/\/history theory, museum and spectacle\/exhibition studies and the particular curations or receptions of \"historical\" exhibitions and spaces in modern China (spanning the 20th-21st centuries).",
    "It's a great class if you're interested in either historical memory in general or modern China in particular. It's not an overwhelming workload, and the readings are interesting and thought-provoking. However, I did feel as though I was at a disadvantage because I neither spoke Chinese nor was Chinese, so consider that as you shop the course.",
    "A very good course that combined Chinese history with a focus on architecture, culture, material culture, and lived experience. Prof. Ho did a great job bringing in literature from history, anthropology, ethnography, architecture, and art history to look at both the linear history of China as well as the use of history in making china modern. Definite strengths are Prof. Ho and her enthusiasm \/ knowledge of the material as well as the course literature. Room for improvement in Prof Ho's contributions to discussions (pushing back and adding to them instead of just moderating), fewer questions per seminar (maybe deeper but less broad), more analysis of writing styles, and more guidance on the final paper \/ deadlines for drafts so they can be publishing ready by the end of the semester. Overall, a great course on Chinese culture and history.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in modern china, its history, and the memory as a tool in historiography!"
