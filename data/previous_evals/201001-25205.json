   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely take it! It's great and it's manageable!",
    "Yes, it is an incredibly interesting class. I think about the course material in my everyday life all of the time.",
    "An interesting class, that at some points is intuitive but for the most part is pretty interesting. Dovidio makes it exciting, and is there to make your life easier, which is rare. He's the best! Not too difficult, but not super easy. 2 papers, a midterm and a final.",
    "Engaging lectures, interesting and relevant material, manageable workload. Highly recommended.",
    "Great course! Everything we learned was extremely relevant. It opens your eyes to the prejudices and biases we are exposed to every day, and also teaches you a lot about the processes underlying these biases. It really makes you think about intercultural\/interracial relations in the context of cognitive and social motivations. Professor Dovidio is great and very knowledgeable in his field. If you need help, he will be there to help you. Workload is not that bad, a midterm, a final, a research proposal, and a final paper. The lectures are sometimes repetitive, but overall one of my favorite courses at Yale thus far.",
    "I couldn't recommend this class any more highly. It was engaging, interesting, and above all FUN. There's a decent amount of work assigned over the course of the semester, but I enjoyed every minute of it to the point that I'm actually hoping to get funding and carry-out my final research proposal next year. This class in UNBELIEVABLE. Definitely take it.",
    "Social Psych of Oppression is an amazing class. If you have an interest in psychology, race\/gender, or both DEFINITELY take it!!!!!!!!!",
    "I recommend this class 1000000000000%!!! It turned on so many lightbulbs in my head and provided content for great discussions with my friends. I was actually excited to go to class every week. That's saying a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Everyone should take it.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE IT.It is mind-blowingly interesting and will change your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they want to be exposed to some of the issues in perception that we face in the social world. It is class that openly speaks about the taboo subjects, so it is important to be open because the basis of this class is not based on changing opinions, it is about describing the social world to people. It is just amazing because the professoris so dedicated to the students and his studies and it truly reflects in the caliber of the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It was a great overview into that theme in social psychology. I think it's important to know these things about the way our society operates. For students who are members of oppressed groups: try not to get too discouraged by the depressing findings, our groups are resilient!",
    "Social Psyc of Oppression was probably my favorite class of the semester. Some of the stuff you will learn is common sense, but other topics are fascinating. The assignments are very broad so you can study whatever you want, and the exams are easy if you go to class. Professor Dovidio is engaging and fun and very willing to help you with assignments and exam questions.",
    "Its an amazing, applicable class, that everyone should take, regardless of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, major, etc.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It is one of my absolute favorites!! The material was fascinating and really made me think about myself and my prejudices. It was one of those classes I always brought up with my friends in the dining hall, in my room etc. The workload isn't too bad. There's a midterm and a final exam which you need to study for and go over some of the readings (but otherwise you don't really have to do the readings). And there's a short paper and a long paper which you can write about whatever you like. If you choose something you're interested in then the papers are actually fun and interesting to do. Professor Dovidio is AWESOME!!! He's really great at getting the class to interact too. SO TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "This is a fascinating course about things which are deeply relevant to our society and our modern lives. Dovidio is a wonderful lecturer and a very thoughtful professor who makes times for his students.The readings are really fascinating. You can get along without doing the readings, but you really miss out.",
    "My favorite class so far at Yale. The tests are thought provoking and go far beyond rote memorization. The papers are great because they allow you to engage with your own interests. The professor is simply the best. He's funny engaging and accessible. Material makes you rethink a lot of things. I loved this class! oh and the work load is not bad at all. pretty average for a psych class, having taken 11 now.",
    "Don't graduate from Yale without taking this course!",
    "Take it. Really interesting experiments. The assignments were interesting. Dovidio is GREAT.",
    "Highly recommend, this is one of those classes that forces you to view the world from a wider perspective while also providing grounds for introspection",
    "Don't take it. The topic is interesting but it's a really boring class, so it's not worth it.It seems that there is not much material to the class - the entire course could easily be summarized into 4-5 lectures, which makes most of the lectures really boring and a waste of time. It was also an awkward course because Prof. Dovidio moved by really slowly and tried to engage the students in conversation - but this was a lecture course. I would much rather hear him reason stuff out than hear forced comments from fellow students, which usually ended up starting with: \"I don't know, but...\" or \"It depends..\". I thought all that time he provided during class for \"discussions\" were a big waste of time.",
    "take it take it take it",
    "I can't recommend Psych 305 highly enough. If you're at all interested in racial issues, please take this class. We covered many aspects of racism, sexism, and general prejudice. If you want scientific or psychological arguments for or against affirmative action, racial profiling, and immigration reform, take this class. It's probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Jack Dovidio is the man, and he likely knows as much about the psychology of racism as anyone in the world. No matter who you are, you'll end most class periods feeling kind of bad about yourself, but it's completely and totally worth it.Also, it turns out that you're probably racist, even if you don't know it, so you should definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to psych majors and non-majors interested in taking a course beyond intro psych. The course material is not difficult to understand, but it provides an interesting perspective. It is not a heavy workload, but it does provide an opportunity to do some psychology writing.",
    "Definitely take this course, there's no question about that. I loved this course.",
    "This course is excellent--a must take for psychology majors, and for students in general. It points out so many of our own subconscious bias and mental processes that we really don't realize on a day to day basis. Both instructor and material are really engaging. I've learned so much more applicable things in this class than I have in any previous course I've taken at Yale.",
    "You need to take this class. It will make you think of people and race in ways that you had never imagined. It really changes the way you think about life and helps you understand why people are prejudiced (actually why everyone is prejudiced) and what we can do to overcome prejudice. Professor Dovidio is also sweet.",
    "YES - possibly the best psych course I've taken. Gives you info to make your own judgments about prejudice\/racism in everyday interactions -- Prof Dovidio is awesome and presents info in a pretty unbiased manner. I'm going to remember more things from this class than from most other Yale courses.",
    "Absolutely recommended."
