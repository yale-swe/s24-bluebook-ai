   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in textiles. An excellent opportunity to view pieces of the Yale collection that aren't on display and to work with a leader in textile studies. That being said, the material is technical, historical, and economic. The usual toolbox of visual analysis as learned in the introductory survey classes, therefore, is not the only skill developed in this course. I found the information fascinating; Professor Barnes provides an 'alternative' history through textile exchanges and the history of motifs. A great course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a warning that grading is pretty tough. You must go the extra mile to get the H, which means you must be invested in the class. Perhaps I would not recommend this to non art or art-related fields."
