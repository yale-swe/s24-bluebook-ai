   "comments": [
    "Great course! The class is well organized and structured. The TA's were a great resource, and SAS labs helped to clarify the concepts made in lecture. The weekly homework assignments can sometimes be quite time-consuming though, but it reinforces very important concepts in regression. Dr. Zhang follows closely with the text, which is great because the text is VERY good.",
    "Great organization and presentation of material.Improvements:A more sequential presentation of material prior to the final project would be helpful. When doing the final project it was difficult to interpret which analysis methods should be used at each step. We learned all of the analysis separately and then it was tricky to put them into a comprehensive model building exercise at the appropriate time.",
    "The course is very systematic. Every chapter is useful in performing linear regression analysis. Homework is tightly related to the lecture and lab.",
    "This class was great and I learned a lot about the practical application of linear regression. The homework assignments were a great way to practice what we learned in class.",
    "Extremely good coverage of the subject. I feel I really know what I'm doing now.",
    "I'm quite satisfied. The course's strengths:Many practical homework assessments, various applications to real datasets, clear, informative lecture, well organized lab sessions , choice of using R or SAS. I like the idea of final project and of applying the study material into a real dataset.",
    "The course is well designed.",
    "This was a well designed course. The structure of have lectures and a lab was very helpful for solidifying the concepts and material. The professor would lecture about the concepts in class and the teach assistants would go through how you would apply it during the lab sections.",
    "strengths:TAs were wonderful. Loved the SAS lab handouts each week. I'll keep them with me for a long time. Book was also fairly helpful (but enormous and had to carry around)Weakness:At times lecture could be a bit difficult.",
    "It is very good.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the opportunity to gain a more in-depth knowledge of statistical analysis -- after finishing this course, students have a deeper understanding of the concepts learning in biostats I and II as well as the confidence to apply these concepts to a complicated data analysis situation. The balance of theory and practice in the course is excellent.",
    "Useful analysis technique. Labs were the most helpful aspect of the class. Effectively clarified what was esplained in lecture.",
    "Very good overall and interestingMaybe more prof instructions",
    "I think this is an extremely solid course in which we learn the fundamentals of linear regression. I think that the work was appropriately assigned. I would change this course in the manner in which the labs and TA sessions would be held. A lot of the TA session was simply the TA reading from pre-arranged slides. I feel that it would be better had what the TA done was more of a broad overview, or re-addressing what was learned in class. I think the labs were very well written out, that we didn't quite need it to be read to us again.",
    "STRENGTHS: Good integration of lectures and labs with the textbook reading and homework so that they reinforced each other; friendly and patient instructors (both the professor and TAs); excellent lab handouts with step-by-step explanations of the procedures and SAS codeTO BE IMPROVED: Consider changing the final assignment to be something on which students can solicit help from TAs and the professor over the course of the semester, and then giving a more difficult final exam instead to assess student mastery of the material. While this might be more time-intensive for the professor and TAs, I think I would have gotten more out of the final project if I had been able to get feedback along the way as I ran into different challenges with my data set.",
    "This is a terrific course for anyone that wants to get a phd or understand more of the math behind the biostats that we are required to take."

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Heping is a good instructor but his real strength are the TAs. Martha and Owais are two of the best TAs that I've ever had. They are very knowledgeable, prompt, responsive and fair.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Prof Zhang is very experienced, and he has a good sense of humor in class. He did a good job.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0He was a great instructor, and very friendly and helpful to students.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Hunorous. Very comprehensive. Excellent job.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The instructor was well prepared and skilled. I liked his sense of humor, keeping the lecture interesting and making analogies to real scenarios.",

    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0No major issues",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Professor Zhang is good at teaching.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang did a good job presenting the statistical theory, which is a difficult topic to cover in a lecture format. I appreciated his example-based format as well as his sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Explanations not always clear in class. At times TAs explanations more useful to students than that of instructor.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Prof Zhang was very approachable and would listen to our questions well.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0An excellent lecturer and very open to student questions. In later lectures, he asked recall questions during lecture to make sure that we were remembering key points from the first half of the semester. Used PPT slides effectively and always posted them early to the ClassesV2 so that students could print them for taking notes. Demonstrated evident enthusiasm for the subject matter. Offered practical advice about what to do when you encounter problems with your data or software program.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0is a very good instructor. He was incredibly responsive to the students and very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0This professor's english was not good--it was very difficult understand what he was saying."

   "comments": [
    "The TA's are what makes the class great! Martha is an excellent TA; her SAS labs are incredibly useful especially when learning how to use SAS in regression analysis. Owais's office hours were also very helpful in clarifying concepts and homework questions.",
    "As I said above they were excellent!",
    "The TA explained the materials in the labs very clearly. The grading of the homework is clear. I think they did a great job.",
    "Owais and Martha were great TAs. Martha did an excellent job leading labs and the lab packets they made were very helpful in supplementing lecture.",
    "They did a great job with the labs. Martha and Oweis, both first rate.",
    "Martha Skup did excellent job conducting the lab sessions. The labs were well prepared and very instructive making the homework projects much easier.Owais Gilani was very helpful during office hours and put a lot of effort and time in grading homework and exams.Both did a great job.",
    "They have done a good job. However, the course is heavy on using SAS but the comment is often heard from the TAs that they are not SAS expert and we should ask somebody else. While I understand, this is not a good excuse. If we should be asking someone else, what's the TA for? Perhaps, one way is to get someone good in the SAS for a TA since that's the main program the course is designed around.",
    "The TAs were great! Both were very knowledgable and responsive to questions both in person and over email. The organization of the class\/lab was very well done. The notes given were extremely helpful for the assignments but also for learning the topics. The marks for assignments were very fair.",
    "Both were terrific",
    "They are all very good. Martha is good at presentation and states all the knowledge points clearly at the SAS lab. Owais is able to answer all the questions we have.",
    "The TAs were excellent! Martha's lectures on the SAS behind the analysis were incredibly useful, and Owais was always helpful and insightful during office hours. I really appreciated that both TAs were available and willing to answer questions via e-mail -- their dedication was much appreciated.",
    "TAs were reasonable and understanding in grading, which is much appreciated. They were also helpful in explaining and clarifying concepts learned in lecture; however they did not always provide an environment where stuents felt comfortable asking questions. Can be condescending at times.",
    "They were very helpful in answering questions",
    "I think that the hw's should have been turned back to us graded with much greater speed. At some points, we weremissing at least 3 hw's that we had turned in. Also, see above for my previous concerns with the lab. It did not need to be read to us. Also, I sometimes found Martha to be a little \"snippy\" when it was unnecessary to do so, particularly when reasonable questions were being asked. Owais was very helpful when we asked questions in his office hours.",
    "Martha and Owais were amazing TAs! They were extremely friendly and accessible and communicated very well with the class. They provided helpful feedback on homework and answered questions well during labs and office hours. They acknowledged when they were uncertain of something and then sent us emails later or posted handouts to ClassesV2 to clarify.",
    "The TAs were very knowledgeable and helpful with class work."

    "Must take for statisticians.",
    "The course teaches about linear regression techniques and their applications. It gives understanding about the multilinear regression model assumptions, how to fit data, interpret statistical results. It shows various, diagnostic methods that can be applied to analyze datasets.I would highly recommend the course to other students.",
    "I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Very useful course for learning linear regression. Both application and theory are discussed. Good practical course to take- because of the skill set you will walk away with.",
    "Be prepared to keep up with the reading and homework every week or you'll fall behind very quickly",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students -- statistics is the basis of everything we do in public health, and this course improves both theoretical and practical knowledge of linear regression topics. It was one of my favorite courses of the semester.",
    "Useful if plan on using technique in the future. Otherwise not useful.",
    "Straightforward and you learn a lot",
    "Solid review of linear regression and its applications, of most of the tools and diagnostics that one would ever want to use. I would recommend the course to anyone looking for a solid basis in these methods.",
    "This is a solid introduction to linear regression. I would recommend this to a student who is coming out of BIS 505 and wants to acquire more theoretical understanding of the formulas behind the SAS code and more sophistication in working with data that may not conform strictly to the assumptions of linear regression.",
    "This is great class that I so happy that I took. I think that I will use the knowledge gained in my PhD program."
