   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class, I still wish rich history courses were offered on all the other great music that isn't in the classical canon.",
    "An amazing class, lectured by the god of lecturing. Take it, I guarantee you you'll love it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class, but if you're taking it you probably have to as a music major. Good luck.",
    "Wonderful (if extremely demanding) course! I can't believe how much I learned in one semester, but it happened--because this class is basically three in one: 1) knowledge of objective history; 2) familiarity with the associated repertoire; and 3) comparative historical analysis. This is a really great class. But if you take it...START EARLY. Start early, start early, start early, start early, ESPECIALLY for the listening quizzes!",
    "Take this fucking class!",
    "YES YES YES YES YES take this class. The music is incredible, the lectures are unbelievable, and Professor Hepokoski is one of the most passionate and exciting teachers you will ever have. Put in the time, do the listening, and do the reading-- complete immersion in this class is completely worth it.",
    "This is the only course at Yale I unconditionally recommend to anyone in Yale College. I've taken dozens of history and history-of-ideas courses in my life, but this is the first one that actually explained to me the world I live in in the context of the past, with implications so far beyond music.Hepokoski is probably the best lecturer at Yale, and he covers this material absolutely phenomenally.If you're looking for a list of topics covered it's something like: Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, the symphony, Wagner-Brahms divide, early modernists, high modernists, rise of mass popular culture, neoclassicism\/reactions to WWI, politicization of music, and (warning: this is depressing) the Death of Art.Nothing else to say really. Just take the course.P.S. He will encourage all non-music majors to leave the first day, but be persistent.",
    "Best class I have taken at yale by far.",
    "This course changed my life, in 3 ways:- It introduced me to a group of musicians that I now consider to be some of my best friends.- It very likely brought down my GPA although I worked my butt off for it.- It opened me up to composers I had never heard of and helped me round out a fuller conception of what I am doing as a musician, what the definitions of \"art\" might be, in all its nuances, and how classical music has fit and will fit into society.It is a class that will make you think, constantly. And if you consider taking it you must know that it will be a steep climb. But for me, the first and third bullet point were entirely worth it.",
    "Music 352 provides a great amount of information about 19th and 20th art music history in a short amount of time. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in music because it covers a great deal of important material in an interesting way.",
    "Intensive study of the romantic - mid twentieth century eras. I would recommend it to a music major, or to somebody very interested in the subject. Somebody looking for an easy history class is not gonna do well in the class. I would highly recommend those people take the class anyway, they just might want to Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Some of these lectures need to be carved on a slab of rock and displayed somewhere for all posterity to learn from. If you're at all interested in classical music, where it's been and where it's headed, this is not a class to miss. That said, be prepared for some long cramming sessions for the truly brutal listening quizzes and tests.",
    "If you're a music major, you have to take this course, but you will love it! I would totally reccommend this course without question. It is what the title says, a survey of history of art music (\"classical\") music from the 19th and 20th centuries. This class is part of a series of three music history courses.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, music major or not. If you have any interest in classical music and enjoy listening to it, you will love this course. The music is fascinating. The lectures are exciting. The assignments are interesting. The only thing to be careful of is that if you are not a music major (like me), it's going to be a ton of work. Even the music majors in the class said it was a lot of work, and if you don't already have a decent background in the material, you might have to work extra to keep up with the music majors in the class. That being said, the work and reading is usually a lot of fun, so it's not too big a deal. So if you already have a heavy semester, think a bit before adding this class. Regardless, one of the best and most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "A lot of work in concentrated bursts if you're like me and don't read until necessary. The listening quizzes, though, are impossible to cram for. Pace yourself, and actually listen to the assigned recordings before the lecture. When I figured that out, everything was much smoother.",
    "Great class. Take it if you love music and have any interest in learning about the dramatic changes in Western music, beginning with Beethoven.",
    "As a student interested in studying music history in graduate school, this is a great course. The listening quizzes require a great deal of time (to do well on, that is) but if you have the interest, this class is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. My only caution is that the work tends to be tedious and not all that enjoyable. The lectures make it worth it, but be prepared for some frustrating assignments (mostly the papers but studying for the exams is also annoying because there is a ton of material about which you can expect to be asked very litte, but of course you still need to know it all just in case)",
    "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken, and I recommend it whether or not you know anything about music or music history. I hardly knew anything about music history coming in, but this class is as much about learning important pieces and composers as about intellectual history and the difficulty of creating a music history in the first place. I thought I was just going to learn the basics of music from 1800-1950, but I ended up learning not only this but also about what it means to study music and music history and why that study matters. HOWEVER this class is a LOT ofwork. Don't do it unless you have time to really do it. If you learn the material however, it will be one of the most valuable experiences you have in college. Hepokoski is truly a gift--everyone should get a chance to hear him lecture, and most of the reading was incredibly interesting as well.",
    "Feel lucky, music major, that you're required to take this class. It's one of the treasures of Yale. Prof. Hepokoski is extremely engaging, knowledgable and fun, and you will learn the material well. You should be warned that this class is a lot of work. The readings are long and difficult (but very rewarding) and this class has a ton of graded assignments- 3 listening quizzes, midterm, final, 2 papers. Make sure you study the listening far in advance! Otherwise, enjoy one of the great classes of Yale. You'll wonder whether you knew anything about music before.",
    "The course really only focuses on 19th century, Romantic music for the first half of the semester; after that, the concentration is mainly on the 20th century, with a heavy focus on Stravinksy and on Schoenberg, and with lectures on 20th century music in America and France mixed in. If you really just want to learn about Romantic composers (Beethoven to Brahms, roughly) the course might be frustrating - there isn't even time to discuss Mahler or Mendelssohn! That being said, the lectures on Beethoven and Schubert are fantastic.The class is a lot of work - 2 written exams, 3 listening tests, and2 historiography papers (which are tedious)- and you'll still get everything out of the lectures without doing any of the reading, which is really only necessary for writing the papers. If you can, audit or Cr\/D the class instead.",
    "Every week there is about 100 pages of reading, 3-5 hours of music to listen to. There are 2 in class quizzes, 2 papers, 3 listening quizzes. This is a lot of work and a lot of material for one course.",
    "This course is a fascinating, if not complete (which would be virtually impossible) survey of this music. Brilliantly delivered and fascinatingly discussed, truly one of the best classes I've taken. I highly recommend it.",
    "This is a very rigorous course. You will learn a lot, but you will also work very hard to stay on top of the material. There are two essays comparing historians accounts of the same material, three listening quizzes, and two exams."
