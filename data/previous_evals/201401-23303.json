    "I would definitely recommend taking Eng 115 to anyone interested in a writing seminar. Being focused on literature, it is never too dry, especially if you choose a subject that interests you, that's the key. Aaron Prat is a great teacher and if you have the chance get into his class, because you'll have blast.",
    "I would highly recommend this English course to any student interested in literature. The topic, Horror and Terror in the Literary Imagination, captured my attention right away and managed to maintain it as we progressed through various different readings and watched movies. I never felt a lack of topics for which to write my essays on based on the readings, and I always found that there was something more to be said about them in class discussions.",
    "Great and not to bad.",
    "A class where we read a wide scope of a particular line of a literature genre. We write a few papers and learn of others in the subject as well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anybody interested in taking an intro English class, even if you don't think of yourself as much of an English person. It was extremely interesting and offbeat enough to not feel like your average English class. It has a fair amount of work, but by no means is it too difficult or stressful. A highly enjoyable and rewarding course overall.",
    "ENGL 115 in general is a fantastic course in layout and presentation (it was just the right amount of writing to allow for improvement without the workload being overwhelming), and this particular section (Horror & Terror) was very enjoyable itself!",
    "AARON IS AWESOME. 115 is good, but 115 with Aaron is great. He's enthusiastic, hilarious, and does a good parody of being a cranky old man while not being a cranky old man at all. He's also very perceptive and cares about his students--helpful and a fair grader. Also the material was interesting to read\/watch. If you're not a fan of English, this is probably your best bet to fulfill a WR requirement. Unfortunately, you do have to write, but it's only four essays. It'll be okay."
