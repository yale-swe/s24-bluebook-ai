   "comments": [
    "It's a broad exposure to a lot of very important ideas that play key roles in our lives today. I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the books assigned.",
    "Yes, solid class choose TF with caution",
    "If your TF was as magical as mine, I would definitely recommend the course to another student. For me, discussion sections made all the difference, so it's best to see if you like yours before committing to the class.",
    "Take it credit D and it will be interesting and enjoyable. The grading on papers is difficult and will drive you crazy.",
    "I think this course is a broad overview of political philosophy. Be warned that it's more focused on theory than application. You will read a bunch of very famous texts, and analyze them from a literary and philosophical perspective, but the discussion does not often turn to present day politics. That said, though, what you learn in this class will help you in more practical classes, even if you're taking them at the same time. Overall, I enjoyed it, and would recommend it if it's what you're looking for.",
    "I recommend taking this class, especially Writing intensive. Garsten is a excellent lecturer, and the material is interesting. It can be a bit heavy, but section helps clear up any issues. Writing intensive only requires revisions on your papers, so it is not a lot of extra work from not writing-intensive. The graders are hard, but fair.",
    "An excellent introduction to political philosophy. If you were interested in DS material but didn't want to commit three credits each semester to humanities classes, this is the class for you. You read some of the most interesting works out there, but it's definitely a lot of reading. The final is fairly straightforward and the essays were interesting (plus it's a nice way to get a WR credit). And Garsten is THE BEST. His lecture on Socrates in the Apology will blow you away.",
    "PLSC 114 was an interesting class; the readings were good, and Garsten was an excellent lecturer. However, it focused entirely on the readings and didn't really look at modern applications like the first lecture implied it was going to.",
    "PLSC 114 is a great class to take if you are at all interested in the history of political philosophy. It is not necessarily only all about political theory, but also about the role philosophy plays in politics.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is willing to do a fair amount of reading and is truly interested in the subject matter. If not, the material will be too dense to get through, and you won't really get anything out of the course without having read the books.",
    "I'd recommend it, as long as you don't mind a fair amount of reading. It's not too writing intensive. The beginning of the course feels kind of vague, but it gets more interesting as it goes.",
    "You read a lot of really important books and will hear some very interesting interpretations of them. Very good class!",
    "It's a wide review of some old books. Pretty much Directed Studies for non-DS students. Doesn't really include all the books I think it should have, including Marx and Arendt. Lot of short essays that are badly placed and two longer essays. Do the writing intensive because it's just editing the longer essays, which doesn't take long.",
    "PLSC 114 is a good course overall - the sampling of readings that are picked out really give a strong sense of the development of political philosophy through time. Garsten is a great professor, and even though his voice is incredibly soothing, what he has to say is almost always insightful and worth listening to (read: go to lectures). The big issue with this course is that TAs control 100% of your grade. This means you have to \"cater\" or \"tailor\" your papers to your TA's particular grading style, which I think is a detriment to the course. The readings are tough, but not too hard to stay on top of (if you're diligent). The grade breakdown is 2 long essays (20% each), 4 short essays (10% each), and the final exam (20%). Another benefit of this class is the optional writing credit - which you should use! Overall, good course, would recommend.",
    "I'd recommend it",
    "If you want to pretend you're in DS, take this class. The reading list is long, but pretty interesting, and you most likely won't have time to do all of it. Don't expect to get an A in this class either, A's are given only if a paper is \"publishable.\" Overall, it's a good class, the lectures are great, it will make you think a little differently, but it's challenging and time consuming. If you're mainly interested in doing the readings, you might want to consider Modern Foundations of Politics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students majoring in any field. It covers basic political philosophy without presuming prior knowledge, and the knowledge it supplies is something I think everyone should have.",
    "Ever Yale student who has not studied these texts in DS should take this course. I'd recommend it to anyone, regardless of major.",
    "YES! Take this class. I had such a phenomenal time with this class: readings were enjoyable, lectures were thought-provoking, section was full of debate and critical analysis, and essays were fun to write.",
    "Pretty good class, nothing great, not bad either. I took it figuring the only time I would read these kinds of books is in college and in that sense it did a pretty good job of serving as an introduction to those books. Garsten was a pretty good lecturer but nothing special-I didn't dread the class but I also didn't love coming to lectures. A pretty good amount of work though--four short papers (600-750 words each), two longer papers (1500-1800 words), and a final. So if you're interested in taking a philosophy class, take this one, if not, you aren't missing out on a ton.",
    "This is a fantastic class not only because you get to read fantastic books that will make you a better intellectual, but because it gives you the ability to scrutinize politics with a philosophical eye.",
    "I loved this class. Lots of reading and a fair amount of writing, but the content of the course is interesting. No matter your major, i feel as though this is a class everyone should take at some point at Yale.",
    "Garsten's lectures are marginally useful. My main gripe with this course was that it did not feel like an intro course in the amount of reading and assignments Garsten expected us to do. Hopefully, Garsten reduces both. Otherwise, it's a good course in that it forces you to read the seminal works of political philosophy. Theoretically crucial, but in practice, I haven't really put my knowledge to much use yet.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Garsten is unbelievable. He is the kind of professor you hope to have when you come to a place like Yale. He is effortlessly engaging and will captivate your attention through his brilliant and incredibly thoughtful lectures. The works you will read are fascinating and will inspire lots of thoughtful conversation. It is a really great way to get your writing requirement done if you are struggling to do that. TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I think the course started out beautifully and just went downhill from there. I loved reading about Socrates and even the commentary on Cicero was good (even though I hated reading Cicero) Hobbes and Locke were okay but at the end, Montesquieu and Tocqueville were horrible. Its strengths are that you get exposed to a lot of different thinkers and are forced to write a bunch of papers that force you to think more closely about the topics. Professor Garsten was nice and funny and a decent lecturer. Weaknesses: WE MOVED WAY TOO FAST IN THIS CLASS. I feel like if we had taken maybe one book out of the syllabus, the whole class would've been more enjoyable. The speed is what ruined the class for me. Also, it'd be nice to have more guidance on our papers. We didn't get the prompt until pretty close to the deadline, we didn't know what was expected of us from the papers, there was just no guidance, no guidelines, which made writing the papers hella stressful and accepting the grading a bit difficult. The class is just not very well organized in general. It'd also be nice to throw in a midterm. Not enough time was given on the final, although he told you what was going to be on the final. IDs are not hard, the essay questions are harder and take more time. Also, the papers were a bit annoying but I particularly enjoyed writing the thought-linked pieces. They were really fun. The passage analysis was weird and shouldn't be required I don't think. But, yeah, it's a deceptively hard class. Take it if you have a real interest in PHILOSOPHY.",
    "This is a strong course for anyone who is fascinated with crossing paths with some of the most important books and ideas of our time and DOES NOT want to plow through directed studies. For anyone interested in political science or theory (in general, not just as a major) it equips you with the right sorts of mindsets and questions to approach the way the world does and does not work today. For those who are skeptical, perhaps looking to fulfill a HU, this course is not highly demanding but is tremendously rewarding and simple: take some time to read the books and think about them, and you are assured to succeed. Though I may end up majoring in the hard sciences, this course has provided me with some texts and questions that will stick with me for a long time and help me understand the world, both politically and otherwise. Some of the TF's are phenomenal, as well: Shop with that in mind.",
    "Yes! Learn a lot in an interesting way",
    "If you're interested in politics or philosophy at all, then take this class!",
    "Take it. Good intro. Brilliant professor. Be prepared for lots of work. Don't fall behind in readings. ALSO: this class has a final. It shouldn't have a final.",
    "This class forced me to read some of the most important authors in western thought, which was good, but it was a painful experience. There was too much reading for me to keep up with and even when I did all the reading, I felt lost in section and sometimes in lecture. The professor assumes you have a basic familiarity with the common interpretations of these thinkers, which I did not. It was also a LOT of writing -- two big papers with revisions and four smaller papers, plus a final.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. Even if you only do the reading for the class, you will definitely gain insight on how political thought has changed over time and why we are in the world that we are in.",
    "Great course! Take it before you graduate",
    "Yes take it, especially if you've never had any philosophy. Great reading list but it was all very manageable.",
    "Take this class if you'd like an intro to political philosophy, as the name suggests. If you're looking for more modern thought though, I think MoFoPo might be the better class.",
    "PLSC 114 is an introduction to the western canon of philosophers.",
    "This class is a good intro to major works of political philosophy. Take this class if you have any interest in politics or philosophy. Also take this class if you need a writing credit because you only write two 5-7 page papers and four 2 page papers.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone remotely interested in political philosophy. Even if not, Professor Garsten makes the material interesting. He has made me want to go back and reread everything this summer. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class. It is a fantastic class with a fantastic professor.",
    "Yeah... a lot of reading but other than that it's good and makes you think about things in a new way.",
    "YES.",
    "The class makes you read the works of classic philosophers, which is a plus, and Garsten presents a number of interesting theses in lecture, but I didn't go to class every Tuesday and Thursday excited to be there. That said, if you pick a great TA, you'll get much more out of the class. For those who haven't taken philosophy classes before, PLSC114 is an opportunity to think and write in new ways. In sum, \"meh+.\"",
    "The class touches major works in political philosophy in a linked, interesting and sequential manner, but the amount of reading involved in the class might be a bit daunting, especially near the end, with finals, and papers just around the corner.",
    "A engaging introduction to, well, political philosophy. You get what's on the tin. That said, easily one of the best freshman PLSC courses."
