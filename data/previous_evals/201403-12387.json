    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It will help you become a more critical and nuanced thinker, and will make you really wrestle with deep moral questions. The grading can be tough, especially if you're new to philosophy, so take it Credit\/D until you get your first paper grade. Grading is 25% participation, 75% 3 5-page essays (25% each). Participation grade actually needs to be earned - you need to be willing to really talk in section. The upside is that as a result, sections are always fun and lively. All the material is interesting.",
    "Hard. Really, really difficult and stressful. Would not recommend to anyone who thinks that it'll be easy just because the class has \"intro\" in the title.",
    "Intro to Ethics is a great overview of the subject. Take it if you have any inclination for philosophy at all. Professor Kagan is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "Good introduction to philosophy at Yale. Covered a nice range of topics. It could be improved by being even more clear about the overall arc of the course more frequently during the semester.",
    "Don't take this class if you're just looking for an easy grade and not actually planning to think pretty hard about some pretty annoying paper prompts. Shelly is not easy, and this class won't be fun if your game plan to approaching papers is to clobber your word document with verbose but unintelligent bullshit.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in philosophy, it'll make you a better student of the discipline",
    "Totally recommend it! If not for a grade, at least credit-d it, or audit it! This class really makes you think and evaluate your own point of views in ethical thinking and moral justifications, and so it is always engaging.",
    "Take this class, but start it Credit\/D\/Fail. Shelly gives the full range of grades, and if, like me, you've never taken a Philosophy class before, you'll appreciate the safety net.",
    "Do not take this class, take anything but this class. Please do not waste your time. You may think it can't be that bad, that I am someone who just had a bad experience. Everyone I know regrets this class, you have so many other Yale classes you could take. Do not take this class with Kagan. Run, run and don't look back!",
    "Yes. I would recommend. Hard philosophy explained in a very digestible manner. Challenging and, if you like ethics, very rewarding. Oh and you never have to do any of the reading to get a good grade - we literally never discuss the readings and Shelly explains the topics much better than the readings do anyway.",
    "This course is wonderful! Take it if you are interested in learning more about ethics, philosophy, and answering the question \"How do we act morally?\" It is an overview of several ethical theories including the utilitarian, deontological, and contractarian perspectives. Kagan is a wonderful lecturer who is enthusiastic and engaging while being very clear and organized in his arguments. Sections are a great opportunity for you to debate critical arguments from lecture with peers. Essays, though challenging, are a wonderful opportunity for you to explore the ethical theories presented in class. Though Kagan is charged with being a tough grader, dedicating the adequate time, thought, and preparation is sufficient to be successful on the essays. Meeting with your TA, outlining, and restructuring your essay several times until it flows logically and raises key objections is all you need to do! This was easily one of my favorite classes at Yale! It will challenge you and force you to think critically!",
    "Great survey. Riveting lectures.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend it to students curious about Ethics.",
    "I would recommend this class because you learn about important moral philosophies that can change the way you weigh actions. It's also not too much work--only 3 papers and then preparation for discussion section (worth 25% of your semester grade).",
    "A solid, appropriately challenging introduction to major themes in ethics: rationality and acting for reasons; the justification of ethical principles; the role of self-interest. Shelly's lectures are impressive because he's funny, clear, and argues wellnot because he's some sort of god among men.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to think about morality from an intellectual standpoint. The questions Shelly asked in class really forced me to think about what I believed to be moral or immoral. It is a difficult class. I took it credit\/D and didn't regret the choice.",
    "Even if you take this course Cr\/D, think very carefully about your decision to take this course. It is not easy. Even if you're interested in ethics, as I was, remember that you still have to write papers, where you need to expound your own thoughts and ideas. If that's hard for you to think about abstract concepts and make strong points with them, your time in this course will be miserable, as mine was. I enjoy the course material, but the essays were really not worth worrying over and spending so much time on. Also, you have to be a good talker and be able to speak a lot in discussion section to get a passing grade. Overall the logistics of the course ruined my learning experience and ultimately led me to drop the course.",
    "Ethics is great! I didn't find it super inspirational or eye-opening, necessarily, but Shelly does a really good job of explaining complicated concepts well, and making you think about difficult concepts. There's very little work (negligible reading and three short papers) and I actually found the essays pretty fun to write as well. Not sure quite where the reputation for terrible grades comes from. Certainly, not everyone will get an A (like in some classes, maybe), but the grading is definitely fair if you put some thought into your papers, you'll do well. The class average is definitely brought down by all the people taking it credit\/d.",
    "don't take this class if you're looking for a basic introduction to philosphy. if you wanted what i wanted, just wikipedia locke \/ hume \/ kant \/ hobbes \/ mill.",
    "If you know that you like philosophy, take this course. If you're a STEM major, you MAY NOT like it. If, after shopping, you have ANY doubts, DO NOT take the class. The lectures will get boring and eventually you may hate the class.",
    "I highly recommend this course to all who are interested, though be aware the grading can be tough. It's well worth taking regardless of that and whether or not it is required for your major.",
    "Epic class. Come to lecture and watch Kagan go. Really makes you think.",
    "PHIL 175 is a course that explores the philosophical content of ethics, through reading Mill, Kant, Hume and Hobbes, in addition to a few more modern philosophers. The course is a good balance between the metaphysical question of the importance of ethics and the everyday practical applications of ethics - the subject matter falls directly in between these questions. I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. The lectures were a weekly highlight, the material important for everybody to think about, and the workload not particularly heavy. If the rumors about Shelly Kagan's grading policy are discouraging you from taking this course, take it Credit\/D\/Fail, but do not let this stop you. The grading is encouraging and rewarding, and it is still very possible to get a good grade in this class.",
    "I thought it was a good class to take Cr\/D\/F in that the lectures were interesting and the workload was light (3 five page essays no real need to do the readings and attending section). I didn't love it though. I don't feel like this is a \"must take\" course. It's interesting and Shelly lectures well. But you're not missing out if you don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this class as long as the student is willing to put in a lot of work in this class.",
    "An excellent intro-level philosophy course taught by an excellent lecturer. Prof Kagan does define the course since his lectures are stellar and incisively clear and illuminating. Having taken Theory of Knowledge in high school, where we looked quite deeply at ethical knowledge, I enrolled in the course being a little worried that it would be a repetition of what I had previously learned. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth at which Prof Kagan discussed the issues, and at the amount of insight he provided in his lectures. This was my favourite class in the semester. :) Also, please do not be deterred by the notorious harsh grading of the class; our class this semester did quite well, and it is definitely possible to write good papers! Take it if you are remotely interested in philosophy! :)",
    "Most of your understanding in this course comes from the lectures. The readings are often very dense and hard to understand. Professor Kagan is a very animated lecturer, so that's a bonus. However, if you don't have a strong interest in the subject matter, it's probably not the course for you. Also, Professor Kagan grades harder than most other Yale professors.",
    "Prof. Kagan sketches out different theories of morality in class, and then you have to apply them in real life situations. Readings are very light but the papers are graded toughly. The perfect fifth class credit\/D",
    "Introduction to Ethics is in many ways just an introduction to philosophical thinking, which just happens to use ethics as its medium. You learn how to both think and write about philosophy, which I think is an incredibly valuable skill. I would recommend you take it, but the harsh grading system lends it to being a Credit\/D course.",
    "For learning basics about ethical frameworks and interacting with big-name ideas, this is the course to take. Shelly makes things even more interesting.",
    "Great course. Shelly Kagan is very interesting, and this was a great first philosophy course. Not that much work, but really tough grading. A great Credit\/D -- can still get a lot out of the class, but stress yourself out a lot less. 3 essays and weekly discussion section.",
    "I'm a senior and this class has been the greatest academic disappointment of my Yale career. I actually waited to take it specifically with Professor Kagan, and couldn't have regretted it more. Kagan will begin the first class reading a list of reviews in a funny manner - he's been doing the same routine for I don't know how many years (I shopped his class my sophomore year and he did the exact same thing verbatim). He finds the fact that there are conflicting reviews funny, and they are a bit, but the sad part is that he seems to have absolutely no ability to actually reflect how the class can improve. My biggest issue with the class, however, is that Kagan's grading system defeats its purpose. An overwhelming majority of students take the class Cr\/D (in fact in my section only one student didn't take it Cr\/D - ONLY ONE STUDENT, and that's because that student had to for his major). As a result, students inevitably don't work as hard on their papers as they would have if they took the class for a grade, and gradually half of the class stops showing up to lecture. Kagan is stuck in his own mind and has no ability to understand how he can actually educate his students. If you give someone a D or a C on their first paper, they're not going to work harder on the next, they're just gonna say \"thank god I'm Cr\/D this shit.\" But if you gave them a B+ or even a B they would work hard to make sure they get an A on the next one. So basically you have tons of kids that end up not learning as much as they could because when a Yale student has 5 other papers and exams to write they aren't gonna invest much on a Cr\/D class. But where this grading scheme bothered me even more was in section. Kagan instructed TAs to grant an A for participation (which is 25% of your final grade) only for students who exhibit \"unique and thought-provoking insights\"... if you say something that doesn't make sense by accident then you can say goodbye to your A in participation. But in an intro philosophy class on a topic like ethics, most likely a lot of things that students will try to say won't make perfect sense or be articulated in the best possible way. This grading scheme discourages students from participating. They are afraid of saying something that won't meet the A standard, and decide to just remain silent or say one thing during the entire session. So bottom line - this class really isn't even worth the Cr\/D. Take Intro Ethics with any professor other than Kagan is my recommendation.",
    "Good course, but the material seemed a bit rushed towards the end.",
    "I liked my section a lot, so I enjoyed this class. I had never taken a philosophy class before, and now I feel like I have a baseline of comfort with the discipline. This was my 5th class, and it was relatively easy to keep the workload low (just 3 short papers).",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. It's a great introduction to philosophy more broadly, and it's not much work at all. Kagan is one Yale's truly legendary professors, and - if you like his teaching style - he's a privilege to listen to for 50 minutes twice a week. Week in, week out, this class offers cool questions of you to ponder and think about in your own life. Definitely take this Credit\/D though. Very tough grading.",
    "I would say it is a broad survey course in ethics, and I would only recommend it if the subject was interested in philosophy.",
    "This class is really hard. Probably not as hard as it is rumored to be, but still difficult. That said, if you have any interest in philosophy, you should take it. It isn't actually a lot of work; the grading is just very difficult. Shelly is a terrific lecturer and that's what makes this course special and I loved my TF and section. Highly recommended.",
    "Overall, the course is really interesting. Lectures were interesting, and Professor Kagan did a good job of making the material as understandable as possible for concepts that could sometimes be confusing. He was clear with his expectations for himself and for the students. I would certainly recommend this class to another student -even if you don't get the grade you want, I would say the class is worth it, regardless.",
    "Absolutely take this class, but start off taking the class Credit\/D\/Fail!! This class is worth taking, and it is not a lot of work, but the grading can be harsh, especially if you are not particularly good at writing position papers with strong arguments in them. Be sure that you read Shelly's \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper\" essay, which he puts on ClassesV2 the first day, and reread it each time a new paper is assigned. If you do well on the first paper and the first part of the participation grade, then consider changing to a letter grade.",
    "Great class. Credit D it or may God (or some divine power for those agnostics out there) save your soul.",
    "Good intro to ethics. The grading might stress you out but it is usually very fair. Lectures are great to listen too and the class isn't too complicated. It does force you out of your comfort zone if you're not familiar with philosophy and it will make your head hurt at times.",
    "Great class, take it Cr\/D. There are probably other philosophy classes that you could take and get more out of, since the Cr\/D takes a lot of pressure (and also effort) off of the papers. It's a great lecture with Shelly Kagan, he's incredibly engaging and fun to listen and talk to. However if it's not required for your major (EPE prereq), then I would give other philosophy classes a chance as well. Although Kagan is a great lecturer, so it could be kind of worth taking for for him.",
    "Yes, as long as you take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "The course is interesting, but I felt like the primary sources were very difficult to understand. I think I would've appreciated more criticisms\/interpretations of primary material in the readings rather than solely primary sources. I loved section, however, I learned much more from my TA and discussions than I did from the course.",
    "A general overview (hence the \"intro\") to ethics and the proof for those theories by several schools of thought. I would suggest this class to another student if they are considering the phosphate major; the writing style required is representative of the major and can serve as a useful \"test-run\" to see if the major is indeed a good decision.",
    "Great course, interesting material and low reading load. But the philosophy papers can be difficult to grasp, especially for first timers and beware not all TAs are created equal.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It really impacted how I think, and I know the ideas that I learned over the semester will allow me to tailor my actions and view the world more deeply for many years to come. The lectures are great, the content is fascinating, and the discussions in section are dynamic. I would recommend taking it credit\/d\/fail, simply because that allows one to enjoy the material and concepts without constantly worrying about how it will all transfer into a grade. I would summarize the course as a class that discusses possible foundations for morality, caveats of those foundations, different criteria one can use to assess what makes something moral or immoral, and how all of the above applies to the individual. It's exciting because something in lecture would be applicable to several situations in my life every day, and it was exciting to be able to evaluate whatever was going on through the lens of different methods.",
    "You learn about ethics, in other words, how we should act. Very interesting class for anyone and any major, be it English, stem, etc.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Kagan is a great lecturer, and the material is really engaging. There isn't a ton of reading, and since the whole point of the class is to discover what you think, as long as you're paying attention you'll be able to keep up. You get to tackle some hard questions, and it's really refreshing to have a class that's all about making up your own mind rather than learning facts or analyzing other people's work. Take it Credit\/D though; the grading is pretty harsh.",
    "Take it credit d",
    "Intro to Ethics was fascinating -- Shelly's lectures were truly engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed his teaching style -- he lead us through the material at a quick pace -- but it was always well organized and thought-provoking. He treated each class as a discussion, where he would present an idea and argue for it. And then the next class he would explain why that idea didn't work. He had me constantly changing my philosophical views throughout the course of the semester. The discussion sections were engaging -- they always seemed to end in some form of heated debate. As for the grading, I thought it was fair, on the whole -- although it was certainly tougher than many other classes. For anyone interested in philosophy, even in the slightest, I would highly recommend this course. It makes you question everything you previously took for granted; an experience I see as incredibly valuable.",
    "Great course. Ended up doing better than I thought. No shame in taking it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Don't take this unless you're okay with circle jerking about hypotheticals all day -- take something more rigorous and text-driven if you want to actually learn philosophy",
    "I would recommend this class for somebody interested in discussing what is right and what is wrong because it certainly addresses the different ways of thinking about it. I would take it Credit-D-Fail though (or audit) if you really care about your grades. Perhaps what is most disappointing about this class is that at a certain point it is not really effort-based.",
    "I thought I would go ahead and take this class first semester freshman year (A-F) as a cool taste of what Yale has to offer. I don't regret it, but seriously take it credit\/D if you care about your GPA. The only assignments are reading and 3 essays, but this course is a holy crusade against grade inflation. Go for it though, because this is a great intro to philosophy and the skill of thinking in general, and you get the cool celebrity professor as a bonus.",
    "I only took this class because it was required for EP&E. Shelley is interesting lecture, but if you're taking this late in your Yale academic career (like I did), you'll find that you already know a lot of the concepts discussed. The class is very focussed on normative ethics - so meta-ethics or applied ethics don't really form the focus of the course."
