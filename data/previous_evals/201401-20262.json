   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class. Not impossible, but not easy either. The psets are usually very long and mechanical.",
    "Take it b\/c you need to",
    "I would summarize MATH 246 as a great introductory course to differential equations. The professor is very helpful as well as the textbook.",
    "Math 246 taught me how to solve a variety of types of ordinary differential equations, and it was pretty solid in this regard--if the point of the course was to teach a computational skill, it was a success. That being said, it was pretty uninspiring. This is largely because the material is very, very dry, so I'm not sure there's any way to avoid this, but it wasn't a class I particularly looked forward to attending first thing in the morning. It felt more or less like an advanced high school math class: here's an equation, here's how you solve it, now solve it over and over again! There were a few points at which the orientation of the class seemed conflicted. For instance, the prevailing assumption seemed to be that the class had minimal theoretical math background, but when we did go over the rare proof, we often used results from analysis that were left unexplained. It wasn't clear what we were supposed to get out of seeing the proof, in this case; that being said, Professor Dang was definitely willing to answer questions we had, both in and after class. We also oscillated between focusing on applications of ODEs (more in the first half of the semester) and doing more semi-theoretical stuff, without doing a whole lot of either--I personally think the class would benefit from more theory in lecture, since the computational problem sets more or less take care of learning the methods, provided the relevant approach is sketched in class. All in all, you should only take ODEs if you really need it to study another subject, since it isn't an intrinsically interesting subject, at least how it's taught here. But the class isn't particularly demanding (problem sets probably took ~2-3 hours most weeks, tests are long but manageable); the worst sin its guilty of is being boring. Professor Dang is really nice, too.",
    "This is a standard intro course that teaches basic methods of solving ODEs. There isn't a lot of work, though some of it is algebraically tedious. Prof. Dang follows the book pretty religiously, which is probably a good thing since the text (Tenenbaum) is AMAZING. She is also very helpful and her exams are fair. She also tries to get revenge on people who don't go to class by giving pop quizzes, not posting homework assignments online, and being unpredictable in covering sections the book, which is a little annoying as a more independent learner. The penalties, however, are not very severe as many people still skipped.",
    "This class is a class you'd take in order to take another class, perhaps in sciences. It's not a particularly thrilling class, but it's solid and straightforward.",
    "It's a fine class. Professor dang is very nice, psets can be tedious.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing further Math \/ Science courses then I would certainly recommend this class. It's a pretty thorough introduction to differential equations, from methods of solving differential equations to numerical methods and various existence and uniqueness theorems. At times it was pretty tough -- the methods aren't easy and there are a lot of them to sort through. The homework was pretty reasonable -- probably around 6-8 hours a week on average, and the exams seemed to be pretty fair. Overall, I'd recommend the class, but be ready for a challenge."
