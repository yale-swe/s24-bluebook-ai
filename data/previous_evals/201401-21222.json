   "comments": [
    "At this point, you're definitely taking this for the major but it's been one of the better classes I have taken in the EE major so far. Things have changed dramatically since previous years' horrendous evaluations. The weekly workload is light and the tests are not difficult. Lab takes up a bit of time, but by the end, the labs are actually enjoyable.",
    "Very good EE course. Would absolutely recommend to another EE student. The material is essential and useful. However, with appropriate background it is fairly easy as it is mostly a review and synthesis of EE 200, some EE202, Laplace transforms (ENAS 194), Fourier Series, and Fourier Transforms. One short pset a week, two non-cumulative exams and one two to three hour lab a week. Labs are actually quite fun as the instructors redesigned the lab this year to make it match the class and you build some really cool things (motor drivers, radio receivers).",
    "A pretty dry class, but the material is pretty important. There's some overlap with EENG 310, so if you are taking them concurrently you won't have to study too much for this class. Overall the teaching was good but you could learn most of the material on your own. Homework was very reasonable and the midterm was fair. The final ended up being a harder than expected. Lab takes about 2 hours on average, which really isn't that bad. They were pretty interesting.",
    "Basically a more in-depth version of the combination of 200 and 202. Lecture and problem sets are very straight forward. Midterm and final not so much. Labs are significantly better than those in 200. The professors really care about the class and are very open to questions and suggestions."
