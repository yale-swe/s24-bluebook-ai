   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students asI believe that information on gender-related issues should be included in the core of most programs.",
    "Gender Theories is the appropriate course if you feel like it is time for you to confront feminist and gender theories. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the centuries-long oppression of women, and the roles that gender(s) play(s) in our society today. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not see the importance of talking about real gender equality.",
    "See question 1 for summary. I would recommend Moira's class to anyone with an interest in feminism, gender, sexuality, marxism, psychoanalysis, Lacan, Foucault, and\/or European intellectual history. The diversity of our group both in geographic and disciplinary terms (we had eight students from seven different countries, three different Yale schools plus Fulbright scholars) attests to the wide-ranging relevance of the course. Although we read few fictional texts, the course's content is immediately applicable to literature and literary theory as well."

    "As I plan to work on 20th-c. literature and literary theory, with special attention to psychoanalysis and sexuality, this course was essential to my research."
