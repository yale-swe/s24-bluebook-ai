   "comments": [
    "Yes, with the caveat that classmates' backgrounds are incredibly diverse and that it's difficult to 'speak the same language'.",
    "AMST 702 is a great introduction to mobility studies with a feminist take on the matter. I would recommend the course to you if you want theadvantage of wielding the mobility lens in your research--you come to understand soon enough that mobility permeates almost every aspect of our lives.",
    "I would say that American Studies 702 provides an introduction to a field of American Studies, mobility paradigms. This paradigm is incredibly multifaceted and encompasses a mutltitude of theoretical frameworks. The class is organized so that two students co-present the weeks readings together, focusing on key questions for the classroom discussion. We write a weekly response and a weekly response following the class. At the end of the semester, we are expected to write a small research paper. The writing encompasses a total of less than 40 pages, which is manageable. I highly recommend taking classes with Professor Grewal, which cares deeply about her students and is very wiling to offer additional guidance through the class and also through grad school.",
    "I would summarize the course as a really fun and exciting theoretical introduction to mobility paradigm in interdisciplinary studies. Coming from a more theoretical and cultural studies background I really enjoyed the theoretical, intersectional, and interdisciplinary analyses aspects of the course. I would definitely recommend it to a student that is interested in looking at cultural theory and mobility in a number of contexts.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend the course. I think this is a good introduction into a wide variety of disciplines. All of the readings were engaging and because the course is cross-listed, it attracts a diverse group of students which makes for stimulating discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Both, a great deal",
    "This class engaged me in a growing part of the field of American Studies. Beginning my classes, I believe it is critical to know the intellectual debates currently within American Studies, to better understand my own position within the field. I believe this overview of the mobility paradigms achieved this goal. The class also allowed me the space to begin to write about JINSA, which I had been previously unaware of. A detailed analysis of this organization's operations may prove to be part of my dissertation.",
    "I think this course helped me explore my research interests and how I want to approach research questions and topics. It help me take intellect risks and explore areas of study I didn't know existed. In that way, I think it helped me deepen my knowledge of the discipline very much and helped me explore my intellectual identity. In those ways, the course helped me think about my dissertation\/research in the sense that it helped me think about the kinds of areas I want to study and how I might contribute to different fields in the future.",
    "I will be able to integrate some of the theory and readings into my dissertation research. It introduced me to a diverse field that I hope to remain engaged with as I continue my studies."
