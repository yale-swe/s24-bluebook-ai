   "comments": [
    "This class is awesome. Take it. You will be totally interested in the material and Professor Rosen is a great person\/teacher.",
    "I would, as it is an important topic that everyone should think about more critically.",
    "This is one of the best courses you will ever take. Brad is amazing. You will not only learn a lot, you will have a lot of fun. The work is totally manageable and very enjoyable. It's just great, it really is.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "A good overview of the implications of evolving technology to privacy. Well taught and very manageable.",
    "This class was really great. I highly recommend taking it. It's perhaps the most entertaining class I've ever taken, and it gives you incredible insight into the nature of privacy in technology. If you're at all interested in law or technology, I highly suggest you take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC 185. You'll get more out of it if you've taken CPSC 183 before, but I wouldn't say it's absolutely necessary. The three computers and the law courses form a very nice sequence, however, and they're all great.",
    "If you can get into this course, I highly recommend taking it. Brad is friendly, thoughtful, and helpful! You will learn a lot and you will get to discuss issues that are literally happening as you are taking the course. You will also get a sense of what it is like to read and evaluate court opinions, which is useful in gauging how interested you are in pursuing law school, if that is on your mind.",
    "Yes, important material and an enjoyable atmosphere to discuss it in.",
    "This is one of the best classes you can take at Yale. Period. This class is hyper-relevant to the world around you and provides you with valuable insight into the analysis and criticism of privacy issues facing our generation's interactions with technology. The workload is fairly light, and can be shifted around to conform to your schedule and stresses very easily. DON'T PUT ALL THE WORK TO THE END! You may feel like you want to, but it can become stressful for you, and you probably won't produce your best work. This is also the most fun you could have while fulfilling a writing credit.The professor, Brad,will be your favorite at Yale, bar none. Besides being a practicing attorney who is extremely knowledge in this subject matter, he also is by far the most engaging and entertaining teacher that I've had at Yale thus far. Known for his wild hand gesticulations as well as his vocal impersonations of Joy Behar and various supreme court justices, you'll love every second of him teaching.If you have little curiosity in the law, technology, or privacy issues, stay away from this class. It is a seminar, and you are expected to contribute actively in discussions and debate. The class is a lot of fun to participate in, and discussions get lively, but if you lack passion or curiosity, it will become pretty apparent. By NO means do you have to be an expert in any of this, but if you have some convictions and opinions, and are open to new ideas, this class will be your favorite at Yale, as it has been for me! Take it!",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the class because the relaxed atmosphere ensured that it was entertaining (e.g. NOT boring at all) and I learned a lot!",
    "Yes, take it if you think about privacy, law, regulation, or the internet, ever, at all.",
    "This class takes a look at the evolving laws and expectations regarding privacy in todays world. The class has a reasonable amount of reading and you actually need to do the reading to be able to participate in class discussions and to write your reading responses. Believe me, you'll actually want to do the work for this class. I highly recommend this class if you need the WR credit or if you are just interested in the subject matter.",
    "Definitely recommend. It will be a very informative (and entertaining!) semester.",
    "This class is what happensto you after you enter the pearly gates and pass St. Peter. In short. And Yes I would recommend it. Absolutely. Walk over hot coals, sell your firstborn child, tattoo a request for class admission form onto your face, buy the provost a small island nation, whatever it takes. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This class is a must. Not only is it relevant and informative, but it is the most fun you will have in a class ever. Honestly. Despite the food and classes outside and jokes, Brad will present the material in such a way that you actually learn. Take it!",
    "Take it. If you have any interest in the material, or just enjoy intellectually stimulating discussions, you will enjoy this class."
