   "comments": [
    "BENG 485 is a once-a-week course that exclusively focuses on neuroimaging (PET, MRI, MRS, fMRI, and so on). Each week there is a lecture on a different topic in neuroimaging, starting with a generalized background and moving into applications toward the end of the course. There is very little work outside of class (midterm paper, final paper, and weekly 1-page summaries of the lectures that are graded for effort). The class is taught with an interesting format, in that after the first 4 or so lectures, each subsequent lecture is prepared and given by a pair of students from the class. The experience isn't overwhelming, and as the class is fairly small, giving the lecture is not very intimidating. Still, I did enjoy learning about my topic and presenting on it to the class. Overall, it's a worthwhile class if you're interested in the material, and to my knowledge there are no prerequisites on either the engineering or neuroscience ends (though basic biology knowledge is helpful), so if you have any desire to learn more about neuroimaging, check out the class.",
    "This class appears to be a lot less work than it really is. The papers 5 page single spaced and 10 page single spaced take much longer than you would think. However, it is a low stress class as there are no tests.",
    "Great class to learn about neuroimaging in a seminar\/mini lecture format.",
    "A great course that is beneficial for people regardless of their background, as the information learned can be applicable for a wide variety of disciplines. Very much enjoyed the course, includes weekly lecture summaries, two large papers, and a class presentation. Pretty low-stress course and got a lot out of it."
