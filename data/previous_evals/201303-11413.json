    "Yes. Interesting class where you learn more than just about language.",
    "Kiswahili is a beautiful, musical language and the Mwalimu Kiarie is a funny and strong teacher. Like any L1 language, you have to be prepared to memorize a lot of vocab (sometimes it is not always clear what vocab is going to be useful for tests and what is just good context for class) and go to class every day. I definitely found the effort worth it. It might be helpful to read a little about the culture\/history of Swahili-speaking countries before or while taking the class because that would give you a good reference for the cultural elements that come up in class and keep you motivated. Exams are straightforward and you learn enough to give a short presentation by the end of the semester.",
    "Absolutely! It is an extremely well taught course."
