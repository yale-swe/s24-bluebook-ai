    "This Chinese class is a lot of work. If you want to do really well in the course, you should probably do multiple hours of homework a day. A lot of this semester is frustratingly formal and doesn't seem that applicable to daily life. There's a strong emphasis on rote memorization and not really room for creativity or anything, but you know that by now if you've been taking Chinese at Yale. I'm glad that I took this course because I really enjoy studying grammar and vocab, but definitely don't take this course just because you took Chinese last semester. Take a look at the different units first and see if they're interesting to you. The teachers are really committed and generally kind, and the class sizes are small.",
    "Typical Chinese language course. You have to put in the work to get anything out of this. Chan and Wang are great - they make class fun and interesting. Most sections only have 5-8 students so definitely worth taking. Daily quizzes and homework, 3 chapter tests, 2 listening exams, one final, and a skit - fair expectations for Chinese."
