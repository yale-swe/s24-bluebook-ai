    "Math 315 is a good second semester of complex analysis. In the class times to number theory are made much more evident. Also the class introduces Riemann surfaces. Giulio is a good lecturer when he is present though we had a sub several times. You learn a lot and the homeworks and final are manageable. I would take again.",
    "If you liked 310, and want to see more, I'd recommend. Some of the theta-function stuff is rather computational, but there's a lot of pretty material.",
    "This course is okay. For most of the semester, it follows Stein & Shakarchi a bit too closely, so you can just read the book in lieu of attending lecture. However, the last part of the course covers Riemann surfaces, which is extremely interesting.",
    "It's a great class if you like 310 and want to learn more. Be prepared for difficult problem sets.",
    "A giant step up from Margulis's 310---not in terms of difficulty but in terms of amount of enjoyment. I felt like I really gained some appreciation of the way complex analysis appears in a ton of different branches of math, from algebraic geometry to number theory to geometry and topology (we hit all of these at one point or another this semester). Also one of the more laid-back math courses I've taken at Yale, with relatively light workload (not necessarily a good thing, since it means you aren't forced to learn the material super well). Giulio is funny and extremely helpful, and lecture was almost always enjoyable---when he was there. When he wasn't (which happened 4-5 times this semester), his substitute was much less inspiring.",
    "I would recommend this class. Cool material, good textbook."
