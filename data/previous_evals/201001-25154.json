   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to game theory. Be prepared for a boring class.",
    "The course is difficult if you are not mathematically\/logically inclined, but its definitely valuable and worth the effort. The concepts you learn are extremely applicable to real life situations and Professor Fox explains things well in class. If you attend the lectures and do the problem sets, it will be very worth your time.",
    "Game Theory as a subject is hard. The lectures were sometimes incomprehensible. The problem sets were hard. But the grading was easy. Take it if you are willing to struggle through the psets and lectures (or have a friend who's good at game theory) in order to get a super easy A.",
    "I recommend this class if you're interested in the material. It's not very heavy in terms of mathematics and does not require any pre-existing knowledge except some simple algebra. Justin Fox is also an awesome teacher, who really cares about students. The class is fairly easy, too, so long as you put some effort toward understanding the material.",
    "It is an interesting topic and the professor cares about his students.",
    "Go for it. I enjoyed it.",
    "Good class, game theory is interesting. Take it if you want to learn more. You should know math through calculus to be optimal for you, but not knowing calc, you'll still probably be OK",
    "It is an introduction to game theory. If you are good at math you will be do well in this course as it is technically rigorous.",
    "The problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but in the end you're almost guaranteed an A. This course should be probably be a QR -- there's a lot of math, but if you like that, definitely take it.",
    "I would not recommend this class - it was too heavy on notation and not enough on applications - the political science part of the course seemed almost tangential. I regret not taking the economics Game Theory class.",
    "Justin Fox is the nicest guy around, and is very thorough in his explanations. The class moves at a relatively slow place, which is appropriate for the audience of the class. His primary concern is making sure everyone understands everything, and for something that builds on itself over the course of the semester as much as game theory, this approach is much appreciated. This is a low-stress way to learn some really awesome material!",
    "Course is an overview of basic game theory material. Despite the name, it's almost all game theory, and little politics. Class is somewhat dry, attendance not entirely necessary. Weekly problem sets, midterm, final, short and easy paper. Worst grade out of midterm, final, and paper gets dropped.",
    "Excellent Game Theory course. I would recommend it. In this course, you will learn how to apply mathematical and logical models to real world situations, and you will learn common techniques for predicting what will happen in real world situations. For example, you create games that model the behavior of voters, political candidates, firms, interest groups, athletes, etc. While the models of this course can be applied to real world situations, this course is not a course on designing models for real world situations. It is a course that mostly gives you the mathematical and logical tools to solve models that have already been created. You will learn about the features that differentiate one type of model from the next, different solution concepts for predicting outcomes in the model, etc. You could do almost all of the work in the course without knowing what the models apply to--just knowing the mathematical and logical concepts. Nevertheless, Professor Fox does a great job of explaining the real world implication. As a result, you infer lots of things about how agents act in various situations. This is a great course.",
    "This is a great class. Especially if you want to learn about game theory but don't have the strongest background in math, this class is really interesting, and it approaches the subject with practical, applicable examples. The professor and TF made the material unintimidating, and I would definitely recommend this class to another student, particularly those in poli sci, EPE, or IS.",
    "Take this if you wish to learn game theory, but are not totally confident with your background in rigorous math.",
    "I'd recommend this class as long as you realized that it was still a game theory class, simply with political science applications and examples. The first half of the semester is to teach basic concepts and some advanced stuff is taught in the last few weeks, so you have to pay attention. However, the grading is fair and Professor Fox tries very hard to make sure you understand what's going on. As long asyou're willing to put in the work, you'll be rewarded.",
    "This solutions-focused course will introduce you to the basics of game theory and the most common types of games, as well as to several of their applications. A big problem, though, is that the result of those applications is often either a) an understanding of a basic game that could have been grasped without solving rigorously, or b) a rough understanding of a more complex game, 'minus some math and technicalities.' Even at the end of the course it is unclear what we are now equipped to do with our new knowledge, or whether it can be applied in any useful way.",
    "If you are interested in the topic but not in economics, you should take this course",
    "If you have any interest in game theory, are not scared away by intricate and detailed math problems, and would be interested in studying the application of game theory to a political situation in a paper, definitely take this class. Professor Fox is great."
