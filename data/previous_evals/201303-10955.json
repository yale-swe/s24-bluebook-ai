   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 121 to anyone who has an interest in learning more about art or learning how to write in a new, unique style.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "English 121 was a great course I would definitely recommend it to anyone; it was interesting to learn how to write in a review style (and also challenging, after being so used to analytic academic papers). It was a very interactive class and my favorite class I've taken at Yale people-wiseby far, we had a lot of fun together BUT it was a lot of work - either a paper or draft almost weekly so that would be my only warning. As the papers weren't graded individually (we were only told our average at the midterm point), it was also hard to know how I was doing; but the work itself was rewarding and the class is unique. I would take it again.",
    "Immersion in art criticism and contemporary art, focus on figurative painters, reading and writing criticism, learning from a critic. I would absolutely recommend it, especially to art history majors and others, people who want to look closely at art, and write, and be involved in great discussions about art.",
    "A good way to develop a knowledge of modern art outside of a HSAR course, quickly improves your writing. I wouldrecommend it only if you are interested in this area, otherwise the 75 min class is going to feel very long",
    "A fairly substantial amount of reading and dense, stylized writing--but never an overwhelming amount of work. I had hardly any background knowledge of art history and felt a bit out of the loop at times, but never found it to be a handicap in any way. We took an awesome trip to New York and bonded a ton as a class. I would totally recommend this course to someone with strong opinions and an interest in the contemporary art world.",
    "I met really great people in this class, and I was challenged to think more deeply about the way I write and my word choice. However, the class was a little unorganized (you never get grades but you have tons of assignments) and the professor's deadlines are at very inconvenient times (3 pm on Saturdays and even due in the middle of Thanksgiving break). Also the field trip in the middle of the semester will take all day on a Sunday, it was great because the whole class really bonds, but you will be gone from campus from about 7am-7pm.",
    "professor chooses a few artists, we read and watch films, discuss, write every week and workshop. yes it helped me know what to look for and how to write about art more precisely.",
    "Amazing course. It revolutionized the way I look at and write about art. Prof. Spillane is helpful, knowledgable and well connected in the art world. We even have Jerry Saltz coming to speak in out class! The workload is fine: six short papers and weekly blog, readings and screenings. Take any course that Prof. Spillane teaches. You won't regret it.",
    "I'd highly recommend it -- it's very interesting and not a heavy workload."
