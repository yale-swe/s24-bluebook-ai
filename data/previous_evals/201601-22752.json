    "This is a faculty research seminar that allows junior and senior faculty at other research universities to present early and late stage work to receive feedback from colleagues. I would in general recommend this course to students as a way to gain exposure to new research in our field and meet interesting junior and senior faculty at other departments."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, this semester I am not sure how the seminars deepened my knowledge of the discipline. The speakers and papers were below the quality that I expected for a university of Yale's caliber. The topics covered were also far from my own research interests, so maybe this is in part why I found the seminar not particularly inspiring."
