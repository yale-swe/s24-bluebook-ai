   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about political theory, and the military.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of federalism, democracy, and political theory. The course helped me to peer edit my colleagues' work with an eye towards coherence and logic.",
    "This class really got me to re-examine how I consider political structures and government. I do not usually care for political theory courses, but this one integrated it with real policy questions in a way that I found enlightening.",
    "I honed exegetical skills reading and analyzing political theory in the first half of the course; in the second half of the course, I learned about public policies in different areas.",
    "This course helped me develop critical thinking skills surrounding American political history and institutions, and sharpened my writing ability.",
    "Much more in depth understanding of the underlying design principles behind the American federal system. Improved writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills.",
    "This class was my intro into political theory. I learned how to look at ideas and concepts from many angles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: field trips Steve Bannon readings small class size guests assignments Professor gives lengthy feedback Weaknesses: Essay prompts are very vague- what is an empirical essay? what is a political theory essay? Reading load is a little unrealistically high if you want everyone to read it all every week Steve Bannon seminar was sad, as we never took his ideas seriously and just patted ourselves on the back for being smarter than him",
    "The readings were repetitive at times, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that the workload was so heavy from week-to-week. One more note on the workload: it would serve future students better to spread the readings out over the course of the class instead of front-loading it all simultaneously with a political theory assignment.",
    "The material in American Political Institutions was interesting, but discussion sometimes seemed to drag on. Professor Fotos puts a lot into the class though, and it really shows. He is personable and always there for his students. The second half was when I engaged most with the class.",
    "The course had a large reading load, but the memos really help explain what was most important I do not think that I have ever seen a professor organize material that well ever before. The papers definitely reflected the course as a whole and class was very well managed and engaging. The weekly responses were not onerous and feedback on them greatly helped when writing the papers; a rarity for weekly responses in all regards. Guests were integrated incredibly well into the course. The main complaint is too much Ostrom, the primary author in the readings for the first half of the course. I understand that his works create a foundation for later parts of the course, but more voices would definitely make the course more well-rounded. Particularly theorists in opposition to Ostrom. King did this in part, but more of that would have elevated the course to one of the best I have seen in the political science department.",
    "This course is strong in how it both examines issues in depth, and has a pretty wide breadth of topics. A weakness is that the reading is designed to be skimmed--based on both the quantity assigned and the approach the professor takes to it. However, the quantity of reading does seem necessary for the wide range of topics covered.",
    "The structure of the course is effective in first teaching students the foundational theory that we need to know in order to understand the more interactive second half of the course. Likewise, it makes sense to have two papers -- one on theory and one empirical -- to mirror this structure.",
    "Very well done. Would love a tad more lecturing from the professor to improve our fundamental understanding, but no major weaknesses at all.",
    "I really enjoyed the way the class was organized. There is a lot of reading and intense discussion in the beginning and then it gives way to real world application of the concepts learned."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this class. The field trips, guests, and small class size make the class truly special. I often mention the class to friends and family in conversation. Seminar discussion felt awkward, particularly in the first half of the course. I am not sure if I am just not used to political theory, but the questions professor asked us I never really knew how to engage with. While I didn't always love the class, I do think it is one of the most memorable I have taken at Yale.",
    "If you are a political scientist, absolutely. It has a professor that is actually a fantastic teacher. Additionally, it is one of the only classes at Yale in the political science department to even consider policy. Some of the readings are a bit much, but the professor guides you through what warrants a close read and what is skimmable. Ultimately, if you are looking for a class to shape how you consider government or just a seminar that is well-considered and not dull, this is a must.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Fotos is very dedicated and helpful. The political theory readings are a lot of fun, and Professor Fotos guides discussions well. The policy readings are usually interesting, and the guest lectures were pretty relaxed, which was nice when late springs at Yale are so busy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in U.S. history and political theory. It's definitely not a continuation of Constitutional Law or another such course, and it doesn't promise to be, but I found it helpful to have a foundational knowledge of U.S. political history before taking the course.",
    "Yes. Incredible professor, interesting material, great field trips; what's not to love?",
    "I have already recommended this seminar to other students!"
