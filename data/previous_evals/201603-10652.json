    "None. Honestly most of this class was just plug and chug into equations we got out of the textbook.",
    "It's basic stat",
    "An introduction to probability and statistics, as described in the syllabus.",
    "Dry but good overview of probability and statistics. Started from scratch and feel confident about the material now.",
    "After this course I feel like I can solve most of the problems but have very little understanding of the actual theory behind the calculations. Realistically, most of the knowledge was gained outside of the classroom.",
    "Econometrics!",
    "Theoretical introduction with few applications or coding.",
    "Techniques in probability, different probability distributions, statistical analysis tools, data analysis techniques",
    "I already knew fair bit about statistics but this class teaches you the theory and proofs behind it. Though you won't need that for the test necessarily.",
    "Not much, just basic stats that was mostly a review of AP stats and the probability was all review.",
    "An extensive introduction to probability and statistical concepts",
    "A basis of statistics in preparation for econometrics.",
    "Probabilities. Test hypotheses. What statisticians do with uncertainties",
    "i learned mathematical probability and statistics",
    "An understanding of basic probability and some application to economics",
    "ECON135, for most students, is the required stepping stone to ECON136. To its credit, it likely prepares students well to continue their studies in Econometrics. Indeed, the probability and statistics learned in ECON135 undoubtedly has much wider application to other fields that use data analysis from probability and statistics. The course's best feature could be that it does not assume prior knowledge yet offers a strong foundation that could lead to further study. The most beneficial information, skills, and insights from ECON125 could be classified as useful. The processes, methodologies, and formulas are practical, and one can easily imagine the many circumstances they could be put into operation. Discrete distributions, continuous distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing accompany are just a few of those tools. Often the purpose of the course's more theoretical explorations were to arrive at one of these particular insights. At the same time, the course could not be called a revelatory experience. The insights might come across as shrewd but never seem profound. Indeed, moving through the material seems like the chugging along with one immense, interlocking mechanism. Perhaps there are students who enjoy such calculations where the thought upon completing a problem is a precise characterization of statistical data in one way or another. It is a straightforward class in the mathematical foundations of probability, statistics, and econometrics.",
    "I was able to learn about the basics of probability and statistics, and how to use the basic tools to understand linear regression.",
    "I learned a lot but only from the textbook. Armstrong is not great at explaining concepts. However, he is a super nice guy and means well.",
    "This course on Probability and statistics basically taught me simple statistics concepts like Hypothesis testing, Confidence Interval and Regression."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Boring lectures Boring material Problem sets were too easy Strengths: Great TA",
    "The course is basic stat for econ\/math majors, so you're in it because you have to. The textbook is good, which is great because the professor is horrible. As someone who went to every class before the midterm, I did better after when I just read the textbook. Tim is terrible; he can't get say a single sentence without stuttering (counted one class: 28 ums in 5 min. Had to stop counting.), and takes hours to get through a small amount of course material. Class is useless, and I'm someone who has always attended classes before this one.",
    "We spent too long seeing algebraic derivations (i.e. excessive algebra scrawled on the board) and not enough time discussing the concepts in their greater context. The detailed proofs can easily be seen in the textbook, and it would've been more valuable to learn in class how to connect the concepts throughout the course.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was definitely organization. We followed the schedule exactly, exam guidelines were extremely clear, and multiple practice exams were posted well in advance. I appreciate this. However, there has to be a better way to engage and better convey the material during lecture. I didn't understand anything until trying to figure it out myself outside of class.",
    "Strengths: clear material, GREAT textbook",
    "Need to redesign the midterm and final. 14 questions making up 80% of one's grade without partial credit is a bit much.",
    "Strengths: well structured, very fair assessment of knowledge gained Weaknesses: more case studies would help make the content more interesting",
    "The lecture is pretty dry, but the material itself isn't that interesting.",
    "Professor Armstrong lectured straight out of the textbook. Making his own examples and explanations instead of repeating the book would be more helpful.",
    "Much of the lectures were just repeats of what were in the book, without as much further explanation of concepts and intuitions.",
    "Strength: Covers essential material Weakness: Not an exceptional course by any means. Very much a transfer of information.",
    "There were almost no strengths, and the main weakness was the professor's lack of engagement with the class. Also, the curve is deflationary.",
    "I wish the course could be more fun but I guess it's statistics so there's not much he could have done about it. Perhaps more paradoxical examples that shows how counterintuitive stats can be?",
    "the class is boring because the subject of probability and statistics itself is boring. it follows that fundamentally changing the field of probablility and statitics to make it less boring will make this class less boring.",
    "The strengths of the course would have to be its practicality and large-scale applicability. The course gives the impression of covering what will be necessary or could be necessary in social science or the sciences. Often in the course, the theory informs methods and methods give rise to practical applications, and it repeats. The prevailing benefit to students is by the end they have a series of statistical instruments that could be employed to analyze data, and they have the theoretical background or basis to fully understand the results. (Unlike some, I think the time spent on theory, in comparison to ECON131, is a strength.) The weakness of the course could probably be summed up by its indistinguishability from a textbook. The progression and animation of the course always seems at about textbook pace and consistency. But perhaps such resemblance is inherent in the subject. And, of course, this is a particularly useful textbook, one that should be necessary reading in preparation for later courses. There are two other caveats to this analogy as well: first Professor Armstrong is always apt and helpful in answering questions asked in class or out of class, and, second, Professor Armstrong does guide the course well by distinguishing what is important and what is often extraneous. The challenge is figuring out how the course could be improved, given the nature of the subject. My one suggestion would be to try and find some more dynamism to enliven the lectures. Perhaps using some more examples or mixing up the lecture format occasionally? As a final note, I want to add one last strength, in that the course is well structured. And by the time of review (for which Professor Armstrong leaves ample time), the sense is that students could have a substantial amount of knowledge to apply in the areas of probability and statistics.",
    "The lecture style was not the best, as I felt like it was just an enumeration of facts and formulas rather than an insightful explanation of what we should be learning.",
    "More practice problems in class. More intuition for sure.",
    "Since lectures hewed so closely to the book they felt a little superfluous. I certainly learned the material, but at times I would have appreciated more proofs \/ mathematical rigor (although maybe this is just a different intro stats class?)"

   "comments": [
    "If you are an econ\/math major, you have no choice. But I definitely would not recommend this course to someone simply interested in learning statistics. It was INCREDIBLY boring and the lectures were hands down the worst I've experienced at Yale so far.",
    "Professor Armstrong is terrible but you have to take this for your major, so read the textbook and you'll be fine despite hating the waste of time that is this class.",
    "This course is solid and not excessively difficult if you really use the textbook, but lectures are very boring. Only take it to fulfill a requirement or prerequisite (e.g. for ECON 136) if you're actually interested in experiencing an intro to statistics, take 238 or 240.",
    "Take it only if you need to for a major. If you just want to learn probability and statistics, then go to another class.",
    "To be fair the subject matter itself is pretty dry but obviously it's necessary to have an introduction to statistics for many courses\/majors.",
    "Yes if you need it for the major",
    "Necessary to take. Could be improved.",
    "Yes, this course gives you a good grasp on the fundamentals in probability and statistics techniques and is not going to increase your workload too much.",
    "This is required for Math\/Econ so if you have to take it, take it. Otherwise it isn't the most interesting, but it's not that hard. The curve is just really tough because people get 100%s on tests. Sit close to the front of the class because Tim has small handwriting and it's impossible to see.",
    "It's required for econ-math major but other than that it's a painful course. Stats is boring and Armstrong literally just writes up examples from the textbook on the board, rendering lecture fairly useless.",
    "Most everyone in the course was an Econ\/Math or an Applied Math major. If this isn't you, I would not recommend this course.",
    "No, I would not, unless there is a better professor.",
    "If someone wants to learn stats rigorously, take 241\/242 sequence. If someone wants to study as much theory as possible without really understanding it, take this course.",
    "it's decent, just pretty boring material. take it if you need it.",
    "I did not really enjoy the course, I found it exceedingly difficult to make the connection between real world application and the models and theories we learned in class. Not sure if I would recommend this over 131, but would say shop them both.",
    "I took this class only because I had to take it for my major. I must say that it is one of the easier math classes for it. However, this was so poorly taught that it was a constant headache for me and all of my friends. Tim never really taught anything in class and you can get by if you just read the textbook. He is really nice but he just can't teach, or maybe the material is just so terrible no one can make it good. Either way don't take this class unless you have to.",
    "In my perception, the vast majority (if not entirety) of those who take this course are mathematics and economics or applied mathematics majors, or at the least are using ECON135 to be qualified for Econometrics, specifically ECON136. Presumably, the course is a good preparation for ECON136 and so might be the necessary path to the econometrics material. The advantages of the course are its meticulous organization, its focus on practicality (but practicality based in plenty of theory), and its applicability to many situations in the fields of science and social science. The course gives the impression of a semester-long preparation course in data analysis where one is taught successive tools of statistics and probability, and the predominant feeling by the end of the course is that the material will be useful. At the same time, unless a student has particular interest in the subject or immediate applications to which they hope to apply the material, the course (particularly the lectures) can be pretty colorless. With more mathematics than ECON131, the course is straightforward. There are no frills attached. Would I recommend the course? I find it hard to imagine it as a taken elective, unless the student had a particular interest in probability and statistics or the need to understand its methods in preparation for later courses",
    "If you already know some probability and statistics, I would not particularly recommend it, but in the meantime, you do learn a lot about the basics.",
    "No. Only take if it's required.",
    "The material is straight from the textbook. It's easy, but you learn a lot of stats.",
    "If you are an Econ and Math Major, this is a mandatory course. Take it! Even if you are not an Econ & Math major, I would highly recommend taking this class. It is kind of tough though. The exams are not easy. You have to revise a lot outside your classes."
