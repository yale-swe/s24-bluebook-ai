   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in behavioral economics and game theory. A healthy mix of lecture and research, although the way it's structured now is a little difficult to sit through. Dr. Rand is smart and passionate. You conduct your own study at the end, so be prepared for that.",
    "definitely take it. really chill workload and interesting topic. the games in class were fun.",
    "I learned a lot about how economic games can influence cooperation. There's a lot of game theory. Knowledge concerning the readings and what you learn in class is tested by two problem sets, a midterm, and a final project. The problem sets were doable, especially if you cooperated with others, but the midterm was very hard. Perhaps that will change in the future, but the problem sets weren't adequate preparation for the midterm. The final project, for which you can work in groups up to 3, was challenging yet rewarding. Creating a valid and credible experimental design is the hardest parts, and then you just have to analyze your results and write up a research paper. I recommend this class, despite the 3hour time slot, because Dave and Matt were both helpful and engaging, and you learn a lot on a not-stressful topic.",
    "Absolutely! Fun, interesting way to learn tools for studying social decisions. Workload is not too bad. Opportunity to perform a research project is great. Professor is funny and good at teaching.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Awesome class with an awesome professor. Good introduction to independently designing studies..",
    "A lot of the class is about David Rand's research, which can get dull. You get class time to work on the final project, which is nice.",
    "Students who are interested in decision-making, social psychology, behavioral economics, game theory, or an interdisciplinary study of any of those things will be really happy to have this new offering in the psych department's \"research methods\" course offerings. While it is newer and less organized than the other research methods classes, it still offered a great peek into this new domain of research. Lectures were interesting, the problem sets and midterm were quite enjoyable if I daresay, and the research project at the end of the semester was a great way to have a first taste of psych research. With the research project, I would have appreciated more anticipatory direction, rather than retroactive direction (clear guidelines\/detailed suggestions\/informative examples prior to each stage of the project would have been better than comments after we completed each stage of the project telling us what we did wrong\/how we could improve). But other than a very loose organization and sometimes unstructured timeline, I really enjoyed my experience in this course. The 3 hour-long class time really didn't feel like 3 hours at all.",
    "An opportunity to learn about research in social decision making, including risk aversion, economic games, and other related concepts. I'd say the first half of the course was almost exactly half research on these economic concepts (through the midterm, which was actually fairly difficult, can't lie about that), and the latter half was all on the facilitation of your experiment."
