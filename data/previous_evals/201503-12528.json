    "It's a good course and Lorca is wonderful but you have to really love Spanish and especially poetry to take the course.",
    "Absolutely take it! I took Spanish 4 last semester as a non-native speaker and was very intimidated by the fact that I had never read and poetry or plays in Spanish and had never even heard of Lorca. I was hooked on the first class. Professor Valis's enthusiasm is contagious, and you will find yourself drawn into Lorca's fascinating world and imagination. The three 2-3 page papers are fun to write, and while the longer 8-10 page paper at the end seems daunting, it's perfectly manageable if you give yourself enough time, and it's actually really satisfying to see the finished product. I always looked forward to coming to this class, and the readings were interesting rather than a chore. I left the last class genuinely sad that I wouldn't be able to Professor Valis talk about Lorca anymore.",
    "General studies of the works of Federico Garcia Lorca.",
    "Really good class. Professor Valis is extremely passionate about Lorca that made this class great. I've never been very excited about poetry but somehow studying Lorca's poetry was fascinating. Besides reading there are three short essays, a presentation, and a final paper. All in spanish but totally doable. If you need to take an L5, take this one!",
    "I'd highly recommend this class, especially if you like Spanish literature! I'd say that it does require a relatively high level of proficiency in Spanish, since there are several papers and the readings are of a high level. The readings can be really short or really long, and they can often be very difficult, so this class isn't necessarily a gut, but it definitely assigns less work than other classes. I over all really enjoyed the class!",
    "This is a great course on the works of Federico Garca Lorca. There were some native speakers in the course but the majority were not, and both participated a lot in class discussions. Workload is moderate in terms of readings and there are 3 short papers (2-3 pages) and a long one (7-10 pages), as well as a mid-term exam. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to read and learn about Lorca.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student as it offers a comprehensive study of Lorca and provides a stimulating environment of discussion and thought.",
    "It is everything you have ever wanted to know about Federico Garcia Lorca. EVERYTHING. You really have to love him to take the class and thoroughly enjoy it. There were some films shown that were slightly unrelated to FGL, but they were still useful for understanding his work. So you don't talk about all FGL all the time, but the class really is about him.",
    "SPAN 324 is a fascinating class. If you're interested in Lorca, up for a challenge, and willing to work really hard, take it. Prof. Valis is amazing, she is so incredibly passionate about the material and makes class really enjoyable. Our TF Jos was wonderful as well, and super helpful. That being said, as a freshman who was placed into L5 after getting a 5 on the AP Test, I found the class very difficult and at times very overwhelming. The material was very challenging, both on a textual and on a conceptual level, and it took me forever to get through, so I often found it very hard to keep up with the amount of reading expected due for each class, particularly with the workload from my other classes. The class is also filled with mostly native speakers, so if like me you feel like speaking is your weakest area, just know that discussion clips by incredibly quickly. However, if you are up for a challenge and are interested in the material, take the class.",
    "This is a solid course, and I would recommend if you are interested in poetry but do not have much knowledge or prior love of Lorca. Professor Valis is passionate and knowledgeable about her subject. It seems to me that she has a plan, day to day. That is, besides the writing assignments this is not a class that greatly expands your critical or interpretative frameworks as much as it is an opportunity to encounter the professor's (often compelling!) readings of Lorca's work.",
    "Incredible class! Interesting lectures (and some discussion) led by Professor Valis. She will weave ideas together in really incredible ways. Take this class if you are interested in Spanish literature, or really just literature in general.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you're looking for a good Spanish L5 class that focuses on literature. Lorca's work and biography are extremely fascinating and professor Valis's teaching does it great justice. She makes the classes really engaging and interesting! The course gives a great overview of Lorca's work and does a great job at contextualizing it in his time period and also in relation to his death. I also enjoyed the readings that were not by Lorca to see how other authors have interpreted his persona and his work. The assignments are not tough and for a high-level language class the workload is most likely less than average.",
    "Thorough introduction to the work of Federico Garcia Lorca. Focus on literary themes and criticism rather than solely improvement of speaking\/grammar. Without a doubt will be recommending this class."
