   "comments": [
    "The course is okay. Much of it rests on students drawing from personal anecdotes or shaky examples to discuss loosely-supported theories.",
    "Excellent readings covering both history and theory expose students to a new side of studying China, regardless of those students' prior experience in the subject matter. The class discussion is very interesting, particularly considering the diverse backgrounds of the students in the class, but at times more structure might have been appreciated.",
    "Take it if you're interested in China and its variety of social issues and have the discipline to really sit down and engage with the readings. It's not a lot of work-- a few articles a week (never over 100 pages of reading), one paper outline, one presentation of said outline, a final paper (15+ pages), and class participation.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the various social factors in China that influence government decision-making. A lot of the readings in this class are very interesting.",
    "If you're interested in learning more about Chinese politics, particularly protest movements and the Chinese government's responses to them, then you should consider taking this. The course readings are very interesting and there is a shortage of classes on Chinese politics.However, keep in mind that Professor Weiss won't add much to the class. She has students do presentations and then just sits back and lets them lead the discussion without contributing many of her own insights. This is a shame, because she's clearly very knowledgeable about China and the way that Chinese politics affect China's actions within the international system. She won't make your life difficult, but she also won't go out of her way to help you understand the material or develop a topic for your final paper.",
    "the readings are interesting... but the classroom experience needed more structure",
    "This seminar is driven by student participation. Do not expect much professorial direction. The readings are good, and the course is pretty comprehensive considering the broad subject.",
    "Yes, if you are really interested in contemporary Chinese politics.",
    "You end up reading some interesting and provocative stuff, but the seminars turn into lectures, and then not even by the professor but by the students, who have to lead the class in turns in the professor's place. The professor also seems distant from the students and uninterested in their intellectual development. Probably think twice about taking this course."
