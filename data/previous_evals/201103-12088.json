    "interesting class on latin america. I'd recommend taking it with some prior knowledge of the region's politics.",
    "Don't take it. Its not an interesting as it sounds and the grading is very tough.",
    "It is a basic and very useful overview of some of the political themes in Latin America's state formation process. The case studies on Peru, Mexico and Chile are very interesting and give you a chance to apply information from the previous, more theory intensive readings. It will be harder to understand the class if you dont have much of a background in Latin American history, but it is possible to learn and follow along.",
    "The class goes through some founding theories of democratic transition, which was helpful. The case studies were also interesting. That being said, don't expect to get a ton of info about the individual case studies. I also never really got the hang of the papers - longer than a normal reading responses but shorter than a real paper.",
    "Lectures can get a bit monotonous, overall the material is solid though. I'm a poli sci student that specifically wanted to learn about the politics of the region -- ultimately this course helped me do that.",
    "If you are interested in Latin America and the conditions that have influenced their transitions from dictatorships to democracies and vice versa, this is a great class and well worth the early wake up. However, if you're looking for a history class on Latin America, this isn't it. The first half of the class focuses on theories behind transitions to democracy and the second half focuses on case studies of Mexico, Chile and Peru. The reading load isn't too bad and you have three 2pg reading responses, a midterm, and a final exam.",
    "Don't take it if you already have some background in the area -- it'll be very repetitive and boring.",
    "Take this course. Professor Stokes is very knowledgeable and a good lecturer. The workload is manageable and you learn a lot about the contemporary political trends in Latin America. An awesome small lecture class.",
    "If you want to learn about the basics of Latin American political systems you've got yourself the right class, but don't expect to go much further than that. We looked at case studies of Mexico, Peru, and Chile. These countries have gone through revolutionary changes in the last 50 years but this class only looked at political parties and elections. We read one article on the rebellion in Chiapas and that was that. Nevertheless, the politics is extremely important. Just know what you are signing up for.",
    "No, I didn't like the approach. Too biased and quantitative.",
    "If you're able to wake up early in the morning, have a real passion for Latin America but don't know too much about it, and have a passion for political science, then this class is for you. There is a very heavy focus on theories of democratization and succession, and they dominate the class at the expense of detail in the case studies. Professor Stokes has a rather conservative approach to Latin American politics, and may not be the most engaging lecturer, even though if you pay attention in lectures you will learn the material.",
    "waking up at 9 is always a little tough and the class was kinda boring so no.",
    "Focus on case studies",
    "I would recommend this class only to students who are interested in learning about:-Mexican, Chilean, and Peruvian Politics-Political Theory-Econometrics",
    "It was always rough getting up at 9 a.m., but I think the course was worth it. Take it if you are willing to make the effort to attend every class session. You don't want to miss out on any of the material."
