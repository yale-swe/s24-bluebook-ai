   "comments": [
    "This is a model seminar - plenty of discussion, great readings, and a world-class professor at the helm. You also have a chance to write a serious historical research paper, which is intense but a worthwhile experience. Although Professor Freeman has limited availability (she's famous), she makes time to meet with students and I felt sufficiently supported with feedback and revisions throughout the writing process. Also, you end up learning so much more about the period than perhaps it seems during any given seminar meeting - the sum is much greater than its parts.",
    "Definitely recommend. This is not the most amazing seminar during the two hours each week, but you will overall get a lot out of it. Because the seminar is based on all primary sources (hundreds of pages a week), it's pretty easy for people in the class to BS and for class to get side-tracked away from the information. There's also not a lot of information taught in the class, which is not necessarily a problem, but it means that background information is secondary to the themes. It's also not as much about the themes of the period as it is actually about Hamilton and Jefferson's personalities and philosophies, even though the syllabus says otherwise (or at least said otherwise when we signed up). That said, the two hours of class are fun and interesting, even if they're not as substantive. BUT (keep reading! this is where the class gets good!!), Professor Freeman reads a FULL DRAFT of your research paper and line-edits it. This means that you are truly working on this paper for two to three months, and it is a pleasant paper-writing experience. It also will teach you how to write and think about primary sources so much better. I think this class is definitely worth it, but it's not the most unmissable history seminar at Yale.",
    "An examination of the lives of Hamilton and Jefferson by reading their letters. I personally was obsessed with this course, however there are a few caveats. The more you know about the time period, the more you will get out of it, so it is not a class that you should take in order to learn more about the period, but rather to expand your understanding of it. Also, you need to be interested in Hamilton and\/or Jefferson. However, Prof Freeman is an incredible professor who is dedicated to improving her students' writing--she takes the time to line-edit your essays!",
    "This is easily one of the best history seminars Yale offers. Professor Freeman is super enthusiastic and has a ton of interesting or silly stories to tell, but she certainly allows the conversation to flow naturally. The 20 page paper seems intimidating, but it's actually an incredibly rewarding experience and Professor Freeman ensures that you keep on track and complete it in a timely fashion. Overall a fantastic course perfect for anyone interested in a close examination of Hamilton or Jefferson - you'll learn to love both in their own way!",
    "If you are interested in this period I would definitely recommend the course. It is very interesting and you get great tools for working with primary sources and writing a research paper.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I suggest taking another course on early American history prior, so that you have a strong background understanding of the period. I'd also recommend not taking it during the semester that you're writing your senior essay.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Even if you have no background in the founding period (like me) you'll have an amazing time with professor Freeman, and get to know all the ins and outs of Hamilton and Jefferson through their letters. Freeman is a boss.",
    "An absolutely fantastic history seminar. Over the course of the semester, you might find, like me, that you don't necessarily love \"great men\" history, but Professor Freeman's exceptional seminar-leading skills more than make up for that. Her stories are incredible and you will learn SO much. Plus, the students in this seminar are very engaged, and the conversations are great.",
    "This is an incredible class. You should take it. The primary source approach to understanding history is (surprisingly) unusual in history seminars that I've taken, and I loved being able to understand historical figures through their own words. Professor Freeman is the highlight of the class. She is an encyclopedia of knowledge about the Revolutionary Period, and was always pulling out interesting anecdotes from her research. She also gave more feedback on our paper drafts than I have received from any other professor in my four years at Yale, which I really appreciated."
