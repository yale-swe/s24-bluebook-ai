   "comments": [
    "Strengths - covers a wide variety of useful and practical informationWeaknesses - sometimes too much information crammed into one class",
    "I enjoyed the course. It was a nice introduction to clinical trials, their design, data collection, and analysis. We talked about current trials which were in the news and evaluated them for strengths and weaknesses which was a nice skill to develop. The homework assignments were a nice way to make sure we kept up to date with the course material.At times the course was very heavy on statistics, and I didn't always feel like the homework reflected what we had discussed in class.",
    "This class had high and low points. I do feel that I have learned a lot of new information. However, the course was repetitive toward he end when Dr. Makuch's attention was split when he was hosting the Chinese FDA visitors. This class should also have an associated lab that teaches the SAS codes required for homework problems and exams.",
    "The fundamentals of clinical trials was a very interesting class that allowed students to understand the basics of the process. We learned the statistical methods involved in the process.",
    "very good course for anyone interested in getting to know the basics and a little beyond about clinical trials.",
    "Great overview of clinical trials and how to do statistical analyses of major designs. Homework is extremely valuable in preparation for the exams. Professor and TA seem a bit disorganized.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures very much. I also felt that the main text used for the course was clearly written and served as a nice complement to the lectures. Perhaps the other articles that were required for the course could have been better incorporated into the class. I also enjoyed discussing relevant topics in current clinical trials that came up in the news (eg. the HIV vaccine trial from Thailand).",
    "This was an incredibly useful class. Any student considering a career in research should take it. It actually provided valuable skills and Dr. Makuch clearly has extensive experience in the field and was able to give great information from these personal experiences.It was a GREAT class.",
    "The material in the course is well presented and clear to follow. The instructor keeps the entire class time interesting and provides real-life and current examples to illustrate the concepts. Homework is a good representation of concepts covered on the midterm and final. Overall, a very good course.",
    "The course started out great however it devolved into a survival analysis class with a primary focus on statistics. There is a separate class on survival analysis - BIS 540 did not need to place such emphasis on it. I think it detracted a lot from the class, as the final parts of clinical trials (analysis, etc) where not discussed in class.",
    "strengths: topic and structure of information coveredweakness: structure of assignments and feedback",
    "I enjoyed this course. The class was interesting, and the material was useful. I think often there was a slight mismatch between the material we learned in the class and our homework, however both were manageable. For improvements, I would recommend having a general TA session before each test to review homework material that may not be adequately covered in the classroom setting. Some of the readings were particularly difficult, so also review of some of the more technical biostats readings briefly in class or in a general review session would be helpful to improve overall understanding of the course.",
    "Very good",
    "?Really interesting material during the first half, and then went downhill as the semester went on. The last couple of classes where Dr. Makuch just ripped apart studies were completely useless.\u0095Lecture had nothing to do with homework, which had nothing to do with exams. The midterm sucked, but it was nothing compared to the final. A note: in every single HW assignment, we were given, through SAS output, the numbers that he had us calculate by hand on the final. We had only a couple of formulas, which we never talked about (we never talked about anything quantitative in class!), never saw examples of, etc., and the FINAL is the first time we\u0092re ever asked to do this??? Are you kidding??? Dr. Makuch said over and over that the HW was supposed to prepare us for the exams. NEWS FLASH: THEY DID NOT AT ALL!!!!!! I came out of the final completely infuriated, feeling unbelievably stupid (knowing that there were people in the class that figured out, and I couldn\u0092t\u0085) and LIVID.\u0095I don\u0092t know if he even saw the HW assignments. I don\u0092t know who wrote them. I have no idea of Fu-Chi ever talked with Dr. Makuch, it was the most disconnected mess of disorganization that I have ever seen. Nothing had anything to do with anything else.\u0095IT IS FLAT-OUT NOT FAIR TO MAKE MATERIAL TOTALING HALF OF THE POINTS ON A TEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN OR DONE!!! 10 points, OK, that\u0092s fine. Push us a bit. But seriously, you set us up for failure.\u0095Fine, everyone will get an HP or H. Thank God for that. But perhaps you didn\u0092t need to make us feel like total shit b\/c we couldn\u0092t do the problems in the first place.\u0095The articles are completely POINTLESS. Nearly all of us are not statistically-oriented enough to understand them.",
    "Strength: It was a good chance for me to have basic and overall knowledge about clinical trials. I would recommend the course to my friends.Weakness: But there were some parts, which the teacher skipped the enough explanation and went ahead to the higher level.",
    "Strengths: good class with practical information. A professor who has been working in this field for over 25+ years taught us, and that is great!Weaknesses: During the 2nd part of the semester, the homework assignments focused on using the SAS software. When the final exam came, we were unable to apply statistical methods to hand-calculate some of the questions.",
    "The course lacked substance and structure because it appeared that the professor was not invested in the course. I would have liked to learn more about the application of statistics learned in the course. I believe he attempted to do that but it felt too much like an informal conversation and less like a lecture.",
    "Strengths - Dr. Makuch is an expert in the field and he thoroughly entertained the class with interesting materialWeaknesses - some of the lecture seemed disjointed and the readings were too technical (papers) and over my head",
    "Strengths - It gave a good beginning insight into clinical trials and various methods used.Weaknesses - The material could have been organized into a more cohesive fashion that flowed together better.",
    "2nd half of the course did not seem as organized and focused as the first half.",
    "strength - elaborate detail provided by the professor in classweaknesses - lack of structure.",
    "I thought this class was very useful and interesting for someone who wants to know more about the clinical trials and pharmaceutical drugs. However, the class was very disorganized in terms of administration. On classes v2, the folders\/lectures are mislabelled. It took me awhile to figure out and organize my binder because the syllabus didn't match the dates and lectures that were posted classes v2."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch shared from his own experiences with clinical trials. It was nice to get a feel for all that's involved in trials and to understand some of the politics surrounding them. He also covered a variety of topics relating to data collection, analysis, etc. and really wants students to understand some of the aspects of trials which you don't learn about in books.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is an excellent teacher.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a good resource on clinical trials and knows the material well. He is a great professor when you can find him to answer questions as he is a walking encyclopedia of clinical trials information. One criticism is that his lectures are often very scattered and repetitive as he tends to discuss whatever is currently on his mind and skims through powerpoint slides that students are later responsible for on the midterm and final. Also, he does not regularly attend his own office hours.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a fantastic professor - he has a great command of statistics and how the real world functions in terms of FDA regulation and study design and execution. I also appreciated his vignettes and personal stories during the semester - it made the course very interesting!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Makuch's lectures. They were informative and his anecdotes served as a unique was to get across his main ideas. Professor Makuch was approachable, and I felt that the tests were fair overall.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Incredible. Dr. Makuch was perhaps the best instructor that I have had at EPH. He made difficult material understandable and has a great sense of humor. He obviously loves teaching and enjoyed being in class. I appreciated that on a day that he had to miss he offered to cover the material outside of class- I think it is very frustrating when professors just cancel classes.Truly a wonderful professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor keeps the entire class time interesting and provides real-life and current examples to illustrate the concepts. He is enthusiastic about the course and always willing to help outside of class and answer questions during class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Obviously the professor is very knowledgable and has much field experience. The lectures which used real cases from the FDA-approval etc were excellent and really served to drive home key points.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0great personality which was helpful in conveying the information confidently, but could possibly spend more time in developing insight on some of the topics, ie tying in the readings into the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I really enjoyed this professor. I feel he had a lot to contribute as a result of his experience in the field, and he shared those experiences willingly. I also enjoyed his teaching style because he primarily taught through real world examples, making the course and material even more relevant. I think he was very fair in his homework and exams, though could do a little more coverage of some difficult technicalsubjects in class after exams.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very experenced in this subject",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good lecturer, very dynamic, clearly smart, didn\u0092t mind going to lecture until the end. But...see above answer to what I thought of the class. I don't think he had any idea of what was going on with this class outside of lecture.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Strength: the way he teaches is very concise, and straight-forward. He introduced different backgrounds of people, which I think is helpful for networking.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Strengths: the professor kept lecture interesting and fun, bringing in current eventsWeaknesses: he should have emphasized hand-calculations of certain statistical methods rather than given us homework questions that involved SAS, especially when we are asked to hand-calculate answers on the final exam. We knew how to work the problems out on SAS but did not know how to calculate the responses by hand.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Did not appear too invested in the course. Seemed like he may have not prepared the material to the level in which he could have.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Provided excellent examples from real clinical trials and broke down all the analysis and flaws of the data",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Interesting lecturer",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0strengths and weaknesses are same as above",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0It was one of my favorite classes because the professor was very knowledgeable in this field\/subject. However, I think he should learn how to prioritize his time. He would talk about an example\/case in the pharmaceutical industry in thorough detail but rushes through the theory that was important for our exams."

    "The TA was generally helpful and available for help outside of class.",
    "Went through last powerpoint too quickly and not too responsive to emails.",
    "Ienjoyed the lecture she gave.",
    "This is my 7th year in higher education and Fu-Chi is by far the worst TA that I have ever worked with.She does not attend class so it took about a month and a half of the semester to figure out who she was. Then, she does not answer emails for weeks at a time. Also, homework problems were rarely posted on classesv2 more than 24 hours from their due date. She also was not available for questions for over half of the semester as her office hours were not posted until 2 days before the midterm.The lecture that she gave the week before Thanksgiving was one of the worst I've ever attended. First, the slides were designed for a 2 hour class and she sped through them in 35 minutes. Second, when asked questions about the material on the slides she did not know the answers, said they were not her slides, and that we should just look up the answers after class on our own.Bottom line: I would never pay her to be a TA again and I hope she does not go into academia as a Professor because her students will be incredibly frustrated and wasting their time.",
    "The TA was not very involved in the course except for checking to see if students finished their assignments. She taught one lecture, but it was very hard to understand her.",
    "TA was always available. But the paper grading was not very good- did not get good explanations for the rights and wrongs.",
    "Fu-Chi HseihVery responsive to e-mail, but disorganized with homework grading\/returning and absent in the semester.",
    "I felt that the TA for this course could have communicated more with the students in terms of specifying when she was available for office hours. The homeworks were also given back sporadically throughout the semester and the answers to the homeworks were not posted at consistent times.On the day that the TA gave the lecture in class, I felt that she should have spoken slower so that students were able to follow along better.",

    "The TA was weak and her lectures were useless.",
    "if only i knew her...",
    "I met with Fu-chi before the midterm and the final exam and found her extremely helpful. She was very responsive, and if she didn't know a way to frame an answer to a question, would check with the teacher and get back to me immediately.",
    "Fu-Chi was very nice, and it was easy to set up an appointment with her. I think the problem is that she's just too advanced at statistics, and had a hard time explaining things at a more basic level.",
    "Terrible. Regardless of her linguistic problem, she is very negligent in responding to the request of the students. For example, I sent her an email asking about the final the day before, but there wasn't response at all.",
    "Strengths: very friendly and prompt via emailWeaknesses: the one day that theTA taught, it was very difficult to understand her and follow her throughout the slides.",
    "I attended almost all class sessions and turned in almost all of my homework assignments and never even saw or met the TA.",
    "The TA was very helpful and willing to meet with you anytime outside of class to explain the information.",
    "The TA was unresponsive to my e-mail. I never met her until after Thanksgiving break when she gave a lecture which lasted about 45 minutes, and all she did was read from the slides.",
    "The TA only came in once. I had difficulty understanding her English and the equations she presented.",
    "I did not know who our TA was and she does not offer office hours at all.When she taught one class she did not seem to know the material that well and just through up a bunch of equations on the board. Even though the lecture she taught us was not the focus of the course she just rushed through the material."

    "I would recommend this course as a great foundation for clinical trials. This is a quantitative rather than a qualitative course and biostatistics is emphasized. SAS will be utilized. The course overall is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend with reservations. As mentioned above, the class started on strong, but really lost its strength withthe survival analysis emphasis. Also, the exams were not completely representative of the course material. The book was good. The professor is overall excellent.",
    "a very helpful course in understanding the statistics involved in clinical trials. great for having tools to critically evaluate them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in clinical trials who does not have a background on the subject. It is a great introductory course, and the skills that we are taught can be translated to all research settings. I really appreciated this course.",
    "Don't take it. But if you do, be prepared for some unpleasant surprises.",
