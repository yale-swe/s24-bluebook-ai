    "Etem is awesome. Class is extremely pleasant and enjoyable. It's a solid mixture of actual learning and fascinating anecdotes about the Ottoman Empire. The workload is pretty light, although some studying is required before the quizzes. I'm so glad that I decided to take Turkish!",
    "do the class",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. Etem is amazing and really cares, both about the subject matter and his students. This is the ideal language for people that are not the best at learning them or at times just feel a little overwhelmed with the rest of their workload. Etem is understanding through all of this and creates an environment where the students can learn the language and have fun.",
    "great! Really low stress way to learn a language. Etem is really funny.",
    "Etem is wonderful. Be ready for the wildest ride of your life.",
    "Turkish 110 is a fun language course. It's not very much work, and the professor is hilarious. The course focuses on grammar and writing (rather than speaking).",
    "This class is definitely unlike the more rigorous language classes I've taken at Yale. Expect a laid-back and sometimes meandering classroom experience: often hilarious, but sometimes frustrating. The workload is very manageable, but sporadic. There'll be nothing for days, and then suddenly five pages of homework and a quiz with a hundred vocabulary words to remember. I feel as though one would have to be pretty motivated and have a lot of time (which I definitely don't) to learn at a satisfyingly quick pace.",
    "Take it! There's a lot less busy work than other intro languages I've taken, but that means it's pretty easy to get behind if you don't put any effort into it. If you do put the effort in, though, you'll get a pretty good handle on the basics of Turkish. Etem is a riot, in the best possible sense. He has fun, you will have fun, and to sweeten the deal you will even learn some Turkish along the way.",
    "TAKE IT. Especially if you are a Freshman. One of the most fun language courses at Yale and it is pretty low-pressure. There are maybe a total of 5 or so quizzes and a midterm\/final exam. Homework assigned about 2-3 times a week. The hardest part about it is having to memorize new vocab if you aren't familiar with any Ottoman or Arabic. Etem Erol is an incredible professor and hilarious to boot. You will not regret taking this class. Also, I recommend Freshmen take the course so that you can continue it. I am a senior and I wish I had taken it earlier because there are opportunities to apply for grants to study in Istanbul and that's just freaken cool.",
    "Take it! It's rigorous but low-stress -- you'll get a lot of words thrown at you, but the homework and test load is mild enough that it shouldn't overwhelm you, so you can learn as much beyond the basics as you want. And Etem and Yasemin are just marvelous."
