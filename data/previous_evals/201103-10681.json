    "Yes.",

    "This was more of a fleshing out of the concepts I got in undergrad. Unlike the other first year grad courses, this one didn't overlap much with its undergraduate counterpart (which followed mainly griffiths) but applied those concepts to more cases, and approached quantum mechanics differently. In this cases where it did overlap, such as perturbation theory, the ideas were the same but the problems were much more difficult.",

    "Yes! Especially with Prof. Jack Harris. Great class.",

    "Looked at a more rigorous approach to quantum mechanics, and poked at subtleties that Griffiths will gloss over very quickly."
