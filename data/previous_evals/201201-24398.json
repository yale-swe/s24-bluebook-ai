    "This is a great class that really opened up my understanding of the Middle East and made me realize how crippling a western perspective can be when attempting to address women's empowerment among these women. I learned so much about Islam's treatment of women, and have been very inspired to continue learning about women's potential to empower themselves within this religious framework.",
    "I would recommend this course to you if you are interested in the Muslim world and the role of women in it. If you are looking to go into detail about any one country or case, steer clear. We talked about women in nationalist movements, but also hijab, polygamy, ijtihad, etc. You will come out with a better understanding of the agency of Muslim women.",
    "The group of students involved really makes the course. If the class is filled with people who have a lot of background information, then an individual with little experience may need to do outside work. The class is sort of dependent on the people who take it. The class is sort of unorganized in that it is not quite chronological or regional. I would still recommend this class."
