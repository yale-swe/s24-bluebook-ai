    "great course! the readings can be a bit difficult to read, but its fine if you have a translated version to refer back to. Andrea is an amazing teacher so he will challenge the way you think and how you view things. very interesting course plus you get to read so many different italian masterpieces!",
    "Take it if it's offered again. Very interesting study of Renaissance literature. You'll learn a lot!",
    "I would take it if you want to better understand Renaissance literature. It is a lot of work, but it is rewarding."
