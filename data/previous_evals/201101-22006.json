   "comments": [
    "Music 218 is \"meant for students with little to no dictation experience.\" However, I felt that most of the students were already proficient. This being said, the pace of the class was largely determined by the quickest students, and those of us who had no previous dictation experience were left in the dust. Just as we began to improve at one type of dictation, we would move onto something harder.If you feel insecure of your abilities, I would audit this class for one semester before you take it.",
    "Yes I would, it is great for learning new musicianship skills, but be wary its a lot of work for only a half credit.",
    "I would recommend 218, but only on top of whatever schedule you've already settled on. It's mostly relaxing and helpful, for the time it requires.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to hone their musicianship skills.",
    "It is a fun class with light work (though it really should be more than half a credit). The keyboard lab is especially a lot of fun. I loved having an excuse to practice piano a few hours a week.",
    "Take it! Take it now! Fabulous, low stress, and Sarita is all sorts of wonderful. Classes can be challenging, but very positive and fun experiences.",
    "Take 218. It will make you a much better musician, and Sarita is wonderful.",
    "Music 218 is a very enjoyable way to improve your skills in music dictation, chord identification, sight-singing, and keyboard playing (including transposing by sight and playing figured bass). In the classroom component, you\u0092ll work up to doing dictation from real music (e.g., transcribing the melody line of a Haydn string quartet or Chopin piano prelude). In keyboard lab, you\u0092ll begin with basic figured bass playing and (depending on your previous level of experience) work up to transposing four-part music by sight. (I\u0092ve been playing piano for 15 years, but my keyboard lab instructor tailored my assignments to my experience level, so the lab was by no means easy for me!) Both the classroom and lab components can be very challenging, and practicing each week for keyboard lab can be very time-consuming. However, I recommend this class to anyone who wants to do the hard work of becoming a better musician and music theorist.",
    "I wish I could always be taking this class. Musicianship is an ear training class that really builds your ability to hear different chord progressions and to dictate real music. My ear certainly improved this year and I became much more comfortable with sight-singing. I absolutely recommend this class, ESPECIALLY with Sarita. She is stupendous."
