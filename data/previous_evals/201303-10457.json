   "comments": [
    "It is a materials and methods class where we learn about and try out all kinds of techniques for making art. It is really hands on, not too much academic work but you learn a lot about art as a physical craft.",
    "A class you should definitely take. There's minimal work, only two graded papers (both less than 8 pages), one very low stress presentation, and the opportunity to get your hand dirty with different mediums of art. You learn a fair amount, though maybe not as much as if this class were a lecture. Highly recommended for fulfilling the art history major requirements and as a fifth class.",
    "Take it!! Part-time working with art materials, part-time visiting with professional conservators and seeing old art and books, part-time working with Theresa's teaching collection to put what you learn into practice. Be aware that the class is only intro-level conservation, so you don't actually conserve anything; rather, you examine objects to see what could be done. It is endlessly interesting, and I do feel like I look at art much differently now. Theresa is kind, brilliant, and supportive, and the class is not much work for a lot of gain, though your knowledge will be rather cocktail-party level--still much more than I knew before. A really great, light class.",
    "Definitely take this if you get in! It's a fun, low-key class and you learn a ton about how art is made and preserved. Professor Fairbanks is wonderful and incredibly helpful."
