    "McGovern is often described as the \"Indiana Jones of political anthropology\" and there's a reason -- he's pretty damn badass, but also really knowledgeable.What you're actually learn from this class is a fuck of a lot about Africa, India, and Latin America in a way that is very raw, real, and personal but still really intellectual useful for anyone in the other social sciences. You will also understand -- as someone who has never taken anthro before -- a fair amount about how to view the world through that lens. It is a good thing to do if you have not done it before.Perhaps the most difficult part of this class was navigating the divide between the anthro bullshit and McGovern's no-bullshit personality. Every once and a while he and the grad students would briefly saunter into Lacan land and all the undergrads would just sort of look around (except for the undergrads that pretended they knew WTF was going on.) Relative to most anthro seminars, however, this class was very grounded.Last, as I am sure other comments will describe, you have to prepare a presentation for each class and then McGovern randomly picks 2 people to actually present. This is a very valuable exercise because everyone shows up to class armed to the fucking teeth. At the same time, don't underestimate how much time this takes. If you've got a hard semester, this is not just a read-a-book-a-week class, because -- though you can take a pass for 2 weeks of the semester -- it becomes an onerous burden if you've got particularly busy weeks. If you're good at planning ahead, though, it should be fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a close academic look at insurgency.",
    "This course is a LOT of work. You have to prepare to give a presentation every week on the book assigned for that week, because at the beginning of each class Professor McGovern picks two names out of a hat - the first person has to give a 15-minute presentation on the book, and the second person has to give a 10-minute response to the first presentation. And these are not short books, either - they average 200+ pages.That being said, if you're willing to do the work, you'll get an enormous amount out of the class. McGovern is great at leading discussions and incorporating non-anthro students into the discussions, and the grad students (at least in the semester when I took the course) were very welcoming and not at all snobbish\/elitist. You'll learn about a lot of different conflicts and a lot of ways to analyze them. Some background in Marxist theory would be helpful, but it's not at all necessary.Bottom line: great course if you're willing to do a lot of work. If you're not willing to work hard at it, then stay away.",
    "This course taught us how to critically analyze and observe various insurgent uprisings from looking at the situation from the bottom up, starting with the viewpoints of the subalterns. We were able to investigate reoccurring themes present throughout these rebellions to best understand the strains of the group which led them to act violently. I would recommend this class to any Anthropology major or International Studies because it makes you readjust how you view the other side of the world and the people living in it."
