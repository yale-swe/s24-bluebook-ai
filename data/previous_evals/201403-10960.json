If it is meant to be a seminar class, then there should be ample space for student participation. And the professor should be able to learn all the students names, not just the most aggressive of the students.",

    "Since this course surveyed many historical topics, it exposed some gaps in my knowledge and gave me ideas for what classes I should take in the future to fill those gaps."
