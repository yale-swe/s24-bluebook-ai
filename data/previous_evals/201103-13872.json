    "Scandinavian Cinema is, as it was purported to be, a look at several directors, themes, styles, countries that begin to make up a portrait of the filmmaking history of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, which is a rich history that I at least did not know much about beyond knowing Bergman's name and a couple of his movies. First of all, you get to watch a score of wonderful (occasionally challenging) and probably unfamiliar films, which seem diverse. (There was not much Iceland this semester.) In-class time is spent almost entirely in discussion, with any \"lecture-ish\" bits coming organically from the two widely knowledgeable professors. The class as I took it informally incorporated formal film analysis and various theoretical analyses but without stressing any of these methods unduly, putting an emphasis instead on what we saw, how we saw it, and building upon one another's experiences. Rather than a single narrative imposed on the course, several vivid strands started to weave together over the few months. The two papers were entirely manageable and completely open-ended, which was very refreshing. Our class bonded quickly and enjoyed conversing together, and had a (respectful) but very friendly relationship with the professors. This was the first time offering this particular course, and the two professors will probably teachit separately, but both were great.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS IVE TAKEN! take it!!!",
    "Scandinavian Cinema is a fantastic seminar--two great Scandinavian films per week, discussions led by two well-informed, excited, friendly professors, two 10 pg papers, occasional readings. I couldn't sing enough praises about this course. I looked forward to it every Wednesday and felt by the end of the semester like a more sensitive reader of films. Katie and Soren are amazing and teach the course very thoughtfully. Such an enjoyable experience. I wish I had something like it every semester.",
    "Scandinavian Cinema is a fascinating look at an important body of films, led by two easygoing and engaging instructors. Take it!"
