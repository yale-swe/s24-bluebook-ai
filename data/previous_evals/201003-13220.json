    "DO THIS. Do the year long. You have a CRAZY amount of resources and the checkpoints are ACTUALLY helpful to make sure you stay on task. It has made my semester and really helped me engage in my academic work. I have loved this so much. American Studies IS THE BEST.",
    "senior essay. mandatory. tisha is great. year-long is very chill first semester. the responsibility of doing your research falls almost entirely on you.",
    "Definitely take this course if pursuing an independent research project. Will help you refine your research skills and receive proper writing help.",
    "The best way to do your senior thesis!!!!",
    "This class is required for senior essay writers in American Studies. It's not a burden, but rather, provides a forum for thinking and talking about your research.",
    "Pretty good, I guess? It's really just a placeholder for you to write your senior essay, but meets every couple weeks. Use the grad student who teaches the class to help you!Although, I was irritated by the time it was scheduled for this semester. Not posted online in advance, and at a random time at intersected with TWO seminar blocks (not a normal time)."
