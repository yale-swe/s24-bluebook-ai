   "comments": [
    "This is a great class to take to learn how to use SolidWorks and 3D printers. I would suggest this class to any engineer, not just mechanical engineers. The problem sets are a little time consuming because you have one every week and the simulations often take 20minutes to run. But I thought it was worth it because this software has so many applications to actual research.",
    "A very useful course, and one of the few at Yale that actually teaches you applicable, practical, hands-on skills.",
    "Yes. You can learn SolidWorks on your own, but if you need a little push to get going this class does a very good job of getting you comfortable with using it to create 3D models and designs, before introducing you to the simulation software which is robust. I didn't know much about SolidWorks until Junior year and took the class as a Senior, but with the CEID I would now go back and take it as a Freshman if I could. It's not particularly challenging, and gives you a skill that can change the way you think about ideas, can enable you in the CEID (3D printing, laser cutter, CNC milling - all begins with SolidWorks or CAD), and can help you get engineering jobs.Take this or learn this early in your Yale career and you'll be happy. I'd prefer a project for both the final and midterm rather than a midterm on info behind CAD, but that's not a reason not to take it.",
    "This class teaches you to learn SolidWorks and does a very good job of that. You learn how to design and make nearly any part that you can imagine. The class also covers simulations, motion analysis, and fluid flow. It is a useful skill for any engineer or person interested in engineering. Prof. Long is not the most engaging lecturer, but he is very knowledgeable and can help you out if there are any questions.",
    "400 is a really good class. you learn how to do cool stuff in solid works. marshall is a chill teacher and our TA nate was great. the only things i didnt like were the matlab p sets and the midterm which was really random. it seemed like we had a midterm for the sake of having a midterm. but otherwise a great class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is substantial, but not terrible and you learn so much. I really enjoyed working on the psets for this class and it's essential to be skilled in Matlab and Solidworks as an engineer, so this class was a great basis for that.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. You get to learn a skill that's very applicable to engineering related jobs and it's a nice change of pace when compared to typical engineering classes. You'll want to punch the computer throughout the semester when SolidWorks crashes or your simulations fail\/take over 2 hours, but it's not that bad.",
    "For engineering majors definitely recommended since it actually lets you do stuff unlike all the other engineering classes at yale. Professor Long is a bit dull but super chill so that makes it way easier.",
    "The course was one of the more relaxed mechanical engineering courses and it was great because it allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of Solidworks, an essential program for mechanical engineers.",
    "Meng 400 was a great course. I learned how to use solidworks really comfortably. This is one of the only meng courses that actually teaches you many practical skills. Chances are in engineering industry you won't be solving the navier stokes equations but probably will be doing cfd or solid modeling. Long is really chill and he always is ready to extend problem set deadlines. There is only one midterm that is just stuff from the slides and is pretty simple if you go through the material. The problem sets are graded really leniently. The final project can be anything you want it to be. Some people choose to do really complicated things and other people choose really easy projects. If you are a mech e major definitely use this as one of your electives.",
    "This class is a good introduction to Solidworks design and analysis. If you pay attention in class and follow along with his demonstrations, then the homework is not particularly challenging and is fun to do, although it can take some time. If you don't pay attention in class, you can spend hours trying to get something to work in Solidworks to no avail because it can be a confusing and not very intuitive program. You also get an introduction to 3D printing, which is a plus.",
    "Nice ABET elective. I came in with AutoCAD 3D experience, but SolidWorks was quite different in how you think about building things - based more on solid bodies than on edges of objects. Work load goes up toward the end of the semester as simulations take longer to run. Go to class and pay attention and you'll be fine. And don't pick something too hard for the final project or you'll go crazy.",
    "Take the course. It's a nice skill to have to know how to use SolidWorks. Plus, none of the psets are too hard. They can get time-consuming though.",
    "This class is great for introducing you to Solidworks. The classes are fairly useless because the lectures are either on something unrelated to the homework or move at a pace to fast to follow. However, Solidworks and Matlab, the two programs we used for this class, are generally easier to figure out on your own. There are also tons of resources online. I felt like I went from zero understanding of solidworks to now being able to use it at a high level. It helps to have used Matlab at some point before.The one midterm was theoretical, completely unrelated to the psets, but only a small portion of the grade. There was no final exam, which was cool. The pset grading was a little arbitrary at times, but in general everyone ended up averaging around the same scores.",
    "Solidworks is fun, but the instructor needs to put in more work to make this a good class. It is often times confusing and disorganized. If you already know a bit of solidworks and matlab then you might be ok.",
    "It's a great way to get yourself to learn Solidworks, an infinitely useful CAD software. The class sometimes moved too fast but I'm very pleased with the end result. However, I'm not too sure the Matlab stuff was as valuable as the rest of the course. If this was sold as just a CAD class, it would still succeed. The homework can take unexpectedly long to do, so don't push it off to the last second. But seriously, if you're an engineer, you need solidworks, so consider taking it."
