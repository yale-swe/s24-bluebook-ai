    "Great course if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "The course is NOT intended to give students a history book understanding of Venetian history or concrete events or conflicts within the time period. It is very much geared toward teaching students to look at primary source and secondary source material with an analytical, curious eye (though you inevitably learn a great deal about Venetian history through this method). I truly benefited from this kind of structure; I feel like I am much more able to think and study like a historian now."
