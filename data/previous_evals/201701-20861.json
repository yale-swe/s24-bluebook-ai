   "comments": [
    "We covered more linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
    "I guess I learned a decent amount about vector calculus and linear algebra and how the two are connected. I also learned about whatever tangents Stefan decided to teach us, like Banach fixed points, Chaos Theory, etc.",
    "I learned a wide variety of Linear Algebra concepts, as well as some other tangentially related math concepts that Stefan wanted to teach us. I also solidified my knowledge of vector calculus with proofs (if not applications).",
    "Much as with Math 230, I developed substantial understanding of math concepts and proof techniques as well as learning the material of the course.",
    "I actually feel like I really grew a lot as a mathematician, especially compared to 230. The course was a lot harder than first semester, and definitely very frustrating at times as well, but I was exposed to lots of really interesting and beautiful mathematical ideas which grew my understanding of what is out there. We learned some linear algebra and calculus, but what I really developed was my mathematical abilities and general intuition.",
    "How to think, do math, write proofs.",
    "I learned how to work under pressure, both with problem sets and studying for\/taking exams.",
    "The course title says that this course is about vector calculus and linear algebra, but the instructor took several long deviations from the class. Random topics from this semester included chaos theory and fixed point theorems. While it was interesting, it was slightly frustrating not learning what the course is set to teach. We finally rushed the major theorems that intro linear algebra and multivariable calculus classes would teach, but didn't end up having the time to discuss them.",
    "I learned more about linear algebra including projections, least-square lines, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I also learned about fixed point theorems and chaos theory, as well as the implicit and inverse function theorems. Furthermore, I better learned about multivariable calculus, including Green, Stokes, and Divergence.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge of linear algebra and calculus as well as a basic but deep taste of analysis. I also gained skills to prepare me for higher level math at Yale, mainly to always keep working on Psets and to keep reviewing material, as math is and always will be a cumulative subject.",
    "Proof-based math.",
    "Time management, proofs, learned lots of cool math.",
    "Chaos, calculus, linear algebra, random math things",
    "I learned higher level concepts of rigorous multivariable and linear algebra, as well as other topics in chaos and fixed points.",
    "I learned many, many things in this course: what math is, how to write a proof, and many specifics of mathematical phenomena. The MATH 230\/231 sequence changed the way I approach life and the way I think.",
    "I learned the math.",
    "I learned to approach \"pure\" mathematics problem with a proof-based perspective.",
    "Great curriculum covering concepts in Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra as well as bits from other interesting areas of mathematics. An excellent introduction to proof based math.",
    "More proof skills in the context of multivariable calculus",
    "Ability to think more abstractly and analytically about math, good foundation in multivariable calculus and linear algebra and associated topics.",
    "I feel way more comfortable with higher level math thanks to this course!",
    "Finished off Linear Algebra and Multi, along with some stuff about fixed points and chaos theory that seems kinda useless honestly.",
    "Proof based reasoning and an overview of vector calc, linear alg, and real analysis",
    "I learned about fixed point theorems and chaos, with some vector calculus and linear algebra crammed in there for good measure.",
    "I learned how to formulate legitimate mathematical proofs and how to utilize the results of those proofs to facilitate computations.",
    "I learned concepts in theorems in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and others like Banach and Brouwer. I also improved my skills in rigorous proof-writing and problem solving.",
    "The course helped me refine my mathematical reasoning and problem solving insight. Shoutout to the Ulam sequence",
    "During this course, it felt like I did not gain any new mathematical skill or insight. The knowledge that I did gain was material tangentially related or completely unrelated to the topics on the syllabus. I learned a fair bit of fixed point theorems and chaos theory; however, I did not learn much linear algebra or vector calculus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a continuation of Math 230. The material is mostly still interesting, but it was somewhat disappointing that the pace slowed down this semester and we didn't get through all the material.",
    "The course wasn't structured at all -- to give one example, we didn't even have a syllabus. Stefan decided to teach basically whatever he felt interested in, which meant I really didn't get a good grasp of matrices, or eigenvalues, or a lot of concepts in linear algebra. In general, I felt like even though I might have gained a surface-level understanding of what was going on through this class, Stefan really didn't give me any more intuition than that. Actually, he explained things in an incredibly roundabout way that often left me more confused than if I had just read the book.",
    "Stefan is a good lecturer, whatever he is teaching. Some students questioned the order in which he presented concepts to us, or certain concepts he left out or glossed over, but I did not notice any of that. I don't know much about math anyway. It seemed like everything I learned was useful and appropriately timed, and that's what matters. The psets were manageable, provided one was willing to put in the time. The additional resources, like the TA sessions and peer tutors, were helpful. The two midterms varied wildly in difficulty. Oh well. We were essentially measured against the performance of the other students anyway, so it doesn't really matter how hard the midterms are, it just matters how much you study. Stefan was helpful in office hours, even if he got sidetracked sometimes. I think the way the class is designed allows someone to get a good grade without really putting in enough effort or understanding the material as fully as they should. Sometimes I felt as though I was taking advantage of that as well. The midterms and final should, on the whole, be more difficult, even if that means they need to be curved slightly. It'd be nice to see some practical applications every once in a while, aside from Stefan just saying \"trust me, this is very practical\". It's not that I don't believe him, I just think it would help solidify understanding, in addition to the heavy theoretical work on the psets.",
    "Do manifolds and differential forms. This material is STANDARD in any vector calculus\/analysis class, as syllabi from many other universities show, and it is an important part of the curriculum.",
    "Strengths: Great subject, very interesting, engaging lectures, fair exams, peer tutors fun (sometimes helpful, sometimes not, but well set up system and worth going to), course encourages engagement with the other students Weaknesses: Very unorganized at times, psets were sometimes ridiculously hard and even Stefan did not know the answers to questions on them, a lot of time was spent on topics which did not really relate to vector calculus and\/or linear algebra (they were interesting, but if you haven't taken these classes before you will need to learn the material on your own), definitely harder than 230 so may be different from what was expected, pset grading doesn't necessarily provide useful feedback and answer keys often incorrect",
    "This course provided a good overview of the topics in vector calculus and linear algebra, and the problem sets were usually interesting, albeit very time-consuming. In the latter part of the course, though, the turn toward multivariable calculus (Stokes, Greens, Gauss, surface integral, etc.) were treated somewhat cavalierly and without the same level of instruction and rigor I had come to expect. That was a repeating flaw of the course: important subjects (eg eigenvectors) were rushed through in one day, to the detriment of genuine understanding. The rise of computation was also a weird turn in the class, consuming a few problem sets and submerging the proof-based approach we had been taking for Math 230 and the first part of Math 231.",
    "Very interesting continuation of the first semester, in that it continues to develop proof-writing skills and thinking. Instructor is very engaging and enthusiastic. However, the lecture schedule was very disorganized and did not seem complete. Although students would occasionally bring up suggestions or ask for help in a certain topic, instructor did not seem very willing to acknowledge that there was a deficit. Overall, accepting and implementing more recommendations from students may be helpful--excluding recommendations that would detract from the rigor of the course but including more resources that may help students understand.",
    "Being the high-level freshman Math course, this course had a lot of support from 230 which continued into 231. From TA's to Peer Tutors or other classmates, it was always fairly easy to work on psets or study with others that enhanced the experience. At times however, the course seemed to vary a lot with what the professor wanted to teach giving forth less structure to the course. The course, just liked Math 230 is really good at accommodating students from all math backgrounds, but I feel it lacks the consistency of language classes that really helps improve students so that everyone is pretty much on the same level towards the end of the class with respect to math knowledge.",
    "Strength: breathtaking overview of interesting math Weakness: some parts covered too fast. Covered Stokes', Greens' and Divergence in one single class",
    "Stefan made this class. He made the math interesting rather than rote. It was a whole lot of work, which I eventually started to resent. It's really hard to plan around the time needed for proofs, and expectations are sometimes unreasonably high. It will definitely challenge you.",
    "Not very organized,could have a better structure.",
    "The class does a great job of teaching rigorous math and giving insight into the real concepts behind computation. The problem sets were a ridiculous workload, but probably overall worth it because they forced us to be able to produce mathematical arguments on our own and really understand the concepts involved. The class could be improved if there was more alignment between its actual content and the tests-- I felt like even when I understood the material on the problem sets and in class after studying for hours, I still wasn't reaching my full potential on the exams. This problem also has to do with the fact that exams are weighted so much more than problem sets, even though problem sets constitute the vast majority of the work in the course. For example, a MC question on the final asked how to approximate logn!, not a concept relevant to anything we learned in class, but rather a two minute tangent. I actually remember leaving class to use the bathroom at that moment, coming back and seeing that we had learned how to approximate logn!, then Stefan erased it and I never actually wrote it down, but never considered it important to know because it wasn't involved in any homeworks\/was never brought up again",
    "This course was great when Stefan was teaching us about things he found interesting. For much of the semester, lectures and problem sets were engaging and informative. Weaknesses arose when we got to topics Stefan seemed to care about less; those lectures were generally unclear and uninteresting. The course is also biased towards those who have taken similar classes before: if you have never taken a proof-based math class before, this will be harder for you than for your peers who have.",
    "This class makes you stronger through intellectual pain.",
    "Strengths: - Important course material - Great professor - Great psets - Fun tests Weaknesses: - I hear some students are quite disappointed we did so little manifold and curl stuff",
    "If the course is truly designed to cover 120, 225, 250, and 301, it should more rigorously explore multivariable calculus and linear algebra. Although we came away with an understanding of both, I fear that my knowledge of 120 and 225 would be greater had I taken the classes individually. That said, 230\/231 served as a fantastic introduction to challenging topics in math and has convinced me to pursue mathematics as my major.",
    "Interesting lectures, and challenging but rewarding problem sets. The peer tutors as well as TA are a great part of the class, and foster a sense of community around the class.",
    "The course's biggest strength is that it follows through on its promise to be an intensive introduction to proof-based math. You cover a lot of topics in unique ways, and the class trains you to be a patient and deep thinker. The biggest weakness is a lack of structure and sometimes the exams do not test on material taught in class but rather mathematical intuition. I understand that it's important to develop that kind of intuition in this class, but sometimes it tends to favor students with a stronger background rather than the ones who really worked hard to do the problem sets and absorb the material.",
    "The rigorous, proof-based nature of the course is a big strength, as are the interesting homework problems.",
    "Let me start by saying: this is an impressive course, and if you are interested in majoring in math and have something of a masochistic bent, you should absolutely shop it. One disclaimer, though: the course has the unfortunate task of teaching multivariable calculus and linear algebra at a very abstract and theoretical level. I say unfortunate because computation is very important in these areas of math. If you want to do physics or CS, for instance, you need to be able to compute partial derivatives or solve linear systems numerically. This course focuses much more on the theory behind topics, and gives little experience in actually doing hand computations. I think this is the course's main weakness, and it could be easily remedied by adding a fairly simple computational section on each problem set. Students can, of course, do supplementary exercises (I did) to ensure their computational abilities do not flag. With that said, this is a truly impressive course, which redefined my understanding of mathematics and has compelled my interest in studying higher math in future years. And the analytic skills it gave me assisted my studies in economics and computer science. If you have the slightest interest in studying math, I highly recommend considering it. Do not take the disclaimers lightly, though: the workload is absurd, and will take many, many hours of your time each week.",
    "Hard class but gets easier as the semester progresses. Stefan mostly teaches what he wants, but this is a good thing. He's a lot of fun.",
    "Some content seems to be not important, and the important stuff was glossed over. The important parts of multi that I wanted to learn about happened in one week (Stokes, Greens), and my understanding of linear algebra is probably worse than those who took 225.",
    "There is little structure to the course. It feels as though we jumped around a lot throughout the year (although doing interesting stuff). Perhaps following a textbook end to end would be helpful.",
    "MATH 230 and 231 need a dedicated teacher whos experienced in teaching the course. The pacing was awful, and I think thats largely because Stefan doesnt understand how to plan out a course, and will on occasion go on two lecture tangents. I dont feel like Ive left with a good understanding of multivariable calculus or linear algebra because we skipped over so many topics. The math department needs to regulate what gets taught in this course.",
    "The course is a lot of work, but it is rigorous and very rewarding. I see no ways it could be improved.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, which is both a strength and a weakness. You learn a lot, but only insofar as you are able to keep up with the class.",
    "This class could strongly benefit from a professor who is dedicated to teaching first years and is willing to do so for a great many years. Having the same professor teach MATH 230 231 year after year will allow the professor to deeply understand the struggles first-year mathematics students may have and then can address them better; furthermore, a dedicated professor can develop a highly focused syllabus that they themselves are familiar with. This course has the potential to be a great introduction to higher mathematical thinking: the material has breadth and depth. It gives students a good introduction to proofs. It just needs to be taught by a good professor."

   "comments": [
    "This is a fun course!",
    "I think the course content is quite useful and a student can definitely gain a lot by taking the course. However, if you take it with a bad teacher, you're really not going to get much out of the class unless you have the dedication to self-study a lot of the material.",
    "If you want to be a math major, and are interested in theoretical stuff, definitely take the class. If not, then definitely don't take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course (in fact, I already have).",
    "If you like math and took 230, YES! It's hard and awful but you will get so much out of it!! After this class you will know whether you want to be a math major or not. And if you do, peer tutors have said this is the hardest class they've taken as a math major at yale so if you can get through this you can get through anything!",
    "Lectures were generally very good, but could be somewhat fast\/confusing at times - Stefan sometimes skips steps or will explain the generally idea, but not everything super fleshed-out. That said Stefan is a very fun and energetic lecturer and will sometime goes on very interesting side-tangents. Psets are very-time consuming (less so during the second 1\/2 of the course). For me, requiring at least 6 hours, probably usually 10+ hrs. However, the problems are mostly doable and doing the psets is very helpful for learning. One downside is that there are sometime typos in the psets and the pset solutions are hard to read (b\/c scanned) or sometimes hard to follow.",
    "If you're really passionate about math, this class explores more topics in more depth than 120, 222, or 225. At its best, it explores various branch of mathematical thought with rigor, giving us a taste for the problems that exist in \"real\" math. At its low points, it tends to emulate the computation of the lower-level classes without the excitement of proofs. Exams are tricky and doable, but studying can be really rough based on the sheer volume of topics we've explored.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're willing to put in the effort. The content is not too difficult to understand once the basics are in place, but ensuring that everything is thorough and complete takes a lot of time. It's worth it in the end if you enjoy math and are willing to spend a lot of time on your own figuring out concepts on your own",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in studying linear algebra and multivariable calculus from a rigorous point of view. We learned about riemann integrals via a rigorous definition, not just \"area under the curve,\" and most theorems, of course, were proved. The exception was the inverse\/implicit function theorems and Stokes\/Divergence, the former of which we did not have time to prove due to snow days and the latter of which I feel Stefan glossed over the proofs.",
    "If you took 230, I would highly recommend this course. 231 is different from 230 in that most people will not have already seen some of the material making everyone equal in some way. Compared to the linear algebra courses, 231 is much faster and affords you time for other material, however this comes at the price that you need to put in effort to really know the material before moving on and before tests. The class and all the faculty and tutors associated are all there to help so there really is no sense of being lost. Great for anyone interested in math.",
    "Stefan is entertaining, but sometimes he covers things way too fast. Overall would still recommend the course because you could save yourself the trouble of taking three math classes before going to take on a real math class.",
    "If your self-worth is determined by how good you think you are at math, don't take this. If you want a challenging year, and are willing to put in the work, etc, and can deal with really stressful times, it'll be fun. You'll make friends, you'll learn a lot, you'll hate it at times and love it at others. Try to keep a positive attitude and you'll get much more out of it.",
    "A very good introduction to math. It's a good option if you wanna know if you really like math and want to major in it. Challenging and fun. Sometimes it can be too much work but it's not too hard to get a decent grade.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student willing to put in the work for the problem sets (at least 15 hours a week). If you are reluctant to devote that much time, you will end up resenting the class, the professor, and the entire field. It might even deter you from your major. Still, I think anyone interested in majoring in math should absolutely take this class, because the content makes it the best sequence you can take as a freshman, and although it might kill you, it's incredibly rewarding.",
    "You should take this course if and only if you love math and are ready to let it take over your life. You should also note that the nature of the class depends heavily on who is teaching it. With Stefan Steinerberger, it was fantastically difficult and all-around fantastic. Weekly problem sets take a lot of time15 or 20 hours, at the least. Lectures are usually very good. The amount of information covered in MATH 231 is staggering, but it's all fascinating and very worthwhile.",
    "The academic masochist will love this class.",
    "Math 231: I would strongly recommend math 230\/231 to anyone who is interested in math. If you're not confident in your math abilities take it credit\/d. I feel like this stuff is really important to learn. I think taking this class (I'm not a math major) was one of the best decisions I made all year. Stefan: Great lecturer and cool guy. Class will be very entertaining and you will learn a lot. Problem sets are fun too.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they had taken multivariable calculus (or higher level mathematics) in high school or if they were strongly considering pursuing mathematics as their major.",
    "Absolutely! Anyone interested in becoming a math major, or just someone who wants to see math beyond the standard high school and intro college curriculum should shop the class.",
    "If you have a strong mathematical intuition and want to learn in a more rigorously mathematical environment, then yes.",
    "Yes, if you're very interested in math and willing to put a lot of time into problem sets and studying.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone who has already taken both multi and linear algebra, but the class can be confusing and difficult, as well as straight up not enough coverage for someone who hasn't taken one of the above.",
    "Yes, compared to other available math classes, 230\/231 is especially challenging and valuable.",
    "Dont take this class unless a good teacher is teaching it. Id recommend MATH 225 and 250 as a better alternative to 230 and 231.",
    "I would recommend the course so long as the student had an ample interest in mathematics and the willingness to go the extra mile for the course. It is demanding, but rewarding and doable.",
    "Yes, I myself feel like I have greatly improved as a mathematician as a result of this course.",
    "If you are considering majoring in math and cannot decide, the course will help you make up your mind.",
    "If you are 100% certain you are a math major, take the course. If you're taking the course as a co-req for another class (i.e. PHYS 260\/261) DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Instead, the math department should advertise the possible route of taking MATH 225\/250 as a better introduction to linear algebra and vector calculus, respectively. If you are only slightly interested in mathematics, take MATH 225 instead."
