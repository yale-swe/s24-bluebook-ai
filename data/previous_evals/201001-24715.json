   "comments": [
    "This course was enjoyable, but it was presented as an introductory class, which it certainly was not. Because I didn't have a lot of background knowledge on the history of South Asia I always felt a little out of the loop. Professor Rai is great though, if a little flaky.",
    "I don't think this is being offered since PRofessor Rai is leaving, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want a really easy seminar where you learn very little, or you are absolutely fascinated by and passionate about South Asian history.",
    "yes",
    "This was a solid course. Prof Rai is very knowledgeable, and the period and region are interesting. The reading can be a bit much, and it isn't clear which readings will be discussed in a given meeting. This made me less likely to do all of the work, which was unfortunate.",
    "Great course covering an interesting subjectProf Rai is terrific; willing to spend time out of class talking and wonderful leading discussion in seminar; she is laid back but insightful and will challenge your assumptions while encouraging you to think deeply about a subject:",
    "History 390J is an engaging treatment of the post-colonial period. While background knowledge is helpful, it is not absolutely necessary, and Dr. Rai will fill in those with less exposure to the region's history. She makes an excellent professor in seminar and leads animated discussions that tend to wander off in interesting if not always relevant directions. The readings range from dry to engaging and come in large but still manageable quantities. Discussion is definitely the class, and listening to classmates really helped me to better understand the text. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone with an interest in South Asia.",
    "Yes, certainly if one is looking for a South Asian course.If one isn't, consider it to learn more about the region.",
    "Very interesting material. Lots of reading... although you don't need to do it all. Professor Rai is a very sweet incredibly knowledgeable woman, but can get off topic very easily.",
    "I would recommend it. I took it as someone who needed a \"rest of the world\" requirement, and I learned a lot. There is a lot of reading, but the workload is pretty reasonable (only two short papers and one long one). Professor Rai is very nice and knowledgeable. It's a pretty low stress way to fulfill a requirement or learn about an area of the world that is extremely relevant today. The only problem was that Professor Rai does tend to talk a lot."
