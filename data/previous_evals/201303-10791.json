    "Chinese 162 is a great way for heritage speakers to boost their Chinese skills - all four, with possibly slight emphasis on reading and writing. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "The online homework for each lesson isn't bad (3 tries for each). In-class translation and vocab practice can be a bit stressful because he calls on students at random, but the biggest assignments are the essay and presentation for each lesson. He expects English-level writing skill, so there are often many red marks on our papers. I have to say that my reading comprehension and writing has improved, but in terms of vocabulary, if I remember the terms then they would be useful in my life, though I'm not sure I will remember them after the break.",
    "Chinese 162 covers a lot of vocabulary and a lot of grammatical knowledge, though sometimes it is difficult to assess how much one has actually learned through the course. However, I can say my Chinese has definitely improved and I would recommend this course for students who are similar to me: who can speak and listen in Chinese but may have difficulty in reading and writing. The course definitely focuses on reading the most, but it is an all-around course still. Overall, it is a good course.",
    "Chinese 162 is a great class if you're looking to achieve fluency in Chinese. The class really focuses on all aspects of learning a language: reading, writing, speaking, etc. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Fun class you'll like. If you do all the work and studying, it shouldn't be hard. Don't fall behind. Language is best learned gradually, and through repetition and deep understanding."
