   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this class because you're interested in law and you want to learn about criminal justice.... don't. It's primarily a sociology class -- and a solid one at that. But expect to be introduced to sociological theories, not legal ones. If you think you might be interested in the discipline of sociology, take this course. Very manageable workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students. It's a really fun course with a really great professor. The readings are dynamic, and when you can't understand them, the professor is willing to talk it through with you.",
    "This is an excellent course for those have ever entertained the idea of taking a Sociology course. It provides good readings from many theorists and they're not all \"common-sense\" analyses. Professor Smith is good and keeps the class awake even though it's an afternoon class.",
    "SOCY 041 does not quite live up to its name. Most of the focus is on an introduction to sociology (which is all very interesting, and I am finding, very applicable to everyday life and other disciplines). Less focus on criminal justice, but enough to keep the students interested.Yes, I would recommend, but stress that it is unique to other freshmen seminars in that it is a heavier work load.",
    "Any freshman should take it in a heart beat. You'll see why we see crime in certain ways or how we've gone back and forth in our view point on crime.",
    "Overall, a good intro to Sociology within the scope (as described by \"Social Control and Criminal Justice\"). Most of the work for each class was just readings of various texts and sociological journal articles. They could be long and dry but were interesting for the most part. The graded workload was decent: a book review of 1500 words, a midterm, a final, and a final research paper of 3000-4000 words (though some people went way overboard). I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Sociology and looking for a lighter workload. The most annoying thing was the time class took place (WF 2:30-3:45).",
    "Sociology 041 is an experience any student shouldn't pass up. So long as you don't procrastinate on your research papers, everything will go very smoothly.",
    "Sociology was a good class as a freshman. The small class size really helped discussions and Professor Smith promotes a very interactive environment. I personally did not find some of the material as interesting as my peers. I would recommend the class however because it is a good introduction to sociology.",
    "I would heavily recommend this course to a student who wants an introduction to sociology. I would also recommend it as it was a fun class. On the other hand, this class is focused on social control and criminal justice and although you learn a lot about general sociological theory, it is very focused to this region of sociology.",
    "If you're looking for lively verging on eccentric, Professor Smith is the professor for you. He enjoys playing \"spin the pen\" when it comes to answering summary questions about the reading, so expect to find yourself in the hot seat occasionally. I've found you can get away with reading introduction, conclusion and skimming topic sentences for most of the readings, though. When it comes to midterms and finals he's relatively lenient; essays less so, but overall I was happy with his grading. Best part: all test answers are in bullet point format.In sum, lots of reading, lots of class participation, but if you put a decent effort in you'll do well. I definitely would not suggest taking this course unless you are interested in the material.",
    "It is interesting if you like the readings (check the syllabus maybe), but he classes themselves can be dry. He sometimes seems to be trying to feed you answers.",
    "I would recommend it. The course offers a wide range of readings, an insight to sociology. Its interesting though a lot of the content you feel is common sense once it is explained. Workload is not heavy the readings are most interesting but you have to do them. Most of the interest comes from discussion and he will call you out if you don't join in and will know if you havn't read the text.. you feel like an idiot. So read the text you will be fine. The exam is easy enough if you have done the readings and taken part in the discussion. There is an essay component which is stressful but the grading seems very generous.",
    "This is a good but not fantastic class. It felt dry at times, and Professor Smith asks a lot of leading questions which prevented really satisfying class discussions.",
    "Sociology 041 was an excellent class. It was challenging but if you put in the work, it's extremely rewarding. Texts read in class are very interesting and also great general knowledge that's good to know. Professor Smith is an brilliant teacher.",
    "Interesting and useful material dealing with social theory. Entertaining professor although the lectures could be a little bit monotonous at times. He does a very good job of making concepts understandable.",
    "This is an excellent course. The seminar setting really allows you to grapple with and master the ideas put forth. And anyone with the slightest interest in death, or executions (and I think that is all of us) will find it fascinating."
