   "comments": [
    "This was a good class. I learned a lot. Quite easy at the beginning, problem sets get longer as the semester goes on.",
    "It was kind of a gut math class. This class probably won't provide you wih the tools to do well in partial differential equations or give you any great insights into math. It will provide you wih some basic tools to solve some ODEs.",
    "Good intro to differential equations",
    "If you have to take differential equations, take this over the engineering offering.",
    "Math 246 is a good 200-level math course and serves as a good prelude to partial differential equations, which I have heard is a bit more difficult. In presenting the material, Professor Osipov does a good job of explaining how the subject relates to other fields. If you are a math major and want to really understand differential equations, I would recommend taking this course and then partial differential equations as opposed to the combined ENAS version. If possible, take this course with Professor Osipov - he explains the material very clearly!",
    "Boring. I cannot say if it will be helpful in the future. I do not recommend it really.",
    "This is a great introduction to ordinary differential equations. The workload is very manageable and the material is interesting. Prof. Osipov is really helpful and enthusiastic about the material.",
    "It's a typical math course. It doesn't involve too much physics like the ENAS course, so it's not as difficult and doesn't have as many application problems. Take it for the credit.",
    "This class is a straightforward introduction to ordinary differential equations. Easy to understand and follow along. I felt like I actually got a lot out of the class, I'd certainly recommend it.",
    "This is a class that is worth taking if you enjoy mathematics and are looking to apply it. Osipov is a solid lecturer and the midterm exam wasn't hard. The final was pretty hard, but he did give us warning that he would make it difficult. The problem sets sometimes get very tedious and long, but I think that's just part and parcel of differential equations in general. Unfortunately the course didn't teach Fourier Series, which I think would have been very useful, but Osipov assures us that it appears in many different courses so you should pick it up somewhere else pretty easily.",
    "MATH 246 is a very well-taught introduction to differential equations. Professor Osipov is a very clear lecturer and his lecture notes are easy to read and understand. The class is taught pretty slowly so it is easy to understand everything and the workload is pretty light up until problem set 7. In Math246 with Professor Osipov, the focus is mainly solving ODEs with minimal proofs about theory behind it. The lecture has a good balance of example problems and theoretical proofs while the problem sets and tests almost exclusively focus on solving ODEs similar to the ones we went over in class. The class is very light in terms of workload. Professor Osipov uploads a practice midterm and final that are almost identical to the actual midterm and final in terms of types of questions. However, the practice final was significantly easier technically than the actual final. I would definitely recommend this class because the lectures are great (although probably optional) and the workload is pretty light until the last few weeks."
