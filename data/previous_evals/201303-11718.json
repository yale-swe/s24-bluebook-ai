    "Yes. Wait until you can take this course with Nordhaus. As a senior, this is by far the most enjoyable econ lecture I've taken here. It's fantastically taught. Nordhaus gets really into his teaching and is truly gifted at presenting the material in an accessible light. The material is much easier than intermediate micro, and it's far more relevant. Problem sets are short and easy. The paper is annoying. It's hard to not get engaged in lectures, which are actually enjoyable. One caveat to keep in mind is his long-lasting love affair with Janet Yellen; just know that he's a Keynesian and adores the Fed so take his lectures on current events with a grain of salt.",
    "yes; also required for major",
    "I would recommend Econ 122 for any students broadly interested in economics, and specifically in understanding many of the most important economic issues of our time: the financial crisis, the Eurozone, etc..",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Interesting and relevant class. Lectures were entertaining but not terribly informative. Paper took longer than expected. Pset and midterm questions were somewhat vague and confusing.",
    "Interesting if you could keep up",
    "*Take it only if you need it for your major.",
    "This review probably isn't relevant for you, because if you're an econ major you have to take this class, and if you are not, you probably won't get in because of the cap. Overall, it was a good course. I wish I had been able to take it earlier in my time as an econ major - it might have led me to take more macro-based courses later - and I'm not sure if it lived up to the hype that you should \"wait to take ECON 122 with Professor Nordhaus,\" as everyone told me. That said, it is an interesting course and it tries to mix theory and applications to current policy concerns, like the Great Recession and the Euro Crisis.",
    "The course work is pretty difficult, and I would not take it if you are not an econ major.",
    "Take it if you have to otherwise just take intro macro if you want to learn general macro concepts. Nordhaus does a pretty good job of explaining concepts. Get a good TA and actually attend section as you will learn a lot in section that you wouldn't have learnt in lecture.",
    "This has been my favorite core class of the Econ major. It's manageable, even without too much of a calculus background. I understand far more about the macroeconomy than I did a few month ago, and I actually enjoyed the learning process.",
    "Nordhaus is great - he makes macroeconomics interesting. He's entertaining and engaging - definitely take it with him.",
    "You probably have to take this and may have heard that Nordhaus is the best professor, but I found the course to be really disorganized and poorly taught. He tried to cover a lot of material and ended up covering none of it very well. It seemed like every lecture had a few slides with mid-level formulas and models, but was mainly a qualitative discussion of how nobody really knows what causes certain things (and then on the final, we were asked to use those models to determine what we agreed nobody knows). The psets aren't bad at all and the midterm was pretty fair, and the final paper was an interesting exercise. The final exam itself was a really poor evaluation of what we learned. A little less dry than your typical core econ class, a little easier than intermediate micro, but you'll learn less than you would other classes.",
    "Not an easy class, but compared to intermediate Micro, it was more manageable. For less math-loving econ majors, it's easier to understand. Nonetheless it requires a lot of review to understand the concepts.Although Nordhaus doesn't always explain all of the concepts and the intuition behind them very clearly all the time, he does most of the time.The class was much more enjoyable because he was able to relate the concepts to today and present them in a more engaging manner than most econ lecturers.If you're an econ major I'd recommend it, if not, only take it if you really want to",
    "Econ 122 with Professor Nordhaus is the best class in the Econ core sequence, hands-down. Some of the material from Intro Macro returns, and comes back in much more interesting forms, since we can actually use calculus to make sense of macroeconomic theory. Professor Nordhaus is a great lecturer, and is very good about discussing current macro issues at the beginning of each class. I also had a great TA - Sebastian Heise. In summary, I learned a LOT in the class about how macro truly shows you how the world functions, and I can't wait to learn more!",
    "DEFINITELY take Intermediate Macroeconomics with Nordhaus if you manage to get in! He is a wonderful Professor, really cares about student's understanding of the content. I love the fact that he cares more about intuition of macro rather than models. I came in the class without a solid grasp of macroeconomics and by the end I could read and understand papers and news easily. Super Applicable class, workload is not bad at all, psets took less than 3 hours to be finished! It is one of those strange classes where you do not do much work, but still learn TONS! Don't be put off by the paper! I actually ended up enjoying writing it a lot. (it is really rewarding to realize that the models you learn in class can be directly used to explain events in real life!)",
    "The course was good, talked about relevant macroeconomic topics. It's a bit overrated, I waited 3 years to take it with professor Nordhaus, putting a lot of my academic plans behind. I probably should have taken it in the spring just to get it over with.",
    "I don't know how it is without Nordhaus",
    "If you have to take Econ 122 I definitely recommend taking it with Nordhaus.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is fascinated by monetary policy, or economic policy in general. It is the best required econ class I have taken for the major, and I thoroughly enjoyed studying for the exams. The lectures occasionally went on for too long.",
    "Good course, especially for an econ core class at Yale, which are usually really dry. Strengths are its real world applications, all relating to really relevant things. Weaknesses was that Nordhaus and Mankiw didn't really agree on the whole LM and MP thing, and it was just really hard to follow.",
    "I would recommend this class. You have to take it for the major and Nordhaus is a better professor than the others, so you mind as well take it with him. Also, it gives you a really good understanding of many of the different economic things that are going on in the news right now. Some advice: The midterm was heavily based off of the psets so be ready for that. Also, note that the second half of the course picks up the pace a bit, so it becomes a challenge to learn everything in time for the final (plan accordingly).",
    "It is an overview of the major theories that have developed in Macroeconomics over the past 100 years.",
    "It is a required course, so take it only if you are an economics major. Otherwise it is pretty boring and you learn very little. It is frustrating course with entirely too much work and material that is not taught well in class - so you will have to rely on the TA\/TF. Again, I would not recommend it unless you are an economics major and have to take it.",
    "Take it",
    "Econ 122 is a very important class to take, even if you are not an econ major. I would strongly recommend it as it allows you to understand many aspects on international trade as well as macroeconomics that any informed citizen would benefit from knowing. It is not a very hard class but the material is by far the most interesting of any other similar economics class at yale.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Good course pretty tough though.",
    "Intermediate Macro is a required class. If you are interested in the subject, you will have a blast, as Professor Nordhaus makes everything incredibly relevant and brings up up-to-date macro methods (say goodbye to the IS-LM curve, for example). If you are not interested in the subject, it's a required class.",
    "Definitely recommended, great course overall: one of the few econ classes at Yale that really motivated me to look at real world issues and policies using what we learn in class. Nordhaus really tried to connect the models and theories to recent events, and problem set\/exam questions as well as the final paper all complemented such efforts. The paper was an especially fun experience: first time ever to write an econ paper, but it turned out to be pretty rewarding. One of the best things about this class is that the TAs were superb (at least this year), especially Jeff and Sebastian: best TA experience ever at Yale in all aspects. Overall, if you want\/have to take macro, take it with Nordhaus for sure.",
    "Econ 122 will provide you with a good understanding of key macroeconomic concepts and will be useful every time you read the newspaper or want to understand what the Fed does. Definitely a useful class. In terms of the amount of work, instructor's style, etc. I thought that it was pretty comparable to other economics courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Chances are you have to take this class as an econ major if you are shopping it, but it is one that I really enjoyed. It explains what is going on in the economic world today, and it is nice to understand the Fed policies. One of the better Econ classes I've taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 122 to any student who is majoring in Econ or who wants to better understand how the economy works today. Professor Nordhaus does a great job of tying the ,doles to current events. Problem sets and midterm weren't that bad, but the final was pretty stressful. Also, Nordhaus is really serious about cheating. During the final, he took pictures of the auditorium to see who people sat next to, in case their tests looked similar. So don't cheat.",
    "Yes you would have to take it for Economics major anyways. There is one midterm, one final, a final paper of 1000 words, and weekly problem sets. The workload isn't bad but he loves current world issues and applying them to macroeconomic theories so make sure you're on top of that.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "It was great. A fantastic class. A real hoot. Definitely take this class.",
    "Take Macro with Nordhaus if you're able to. He's a really great professor - can explain things clearly, is very knowledgeable about macro, and ties it back to real life by using the most recent data and discussing current events. Sebastian is an awesome TA.",
    "Very fascinating and up to date",
    "Best of the required econ courses",
    "This class was pretty difficult. I heard that it might be easier to take it in the fall than in the spring, so I chose to do it. Afterwards, I'm not sure if it's true or not. Regardless, I guess my understanding of macro was improved, and Nordhaus is pretty fun and goofy in lecture. Only take it if you need to.",
    "Take it",
    "Your standard intermediate macroeconomics class. Covers everything from interest rates and the fed to closed vs. open economies, and everything fits together into a larger picture by the end. Nordhaus is an amazing professor, so take the course with him if you can. I would recommend the course to anyone, even non-economic majors who are at all interested in learning about the details of the economy.",
    "Nordhaus is a somewhat dry lecturer, and can be obscure at times, but the material is very solid and you will come out with important tools that are necessary to understanding econ in the real world. Take it if you need it.",
    "ECON 122 is a requirement if you are an Economics major. I would recommend taking it with Professor Nordhaus. While he's not the best lecturer I've ever had, he does a good job of providing relevant examples for the course material and connecting what you are learning to current events. The course consists of eight problem sets (which aren't too difficult or time-consuming), a midterm and final exam (which are fair), and a final paper. The textbook is a good supplementary resource.",
    "If you're an Econ major you have to take this - it is more interesting and relevant than Micro. 8 problem sets, midterm, 1000 word paper, and final exam.",
    "This class is pretty tough class and unless you need it I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "It's a great course, but very challenging.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class if you want to be able to understand the world in terms of the flow of money. It will help you understand the economic news.",
    "If you are majoring in econ, you have to take this, but otherwise if you are fascinated in econ I would recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was definitely the best required econ class I have taken to date. You learn about things that anyone interested in policy--not only economic--should know.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Econ 132 is the first time, as an Econ student, the models we learnt made intuitive sense and fit together to illuminate the workings of actual economies. That made it an incredibly rewarding experience. The topics we covered really gave you a grounding across a variety of important subjects, and also built up a real understanding of the history of Economics (the whole classical\/Keynesian divide) and what economics really entails. However, on occasion the material got slightly convoluted or didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit together properly and some \u00e2\u0080\u009chand waving\u00e2\u0080\u009d was required, which was disappointing. Also, no one really agrees upon what Economics is or what it can explain, so the whole thing is really one huge debate with no firm conclusions.",
    "You can get a good grasp of the Macro Economy. Take it!",
    "Take ECON 122 is you're at all interested in macroeconomics. It's well-taught and relevant to what we read in the news.",
    "Recommended if you need it for the major (obviously)...not a huge pain to take...by the end of the term, I felt like I had really learned quite a bit",
    "If you're going to take this, take it with Nordhaus. I waited a semester just so I could take it with him, as did many of my friends. It only takes a brief perusal of his wikipedia page to confirm that this man knows his macro. That aside, I disagree with how the course is taught in that you don't learn the evolution of macroeconomic theory i.e. repudiation of the Phillips Curve, how \"rational expectations\" came into being, etc and how they related to real world events. The way we learn macro is more along the lines of Nordhaus introduces the concept, draws a few graphs, and then derives the equation. Would have preferred to hear more of the historical background, less a set of variables and equations, and more a representation of physical phenomenon.Not a hard course, math is almost trivial. Curve will take care of you if all else fails.",
    "Overall, a great course.",
    "Prof. Nordhaus is awesome but take the class seriously, it's a hard class.",
    "Cool course, definitely my favorite of the (3) introductory sequence courses I've taken here. Nordhaus is a good lecturer, and we had really good TAs this year.",
    "Good overview of macroeconomic questions of modern day. Really relevant, very interesting, and really important. I would suggest that students take this class even if they aren't an Econ\/EPE major - which I would never do for a lot of other econ classes, especially ones required by the major\/non-electives. This is SO much better than intro macro, and really important material that is presented well.",
    "Probably you're taking this for your major - Nordhaus' class was only open to Junior and Seniors in the major anyhow. It's a pretty basic intermediate macro class. Take it."
