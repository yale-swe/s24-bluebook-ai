    "Cell Bio 900 is the mandatory class that the department makes you take to fulfill grant requirements like ethics training. If it were not required, I would not recommend the course, as generally it provides no benefit.",

    "No; I really don't think this course should be required beyond rotation& faculty talks; I don't think it was a good use of time. But they won't have a choice!",

    "Generally this course did not deepen my knowledge of my profession, nor contribute to my research beyond the opportunity to present my rotation research.",
    "It was great that we were able to give presentations. It was nice to hear about everyone else's work and to be able to hone my own presentation skills.",
    "It was helpful to get to know the professors during faculty talks (the 'happy hour' afterwords was a great idea); and to practice presentation skills. Otherwise I feel that it did not contribute to my training.",
    "did help to go over nsf proposals. most of the other classes were not that helpful though.",
    "It was occasionally informative, but not always.",
    "This course helped me to discover the resources that are available at Yale during my graduate studies."
