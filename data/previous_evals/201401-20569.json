   "comments": [
    "Fun class! Lots of reading but all of it is really interesting.",
    "NOT A HISTORY CLASS!!!!! ONLY TAKE THIS IF YOU LOVE RUSSIA AND NO ABOUT RUSSIAN HISTORY AND DON'T CARE THAT IT IS AWFUL.",
    "Don't take it unless you are very passionate about Russia. There are much better history classes to take, but if you love Russia and all things Russian culture this is the class for you. If you don't know a lot about Russia, skip it.",
    "Fascinating class, but really have to do the reading",
    "Yes! Easy history credit. Midterm is fairly tough but you can get an A if you read the book. Final paper topic has lots of wiggle room.",
    "recommend! one midterm and the choice of a final paper or exam",
    "lots of readings and russian studies majors",
    "Absolutely take it. Russian culture is fascinating, Russian history is fascinating, and MacKay and Bushkovitch are great. Just take the class - you won't regret it.",
    "At first, I was a bit skeptical about covering Russian culture from the 19th century to the 1980s, but I was amazed by this course. In just one semester, Professor Bushkovitch and MacKay managed to provide an exceptional overview of Russian culture, with enough depth, intricacy, detail and specificity. It's use of a variety of mediums, including painting, music, literature, philosophy, etc., paired with historical context is phenomenal. There is a fair bit of reading, but the lectures cover a lot of the important information and details. A wonderful course that I would suggest to anyone with either a passion in Russian, or just an interest in taking a dynamic history course.",
    "Really great cultural history course. There's quite a lot of reading, but it's interesting and diverse and the rest of the workload (4 reading responses for section, a midterm, and a final or 10-12 page paper) is light. Both the professors are wonderful, and you'll learn a lot about the general trajectory of Russian history and culture, with a focus on the nineteenth century.",
    "Highly recommended. I took it to fulfill a Humanities requirement and it ended up being my favorite class this semester. Fascinating and well structured. Great lectures, wonderful readings, and a remarkably readable textbook written by one of the professors.",
    "If you need a relatively low-work class, go for this. Only do it if you're already interested in some aspect of Russian culture. Overall, pretty good class!",
    "This was a great course. Both professors were experts in their field and the way the course combined culture and history was truly exciting. The workload is pretty manageable and the more readings you do the more fun lecture will be. I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in Russian history.",
    "Great class if you like history but also care about how Russians lived throughout it.",
    "I certainly recommend this course. You will learn Russian culture and history and read very interesting materials.",
    "definitely. great class if you like cultural history and if you want to understand Russia and its past."
