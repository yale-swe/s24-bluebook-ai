    "My knowledge of classical Japanese and ability to parse and understand it on my own developed tremendously during this course. When I started the course, I was familiar with the different grammatical structures, but relied very heavily on the professor to explain context and how the grammatical structures were actually translated within the text. However, after taking this class, although still not perfect, I'm able to much more confidently translate texts on my own with no aid other than my knowledge of classical Japanese. I have also learned a lot about different authors in Japan as well as the progress of literature through Japanese history. As we translated texts, I was also able to learn about the cultural context in which the text was situated."

    "If you are interested in Japanese language and culture and are familiar with the grammatical structures of classical Japanese, this is an amazing course with which to improve your skills. It has a relatively low work load and the classroom environment is very low stress. There are only a few students and the class generally progresses at whatever speed suits the students the best."
