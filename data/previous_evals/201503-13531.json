    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Communication between all teaching assistants and the course instructors was very poor. Understanding of project expectations between the teaching assistants and the course instructors was greatly varied and on both sides the extent of work that we were supposed to be doing was unclear.",
    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Although the teaching assistant (Alex) was nice and willing to help, the instructions for the field activities and lab work were not formally provided (written guidelines). This led sometimes to contradicting information from TAs, and led us to make important mistakes on the sampling procedures that affected the quality of our work. I would recommend to formalize the guidelines for the field and lab work.",
    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Our TA walked us to our field site each friday, and helped us once or twice in lab. Mostly we relied on Clara who was also a bit difficult to reach and get clear instructions from, but we really enjoyed her.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0It seemed like the teaching assistants as a whole had as little idea what was going on most of the time.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was very helpful and accessible. I think all of the TAs could have benefited from a little more communication with the professors. It felt like sometimes the TAs didn't have much better idea than we did regarding project assignments. Some of the lab days could be a little more organized. Sometimes the lab times were a little disorganzied and could have been more productive. Overall this wasn't specific to Clara, this was just for the lab sessions in general.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was very responsive and accessible. Not always clear with the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was always very nice and open to help us. Nevertheless, I feel like the lab work was very disorganized as well as the final project. The field trips were confusing because I didn't really understand the goal of what we were doing. There was not a connection between classes and what we were doing in the field.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was very responsive, available when needed, and explained concepts clearly and thoroughly, particularly in the lab.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0The professors had a very unclear role for the TAs, so these are difficult questions to answer. They assisted with field and lab work and answered questions in an ad-hoc manner, but their aid to the overall class seemed a bit sporadic and unorganized. There was a clear lack of communication between the TAs and the professors, and the TAs often either did not understand what the professors wanted or had told us, or knew far more about an assignment than the professors had told the students. Although I really liked this class, this was my #1 frustration with the course. It felt generally disorganized at times and like we were only given information on what was happening one step ahead, never multiple steps ahead. For the final project in particular, understanding expectations was very challenging.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was very helpful, accessible, and nice.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was extremely helpful with the lab component of this class. She explained new concepts, and offered to help walk through the data analysis component of our assignment once we began grappling with it. I very much appreciated Clara, as well as the other TFs.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Clara was accessible, approachable, personable and was a pleasure to work with. However, the lab sessions were not very well organized. Given the limited lab equipment and number of people in the class, the sessions could have been organized more efficiently.",
    "Instructor: Clara Christina Pregitzer \u00a0Sometimes there was a disconnect between the professors and the TAs. This led to some confusion about what expectations were.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0She was very willing to help, which we greatly appreciated. However, being more confident would allow her to be a better guide to students.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly was very helpful for the final project - very available and offered great guidance. However, the TAs only seemed to be 'on call' for the final project - not for any other aspects of the course.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly was especially helpful with our final project and went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly was responsive to emails when we really needed assistance on our final project, from sending us detailed guidance on draft write-ups and specific scientific literature.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly Aho served as the teaching fellow for my lab group. She was phenomenal and always available to provide extra help. She was approachable and very fun to work with."

    "I think the course started very organized but as the months went by the class seemed very disorganized. The lectures were sometimes not posted on time. I really didn't understand what was the main goal of the field trips and the final projects until the end. Also, I have a lot of questions regarding my projects and it would have been nice to have individual meetings with the professors to clear up all of the questions that came up when doing the final project and other projects.",
    "Field trips (Friday field and lab work) were very disorganized -- there was not clear communication about what we were supposed to be doing, collecting, analyzing, etc. It also seemed like the instructors and TAs weren't communicating closely about what we were supposed to be doing.",
    "The course work was extremely useful and interesting. However, at most times the students were left to do their own literature review to understand concepts and make carbon budgets, for example. I hoped to have more guidance on how to construct a carbon budget (the main project of the course). When in the field, we were not given an overview of the entire project and how we must work towards building the budget and how our field work ties into the greater objectives of the course. There was little communication on part of the professors and often we simply did as we thought right.",
    "The concepts were helpful to understand before beginning other coursework at FES",
    "With respect to the pace of the class, I felt that the first half of the class was a bit too fast.",
    "The lectures themselves were very clear. However, the explanations for assignments and preparation for lab work was often minimal. We found ourselves scrambling to catch-up during precious lab time, which was frustrating when so many subsequent assignments were based on the work we conducted in the field.",
    "This course is fantastic, but at times it doesn't run as smoothly as it might. The professors did not always seem to work together when planning assignments. Beyond that, I loved the class. I especially enjoyed the group work field\/research component, and the fact that professors were hands off until we needed their help. This level of work is appropriately challenging for graduate school.",
    "As someone with ZERO ecology know-how, there was a lot of new and complicated information for me to learn quickly during this course. Biogeochemistry was especially hard, but it was easier as we applied it to our field sites and other ecosystems. I really enjoyed the last quarter of the semester when we introduced humans and animals into the carbon cycle.",
    "Q 14 - The course was great overall but the lab sessions were not efficiently organized and there was often lack of or unclear communication."

   "comments": [
    "The final products were very worthwhile and made the course come together. It is easy to see how this fits into a real world application.",
    "I thought the exposure to scientific literature through literature review for projects and reading assignments debate made me much more comfortable reading peer-reviewed papers.",
    "Discussions lead by instructors Raymond and Schmitz. This class represented one of the few chances, in the classroom or outside, at FES were students were challenged on their positions and in position to challenge each other.",
    "I learned a lot from the professors. I think the overall content in the course was very valuable for me. I also liked that the point of the course was not have a good grade but to understand the big picture of what the professors were trying to teach us. I think it is very valuable that they taught us how to read scientific research papers.",
    "I enjoyed the days spent in the field the most. Because the class is so collaborative, venturing out into the field really helped build a strong team dynamic. I also enjoyed class discussions, which helped me view environmental challenges from a multitude of perspectives.",
    "How the concepts were linked together to give an understanding of how ecosystems function, and the many interrelations between their components.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the class lectures and discussions in the second half of the semester. Os really starts to push the course towards thinking about actual management scenarios and how to make decisions among different management options. This went from being my least favorite and hardest course for the first half of the semester to the most useful and favorite class by the end of the semester. Some of the assignments (paper critiques, management plans for an ecosystem) were practical and useful.",
    "Group projects and presentations.",
    "The course content.",
    "I benefitted the most from reading high level science and extracting essential information from it in the process of doing paper critiques. Although tim consuming, this activity is definitely worth the effort. I also like the applied field worked and doing sampling for collecting data. This exercise helped me build up confidence as environmental manager.",
    "I really appreciate that the class went in-depth on certain ecological concepts and allow us through multiple assignments and class projects to learn that content very thoroughly instead of skimming it superficially. Writing scientific critiques was at first challenging but a very helpful exercise, as were the group projects.",
    "Lectures that were best able to combine concepts discussed into applied case studies-- for example wolves in Yellowstone",
    "I really liked the lectures on teleconnections and discussions on how human management in different ecosystems can",
    "Getting more experience with understanding and critiquing scientific articles and experimental design was very helpful. I appreciated both professors' flexibility in altering the schedule for assignments when they perceived people in the class were especially stressed. You don't see that often, and personally it helped a great deal. I also appreciated class discussions about environmental values and decision-making.",
    "I enjoyed working in the field, and how our lab work slowly pieced together an in-depth understanding of our system. I also greatly enjoyed the discussions on scientific literature, and the guidance provided in analyzing this type of writing.",
    "Again, I loved the group work. The professors set high expectations, but they were readily available to help when asked. I really appreciated this, and the chance to work with my peers on a project that mostly spanned the duration of the semester.",
    "I liked the field trips, but these meant we had to meet at 8 am every single friday....rough!",
    "The best aspects of the course came about in the second half of the semester. The first have seemed very disjointed and confusing, but it was clear the the professors were more interested in what was being taught in the second half. I learned a lot about systems work and the environmental field as a whole that I had not know going into this class, so that was a huge take away. I really loved learning about environmental ethics as well."

   "comments": [
    "The communication between the instructors and the students was very poor. Due dates of assignments were rarely clear and expectations for projects were vague.",
    "The number of field trips didn't bother me but there were a couple lab sessions that didn't seem completely necessary or very organized and productive. Due to availability of lab equipment we wouldn't be there very long and would have to come back on our own time anyway, so not very much would be accomplished. I recognize I'm biased because I was trying to get out of New Haven to spend the weekends with my wife and daughter who live two hours away.",
    "Field trips and lab work was very disorganized. We spent a lot of time waiting to do our work, there no clear instruction on the taks we were supposed to do.",
    "Communication with the class about project expectations and with the TAs about what the end result of our project is going to be. Good communications in all areas except final project goals and outcomes.",
    "Organization",
    "This course could benefit from more organizationclearly defined assignments, deadlines, and expectations.",
    "It was a little disorganised at times, but never to much so as to greatly affect our learning.",
    "I felt like there was a big disconnect between the professors and students for the first half of the semester. I felt like everyone was very lost in the discussions, but didn't even know what questions to ask. Regarding field trips - while it was great to be out in the field the first half of the semester while the weather was nicer, we also understood so much less about what we were collecting and why. I think we could have been much more thoughtful about our experiment design and sampling had we been further along in the course. If that's not an option, at least having more instructor guidance or input into the field work would have been helpful. The course load overall was much heavier than other courses. In particular, towards the end of the semester we were working on our final projects but also had separate group project assignments due, and that workload (two concurrent group projects in the same class) felt much less manageable.",
    "Guidelines during projects preparation, specially because many of us didn't have relevant background related with the course of study.",
    "The course needs definitely a more formal framework for the field and lab work. Written instructions and method descriptions would help. I also thought that at the beginning of the course, the contents may be a bit imbalanced towards biogeochemistry. Although it is good to have this perspective, the strength of this course should remain on ecological theory, and this wasnt always the case. Also, the biogeochemistry side of the course was similarly covered in the Science to Solutions class, which I thought it was too much overlap.",
    "The beginning of the course felt a bit disorganized and casual. However, as time went on it felt more and more like the professors were invested in the course and students and it became more interesting. But the communication with and utilization of TAs seemed fairly poor. The final project in particular felt like a bit of a mess. It wasn't clear when we collected samples in the field what on earth we were collecting them for, how they'd be processed to produce data, and how we'd use that data later to write a report. Thus, it was impossible to design a good sample because we had very little context for what we were doing. Lab time was completely disorganized, with everyone needing the same equipment at the same time. The whole process was frustrating. However, it was also incredibly valuable and would be the best part of the class had communication been clearer.",
    "Organization and communication with the students over course expectations and deadlines for assignments and group projects should be clarified",
    "There should be an explicit overview of the final assignment in the first week of class or whenever the first field trip to the Richardson property is. It was extremely difficult to understand what we were supposed to be doing in the field on our 2nd and 3rd visits without specific guidance on the final outcomes and required data points. Knowing about the details ahead of time would have drastically helped us plan better in the beginning of the course. All the guidance we received in the field was mainly from our TA so in the future I recommend the professors review it earlier in class to allow for Q&A.",
    "I know this will be a recurring theme in comments, but I echo it as well: I felt that for many of the big assignments in the class there wasn't clear enough direction given. Sometimes each professor gave contradictory information about what to do when contacted.",
    "We could have used a lot more guidance on what our lab work entailed. I felt as if we were thrown into the field to soon, without adequate preparation to dive into the work. It was also unclear how this work was going to contribute to future assignments. A better understanding of this would have kept us from spinning our wheels and allowed us to be more organized throughout our work.",
    "At times, assignments felt slightly disjointed. I would love to see a description of final project expectations or maybe even examples at the beginning of the semester. Our first day in the field wasn't as smooth as it could have been, but overall this was still a very valuable experience.",
    "Needs to be better organized. Between 2 professors and 3 TA's, no one knew what was going on.",
    "Organizing the lab sessions better so that students can maximize time with the equipment and minimize waiting around. The groups could have been split up between two sessions instead of everyone waiting around",
    "The work load for this course is quite large, especially for a foundations class. I spent more time on assignments for this class than for any other class. The final project also could be explained better. If we had known all the details of what the final report required we could have better tailored our field methods so that we had all the data we needed. I also thought that the third round of the ecosystem assignment (addition of animals) was poorly timed. It was only minutely different than the second paper (focused on manipulating the system), and it was due shortly before the final project so we were not able to focus on the larger project for the amount of time that we would have liked."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, although the intro lecture made it seem as though we would be introduced to specific ecosystems. Instead the class was very heavy on nutrient cycling. I guess I didn't realize that this was really how ecology is executed.",
    "Yes. It felt less organized and structured than other foundations courses, but I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. We had to deal with a little more uncertainty and I think this frustrated some students but it models the real world more closely where projects aren't given to with perfectly clear expectations all the time.",
    "Yes",
    "I think I could have learned more from my projects but I have a lot of unanswered questions",
    "Yes. Because class material was built up and applied, a lot of the concepts really sunk in.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. So far, I think this will prove to be the most important class I will have taken at FES. I have a much better understanding of trophic dynamics, primary production, and things to consider when evaluating different management options.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. My expectations were met.",
    "Yes. I feel like this course effectively taught me basis scientific concepts and skills, and foundations of ecology. It was both my most frustrating and my favorite class.",
    "I learned more practical skill than I thought I would.",
    "I felt that some of our final assignments were an enormous amount of work for what I got out of them.",
    "Yes, I actually learned more than I expected during the course of this class.",
    "now I can actually read and understand a journal article.",
    "For the most part."

   "comments": [
    "Real life skills but very time consuming and frustrating when some group members didn't follow through on work they had committed to doing.",
    "Great group work but bad communication with TAs.",
    "I learned a lot from my teammates.",
    "While I enjoyed both of my working groups in the course, I unfortunately had several group members who did not pull their weight in the group and barely showed up for team meetings. While it's difficult to predict this when selecting group members, for the most part I greatly enjoyed working with my groups and found that I learned a lot from my fellow classmates.",
    "Advantages: Learning teamwork skills, particularly in a team with members from different nationalities, cultures, backgrounds, and strengths. Disadvantages: I feel we were unprepared to carry our the work we were expected to do during our first day of field-work.",
    "I learned a lot from the rest of the team members. Applied knowledge and consolidate ideas achieving our team goals. Improved my group organization and communication skills. Made new friends.",
    "The group work contributed to my learning. I would prefer to work with only one group during the course, having 2 simultaneous groups led to confusions at some point.",
    "There was a lot of group work in the course, and coordinating to meet with all group members was a challenge, particularly toward the end of the semester",
    "Near the end of the semester it was difficult to juggle both the small ecosystem group project with the larger class final project since the two assignments were overlapping in their due dates.",
    "Group work allowed us to complete a very large project that would be impossible on our own. However, our lab group members had varying degrees of dedication to our project which became frustrating and led to drastic discrepancies in the amount of work done by each member. We also had several members away at COP for two weeks at a crucial time in the semester. It was also difficult having two lines of group projects with two different groups at one time. Group work often takes longer, and it is difficult to schedule group meetings.",
    "I've covered this in previous responses, but the group work component was in my opinion the most valuable part of this class. I worked in a relatively large group where members often had different previous experiences or ideas about how to tackle problems. We were forced to compromise and work together in order to complete our assignment, which is a critical skill for our continued education and also into our careers.",
    "I had a love\/hate relationship with this. First, it really helped me get to know some classmates and a lot of the projects were difficult and seriously required the brain-power and know-how of multiple talents. There was, however, someone in each group that was seriously absent\/slacking\/annoying."

   "comments": [
    "The course is takes a lot of time but the final products are worthwhile.",
    "Involves managing a few different projects and assignments simultaneously which can be challenging, but in the end I feel much more comfortable with scientific literature and areas of debate than I was before.",
    "Take it if you do not have a background in ecology or ecosystems science.",
    "Don't fall behind in the readings and in the final project",
    "Dear future students, while this is a very time intensive course, eventually things come together. Set expectations for team members and hold each other accountable.",
    "Do the out of class assignments.",
    "Stick with this course. Os and Pete are very receptive to feedback. It's a lot of work and can be disorganized, but ultimately the concepts are very important and worth learning!",
    "Be prepare to dedicate a lot of time to the course tema projects.",
    "This class is highly recommended as an introductory course for ecosystem science, most appropriate for incoming students focusing on conservation and land management or for other students who want to have an overview of this topic. In my case, the course was most useful for getting used to reading high level science and to critically analyze scientific papers on the field. The course also has a valuable applied side through field exercises and data collection. Both professors promoted good quality discussions in class based on the scientific readings, covering quite a big variety of topics in ecology at a global scale.",
    "Be prepared for an especially heavy workload early in the class. E-mail both professors jointly if you have questionsdon't just e-mail one or the other.",
    "Do it! Ask questions when you need to, and budget your time wisely with the final project.",
    "It's great, especially if you're working in conservation and ecosystem management.",
    "The beginning few weeks are rough, but if you stick it out what you learn will be worth it. You will also be learning from the best and form great connections."
