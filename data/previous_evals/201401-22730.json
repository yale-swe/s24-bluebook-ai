   "comments": [
    "As a member of the PEB program, you have to take this course, and it's fairly good for the most part. You'll learn a lot (unless none of it is new material for you), and it'll provide you with useful techniques you can draw upon in your independent research (e.g. 3D Printing and Modelling).",
    "For anyone interested in doing PEB, this class is one of the major reasons to decide to do it. Even if the project you work on isn't directly applicable to your interests, the skills you will gain are invaluable. It was also very useful as a chance to work with students from other backgrounds.",
    "I would recommend it. I would also warn that the semester would probably be very difficult, but that it would be worth the effort. I feel that I learned a great deal, and am excited to see where it takes me.",
    "I would recommend the class as an opportunity to explore interdisciplinary research.",
    "This class is a cool workshop where you complete 2 projects in different labs. I would recommend this to other students.",
    "It is a fun course - especially the CEID module. But, it is a lab course, and so the rigors of laboratory work come with that too (in other words, things aren't working and no one knows why).Nevertheless, it was a great team building exercise. Working with someone else was a very positive experience, mostly because it introduced perspectives or ideas that I had not considered."

   "comments": [
    "Having a chance to work in the CEID was useful as an engineer. The second project was also useful mainly in showing that I don't have interest in pursuing that topic, but it was still cool and broadened my understanding of PEB.",
    "It was a great intro to 3D printing and molecular dynamics simulations. I hope I can continue with molecular dynamics, and am currently working on developing a project with several PIs to pursue this.",
    "Although this course does not apply directly to my research, I think the problem solving skills obtained will be useful in the future.",
    "It was mostly about communication between individuals that I liked the most. It sounds very simple, but that's because it was a simple effect that will go a long way in my career."
