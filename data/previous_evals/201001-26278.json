   "comments": [
    "Well, if you're looking for a class that doesn't require a massive amount of input, this would probably be it.",
    "Probably not. I learned a lot, but only because I enjoyed some of the reading. There are better classes out there.",
    "This class is interesting because it gives you the opportunity to learn about the ancient Near East and some of the key moments in human history: the Neolithic revolution, the first empires, the development of monotheism, and the origins of the alphabet and writing.However, except for the readings you learn very little history in class--it's a lot of Prof. Weiss talking about climate and broad social phenomena.",
    "It is an archaeological look at the causes behind the rise and fall of civilization. If the student has a genuine interest in archaeology, this course would be a great place to start.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in ancient mesopotamia. It is a nice survey course that is not too difficult.",
    "This was a very interesting course that I really enjoyed. Professor Weiss clearly loves what he does and, while sometimes confusing as a lecturer, the material covered was very interesting. The first part of the course you read Jared Diamond's \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" which is an incredibly interesting read. I was just disappointed we weren't tested on more of the book material. Section is very useful to work through the important aspects of lecture. The hardest part of this course for me was the online reading. I don't mind reading hard copies of things that I can physically read and underline, but much of the reading (especially the second half of the semester) is online pdf files that would take up way too much paper and ink to print them all. Also, pay attention to the lecture pages. Quotations on the page are totally game material for the exams, so don't let that trip you up!",
    "I'm glad that I took this course, because I learned so much about the subject. But I feel as though I learned most of this information from the TAs, the reading, and online research. I would recommend this course to anybody who is ready to put in the work necessary to take full advantage of it.",
    "I would not recommend it. I think that even students who are interested in archeology found this class impossible to digest.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. The material could be interesting, but the teaching and student - teacher interaction was lacking.",
    "Would I recommend it? Yes- if you're looking for a fairly easy class which is still interesting to balance out a tough schedule.Will I summarize it?- I guess so:it covers ancient civilizations and the effect of climate change on the ancient world.",
    "Not as easy as it sounds. It really wasn't as good as I expected.",
    "The lectures are often completely off-topic for the majority of the time (hence the attendance falling almost immediately after the start of the semester) but for what is covered, it can be really interesting and make you think about the world in a different way. You get to watch some really good movies and the books are classics.",
    "This class is not that complicated when you get down to it but in the midst of taking it it gets utterly confusing. The key is not to get bogged down in small details or inconsistencies in lecture and just look at what the heck is going on. If you need a humanities credit, take it.",
    "It is an incredible course, packed with some truly inspiring knowledge about civilization. I think it's a story about the human race that everyone should try to understand.",
    "If it counts towards your major, it is a tolerable way to pick up the credit. I could be genuinely interesting at times, but Weiss' completely refusal to actually warn you about the format and nature of the tests seemed to be rather aggravating for some.",
    "Great course. Really useful info.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the material. This is by no means a gut. You have to work for your grade.",
    "No. The class has almost no work due throughout the semester, but Prof. Weiss presents the material in such a confusing way that I had no idea what was going to be on the midterm or final. The course is definitely a gut work-wise, but it ended up being hard to get a good grade in.",
    "I would recommend it if they are really interested in the middle east, the bible, or need an extra credit.",
    "If you like the idea of studying the ancient middle east, you may enjoy this class. Some of the readings are very interesting. However, Professor Weiss is very disorganized and his lectures can be tough to follow. Not a great class, but if you find the subject matter interesting, consider it.",
    "Boring, convoluted and outdated. Impossible to follow. No real order or importance. Old materials written by professor and his band of like-minded colleagues. Some interesting material can be gleaned, but History Channel would be better."
