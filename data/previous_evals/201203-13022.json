    "I definitely would recommend it; it was my favorite part of the progrm. The works we discussed were rich, the discussions themselves were always engaging, the lectures (in my opinion) were often the best in the week, and the course in general is completely fascinating!",
    "Professor LeVen is a friendly and thoughtful section leader - if you get assigned to her, definitely don't swap out of the section. She encourages close readings rather than sprawling generalizations in papers, which is a really sensible attitude. She also loves talking about \"complicating\" or \"problematic\" aspects of texts, rather than pretending they don't exist. As for the week to week lecturers, there's a lot of good stuff - Lit lectures are definitely less variable in quality than H&P or Phil lectures.",
    "Taking Directed Studies has been one of the best decisions I've made since coming to college. This section, Literature, was particularly amazing. Professor LeVen is a great section leader, extremely welcoming and knowledgable, and the texts covered in the course are fascinating. Obvious weaknesses of the program include the \"insane\" amount of reading (which, by the way, I thought was manageable, even if it was time consuming,) and the fact that you only really interact with a small group of people within the freshman class for most of your classes. However, DS is absolutely worth taking. It's the first set of courses i've ever taught me how to think.",
    "The workload, if you do it all, is absolutely as intense as they say. I recommend doing all the reading, or as much as you can! It makes discussion so much more interesting and comfortable, and makes studying for finals relatively painless. Don't take this class if you're not totally into the subject matter, close readings, and intricate discussions. It seems to me like if that stuff just isn't really your thing, D.S. will be hellish. If it is really what you love, then D.S. will be a delight.",
    "I loved this section a lot, but I would not recommend the DS program in general. The program moves far too quickly through far too much material for it to be anything but the most shallow and platitudinous of approaches to learning. If you are looking for breadth over depth, though, DS would work for you.",
    "DS Lit was my favorite of the fall DS courses. You read great stuff, so do as much of the actual reading as is humanly possible. LeVen is a marvelous section leader, she's fun to have around and gives really helpful feedback on papers.",
    "Directed Studies has a reading list that can't be beaten, but it's vital to keep up with the work. It's possible to get by doing half the reading, but reading week isn't fun then because youhave to learn the other half of the material, and you realize how much you missed out on by not reading it the first time. This class is definitely worth taking if you can invest the time in it, and maybe even if you can't.",
    "DS Lit is a really good class and I'm so glad to have taken it with Prof. LeVen. I like literature least of the three DS topics, but I enjoyed my lit section the most. Professor LeVen is very accessible and gives a lot of feedback to help you improve your writing. The class itself is well-led and Prof. LeVen brings in interesting insights to add to the discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS, especially if you have LeVen. She definitely knows her classics and Greek, and teaches you Greek along the way! She will definitely teach you how to write a good college paper by the end of your time with her!",
    "This class is a survey course in \"Western\" literature. You move through texts very quickly, but LeVen makes it so fun that you'll love it. I highly recommend this course. LeVen is not an easy grader, but you'll love her and her French accent so much that you'll just want to improve. Take it!",
    "This class was absolutely wonderful. Although it was at 9am, we always had wonderful discussions and no one ever appeared tired. The reading is interesting, the discussions are illuminating, and I feel as if I have finally begun to grasp how to write a paper. LeVen is a wonderful, caring teacher who leads discussions very well.",
    "Literature definitely fulfills on the DS promise: you trace the way the Iliad and Odyssey are found replicated with a variation in the second and first half of the Aeneid, respectively; you meet Virgil again in Dante's Inferno; you compare Oedipus's daughter to Agamemnon's son, who is in and of himself a foil for Telemachus; you read Ovid's flood myth side by side that of the Bible. In short, you follow the teleology of the Western canon from 800 BCE to 14th century Florence, and it's beautiful. Of course, when it comes down to recommendations, it's not about DS Lit. It's about DS, or not. I can't tell you that, because it's a decision only you can make, dear Reader. I would advise you to try at least the first semester, and see what you like or dislike about it. It really isn't that much work, especially if you structure your time well, and I disliked the culture of \"oh we're so miserable on Thursday nights\"; other people, of course, found friendship and solidarity in those moments of shared misery. For some people, DS is a really great chance to learn to do college writing; for others, it's a chance to hone a skill they've already been taught, and only you know how well prepared you are for college and whether you'd want to be learning new things. The second semester is \"better\" than the first, people say, but it's also the most disjointed, because the Western canon explodes, and you can't chart an easy path anymore. If that path was the reason to do DS rather than a philosophy class, a literature class, and a polisci class, then certainly do the first semester, and then decide how you feel.",
    "If summarizing Directed Studies: Literature to a fellow student, I would first make clear to them that, unlike what they may expect, this course is probably NOT at all like their high school English classes. Aside from the obvious differences - the fast pace of the class, the heavier reading load, the emphasis on class discussion - the biggest difference is in the way students are taught to think and write about literature. At least for me in high school, there was never a \"wrong\" answer in English class. Whether speaking in class or writing an essay, I could pretty much make any claim I wanted, as long as I expressed it well and somehow manipulated excerpts from the text as support. In DS: Literature, however, the first thing I learned was that, yes, there are wrong answers in literary analysis! Unlike in high school, writing papers in this class is not as easy as throwing a thesis together and then citing random quotations. To the contrary, students in this class are taught that literary analysis is a delicate art, demanding careful reflection about the author's intent and how his text evolves as a whole. A successful analysis in this class is one that takes these considerations into account and then presents ideas that not only reflect the students' own impressions, but, more importantly, stay true to the author and the text itself. While this may sound obvious, it can be difficult for a first-semester freshman to master; at least, it was for me! (And I am still FAR from mastering literary analysis...)That said, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. In fact, I would recommend it for that very reason: that it is difficult. When students realize just what a delicate art literary analysis is, they should and will be intrigued. There is something very exciting and satisfying about the opportunity to try to \"chew on\" and \"digest\" writers of the past, to take the texts of antiquity and try to represent elements of them in one's own words. After all, in writing a paper, say, about the poetic techniques of the \"Divine Comedy,\" students are really making progress towards the greater question: \"What makes Dante great and why should we still read him today?\" What could be a more exciting endeavor for a first-semester freshman?! So, yes, this class will probably be challenging. No, students should not expect their paper grades to be as high as the grades they earned in their high school English class. Nonetheless, students should expect to be stimulated by the act of engaging with the master writers of antiquity. And, in the process of trying to write papers (and likely tripping a lot along the way) students will receive a firm introduction to and sincere appreciation for the art of literary analysis."
