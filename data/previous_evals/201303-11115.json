   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Education, be it policy, practice (how teachers do what they do and the philosophies behind that) or research (the data that points to the way education is, then TAKE THIS CLASS. It's small enough to feel intimacy within the class. The class structure allows you to feel all the intimacy of a seminar with the freedom to (sometimes) put off homework due to the lecture style of the class. Take this class and you will have a much deeper understanding of all the complex issues of education!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It's not too difficult, and it's a great introduction to the education system. I think it'll develop and grow as the Education Studies program returns Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course regardless of your interests. Education studies looks at various social sciences and humanities fields",
    "If you are interested in education I would recommend this class as an interesting elective.",
    "A great introduction to the American Education system's practice and policies. There were lots of introductory readings and challenging writing assignments that gets a student acclimated to the system as well.",
    "If you'd like a broad survey class that expects you to have and defend an opinion, this is your class. Overall, a very positive experience.",
    "The Education Studies program is still young. They're trying to figure out what the program will look like in the years to come. A lot of things seem up in the air. That being said, Ed. Studies 110 is still a good class to take. It's a solid introduction to the education system in the United States. It relates well with a lot of fields; we covered a wide range of issues with ties to psychology, sociology, and economics.The reading can be a bit much. They're probably going to adjust the workload in the classes to come. We might have a couple pages of reading for one day, and then 30-40+ the next. You can be safe and skim the readings that don't seem interesting to you, though.Take the class!",
    "Great class with a great professor. If you are interested in education, this is the class to take. It covers almost all of the issues that are relevant to education. The weakness of this class is that because it covers too much, it doesn't go in detail into any of the topics. There's an emphasis on how theory and practice relate to one another. There's a couple units on New Haven and Bridgeport that are very current and practical. The classroom observation unit is an amazing experience.",
    "It gives a broad overview of some of the leading debates and issues in Education. You get to explore a wide range of topics and write diverse papers.",
    "If you want to learn about education in America, I suggest you take this intro course. The reading load is a little heavy, but the work load isn't. One day is dedicated to lecture and another day is dedicated to discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ed Studies to a fellow student. I would only suggest that a WR (writing) credit be given for the course. I think this would make it much more appealing for students overall.",
    "Yes! We need a wide variety of students to tackle today's educational problems!",
    "If you are going to do the Educational Studies track then you have to take this course, if you are not sure or just want to dip your toes into what Education classes at Yale have to offer I would consider looking elsewhere.",
    "As a freshman who had only watched \"Waiting for Superman\" and read a short book on school inequalities before taking the class, EDST 110 was a great introduction to the complex issues surrounding the research, practice and policy issues of education today. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about education!",
    "Education Studies 110 is a class looking at the intricacies of education in the US. Take it if you are interested in Education in its multiple aspects or the Education Studies Program.",
    "Good intro to issues in American education. Lots of group discussion and varied writing assignments. I'd recommend it if you want to have a career in some area of education.",
    "Take this class even if you are interested in education because I feel as though this class does a very good job in raising awareness of the many things in the field of education that the general public does not think about in a regular basis. The readings were long, and some of the lectures were dry. However, the professor is great and you learned so much about education and the challenges that the US education system faces today.",
    "Education Studies 110 is a class that anyone should take to learn about the foundations of the education system and many of the issues found in the American public school system. The class focus on practice, policy, and research (and the intersection of the three) as the core of educational philosophy. Issues such as educational psychology, school choice, and the achievement gap are discussed, with a focus on practice, policy, and research. These ideas are then implemented into a unit on education in New Haven that includes an observation on a New Haven classroom. The readings are relatively long for this class, and there are four essays, each of a different writing style. I would recommend this class to those interested in learning about the education system of the United States and how our understanding of the system and the changes we make can affect the leaders and thinkers of the next generation.",
    "Education Studies 110 offers a nice introduction to the issues facing the K-12 education system in the United States today. While it does not go into great depth on the issues, it does cover a vast array of topics, providing for a fast-paced and engaging curriculum. That said, I would definitely recommend the course to other students, but only if they are truly interested in education (especially those who think they might have some future as teachers or educational policy makers). This is one of those courses that can be very interesting, but depends a lot on the students and professor sharing passions and interests in the field.",
    "Ed studies is a wonderful, broad overview to all sorts of ways to work in\/study education. Highly recommended. Prof Carroll designed a very nice curriculum with a diverse array of readings and assignments. The poster session at the end of the semester was fabulous because we got to see the widely varying interests of all our classmates, even though everyone was somehow writing about education.The class attracted interested\/interesting students, so the small group discussions included in lecture were always interesting. Lectures themselves could be a little dry, but since Prof Carroll is a true educator, I know that she will take all the reviews from this semester to heart and make next semester even better."
