   "comments": [
    "- Better understanding of Spanish Grammar - More proficient speaking abilities - Developed a more profound understanding of Spanish culture",
    "I got great experience reading and writing different genres in Spanish. (I think this is kind of like the 'English 120\" of Spanish.) Speaking only improved slightly though; there wasn't much opportunity for it.",
    "I learned to write longer-form pieces in Spanish, something I had never done before. I think it helped a lot, as I never thought I knew enough Spanish to write a full-length essay or opinion piece or any of the other projects we did.",
    "My Spanish writing skills improved from basic 5 paragraph essays in L4 to proper academic papers in this class.",
    "Learned advanced writing in Spanish",
    "Although a native Spanish speaker, this class helped me refine my writing, speaking, interpreting, and comprehension skills.",
    "I enjoyed reading things in Spanish and analyzing them through in class discussion. I learned new ways to express my thoughts and organize and argument.",
    "After taking this course, I have a better grasp of Spanish grammar as well as a lot more experience composing and writing essays in Spanish. I think this even helped me with my writing in English, since it forced me to go back to the basics of writing.",
    "This class is an excellent, in-depth exploration of different writing styles and techniques, authors, and sources in a seminar setting. I learned not only how to write better in Spanish but also how to speak and engage in discussion more concisely.",
    "We wrote and read different types of essays and stories in Spanish. You learn different ways to communicate an idea just by being exposed to how Hispanic writers do it, and improve fluidity and grammar by practice and feedback",
    "I gained a better sense of grammar, and very much improved as a writer thanks to the helpful online feedback and in-class workshops offered by the seminar.",
    "My reading and writing fluency skills greatly improved during this course",
    "This course significantly improved my Spanish writing and grammatical abilities (after having taken both AP Spanish courses in high school). It really delves into some of the more technical elements of grammar and composition which is really what I needed coming into the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this was a great course overall. I really enjoyed the different genres of writing we worked with, as well as the different materials we read and learned from. In particular, I loved the works we read by Rosa Montero, and the podcast we listened to. I also loved the freedom we had to choose topics we cared about for each essay, because it was really useful and a great learning experience to read and write about topics I care about in another language and context.",
    "Your writing improves a lot in this course, but not so much your speaking in my case. It's a good course, weekly papers, fairly graded. Participation is not a free 10% though, so beware of that. Prof Harkema is a very good professor, very nice, and always willing to meet and help with papers. The course did drastically improve my writing skills, so I recommend if you take Spanish seriously.",
    "Strengths- teaches you proper essay skills in Spanish acaemic writing without seeming forceful Weakness- not tailored to individual so hard to personally glean the scope of your errors",
    "You get to see different styles of writing which ultimately helps you better hone your skills. However, if the class has too many students in it the, then the class can get a bit crowded and it can be difficult to get the professors attention.",
    "The strengths of this course were the in class discussions and the trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library and other use of outside sources like that. A weakness would be that some days in class felt like they did not have a purpose.",
    "I think the workload of the class is actually one of its strengths, since the best way to get better at writing is to actually write. Profa. Harkema also gives us interesting topics, and it's fun to be able to pick our own topic for the final essay. The only thing I would change would be to read a longer book throughout the course, or maybe read some more examples of narrative writing.",
    "I love how we submitted initial drafts and got feedback from peers, Profa. Harkema, and Juan Pablo. The range of content was another strength of the course - I felt that I learned so much about personal, opinion, analytical, history-based, and investigative essays. I would suggest a different way of doing peer review. Instead of having a few people workshop their essays each time, I think it would be more helpful to instead divide into small groups of three or four; that way, each student gets feedback from others each time around.",
    "Strengths: The writing assignments were varied and a good level of challenging Weaknesses: Maybe there is no way to make grammar review fun",
    "I generally really liked this course (although it could be difficult to stay completely engaged in discussion with the 9am start time). I thought the 4 units (narrative, journalism, literature, and the Spanish Civil War) were really effective at practicing different forms of writing (and also enabled us to read from different genres). I also thought the discussions of the subtleties of Spanish grammar were very effective and found myself picking up new topics and new ways of using Spanish language which I had not previously known. The feedback on writing was also very comprehensive and helpful, and I liked the process of drafting and then having the opportunity to correct an assignment. The final paper was also a great opportunity. It was certainly intense to write such a substantial work in Spanish (I had never done anything like that before), but I really enjoyed the complete flexibility in choosing a topic and felt proud of the end result (which allowed me to implement all the skills I had picked up throughout the course). In terms of weaknesses, I think the peer review process could have been improved. I thought it was really helpful for me and was a shame that each of us only had the opportunity to have our work reviewed once. Perhaps, if the system of having two groups was maintained, 4 different essays could be read by each group (rather than 4 of the same) allowing each person to have their work peer reviewed twice. It was also really nice to have the appointment with Profa. Harkema in her office after one of the assignments before the revision; it would have been nice if that could have also been repeated once more. Finally, I think Professor Harkema's comments on papers while very helpful could sometimes overemphasize the grammar and not talk as much about the content or style (and then points would be docked on the final paper for content\/style problems not mentioned in the revision process). So, sometimes, more varied comments on the papers would have been really useful."

    "No",
    "I would recommend this for anyone looking to get an L5 done, but if you're really interested in Spanish literature or culture this is not for you. My writing definitely improved in this course, but not really my speaking (I hadn't taken a Spanish class since AP in high school 2 years ago though, so the lack of practice put me at a disadvantage). Fortunately for me (grade-wise but not learning-wise) grades are not very dependent on speaking, and the writing exercises included first drafts with corrections so it was easy to do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was interesting. The work load was manageable--not too many readings or assignments, and virtually all of them were very interesting. I definitely improved my Spanish, and also improved my writing.",
    "I recommend if you take spanish seriously. This course improved my writing skills a lot, but it's also a lot of work, and it's not a free A. Depends what you're looking for.",
    "Yes, as it truly improves your skills in Spanish",
    "Yes, because as long as you show up to class and do the work, I don't see how one wouldn't improve the Spanish speaking and writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course due to the care that the professor puts into each lesson. That being said i would advise to stay on top of the work.",
    "If you're looking for an L5 credit or are simply trying to improve your Spanish writing skills, this is a great course. You'll write three short essays and a longer final essay on a topic of your choice. The shorter essays cover a variety of writing styles and you'll go over \"examples\" from different writers before each assignment. Several classes are dedicated to workshopping your writing, which can be helpful if you come prepared to speak up and participate. The course also includes some grammar reviews, but nothing too obvious. Profa. Harkema is a very dedicated professor and she's very helpful if you need help on anything.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to improve writing and discussion skills. You will be surprised by how much you improve over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, if i come across someone who really wants to improve their fluency in reading and the strength of their writing in Spanish, I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Harkema takes a topic which may seem dull or dry and makes it relatively interesting and engaging. It may not be as captivating as some of the other courses in the department, but it certainly fulfills its role of improving reading comprehension and writing ability. I would caution that it is a relatively difficult course especially for non-native speakers. It can take a while to get used to writing longer works in Spanish, and the course moves at a quick pace in terms of the writing and revision process. Also, grading can be somewhat difficult (especially due to the need for such a high level of grammar); an A- is usually feasible on assignments, but an A can be much harder to achieve. Therefore, simply be prepared to invest significant amounts of time and effort in order to get the most out of the course."
