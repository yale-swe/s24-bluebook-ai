   "comments": [
    "English majors have to take this, but I would also recommend it to non-English majors. You will gain a much more sophisticated understanding of English poetry and read works that are foundational to all literature produced today.",
    "Professor Glaser is a tough grader, but he definitely challenged me to improve my writing and analytical skills and he is very fair. Class discussions were always interesting. I'm not usually one to speak up in class, but I felt like I could easily get engaged. A little less stuffy than 125. Definitely a great introduction to close reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 126 to another student. I took this course because it is a prerequisite for the English major, and I did not expect to enjoy it, but it has turned out to be one of my favorite courses at Yale. The poets we read in this class were interesting and entertaining, class discussion was engaging, and the reading was not too much in quantity.",
    "If you take 126, take it with Glaser. I've never seen a professor before so skilled at drawing ideas out of students. He doesn't take bullshit, so you have to come up with something interesting to say, but once you have an idea, he's happy to meet in office hours to talk it over. The reading is sometimes a bit tough Paradise Lost takes time to get through and for the level of analysis that the class reaches, you won't follow if you haven't read. But if you have, the class becomes a lot of fun.",
    "English 126 is a great introduction to some of the world's greatest English poets. The pace at which the class moves seems to make it a bit difficult to truly savor and delve deep into some of the poets, but there is nevertheless the opportunity to read some of their major works and to place these within the context of the greater literary canon. In order to enjoy and feel comfortable and active in classroom discussions, it is necessary to put in a great deal of work preparing the difficult readings beforehand. I would recommend English 126 to another student prepared to do this work and with a great love of poetry, as the works are often very complex and will require careful attention.",
    "I really enjoyed this course--Professor Glaser is great! But take a look at the different ENGL 126 syllabi, as there is some variation in the poets selected. For instance, beyond Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot, we read Yeats and Bishop, while another another professor choose to end with Hughes and Stein.",
    "Great intro course. I think it's a good foundation in writing skills and thinking about writing and poetry. I really enjoyed the course and challenged my thoughts and writing skills. Peof Glaser was really helpful and encouraging. Class discussion was stimulating and I really enjoyed my exoerience.",
    "I have a tricky response to this. The course is required for the English major. I was going to be an English\/art history double major before taking it. I am a very good writer; I am not as talented at literary analysis, and can only effectively do it if I am extremely engaged with the material. The course made me realize that my distaste for literary analysis and dissection renders me unlikely to succeed as an English major, and I've decided to drop the double in favor of focusing on art history, where my analytical skills manifest more effectively. I would recommend this course to aspiring English majors for obvious reasons, but also because it'll be a kick in the ass if your literary analysis is shaky and you don't know if you're cut out for it. If you still want to be an English major after 126, then you're cut out for it. I wasn't, but I suppose I was an art history major at heart."
