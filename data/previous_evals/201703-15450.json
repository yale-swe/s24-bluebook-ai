   "comments": [
    "Learned quite a bit about different ways of thinking about and writing American history. Learned about the kind of researcher and instructor I would want to become. Got to explore some new research questions too.",
    "Broadened my understanding of US history in the twentieth century by exposing me to a wide range of literature I otherwise would not have encountered in my environmental history focus. These include social, political, intellectual, and military histories from populism to the 1980s. I also had an opportunity to write a lecture for the first time, which was a very challenging and rewarding experience.",
    "I learned what questions historians ask when evaluating a text's relationship to existing historiography; learned that historians can write in different ways for different audiences; wrote a syllabus and a lecture for the first time.",
    "This class was a great way to read the books people will expect you to have read as a historian working in modern US history. It will also teach you to read for orals.",
    "Good overview of 20th century US, particularly big political themes and moments. Useful assignments for preparing to one day teach ones own course. Helpful discussions for thinking through the connections and continuations throughout 20th century politics and political moments and movements.",
    "A great overview of some of the major works of 20th century American History."

   "comments": [
    "Class discussions felt very focused and on track. Great readings. Fun, really valuable assignments. Well-organized syllabus. Glad I got to hear about other people's assignments in class and see them on Canvas. There was almost a disincentive to read more of the second\/newer book for each week since we tended to spend so much time on the first\/older book of each pair.",
    "The seminars were engaging in a way that I had never experienced as a student before. The type of questions addressed and freewheeling but still directed conversation were of the highest quality. I thought Prof. Gage did a great job of keeping everyone on topic and moving the conversation forward. When I had questions outside of class, she was very helpful. Two books a week is tough to keep up, but I get it! As much as I sometimes felt like I was talking about the book without having really \"read\" it in a way that I would define \"reading,\" I appreciated the experience of plowing through the historiography. No improvements necessary.",
    "Strengths are the professor's ability to facilitate conversation and diversity of assignments. Amity Shlaes was the weakness.",
    "The strength and weakness are one in the same. It was a lot of reading. I just think you need to be thoughtful about what's happening with the rest of your semester. I never got too overwhelmed but I could see it becoming the bane of your existence if you pair it with other very reading intensive courses. Here's the thing about the courses assignments. I thought they were very helpful (write a syllabus, write a lecture, write an op-ed) and are helping you develop skills you will 100% need to make it in the profession. However, if you need to improve your research skills, this course isn't going to do that. But it does other important things.",
    "Helpful assignments, strong readings (particularly helpful to have a balance of newer and older works)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes -- A great class to get a broad sweep of American history in the 20th century. Lots of great readings and assignments. Class discussions were well-organized, thoughtful, and interesting.",
    "Yes, but only with the understanding that this class is meant to \"broaden\" rather than \"deepen.\" Don't beat yourself up if you don't catch everything. I think everyone has something to different to add to and gain from this class.",
    "It gave me an entry into historiographical conversations about 20th century US history, which will be invaluable.",
    "Yes. If you want to familiarize yourself with modern US political history (its not giving you a lot on race, gender, sexuality, etc), this is a good course for that. If you want to experience the reading pace for orals, take this course. If you want to do work that will prep you to be a professor\/academic, this is a good course for that. The course is good; its just a question of is it giving you what you particularly need.",
    "Great course if looking to understand major themes in 20th US History.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Well worth taking -- even as an undergrad, as I was -- for the amazing books, great professor, and rewarding discussions."
