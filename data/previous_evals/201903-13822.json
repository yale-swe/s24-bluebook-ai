    "Having all the different instructors was helpful for looking at the issues from different perspectives.",

    "Strengths: All four professors are experts in the field and very excited to talk about their research. They are all willing to occur help on various assignments. This is truly a \"real world application\" class Weaknesses: Sometimes outside research (google) is needed to supplement lecture learning, but it is readily available.",
    "strengths - very relevant topic. It got me excited about ways that chemists can help solve energy related problems. weaknesses- disorganized. some professors covered the same topic. Each section was taught so differently that it was hard to adjust to each professor's style",
    "Strength is in getting knowledge from different professors. However, too much content so hard to absorb everything taught.",
    "Learning from 4 different professors provided the students with varied perspectives and approaches to the energy problem."

    "Yes, would recommend if interested in alternative energy.",
