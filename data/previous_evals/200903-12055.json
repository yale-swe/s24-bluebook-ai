    "Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was great. Lectures were interesting and easy to pay attention to. Section was fun full of different activities. Food is a fun topic to learn about.",
    "You should shop it but I wouldnt recommend it",
    "It's worth taking, especially if you need a social science. The lectures are all interesting and you aren't responsible (i.e. graded) on the info presented in them, so you just sit back and enjoy listening and reflecting on them, which is a nice change. Also, the sections tend to include fun discussions, and the 4 papers are predominantly personal essays, which are much less stressful and time-consuming to write than most analytical work. It's a good course, especially if you have a hard course load.",
    "YES. It was a great class that opened my eyes to various food\/nutrition\/sustainability topics. Awesome Awesome AWESOME. Grades only are based on 4 fun papers and section participation. NO FINAL = WIN.",
    "I would recommend it. The material in class doesnt relate much with the papers, but the papers are very open and not too difficult to write. Gives a different perspective on food and gender roles in the household.",
    "The papers are fun and interesting to write, and the workload is quite light. Keep in mind that this is a food course, but a lot of the focus is on feminism and women's studies, which I did not know prior to taking this course. I still enjoyed it, and it was fun to go on field trips during section and have apple and cheese tasting.",
    "Take it if you don't mind writing and are good at it since it's just 4 five page papers spaced out over the semester. grading can be difficult since the papers are so subjective in nature",
    "An interesting first look at areas of food and how they relate to gender. If you have already taken a lot of food classes at Yale, this may not be the class for you (unless you're really interested in the gender dynamics).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was light on the work, but very interesting material.",
    "As with any WGSS lecture, the class was comprised of two types of people: those taking it for a gut and those taking it because they were genuinely interested. That's all fine and good in lecture, but it makes section painful when only a couple people talk and everyone else sits there in a stupor because they haven't done the reading. I wasn't exactly in shock and awe over any of the material we studied- none of it seemed that new to me, but maybe that's because I've taken WGSS classes before. However, lectures were generally interesting and I never missed one, and I rarely felt like going to class was a waste of my time (except for section).",
    "Take this class, but it really all depends on the TA you get.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because the material is really interesting and you get to write about yourself a lot.",
    "This class provides an overview of the role of women in the production, preparation, and consumption of food. Each week had a different theme, and the lectures, reading, and section discussion all had to do with that topic. The four paper assignments were all a lot of fun to write. There were also some great guest lectures and also some food tastings in section (cheese and apples). I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This course has a lot of potential that it did not fulfill. This course is good for students who are looking for course with a light workload. I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes! Please take this course and enjoy exploring life through the lens of food. You can take this course as a 5th class, but if you really invest yourself in the material and the class discussion you can get valuable academic experience. I encourage you to push yourself in this class and appreciate it for its unique approach to academic study!",
    "I loved this class! As a science person (and someone who's been wary of the women's and gender studies thing), it was a great break from really rigorous classes, but it really made me change the way I think about food, housework, gender, globalization, and the control of desire. All the lectures were interesting (Professor Trumpler used to be a designer cheese maker!). The class was also very interactive, with food tastings in sections, visits to the Art Gallery and Peabody, and interesting guest lecturers (like the owner of Claire's Cakes). Great class.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they are interested in how food affects society. Don't take the course unless you have interest in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, if you are interested in the subject, or even if you have never thought about it before. It made me notice things related to women, culture, and media that i hadn't previously, and it was a very enjoyable, low-stress course.",
    "Yes, wasn't a hard class to say the least.",
    "Yes. It provides an interesting perspective on the subject of women and gender studies. I would take the class again. I thought this course was interesting, and it addresses the subject from many different angles. The writing assignments were particularly interesting. However, the course sometimes seemed to cover many subjects without establishing a completely \"common theme.\"",
    "The lectures are very loosely related to discussion in section, so be prepared for little motivation for going to biweekly lectures. Also, the topic for the papers are very broad and sometime ambiguous. If you are looking for a decent grade on your papers, you'll HAVE run your ideas by your TA first. You get to taste lots of great food in section though, which is a huge plus.",
    "yes I would recommend because the course is different and the material is interesting...course is not too tough and is pretty enjoyable",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to talk a lot about food, and doesn't mind really really boring moments of farm-talk and looking at random pictures that don't really relate. It's sort of a gut, actually. But some of the papers, lectures and books are actually really really interesting (the book Appetites, the food portrait essay, etc)",
    "I was not a huge fan of the lecture because a lot of what we talked about seemed a little random or not concrete. I was a huge fan of section discussions because there were some great conversations about the more interesting topics. I loved writing the papers though, I thought the assignments were great, and I think they should stay the same every year.",
    "Not a lot of work- but there are 4 five page papers that do creep up on you from time to time. Take the class if you're interested in feminism and learning about food in everyday and historical context.",
    "The re-grading policy was very unreasonable.",
    "Easy class to get a good grade in, the readings are really interesting, and you don't have to go to lecture. Some of the lectures can be boring, but more of them are worth going to.",
    "Lectures are somewhat interesting, good guest lecturers. Don't need to go to lecture or really do much of the reading to get by. The books are pretty interesting and not too difficult. It does make you start thinking more about women, food, and culture, and how the interaction is perceived by our society. Take it if you need a 5th class, but don't expect anything life changing.(You get out of it what you put in) And also it's nice that sections make you go to yale art gallery, beinecke, and peabody museum. section is pretty entertaining.",
    "TAKE IT. WGSS 120 is a wonderful course. I am so glad I took it. Professor Trumpler is a great woman and the writing assignments are fun and easy. We even had an apple tasting and a cheese tasting!",
    "Definitely a class worth taking, isn't really what I would call an easy A, because the grading can be weird. Also, the lectures and papers do not really correlate well, so it is not necessary to go to lecture. But attend them, the class is worth the time.",
    "Absolutely. A fun and relaxing course that requires a low workload. The readings are interesting and the lectures are mostly fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Maria Trumpler's passion about the course is contagious. Food history is such a great lens to study various disciplines, it will relate to any major. Gender (and Food) studies are important areas to study and will finally be acknowledged as important if more students take classes like this one. The assignment were very fulfilling. For example, I wrote a sociological \"food portrait\" of my mother, a homemaker, and highlighted the importance of her role, putting her on par with, say, a doctor. Plus, the course is fun; take advantage of the opportunity to think about (and sometimes taste!) food in one of your classes.",
    "Yes, great course!!",
    "YES take this class"
