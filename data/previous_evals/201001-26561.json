   "comments": [
    "This class is great in developing a scope of knowledge on the development of Islam. Do not be intimidated if you do not have any prior knowledge of Islam, Griffel makes sure to be inclusive of everyone when leading discussions, and most of the readings are enjoyable. Take this class if you like to read, write, and contemplate Muslim ideological development in the last two centuries.",
    "Far more theological and less political than one would anticipate.",
    "Good class. I don't know if it would be as rewarding with no background in Islamic studies whatsoever. I would recommend an Intro Islam or Islamic theology first.",
    "Yes if you want a detailed examination not a survey",
    "Take it after carefully looking at the readings because discussions are very heavily focused on those. Hopefully some readings will be changed for future years.",
    "This is a fascinating examination of the historical roots of the modern Salafi movement. The reading is a little dense if you aren't used to the material, and I imagine a background in Islamic thought would help clarify the concepts. That said, it's quite enlightening and always interesting.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Very interesting.",
    "A great class - go for it! I thought it gave me a great view into the intellectual history of one of the most important movements in modern Islam, and really helped me better understand the current religious and political situation in the Muslim world.",
    "This is a seminar style class with around 100 pages of reading per week, three papers and then a 15 page final paper. It is fun but requires proper time, but if you can commit, then definitely it is a great experience.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. While sometimes hard to dig through the content of the reading, it was rewarding to come away with a deep and comprehensive understanding of the modernist movement. Most of the readings are primary sources which makes it more interesting."
