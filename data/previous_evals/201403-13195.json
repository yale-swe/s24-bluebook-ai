   "comments": [
    "If you don't mind reading dense legal texts then it is great. Our class emphasized discussion\/argument a lot, that might vary year to year; however, given the nature of the course I suspect it is always going to be rather like that so you need to be active in the seminar.",
    "Overall, the course was interesting, but not quite my cup of tea. The novels we read were significantly more interesting than the legal texts or academic articles. Sometimes, the reading was somewhat outrageous in terms of the amount - I felt like if I wasn't reading for this class everyday, then I was doing something wrong. Something that would've helped with the readings is if we got some kind of brief summary from the professor ahead of time, or, in particular with the supreme court opinions we had to read, if he had addressed briefly at the start of the semester how exactly to read an opinion. I would only recommend this course to students with a strong interest in literature - don't take it just for the writing credit or because you think it will be an interesting discovery of new material.",
    "Are you a lover of literature? An armchair philosopher? An aspiring scumbag lawyer? It doesn't matter. I'm telling you that this is the class for you! Professor Smith does an amazing job of creating a relevant curriculum that ferociously dissects the interactions between legal and literary thought. The readings include sources ranging from philosophy to novels to legal cases, and Professor Smith takes pains to ensure that you see the many connections between them. And with only two papers in addition to weekly reading responses and a reasonable reading load, this class gives you plenty of time to think about the material without stressing you out. This is absolutely one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Shop it for a day, and you will want stay for whole term. Good luck getting in!",
    "An interesting survey course of topics that have been tackled by the legal system and literature alike. I would recommend it if you're interested in learning a lot about the foundations of the law, as well comparing how the law and literature tackle problems of the same nature. While some of the reading can be a bit boring, especially if you're more interested in the literature, both sides of the course will challenge how you think about and relate to the law.",
    "Wonderful English seminar. Definitely take if you have any interest in law and its intersection with literature. There are quite a few critical readings\/cases and less literature, so be aware of that. 1 midterm paper and a final paper (which you workshop in class so you'll get a lot of feedback before it's due). Definitely recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. As the title suggests, we went over legal documents, namely cases, and read novels that discussed relevant issues. The mix of the legal and literary perspective was really engaging and the class discussions were fun. The reading load was quite heavy but also interesting. In addition, Prof. Smith is a wonderful professor. Seminar was engaging and he made complicated texts approachable. He's very insightful and made the readings more interesting by contextualizing them within a historical and literary framework. Prof. Smith is very kind and available for office hours. He was always willing to discuss ideas from class, as well as essay topics. I feel more comfortable with legal texts and believe my analytical skills have greatly improved through this course."
