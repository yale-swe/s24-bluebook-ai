   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the process behind adapting text to a film as well as literature or film as independent entities.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale so far. Everything has been so interesting and so much fun. If I could take this class again I would in a heartbeat!! The films we studied were varied and edged us slowly into the world of film analysis. Towards the end of the semester we moved more into foreign films - Italian mostly - and by this point we had learnt so much that we were ready for it. Professor Marcus is by far the best teacher I've had at Yale thus far. Her insights into some of the films we have watched this semester have been so fascinating and surprising. You will not regret taking this class!",
    "This seminar was basically entirely invented and driven by prof. Marcus, who taught us the film adaptations she was passionate about. She was a great instructor, very personable with us, and the course was a ton of fun. Seeing these films and reading the source material is one of the things at Yale that has made me feel most truly educated--not just an acclimation of knowledge, but perspectives that can enrich your viewpoint and what you gain from the world.",
    "I would recommend the class. The three 5-page papers are not too bad but are a decent amount of work. Make sure you know what the paper is about and how to write it. Very different from a high school paper!",
    "Take this class!!! It is a really fun class that will change the way you look at films. The discussions and the films are great, and Professor Marcus is awesome (probably the best professor I have had so far at Yale). Everything about the class--the content, the format, the professor, the workload--is exactly right, and it is basically the ideal freshman seminar experience. In addition to enjoying the experience, I learned so much about film studies, Italy, literature, and all kinds of different things! Really, I cannot recommend this class enough!",
    "I would highly recommend Literature into Film for any freshman. It doesn't require any prior knowledge of film, and is an engaging class with an amazing professor. TAKE IT!",
    "I would really strongly recommend this class. Professor Marcus is fantastic and just about the most adorable person ever. The films we watched ranged from the mainstream (Apocalypse Now) to the obscure and Italian (Garden of the Finzi-Continis), but class discussion and Professor Marcus' comments make them all interesting. There are 3 short papers and a really irrelevant final, so the workload in general isn't too bad, but the reading does stack up at times. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of whether you're super interested in literature or film. This class is hugely enjoyable and anyone will come out of it having a deeper appreciation for literature and film.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The environment was relaxed, the papers were not difficult, and Professor Marcus is great.",
    "A great opportunity to learn about films in a comfortable environment with an impassioned teacher. Take it!",
    "I will definitely recommend the class to any student no matter what major he\/she will be focusing on. Literature and films shares a large part of our life, and through comparative study we get to understand both better. The crosstalk of the two medias often bring out new meanings of the story, and the meanings are so rich that you feel like you will never get enough of it.",
    "This is a class where you get to read awesome or not terribly long books, watch awesome films, and interact with a lovely professor for credit. Take advantage of this.",
    "This class is interesting and fun. The work is totally manageable and Professor Marcus is an excellent teacher who really cares about each student. (At the end of the semester she hosted us all for a homemade pasta dinner at her home). Take it for an easy and interesting seminar, but know that there is a time commitment outside of class to watch the films as a class."
