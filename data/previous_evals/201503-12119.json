    "I would recommend GLBL 101 01 to every Yale student. The class is a high-level discussion of current issues that challenge students' philosophical, historical, and practical knowledge of the things that affect our world today. The modules are taught by leaders in their fields, and each expert is engaging and thoughtfully interactive with students.",
    "I think you should take this course if you think you are going to go into policymakingif you dont think so, its not worth your time. Ultimately, there is too heavy an emphasis on the tradeoffs and complexities of actual policymaking than there is instruction on what is going on in the world today that could benefit from effective policymaking, which I think is important to consider when shopping. Additionally, having only an introduction of the course during shopping period without \"really\" experiencing a lecture is a detriment, as it doesn't give you an accurate representation of the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is a great introduction to global affairs wit ha reasonable work load.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the various fields of global affairs. Definitely take this course if you are considering the Global Affairs major. Everyone will prefer certain modules of the course over others, and there's definitely something for everyone. You will not leave the class knowing many concrete facts, but you will know how to write a policy memo and you will have developed a different way of thinking.",
    "I would recommend GLBL 101 to students truly interested in the specific modules. There is no real focus on one specific area of global affairs, so if you want just a short snapshot of the issues being discussed in the module, only then should you take this course.",
    "This course is a star-studded overview of what the Global Affairs department and major have to offer in terms of broad topics covered in classes. A fascinating and concise look at important topics in international relations, but one that will not provide you with any substantive information or material. Students will feel good about taking this course and excited about discussing the various topics, yet ultimately leave frustrated by a lack of comprehensive instruction. Overall, a great opportunity for freshmen and underclassmen to get exposure to faculty that they would otherwise not be able to, or for upperclassmen from other departments looking for an interesting class that is not too intense.",
    "You may not like all of the modules but they fit together to give you a good idea of the breadth and depth of the subject Global Affairs. It also makes you want to take more specific classes about each module topic, because the topics can't really be broached completely in 6 classes each.",
    "MUST TAKE if you're interested in global affaires, international relations, or just current hot topics! Phenomenal teachers that have amazing backgrounds and on the ground experience.",
    "The course, split up into four modules, provides a combination of current events and historical studies not many others can offer. The variety of the modules lends an interesting look into the international security\/development tracks of the GLBL major. The module leaders - experts in their field brought to the classroom to analyze the theory behind their work - were phenomenal, lending insight and experience to each of the lessons. The modules and instructors will vary, though interest generally depends on security vs. development: McChrystal and Lamb's Conflict module\/Graham's Russia module & Karunakara's Humanitarian module\/Braverman's Citizen Services module. Overall, a great Yale intro course that is interesting and valuable no matter your intention of study.",
    "I would highly recommend GLBL 101 to a fellow student. You learn to write policy memos and think through various issues methodically, which is a valuable skill, and it would be a shame to turn down an opportunity to have such amazing instructors. If she's still a TF, I would highly recommend Zeinab, too.",
    "it will either make you love or hate global affairs. Probably love. You get to explore 4 different modules with 4 different exciting lecturers. You will have engaging discussions in section. You will get the most out of the class if you do the readings, which may be overwhelming. At least skim them. Soak it in while it lasts.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone at Yale regardless of major. The opportunity to learn from some of the world's foremost experts on such pressing current event is an invaluable experience.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is an introductory global affairs class that teaches large themes such as grappling with war and conflict, humanitarian assistance, and citizen service delivery in the form of four modules taught by guest lecturers. The material is fascinating, and students get to learn from experts who are truly at the forefront of their fields.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. I think the success of the course depends in the modules. This semester I really likes the modules a lot. I would summarize it as an introduction to global affairs.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the Global Affairs field and major. It is module-based with four lecturers, each experts in their field. The writing assignments, short policy memos, provide a real-world application for the knowledge gained in this course. I would highly recommend this course to others interested in government or international relations.",
    "I would recommend GLBL 101 to any student, regardless of their major or interest. It certainly affected the way I perceive the world and provided me with a greater degree of scrutiny with which to look at current affairs.",
    "This is an amazing course. I shopped it on a whim, but am so glad I did. Thirty minutes into the class, I was so engaged that I decided to definitely take it. You get an introduction to four distinct areas of global affairs (for us, it was war, humanitarianism, improving citizen services, and the future of Russia) taught by the leading people working in the field. As a freshman or sophomore, it's incredible to be taught by such amazing people. Generals McChrystal and Lambe gave us their opinions on the war in Afghanistan and the future of war. Dr. Karunakara, ex-chief of Doctors Without Borders, taught us about the challenges facing humanitarianism and the decisions he himself has had to make for the organization and thousands of people depending on him. Even if you aren't thinking about international relations or global affairs, I highly recommend this class. The sections are equally as inspiring--in mine, my TF had previously worked at the Pentagon. You get the opportunity to talk about very real, serious issues in a smaller group with someone very experienced in the field. The work is challenging but not outrageous--you have four short policy memos (3 page papers, usually) and a reasonable final exam. The readings are usually amazing, and more for your own improvement and enrichment than structure of the class vary from module to module--some are lectures, others are involved seminars. I can't emphasize how much I recommend this class.",
    "Solid introduction to the Global Affairs major and a few contemporary issues facing the arena of international relations. Also great access to accomplished individuals",
    "I would certainly recommend, on account of the wide array of material covered.",
    "A really great broad overview of the Global Affairs course that looks at a range of current issues from technology to the Middle East. I would recommend - it covers important information for the real world!",
    "This class is good if you're interested in global affairs to give a good introduction, and it provides unique perspectives on global political issues. However, it can be a bit general and broad, so if you're looking for in-depth knowledge on any particular topic, I would not recommend it.",
    "This is a great class which will teach you a lot about current issues in ways you never really imagined. I recommend it for anyone considering global affairs or just interested in the nuances of our world today"
