    "interesting course if you have something that you want to find the answer to. pretty much all you do is conduct and explain an experiment.",
    "I basically took this because I thought it was an easy econ seminar but the past evaluations were misleading - it wasn't that easy. Professor Sunder has very high expectations, he is very meticulous and will tear your proposals apart if they are not absolutely clear and sound. While it was a great challenge to impress him, many times I felt that I was putting in way more effort than other classes.Also, experimental economics is a really useless field in my opinion. I don't think anyone made any significant realization or finding, experiments were pretty pointless. I did learn a few things by participating in experiments though, but the rest of it didn't result in any learning.",
    "Definitely take it if you are an econ major and are looking for a class with less boundaries and more intuitive research.",
    "The premise of the course was interesting, but I ultimately wasn't sold on the way it was executed. I think laboratory economic experiments and the associated methodologies are really interesting, but you only spend the first three weeks or so of the course covering that material. After that, you spend 100% of the class time serving as subjects in other people's economic experiments, which was sometimes fun, but often very boring, and I didn't think it was particularly educational. I wish we had moretime to talk about the costs and benefits of various methodologies and that we spent less time running our experiments (or had conducted them outside of class time) because Professor Sunder is very experienced in the field, and I would have liked to hear more of his thoughts on the technical aspects of the subject matter so that we might be more prepared to do other economic experiments in the future. The grading for the class is also a complete mystery - we didn't get any grades returned all semester, so nobody had any feedback about how they were performing in the course. On the bright side, Professor Sunder was very willing to meet with us about our final projects, and it was enjoyable meeting with him to discuss our economic experiments one-on-one. I think this is one of those senior seminars with little guidance in which you can get by for most of the year without doing a ton of work (although there was a LOT of writing at the end), but ultimately you only get out as much as you put into it.",
    "Fun and interesting class. Be warned that is is different than most Yale undergraduate classes. Professor Sunder really wants students to delve deep into a subject that interests them (really any topic\/issue, anything) to create an experiment. The majority of the work during the semester is creating this experiment and analyzing the results. Also, during class periods, you get to participate in experiments either ran by Professor Sunder or by classmates. Most of them are fun, some can be boring. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend taking! It is really rewarding to put a lot of work into an experiment and then get to run it on classmates.p.s. be aware ahead of time that there are basically two final papers..."
