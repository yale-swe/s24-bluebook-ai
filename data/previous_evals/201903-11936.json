    "Strength: Exposure to many different fields of research. Weakness: More visitors from other fields should come (not just people from the Medical School - which was about 50% of the consultations).",
    "It would be nice if there was more follow up on the individual presentations, for example continuing to work with a client after they have presented.",

    "Yes, the course is interesting and exposes you to statistics in a variety of contexts",
    "Yes - not a bad way to spend Friday afternoon, gives some insight into the types of things statistics is applicable to."
