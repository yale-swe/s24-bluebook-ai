    "Yes. It's a great class to learn how to use law in other areas of discipline. I think it's great for undergrads who are interested in understanding more about law and don't have much background in it. I love that it teaches how one can use law outside the context of being a lawyer--it really highlighted the importance of law and the creation and maintenance of markets.",
    "I you are interested in practical solutions to environmental problems you should take this class. At the end of the day any successful environmental project depends on the right amount and type of financing. This course will show you the ropes for how to get there.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's not too taxing on the workload, you don't have to do all of the reading, and it's interesting stuff. This can be a challenging course though if you struggle to find a topic to focus on for the semester, or your topic does not interest you very much."

    "I am an undergrad economics major, and it was valuable for me to understand how much law can impact and change the rules of economic markets. With my interest in public policy, this is very applicable to how I will go forward thinking about economic policy.With regards to my research, I am writing about water scarcity and municipal water markets. Therefore, understanding the water history and law facing these markets has helped me gain a better understanding of what types of policy recommendations can be made."
