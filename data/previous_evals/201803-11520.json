    "Learned about intelligence testing and abnormal psychology",
    "After reading so many psychology papers for various intro courses, it was really cool to see and be involved in the process that goes on behind them. I had to learn how to think about research methods while also thinking about which details might not work due to different confounding variables. This was especially important when determining how an experiment should be designed. Overall, just an amazing course to take if you're interested in conducting research.",
    "Research skills, running a lab, communication & cooperation, insights into lab work",
    "I was able to assist graduate students in various tasks such as coding data, running participants, programming studies, and conducting literature reviews. I gained a lot of insight into the day-to-day work involved in research and the process behind beginning a new study.",
    "Real-life research skills, how a lab is run, how to interact with participants, current research being done in the field, etc. One of the most valuable learning experiences I have had at Yale so far.",
    "This was helpful for completing my lab work.",
    "I developed skills from working in a research environment. I realized how succinct procedures must be in order to keep consistency and validity. I also learned what its like to work in a lab and participate in lab meetings."

    "Strengths: Learned a good amount!",

    "I was very happy with the work that I studied this semester and working in the lab. It was very enjoyable."

    "If you want to be involved in research, then this is an obvious choice. You learn a LOT, without having to put a lot of time in. The actual research time is complemented with meetings where different papers are discussed, and presentations are given.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in psych research at all, it's a great credit to take.",
    "Yes especially if you are interested in lab and research\/grad school",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in research. Since the course is an independent study, you have a lot of say into what type of work you do, and this is a great way to get hands-on experience and mentorship in your area of interest.",
    "Yes. For a psychology major, there is no better way to understand what grad school\/academia track is like. You learn useful skills, as well as one part of current research in psychology really well.",
    "Yes I would especially if this is a field that they are interested in studying. Working with the dogs was very therapeutic.",
    "Yes. Direct research experience is incredibly valuable."
