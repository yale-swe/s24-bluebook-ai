   "comments": [
    "It is an introduction to the intellectual history of Islam and Islamic civilization, covering its major movements and thinkers from the Prophet to the modern Salafiyya movement. I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially to fellow divinity school students. It is a coherent presentation of Islam on its own terms, and presents students with an opportunity to climb inside the thought of Islam. This is invaluable for anyone in a Western world in which Islam is so important and so little understood, but especially for those training (as scholars or future ministers) largely within the Christian tradition in a growingly pluralist world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another fellow student who is interested in Islamic studies. I am very happy to have taken this course. I think it provides a succinct portrayal of the birth and development of Islamic thought (especially for beginners)"

   "comments": [
    "As a scholar of Christian theology, it deepened my understand of the impact of Islam on the Christian tradition, and of the possibilities of interfaith dialogue and theology. The course expanded my understandings of the theological challenges of monotheism at large, of the Abrahamic faiths especially, and the potential theological insights Christian theology might gain from engagement with the Islamic tradition."
