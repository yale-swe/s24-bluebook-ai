   "comments": [
    "EP&E 298 is an interesting Econ seminar with a relatively light workload.",
    "ECON 481 is a great course, the material, of applied microeconomics, is both very interesting and helpful for anyone interested in public policy or public economics. The course is not too hard, and any student haven taken ECON 131 will be fine, although more advanced classes in econometrics would be helpful as well. The course was not very technical, which some students liked.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! In this class you have the opportunity to read and discuss papers on a number of interesting and important topics (race, gender, health etc.) as well as to learn about how to apply key techniques of applied microeconomics. Professor Reyes is also great!",
    "If you take this class, you're expected to know quite a bit of econometrics and I wouldn't advise anyone to take it if they haven't taken Econometrics and Data Analysis II. Went through 3-4 empirical research papers a week that were all extremely interesting. We had to write three engagement papers on any of the papers we read, and had a final empirical research project. Class was not the most engaging but the readings were so interesting it was worth it.",
    "I thought this was a good class, and it was much more interesting than I expected. I was scrambling to find a seminar at the end of shopping period and was somewhat forced into this class. However, looking back, it was a great seminar and I'm glad I took it. Very different from many of Yale's economics classes because you actually read work in the field and it strays from the purely theoretical and model based classes that you find through the rest of the major.",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course. Definitely recommend."
