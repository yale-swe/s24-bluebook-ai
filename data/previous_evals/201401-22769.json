   "comments": [
    "I thought this was a very useful class and well taught. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely. For someone who had forgotten a lot of the finer details of Molecular Biology, this was a great refresher.",
    "everyone in MBB takes this class even if they've fulfilled their cell bio requirement already.a it's definitely worth taking but also a ton of work",
    "Goes through the central dogma in extensive detail. Covers a lot of material in great depth. I would recommend it.",
    "I would say that it is a good class but a lot of work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was very illuminating and I particularly enjoyed the subject matter more-so than some of the other suggested courses in the department.",
    "Great class. I learned a lot. It is very intense and you should always try not to fall behind.",
    "The course covers eukaryotic gene expression, from maintenance of the integrity of the genome to degradation of proteins. It's a good and well-designed course if you want to learn about this biology.",
    "Yes. It is a challenging course, but you learn a lot.",
    "Yes. The course is very useful and push you to learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, particularly if they do not have a strong molecular biology background. If they have a strong molecular biologybackground, there may be a lot of repetition, but I did not have this experience.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to another student as it covers a very useful variety of biology that is not covered in many other classes.",
    "You'll learn everything you forgot about biology from college, but it works best if you've actually had that teaching before (it's definitely not an intro course,which may make it difficult for people who aren't coming in from biology).But, if you have had biology, you should take it! It's great for learning the science and the way to do it - something I had never had before in a class."

   "comments": [
    "I had learned most of the concepts previously in undergraduate courses. But learning things for the second time, all together (and not several courses over several years) really solidifies the knowledge in my memory. I think this course was incredibly valuable to me and applicable to almost any field.",
    "This course helped with advancing my work by reinforcing and deepening my knowledge of the workings of eukaryotes.",
    "while I don't study eukaryotic biology, this class will be very helpful in preparing for my qualifying exam",
    "This gave me a great knowledge of how to approach many areas of molecular biology experimentally. Super important things to know.",
    "This course was helpful in learning how to write grant styled papers. It was also helpful to learn about eukaryotic processes in case I ever work outside of E. coli systems.",
    "If I was going to study protein degradation it would have been very helpful but it didn't do a good job of providing a thorough survey of the topics.",
    "Yes, I needed to learn the material this course covered, it did deepen my knowledge of my discipline.",
    "This course provided in-depth understanding about modern eukaryotic molecular biology. I will use skills based on the knowledge taught in this course in my dissertation for sure.",
    "This significantly deepened my knowledge of my discipline. Prior to this course I knew very little about DNA\/RNA production, regulation or degradation and I learned a lot. This will contribute significantly to my dissertation and research.",
    "This class will prove very useful to my studies and to my thesis work as I will be focusing on a topic covered in this class.",
    "I now know much more about how to think about experiments in biology.I can't say that the paper helped me too much - although it will forever remind me of how NOT to write a paper (unfortunately).Nevertheless, the class did stretch my brain, and I learned a lot more from this course than Macro and other courses from last semester."
