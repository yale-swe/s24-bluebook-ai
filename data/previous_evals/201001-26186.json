    "I would definitely recommend taking Span 130 with Sebastian. The course is what it is; it meets everyday with homework every night, which really starts to drag. You will become better at Spanish because of it though. If you're choosing between sections, Sebastian is incredibly friendly and helpful, and I would absolutely recommend his class.",
    "You're probably considering taking the class to either fulfill the foreign language requirement or because you truly want to learn Spanish (in other words, you'll probably take the class regardless of this review). Make sure to take it with Sebastian Diaz.",
    "Personally, I would avoid language classes at Yale at all costs - classes five days a week and work every night is just unrealistic on a college schedule imo. If you need to take it for language requirements, take it with Diaz if you can. He' s a great guy and makes it easy for you.",
    "Spanish 130 is a decent course however if you struggle in reading comprehension, it is more difficult to receive good grades on exams. I would take this class if you should make sure you get a good professor.",
    "It's most likely a requirement if you're taking it, or if not, you are interested enough in the language to continue taking it regardless.",
    "Yes you have to take it",
    "Typical spanish class, even some of the stories we read I had read in High school, but it depends on the teacher, and Diaz is great.",
    "Sebastian is a great teacher and a lenient one at that. If you're having some troubles, he's a understanding guy.",
    "This is a language class\u0097-meaning that, with daily classes, nightly homework, and lots of busywork, it is basically a regression to high school. Fortunately, Sebast\u00edan is a good teacher, the course is well-organized, and your Spanish will improve. But, if this is at all optional, don\u0092t take it. Use your all-too-short time here and take a unique Yale class.",
    "130 is a very good step along the way to Spanish proficiency. Reviews concepts from 120 in greater detail with the goal of mastery, also adding in some new components. I can understand much passing conversation between Spanish-speakers now, as well as billboards and books for young adults. Very cool."
