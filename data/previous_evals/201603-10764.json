   "comments": [
    "I became better at both reading and writing poetry. Workshops and Professor Glck's comments helped me to see my work through the eyes of others, and develop a more refined perspective and greater self-awareness.",
    "I learned how to critique poetry, both others and my own. I gained more confidence in my ability to read something and assess its meaning holistically. I learned how to appreciate poetry that I wouldn't have appreciated if I had read it on my own. I also learned how to write more expansively, to touch on topics I wouldn't have written about otherwise, and to try out different voices and different vocabularies.",
    "I learned a lot about how to write poetry but mainly through trial and error rather than more explicit training.",
    "I learned a lot about writing poetry--Professor Glck is a phenomenal instructor and poet, and her feedback always felt, for me at least, right on the dot. She knows what I'm trying to do in my poems, and her suggestions to improve them are extremely helpful.",
    "General exposure to poetic techniques from other members of the class, but very little from outside. The course could do with assigned readings to help guide students outside what we get to view in workshops.",
    "This course helped me become a better reader of my own poetry and that of others. I came into this class used to writing a draft, not thinking about it much, and then waiting for the feedback of others before I changed anything. Knowing the standards to which Louise would hold my work once I turned it in pushed me to take more care on my initial drafts, revising them myself before giving them to her for comments.",
    "I worked on my command of writing in verse.",
    "This course taught me more about being a writer the tenacity, dedication, and humility it requires than any class I've taken previously. Louise is extraordinary, and though I often struggled to raise my poems to her extremely high standards, she recognized hard work and met me where I was; she wanted me, as a writer, to become the best version of myself rather than take after another. And the other students in workshop were brilliant both as writers and as critics of each other's poetry. This class was an incredible challenge, but also an incredible privilege hands-down the best I've taken at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At the beginning of a few classes, Professor Glck read a single poem by a professional poet. This was always a nice way to anchor the class, and gave us some sort of standard to think about when reading student poems. I wish we began every class this way. It would be nice if Professor Glck could keep us more focused on relevant topics during workshop, as discussions sometimes strayed into grammatical and syntactical technicalities when there were broader, more interesting topics to talk about. Also, some of the weekly themes could be more engaging and offer more possibilities.",
    "I think the greatest weakness of any workshop class is that it takes the engagement of everyone involved for the workshop to be successful, and I think there were days when that engagement wasn't there, particularly as the semester was drawing to a close. Otherwise I didn't really have any issues with the class. I loved the prompts, and I loved how open Professor Gluck was to meeting with each of us and for her insights during class.",
    "I think it would be helpful to talk a bit more about poems that are not written by students in the class, even if only for 20 minutes each class period, in order to spend some time looking at good examples as a class.",
    "It's a great class, with wonderful participation from most if not all the students. After every workshop session, I felt more excited about the possibilities for my poems. I can't immediately think of any weaknesses. For my first workshop class in creative writing, I was very satisfied.",
    "It's really awesome to take a class with Louise. She's incredibly astute and insightful and will give you great comments about how to write good poetry. I suggest meeting with her as often as possible. Class time is a bit unfairly divided. Some people were workshopped four times, whereas one member of our class was not workshopped until the very last meeting. The means that Louise uses to choose poems for workshopping seem pretty arbitrary and she seems to play a lot of favorites. Ultimately, it is better to workshop poems that are good to begin with, but Louise could be a bit more judicious about feedback.",
    "The strength of this course is Louise's expertise, the time she takes to meet with you individually, the fact that everyone in the class is engaged, eager, and invested. A weakness might be that as far as an intro class, there is no discussion about how to write a poem. It definitely assumes prior experience.",
    "Lots of attention from professor Glck. A truly great class.",
    "The strengths of this class are legion its small size, the quality of the instructor and the students, and the sheer intensity of workshop, where we could spend upwards of an hour on one poem. One thing that I thought could have been improved was the procedure for scheduling who got workshopped. Louise said, towards the end of the semester, that she wanted everyone's work to be discussed a minimum of twice and no more than three times; but some members of the class had theirs discussed four times, and one person didn't have her poetry workshopped until the very last session. Other than that, I have no complaints."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to become a better poet. I love that this class forced me to set aside time in my schedule to write and refine a full poem each week. Professor Glck is honest, sharp, critical, fair, eccentric, and has a great sense of humor. The two hour workshops can get a little tiring, but nonetheless, this was the class I looked forward to most each week.",
    "Like most workshops, you get out of this class what you put in. If you get in, take it because Louise Gluck is incredible, but know that if you don't think you will commit to thinking about and writing poetry then the class won't do as much for you. The structure of the class is fairly simple: every week, you receive a prompt, every student writes a poem and turns it in over the weekend, and Prof Gluck chooses three poems to workshop. The next week, she gives back the rest of the poems with her comments on them along with the next assignment. You can sign up for office hours on her door (but be quick because they fill up). At the end of the semester, we turn in a final portfolio where we annotate our own poetry and point out what we think is good and what is bad. I think people tend to criticize the fact that it's hard to judge what Prof Gluck likes, but I don't really think that's the point -- you can learn a lot whether or not you're getting workshopped if you stay engaged. And I think I've come out knowing not just why Prof Gluck comes up with various assessments of poems but also how to disagree with her and make my own arguments, which is the most important thing you can get out of any class.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I think this class is fantastic for cultivating your poetic voice, and getting a better sense of the things that inspire you.",
    "Take this course to take a poetry course with Louise Glck, because she's insightful and will tell you straight up if she likes or does not like your work, which will make you improve. At the end of the day, this is a very low-stress class because you can submit a poem a week and still do all the work. But you should take the time to revise everything and actually improve.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student with some prior poetry experience, or a student who is ready to get what they can from an expert instructor, knowing it will be a little rough and they will likely want to take a class that focuses more on the craft of poetry afterwards.",
    "I would because learning to write better poetry has helped all of my writing.",
    "Yes. Louise is Louise, after all.",
    "If you get in, you'd be absolutely nuts not to take this class. Louise will strip you of all your illusions, tear your work apart in a way that's at once brutal and scrupulously fair, and expose you to ways of thinking about writing that you've never considered. 246 is the best kind of difficult pushing you to your absolute limits without ever being unreasonable, and showing you firsthand what art truly demands of the artist. If you want a class that will actually humble you, and give you the tools you need to make yourself an extraordinary writer, this is it."
