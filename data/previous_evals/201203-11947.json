    "Don't worry, the German department remains just as awesome as before when you get to L3. Still only a skit for a final! Marc is simply amazing, but I don't think he's going to teach it anymore. Sad face.",
    "I would say that it is a decent intermediate language class, but would not recommend it unless they really want to explore German, because the workload is pretty high, and of course meeting every day is a real drag.The emphasis seems to be mostly on speaking \/ acting as far as the day-to-day class work, so for someone like me who was mostly interested in reading German, this was a bit inconvenient.",
    "Yes! Although the teacher I took it with is not teaching anymore, the German department in general is great and learning German (as long as you like language learning) is a very good experience. Will improve your understanding of English grammar, as well! :)",
    "This is a great intermediate class.",
    "Like GMAN120, but more so. You'll review grammar, start reading things in the original (including selections from Brecht and Kafka), and watch movies (this year DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN and IM JULI). Basically, if you took L1\/L2 and enjoyed the atmosphere, stick with it.",
    "More grammar-heavy than L2, less literature than L4. Take it with an instructor that you really like the teaching style of as it'll make a huge difference to how much you learn. Also be aware that the department is fairly disorganized, so be ready to have deadlines and assignments radically changed or moved in date with very little notice. The net result is that this course is quite a lot of work - but if you want to learn German, that can only be a good thing."
