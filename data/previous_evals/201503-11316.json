    "I definitely would recommend it, but I would warn students that it is a lot of work..",
    "This course provides a good teaching foundation, and I would recommend that one of the assignments (perhaps instead of the 5 page paper) be to create a syllabus for an undergraduate course. However, I was left wondering why so little of the scholarship we read dealt with bottom-up questions.",
    "Hist 641 offers you a window onto the historiography of Atlantic history. I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students because it gives you a unique opportunity to work with two scholars.",
    "HIST 641 compares the British and Spanish colonialism in the early modern Atlantic world and looks at the corresponding scholarly debates in political and economic history. It focuses more on processes of colonialism and the actions of Europeans, rather than comparing the experiences of ordinary people in the colonies. This is the bulk of the material and the focus of the discussions, so I would recommend this course to a student with those interests who already has a good background on the topic. I would not recommend the course to those just beginning to learn about this field, or who have other interests (i.e. cultural history, religious history, history from below\/subaltern studies, post-colonial critiques), or who are interested in analyzing very recent scholarship. I would also only recommend this course to students who are taking less than four courses or who are not taking an additional research course, since this course required a lot of written work."

   "comments": [
    "excellent historiographical grounding.",
    "This course was not so much difficult as time consuming. I would have appreciated fewer readings and more detailed discussions. I would have also liked one more week to work on the paper. That said, I am pleased with the finished project. This course built on my previous knowledge and taught me a number of new things. I am sure I will continue to interact with these professors in the future.",
    "After five years of research on espionage in the Spanish-American borderlands this course offered me the best opportunity yet to polish an article for publication. The feedback I received from Professors Schwarz and Pincus on my final paper was very encouraging and has inspired me to try to publish on the topic.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline by introducing me to authors and debates in a subfield that I was not previously familiar with. Furthermore, it contributed to my interest in comparative history, and helped me move closer toward a dissertation topic."
