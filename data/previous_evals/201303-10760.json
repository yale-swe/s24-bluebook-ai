   "comments": [
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is exactly what the title suggests. The course is all grammar and only grammar. If you want to improve your grammar then take this class because your grammar will definitely improve. The class doesn't help much with my writing, reading, or speaking skills but it gave me better fundamentals so that in the future these other skills could be developed.",
    "Yes. If you want to become fluent in Spanish you must take this class, plus it's fun!",
    "No, it is too boring and my Spanish did not improve by much.",
    "This class taught me a lot of new material I had never seen before which was interesting. It was a lot of work but it was relevant to class and reinforced new ideas. I recommend it if you're ready for a lot of work but good discussion and topics.",
    "This class has a lot of work, but is interesting if you take it for the right reasons. If you're very interested in perfecting your Spanish grammar skills, then I would definitely recommend this class. However if you are trying to find a class to take after not taking Spanish for a year, I am more hesitant to recommend this class. You might want to choose a different L5 course with less work and stress attached to it.",
    "It is one of the few L5 classes that focus on the language itself. A lot of the material will be reviewing in greater depth the grammar points hastily covered during L1-L4, but we also got to expand our vocabulary and learn about more special constructions. There are quite a lot of homework and mostly are mechanical grammar exercises, much more meticulously graded than in L1-L4, so it is harder to get exceptionally high scores in homework or exams. The writings are all brief (~2 pages) and the readings are awesome. The textbook is excellent and is useful for future reference too. If you just come out of L4, this class will prepare you for the higher level writing or literature classes. It does not help much with speaking though.",
    "It starts out with a review of ser\/estar, but gradually gets into more difficult topics. There is a lot of homework, but this is to make sure you really understand the material. It's good for clarifying grammar topics before taking other L5 classes.",
    "In a nutshell, Advanced Spanish Grammar is very detailed and work-intensive--there is much repetition and sometimes even monotonous work, but that is what it takes to master the grammatical aspect of the Spanish language. I recommend this course to any student who is aware of these facts about the course and is passionate about studying the nitty-gritty details of the Spanish language.",
    "A ton of work, at least a few hours of work for every class, and still not easy. Not easy grading either. However, if you're already pretty comfortable it's a good class to refine your grammar, and Seymour is great- she's always available for extra help, and just the sweetest.",
    "This is a good class. Your grammar (spoken and written) will improve. Be prepared to work--not a whole lot, but consistently through the semester."
