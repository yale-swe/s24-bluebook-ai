    "I audited the class",
    "This is a great course!",
    "I audited the course. I'm glad professor Ashton made me take the midterm because it forced me to study the material.",
    "Question 1 - - I did not do any of the assigned reading and never felt like I was missing anything which makes me think it was not helpful).Question 7 - - Mark is one of the best professors\/lecturers that I've had. In addition, it is very clear that he is devoted to education and students more than other faculty here at FES. He has the time, the energy, and the commitment that I would like to see more of here.Question 8 - - Great course.Question 10 - - Great field trips, and very helpful to learning and understanding the material. This was especially true for the better planned field trips (Yale Myers, Quabbin, URI).",
    "With regard to question 5 about professor responsiveness to questions, Mark definitely answered student questions on field trips and in smaller group settings. But, during the lectures, there was very little opportunity for critical engagement and questioning. I would have appreciated it if Mark stopped regularly to solicit questions, demand questions, or ask questions of the students. I suppose that some years the class is too large to do this well, but at least this year, the class was small enough that it would have enhanced my in class experience to break up the lectures with some time dedicated to questions\/discussion. Too often the lectures went along without enough time to critically engage\/process the material, even though there were breaks midway through.",
    "This is one of the best courses offered at FES. The out of class work is especially valuable and is really serves to drive home the material. Though there are a ton of field trips they are all worth it. I am a huge proponent of hands-on learning so if that's your thing then take this course.",
    "Really enjoyed this class. There were a lot of field trips, but they were all useful. There's nothing quite like being able to observe Mark in the field :-)",
    "The field trips that I was able to attend were great and really where a lot of the learning happens. The lectures, on the other hand, move quite slow. Mark should condense his lectures and do some of the field trips instead of Wednesday classes. Alternately, when enrolling for the class, it should indicate it meets M,W,F. Other classmates who were unable to attend the field trips due to prior commitments\/other classes were at a significant disadvantage. Mark is fun and engaging, but a bit all over the place. For beginners, this is challenging. For those with some background, it is quite fun. Great beginner class for MFs, interesting for others, but not as useful.",
    "Everyone should take this class.",
    "Great class and introduction to silviculture.",
    "In response to question 1. I regret not reading more of the material.",
    "There were definitely a lot of field trips, but they were really helpful. The only thing that I struggled with was the size of the class. It is difficult on field trips to ask all of your questions and hear the professor in a large group. I didn't realize how much the field trips built on one another until the second to last field trip and our visit to Yale Myers when it all started to click.I really enjoyed the class.",
    "The course is valuable, even to MEM'ers, because of the continuous illustration of competing values--a concept that we must all grapple with as much as possible while stakes aren't high and we're in school. This class is a continuous reminder of that.",
    "The textbook is very helpful, much more concise and better organized than class lectures.Lots of field trips, but they are fun if a bit disorganized.Mark Ashton is a great guy, very engaged with students, enthusiastic, but it must be said that he really is a terrible lecturer. It was hard to follow along, and slides had minimal information to ground the lectures. I learned a lot more from the textbook."

That is palpable in this class and students are more enthused because of it.",

    "It can be a bit tough paying attention in class. I suggest not bringing a laptop and sitting in the front.",
    "The pace, Prof. Ashton can get a little off course in lectures.",
    "Not too much. I would eliminate the Friday lectures scheduled at the beginning of the semester as I think all of the material could be fit into the normal class hours.",
    "mark's lectures are a bit like long lists of concepts. he's a great person, has great energy and knowledge, and he is a fantastically generous person. but the lectures were really not that helpful.",
    "The work - maybe have 2 quizzes instead of a midterm. Space out assessments, so there are more opportunities to apply what has been learned.",
    "The course is taught to be accessable to people with no background in science or ecology; it might be better to assume more knowledge since FES admissions generally requires some science.",
    "Sometimes when my group got a wrong answer on a field trip exercise, or just didn't understand how to calculate something correctly, we never really went over how to do it the right way. I wish we had gone over the exercises together after doing them in groups to solidify how it's supposed to be done, because there were definitely times when my group was way off and we weren't sure why.",
