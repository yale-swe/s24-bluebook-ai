   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I feel like I learned about so many different aspects of our public health history that I had never even heard of. Anyone interested in American studies, cultural studies, women's health, race relations, our modern healthcare system, etc would find this class fascinating. You can't go wrong taking it! Just make sure you're a fast enough typer to keep up with Prof. Rogers during lectures...",
    "This class is a fairly good historical overview of US public health in the last two centuries, and I recommend it to folks interested in that history. My four most significant cautions are the following: (1) the class covers too much material in too little time, which is a natural problem with overview lectures. Important things are skipped over or given little attention due to this lack of time. (2) Professor Rogers speaks WAY TOO FAST and sometimes starts class before the actual start time. She's incredibly hard to follow. (3) Section is basically useless. (4) Though the class is advertised to cover material up to the present, it full-stops in the 1980s. This isn't a problem so much as just misleading.",
    "This was a good class. It's very straightforward and you know what's expected of you. Great way to get your humanities credit.",
    "Hist of Science, Hist of Med 215 is a comprehensive look at public health in America in 1793-2000. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the lectures are super interesting and there is not a lot of reading.",
    "If you're even a little bit interested in public health, take this class. I honestly learned SO much this semester, probably more than I've learned from most classes at Yale. And it was mostly material that was both new and interesting for me. Lectures can move a little too quickly, which can be frustrating, but luckily the material is pretty straightforward. The paper is great - you can write about whatever you want, so I actually LOVED writing my paper because I was able to choose a topic that I'm passionate about. The readings are super easy and enjoyable and not even necessary all the time. Midterm and final require studying but are fair. Overall, solid history course and in a REALLY interesting subject that I knew nothing about before and now feel very confident discussing.",
    "Yes! DEFINITELY take it.",
    "Yes! Take it if you're at all interested in HSHM -- it's a great introduction to the subject as it pertains to American History.",
    "Public Health in America gives a great overview of the topic. There's not too much work (a midterm, final, and final paper), and lectures are enjoyable although Professor Rogers goes fast sometimes. You learn a lot of interesting things. The course is definitely worth taking.",
    "Public Health was generally interesting, but I wasn't blown away. The course was kind of disorganized, but the subject matter was interesting. It isn't too much work, and if it's something that you don't know a lot about, it would be worth taking.",
    "Good class, average workload, fun readings that you will actually enjoy and are not too long, interesting and relevant information",
    "This course was a really great introduction to public health in America. I think it is perfect for anyone interested in public health, history, science, politics, and medicine. The topics were interesting and eye-opening. The work is not very taxing and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "No, the professors and TAs don't seem to care.",
    "Exams were fair, but because there are so few opportunities for assessment in the course, a LOT of material is covered so a lot of your grade rides on the two exams and paper. A bad TA made this class's discussion section pretty uninteresting for me, and I also did not like Professor Rogers' lecture style. Some of the readings and course material were interesting, but I overall would not recommend this course.",
    "This class is a very good overview of public health and how it emerged as a field in the United States however I wouldn't really recommend it unless you are a HSHM major or just really interested in history. There aren't many discussions about how history impacts the current situation of health in the United States. I just had ahard time seeing the continuity or relevance of the course. However, I did learn a lot so that's good.",
    "If it sounds interesting to you, then take the class. You pretty much get what you sign up for. As an HSHM major, I liked the class. My friend who took it who was not, found it boring.",
    "Really basic to the point of boring.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to students, even if they are not planning on majoring in History of Science\/Medicine. It gives an effective overall understanding of the path the US has traveled to get to the ACA.",
    "Overall, a great class. The lectures are engaging, the readings are a lot but interesting, and the workload really isn't too bad (2 exams, 1 paper). Definitely worth it if you're interested in public health, premed, or just care about American history in general. Section isn't that useful, though, which I would consider the biggest downside.",
    "I would recommend the course. Fascinating material. Audit it though if you're worried about your grade--I did not feel prepared for the midterm or the term paper. Not much guidance from the TFs in that area. However, if you have the time, I think an A is very doable.",
    "Great class - solid survey of public health history, exactly what I expected. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend. The course work was backloaded, tho.",
    "It was good, informative, very interesting and does what it says it will teach you. Not a ton of work and interesting readings.",
    "Good. Lectures are intense and trying to get all the info down is stressful (no lecture slides posted). Exams are rote memorization for ID questions, and attempting to synthesize info into overarching themes for essay questions. It was okay. I learned a lot and will surely use this knowledge in my future career (medicine). I think all future doctors should take this class. It wasn't a 100% enjoyable experience, but I got a lot out of it. Would recommend, with a grain of salt. I didn't read the books, just the course packet--I think I did fine.",
    "Public Health in America is a very solid survey lecture class that gives you a great background in the progression of attitudes and structures of public health throughout our history. The lectures are not always the best, though - they often seem pretty disorganized. The class is not a lot of work, but 70% of the grade is determined in the last week of class. There is not a lot of support for writing your essay or studying either. But overall, I think I got a lot from this class, even if it wasn't executed perfectly.",
    "Very little work, pretty boring. Information is interesting. I wouldn't take this course again. There is many other good hshm classes to take.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for its content and the quality of the lectures and instructor.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class. It gives a great account of the key moments in America's public health history and is very engaging if that's something you're interested in. However, be aware that lectures move fast and powerpoints are not posted. The final paper is on a topic of your choosing so it can be enjoyable to write and the tests are very fair.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone interested in medicine or public health or simply looking for a really interesting class with engaging material.",
    "One of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This course demonstrates how history informs the present. All of the themes covered, from smallpox vaccination to health care disparities were relevant to issues we face today.",
    "This class is very interesting and covers events in America from the AIDS epidenic to leprosy to the yellow fever. Lectures are well done but a little fast and slides are never avilable after class. That is my only conplaint.",
    "This was a good class! Goodthings to know: Professor Rogers starts lectures EARLY, so don't take this class if you like to slip in late to everything, and you should also only take this class if you are a fast typer, because she goes through a lot in lecture.I learned a lot about a part of US HIstory that I hadn't ever really considered, which was really great, and the section was fun. Fairly small workload-- two tests and a paper-- so a fun fifth credit.",
    "This is a great introduction to the big questions of public health, and the big events in American medical history. I would recommend it--it is fascinating material, taught by an amazing scholar and lecturer. But if you have taken another class on the history of public health, you will probably already be familiar with a lot of the course's ideas.",
    "I would not recommend the course to another student. Much more interesting courses are offered at Yale.",
    "I'd take it only if you're really interested in the subject matter. The readings are really good primary sources, but the lecture can be an overload of information."
