   "comments": [
    "This is real physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics, and electrodynamics all come together in stunning crystallization. Professor Baltay is an engaging, funny, and insight professor. This class was absolutely the highlight of my year.",
    "This is a great class. Baltay is an amazing professor and he really understands all the topics we cover throughout the year. It is fun (weird for physics) and always interseting. The work is not too bad, and all the tests are very reasonable.",
    "Yes. Definitely recommend to anyone.",
    "PHYS 261 is a continuation of PHYS 260. It's a great class to take, particularly if you're interested in the logic and thinking that goes behind physics, rather than being able to solve tricky problems. Additionally, general relativity is covered in this class (which is awesome).",
    "If you are looking ahead and deciding about taking it, do it. Baltay is awesome and if you can do the math 260 is way less work than 200. If you started out in 260, continue with 261. Baltay is awesome, and it is a great intro to some of the more interesting topics in physics (quantum and GR). Second semester problem sets were really easy, and the midterm had a generous curve.",
    "Physics 261 covers most of the basic material from electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity (with some introductory general relativity towards the end). Some material associated with particular subjects is not explicitly mentioned in class (dialectrics, paramagnetic materials, electric\/magnetic fields through non-conducting media, for instance), and so in that sense the class \"assumes\" that you learn the material on your own. The first textbook for the class is pretty good (Griffiths is very readable), while the second textbook tends not to be used as much (besides problems and references to specific approximate formula from the problems). The lectures on quantum mechanics are relatively thorough, however, so overall the class is pretty good. Baltay is a great teacher and is usually available for asking questions on related subjects.",
    "Great class if you want an introduction to advanced concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics. Tests are challenging but the class is rewarding on the whole.",
    "Physics 261 is a great course! In 260 you learn mechanics and E&M - stuff you learned in high school - but in more detail, and you also learn some special relativity. In 261 we started with magnetism but went onto learn things you may not have learned in high school - quantum mechanics and general relativity. We didn't really \"learn\" either quantum or GR in a whole lot of depth, but this course is a good introduction to those different topics. And Professor Baltay is a great professor to give you an introduction to this material - he's a lot of fun, and he's very excellent at explaining these things and conveying the big picture.",
    "Really exciting and a great introduction into the big ideas in physics. I dont know how I could ever take a physics course that stresses doing complex problems after 260. I feel like 260 made me realize that the concepts of physics are incredible however I cant get the same excitement out of working through a problem as I do just thinking about the ideas behind quantum and general rel.",
    "Physics 260 \/ 261 is a fantastic set of courses. It is a intense class, but well worth the work and effort.",
    "A very interesting class. Not too hard either. Lectures cover advanced topics and derivations but the problem sets and tests aren't as bad as the description makes it seem. Do not be afraid to take this class if you aren't taking Math 230. Math 120 will do. Differential equations second semester is a good supplement but is not needed a all.",
    "If you like physics, and you took first semester, and you have a solid background, take it. Second semester is definitely mathematically and thematically more challenging than first. Some of the derivations we did kind of went over my head, and that made the final challenging, but Professor Baltay is wonderful, and in general the exams were not terrible and were graded leniently. This course does a great job of making people excited about physics, of allowing freshman to see complex derivations, and of introducing students to \"real physics.\" Also, Professor Baltay is interesting, fun, passionate, great at explaining, and really innovative in the way he teaches physics. It was a real pleasure to learn from him. He was also extremely helpful one on one.",
    "This course will give you a theoretical appreciation of modern physics, namely relativity and quantum. This makes it GREAT. It's hard but not crazy difficult; but I think you have to really love physics to get the most out of it. You should also be very comfortable with the theoretical foundations of vector calculus (it's okay if you don't remember how to apply it). If you're deciding between phys 201 and 261, you will focus less on minutia and have your mind blown much more often in phys 261. To me, that says \"take this course\".",
    "Difficult but worth it.",
    "If you are interested in the future of physics and want to learn a great deal of academic material this is a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any prospective physics major. It gives a great tour of physics and is overall a great class. This course need not necessarily be take concurrently with Math 230.",
    "I would highly recommend Physics 261, as it is a fascinating class that teaches such cool subjects as quantum mechanics and general relativity at a comparably accessible level. The workload can at times be intense, especially with the material from the E&M book, but overall the extra challenge is definitely worth it. As long as you are comfortable with basic multivariable calculus, you will find this class very enjoyable.",
    "Wonderful for kids in the mathematical know, and Prof. Baltay is a great lecturer. However, those who are not \"quick\" at math may find themselves outpaced and unable to follow the mathematical arc of a class, even if the conceptual arc is clear.TA quality will define your relationship with the course outside of lecture, and it will vary widely semester by semester.Knowing the math necessary may not be sufficient - when they mean \"flair\", they do mean it. If you think you can handle it, the course will reward you, have no doubt, the workload isn't onerous, and absolutely worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Baltay makes Physics incredibly elegant and simple, and his tests are not too challenging. Don't be scared away, and go to lecture because Baltay is very insightful and enjoyable to listen to.",
    "Physics 261 is an all-around amazing class. Do not be afraid of taking this course because it is the highest level intro physics class; it is accessible yet challenging. You will grow as a physicist and a person by taking this course. Professor Baltay is an excellent instructor whose most unique contribution to each and every topic we discuss is his ability to give explanations that truly make sense. Although most people who take the class already know the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the true explanation of its validity is Fourier series, for example. The problem sets are good, and the topics covered are diverse yet to a great level of depth.",
    "Physics 261 has more new stuff than 260, and the G.R. at the end can get kind of weird, since Baltay teaches it in a unique manner that simplifies certain things in a sometimes-confusing way. The tests are a bit harder, but the workload is similar, as in pretty light. If you get a good TA, like we didn't, you'd probably have a better time. The class was still good though, and Baltay is as clear and entertaining as ever.",
    "Challenging material conceptually, but the work isn't too difficult and is very doable in terms of quantity. Provides a basic, hand-waving understanding of General Relativity, which is very interesting and exciting if you like physics. I recommend this class.",
    "Phys 261 gives you the opportunity to learn about many of the cool things you have always been interested in. General relativity, black holes, metrics and tensors--all are covered in the course. I recommend it but be serious about learning the material and going into greater depth than that which is presented in class.",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester! Professor Baltay is absolutely wonderful. His lectures are clear, entertaining, and well-organized. The material is fascinating -- the class covers quantum mechanics and general relativity with far more mathematical rigor than I had expected. This is the really cool stuff! This is why you spend hours calculating baseball trajectories and drawing force diagrams in high school, so that you can someday understand these complex phenomena, and Baltay makes learning them even more fun. Only downside was this semester's TA, who basically didn't do anything, but that didn't matter too much since the class is so small and Baltay has office hours.",
    "I would certainly recommend Phys 261 to another student. If you took 260 last semester then you already know how good Baltay is, but this semester is even better because you learn some quantum mechanics and derive some of general relativity. The workload is pretty much the same (not too much per week) and the material is quite interesting. Take this class if deriving Heisenbberg's uncertainty principle from gaussian wave distributions and maxwell's equations from coulombs law and special relativity sound exciting to you.",
    "If you want to really understand physics, this class is great. It's tough while you're in it, but anything you do with physics afterward will make much more sense.",
    "This class is a good way to get a sense of physics topics, which is really useful if this is the last physics you might take at Yale. While there was less focus on problem, making the final and midterm difficult, overall I learned a lot about how physics works.",
    "OK, hotshot. You made it out of 260 alive. Congratulations. You're where I was this time in 2010: feeling good, knowing how great a professor Baltay is, and itching for the upcoming challenge. Be warned - this is a whole new ballgame.Got through 260 with an OK knowledge of multivariable? OK doesn't cut it. Be prepared to derive E and M field equations, on an exam, given just Maxwell's equations. (Look them up and imagine how.)Taken Diff Eq? You won't have needed to, but you'll be glad if you did. We spend a fair amount of time dealing with Schodinger's Equation.Ever even heard of a tensor? It's kind of like a vector, but more general. You'll probably be picking them up on the fly, because no math class you're likely to have taken deals with them. And don't believe Professor Baltay if he says you won't be expected to know these sorts of things; three out of eight questions on the final dealt with tensor math.All that said, this is still one of the best classes I've ever taken. Baltay is an excellent lecturer, as you by know realize. You cover a lot of material, all of it interesting. I'm not even a Physics major; I'm in the humanities, and I still loved it. So if everything I said above sounds more like a challenge to be met than like a threat to be avoided, you're in the right place. Godspeed.",
    "Take it if you are interested in Gerneral relativity. The math wouldn't be a big problem.",
    "261 is similar to 260, although 261 has more interesting, cutting-edge material, in my opinion. If you enjoyed 260, take 261.If you're trying to take 261 without 260, it's possible; you'll need to work hard, though.",
    "I highly recommend this course."
