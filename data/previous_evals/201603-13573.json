   "comments": [
    "Learned how to discuss legalities in Spanish, and different constitutions in Latin American countries. Learned how to write real paragraphs in Spanish.",
    "You learn about the legal systems of most Spanish Speaking countries compared vis-a-vis the American system. It is interesting to compare and contrast across cases.",
    "Further development of my Spanish skills",
    "I learned a lot of vocabulary which is useful when conversing in Spanish about legal topics. I also had the opportunity to investigate certain areas of international law and international topics which I had not experienced before.",
    "Wonderful introduction to key topics in the legal system, immigration, etc. in Latin America. Gained a deeper knowledge of these issues and a framework for engaging with them in the Spanish language.",
    "I took this course to improve and maintain my spanish, as well as to develop a legal vocabulary and the course certainly delivered. We discussed interesting topics and the weekly reading response and twice a week classes kept me reading, writing and speaking the language well.",
    "I learned so much about legal process that I had never known before. Professor Carreras was so great at helping us to improve our grammar and speaking skills.",
    "I greatly improved my oral and written spanish skills! Typically oral skills are not stressed in beginner classes, and this class certainly avoided that mistake!",
    "I learned a lot of new vocabulary relating to the legal field, how certain legal processes work and how to discuss those in Spanish, and improved my grammar skills.",
    "I learned much more Legal and political Spanish vocabulary as well as facts regarding the various constitutions of Latin American countries."

   "comments": [
    "Great course, very interesting. Could be a smaller course packet (I feel like we only used a third of it even though it was pretty expensive).",
    "The class was always very interesting and made it a point to incorporate relevant visual materials.",
    "Some strengths of the course were that it was a moderate work load and encouraged engaging conversation during class time. The weakness of the course is that it is only offered at 9am!",
    "Wonderfully laid back, and awesome Professor! She is such a sweet person!",
    "The course assessment is fair and the professor is fantastic. The topics were interesting and the structure was good. A smaller class could have been better to allow for more discussion and engagement.",
    "Really can't think of many ways to improve the course.",
    "The oral discussion based format was critical to the class. No recommendations for improvement.",
    "The course covers a lot of really interesting material, but didn't really follow the syllabus in terms of the dates we covered each topic and the readings we did to prepare for it. In the future, I would suggest aligning the syllabus more closely with what we cover in the course, just so it's a little more organized and the students can be prepare better. Other than that, I thought the content itself was covered thoroughly and I appreciated the opportunity to have group presentations on different topics, so that we could gain in-depth knowledge of many different subjects.",
    "The strength of the course is the feedback given, the fairness of grading, and the engaging political discussions we participated in throughout the semester. The weakness, however, was probably the lack of various activities and exercises that would help cement the knowledge we learned. We mostly discussed topics and watched videos which, although helpful, don't allow us to engage with the material as in depth as possible."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah this is such a dope class. Mercedes is so funny, and while her iPhone is always volatile and goes off at random times, she is always engaging the class and prepared with a lesson. Homework is pretty easy as long as you put in some effort, and the only real catch is the 10 page final paper (but you can write it on any topic). Would definitely recommend for that young language credit, but don't expect hardcore Spanish practice.",
    "Take this! Professor Carreras is one of the most amazing and caring professors at Yale. One of the best ways to get a language credit if you need one but also to take even if you don't need one! Fun, engaging and not too much work.",
    "Yes, good way to continue in Spanish without the sometimes-brutal (at least for someone with absolutely no innate grasp of the language) intensity if L1-L4 courses",
    "This class is a good intro to understanding legal systems in Latin America and Spain, and you increase your vocabulary. The environment is relaxed, and Professor Carreras is sweet and helpful. I'd recommend it as a nice fifth class!",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student. The professor, Professor Carreras, is probably one of my favorite professors at Yale. The course was absolutely worth it.",
    "Would strongly recommend this course! A very kind, easygoing Professor and a cool subject matter in the study of the law through a Spanish lens.",
    "If you want to maintain and improve your spanish and develop a legal vocabulary then this is a good course. The class isn't too challenging so don't be put off if you aren't a native speaker.",
    "Most definitely. A great way to learn not only a language but interesting legal material as well.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you would like to improve your spanish speaking skills if you have not practiced in a while!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! Professor Carreras is SO sweet and genuinely passionate about teaching Spanish and engaging her students with the material. It's a good fifth class, not too hard of a workload considering it's a language class and the classroom environment is super laid-back. You really get out as much as you put in, so if you're interested in the subject, need a chill L5, or just want to practice your Spanish a few times a week, I would definitely take Legal Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who are looking for a low pressure class. However, if looking for a class that will intellectually challenge you, this may not be the right one."
