    "I think it would be better to introduce some social or mental health issues in workplace as well. That would be truly interesting topics.",
    "While I think this course is a great elective for APH students, it is a waste of time for traditional 2-year EHS MPH students. All of the material taught in this class is covered in the required courses Toxicology, Risk Assessment, and Assessing Exposures to Environmental Stressors. Since I had already taken these three courses, this class was completely review.",
    "Some lectures were more interesting than others. Learning about occupational health epidemiology and industrial hygiene through case studies would make the topics more interesting. Many of the readings, especially the ones in the textbook, seemed superfluous and were never addressed. Cutting out some readings and being sure to address the important readings in class would be nice.",
    "very enjoyable course. well organized. guest speakers were a nice addition. Some guest speakers better than others. Meredith was excellent",
    "The parade of guest speakers in this class was incredibly frustrating as a student. While it was nice to bring such a variety of perspectives into class, so many of those people had little to no pedagogical training, and there was no coordination about what the precedent was for background information, leading to endless repetition of certain concepts and topics. Surely, Ebola and asbestos are not the only two occupational hazards in the workplace, but due to the frequency with which they came up, you would think so. The grading in this class was effectively pointless. It felt like no matter what you put down, it wouldn't get marked off, or only a tiny percentage point would be taken off. While I can appreciate wanting people to feel good about their grades, and how a variety of correct answers can appear within these questions, marking everything correct to the degree that happened in this course disincentivized me from ever studying, preparing, reading papers, or engaging in the class at all. Surely in the real occupational medicine world you cannot do anything at all and have it be right; it would be nice to have the grading reflect that.",
    "Nice introductory lecture to occupational medicine. It was good to have different speakers in one course. However, 5 quizzes besides mid\/finals were bit stressful.",
    "I was disappointed with this course because it felt too elementary. Each lecture seemed to repeat the same basic principles of occupational medicine and then provide a very superficial look into the topic of the week. The guest lecturers were variable. Dr. Stowe was very VERY nice and way too easy of a grader. I enjoyed her lectures - though she confused the MDs with her epi lecture. Dr. Redlich's lecture was disappointing, specifically the reproductive health lecture. I also thought the epi lecture was completely unnecessary and review. To make the class more appealing, you should consider making epi II a pre-req and making the course material more challenging.",
    "the book was soooooooooooooooooo unhelpful, and a waste of my time to read, this should have been clearer at the beginning of the coursea",
    "Very good",
    "The courses strengths are its instructors. They are passionate about the course and teaching it and make it easy to learn. One thing that I think could make it better is an overview or clear outline of sorts to help make the connections between all the different classes clearer.",
    "Too much knowledge that was vey helpful for my profession in medical field",
    "The textbook readings were very redundant. Each chapter had a specific topic, but it would spend the first 30-50% of the chapter re-treading \"this is how you would conduct a survey, these are the questions you'd ask, this is the data you would record, etc...\" The lectures were fantastic and engaging.",
    "The course focused on occupation, but it's merely a review of epidemiology courses and other EHS courses."

    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Excellent.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Dr. Redlich has a lot of great experience, however I find her lecture style difficult to follow. Her sense of sarcasm may be difficult for students to follow. She also has a tendency to interrupt guest lecturers to discuss things that are not pertinent to the present discussion.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Carrie clearly has a ton of incredibly valuable experience in the occupational medicine field. However, it might make more sense to have only Meredith run the class since she already handles the logistics of it anyway. Then Dr. Redlich could just give her lectures, but not run the class.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0gave very little feedback and did not seem interested in students other than her Occupational Medicine Fellows in the class.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Dr. Redlich is an ineffective teacher. In the few lectures she gave, the information she presented was scattered and often unjustified or unexplained. She frequently would interject during guest lectures with long-winded unrelated tangents. Also, while I understand that she is a doctor and may have other responsibilities, I do not believe that gives her the power to frequently check her phone during lecture. If she wants the students to stay engaged at all, she has a duty to stay engaged in the class as well. I assume I am being held to a standard of putting off important e-mails or calls until the class is done, and I would like to hold that standard to the teachers as well.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0She was trying to answer all questions regarding to topic. She also challenged us with many different cases. Nice to work with her.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Didn't enjoy her lectures. She didn't seem super invested (checked her phone DURING her lecture??) and would interrupt guest lecturers with long personal anecdotes...",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0nice",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0very good",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Carrie is very experienced in the field and has a lot of knowledge about it. I think more emphasis on what she considers powerpoint in her classes will be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0A good teacher",
    "Instructor: Carrie Redlich \u00a0Excellent instructor. Very passionate, engaging, responsive. Always provided additional helpful information. Very receptive to student requests or recommendations. Overall fantastic instructor!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Excellent. She really cares the students opinions.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is very good at relaying the gaps in the lecture or discussions she thinks we are not picking up on or are having a hard time with. I like her lecture style, when she does get to lecture. I wish she gave more lectures in this course.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith handled the logistics of the class and was the person who was there every lecture to try and thread common themes through the course. She clearly cared that we learn the key concepts and provided us with fair opportunities to demonstrate our knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0excellent. approachable and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is incredibly nice, to the point where the grading in the class was reflecting this personality. Her lectures at the beginning of the semester were somewhat clear, though the study design lecture was a complete review of intro epidemiology, a class nearly everyone in this class should have taken by the point they were in it, so it may be able to do a briefer review of the study designs and get right to application of that information.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was absolutely approachable, helpful, and kind. Thank you for your help.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Extremely nice. Almost painfully so. Grades way too easily.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0she's the MD right? pompous. Liked read my mind questions. Took points off on our midterm for statistics I got from CDC website. Like, really? you expect us to read all the individual studies and disagree with the CDC that flu vaccine provides herd immunity????? REALLY??????",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very nice",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith has amazing insight into the course. She is very sensitive and perceptive about students individually as well and this makes her a great tutor. I was privileged to study under her.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Amazing, very approachable, excellent teacher, so sweet and understanding, always looking after the students best interest making sure we are not over worked, flexible with work and assignment submissions, like the sweetest grand ma,",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Excellent instructor. Very passionate, engaging, responsive. Always provided additional helpful information. Very receptive to student requests or recommendations. Overall fantastic instructor!"

    "Not everyone is interested in the course I suppose, and some contents might be overlapping with some other courses (epi). But overall it's a really good course and I would highly recommend it to others.",
    "Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11",
    "If you are a 2-year EHS MPH student do not waste your time with this course. However if you are an APH 1-year student with a clinical degree already, this is a great course for you with low time expectations.",
    "Some lectures are more interesting than others, but for a class taught by many different people, they do a pretty good job of weaving common themes together and providing a solid introductory picture of occupational health. The course exams\/quizzes are fair overall. Even though some of the quiz questions were very specific, the exam questions, which are worth more, were very fair.",
    "This class is a rehashing of epidemiology to focus more on the occupational setting. However, it does so in an incredibly simplistic wayit doesn't feel like it gets into much of the nitty-gritty or finer details of the system, much more of a survey. The grading is extremely easy. I would recommend it if you were planning on going into occupational medicine, but not much otherwise.",
    "I like this course and it was fun to study.",
    "If I had just gone to the first 2 lectures, I'd pretty much have learned everything else covered the rest of the class. Don't recommend unless you want an easy class...(sorry)",
    "not a bad course- but there was a bit of pompousness in the MD instructer",
    "Very good",
    "If one has any interest in occupational and environmental medicine this is a great place to start. I would recommend it because serves as a great introduction, if not more, and invited speakers are specialists in each sector they lecture on.",
    "Great course",
    "Great introduction to Occ med with a very reasonable workload.",
    "I would not recommend the course to those who have taken other EHS courses and those who have taken EPI 1 and 2."
