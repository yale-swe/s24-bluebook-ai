   "comments": [
    "very helpful to learn how to critique studies",
    "Excellent course",
    "The course was overly focused on randomized control trials; observational studies are a huge portion of epidemiology and there's plenty of options on how to do meta-analyses on observational studies that were not covered. The professor's preference for randomized control trials is outdated; the field no longer considers them to be a \"gold standard\". The course had too many arcane examples during lecture. A more practical, step-by-step method would have been extremely helpful. It started off that way, with defining the research question in the beginning and having the medical librarians give guidance, but then became less helpful. It would be great if each week you progressed to a different portion of the meta-analysis steps.",
    "I think that this course is very useful, however, it should be structured better. I believe that the discussion sections should be in the format of workshops where we go over each section of our paper. In addition, I believe that the term paper would be more manageable if a section was due every other week.",
    "This course provides a lot of useful material for students interested in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Additionally, there is a lot of emphasis placed on discerning good quality studies. The broad nature of the class is great, and I would suggest adding more practical sessions using RevMan for data extraction and search strategies earlier in the semester.",
    "Strengths: developing a research question in your field of interest, completing a literature review for your topic with the help of the librarian, turning in a protocol mid year to prepare for the full review Weaknesses: hearing everybody's progress every Thursday. We went around a circle after completing little assignments, and often we would run out of time and wouldn't get to everyone, and meanwhile, kind of zoned out while everyone was talking about their own specific topics, often very technical in the case of the doctor students, and weren't relevant at all to what you were doing. I think the time would be better spent doing RevMan tutorials or talking more about analysis. Improvements: Coming in to the class at the beginning of the semester with a research question already approved by Dr. Wang. Maybe through an application process? This way, we wouldn't have to spend the first half of the semester figuring out what to write on, and then not have enough time to learn about the analysis part of the review. More on the analysis and less on bias. The bias lectures were good, but a little repetitive for epidemiology students. I definitely felt time would be better spent talking about different methods of analysis, particularly for observational studies or special topics. Also, maybe more of a heads up that the class would almost solely be geared toward RCTs. Finally, more time with the librarians on conducting a literature review.",
    "strength : very useful class for writing meta-analysis, learn the skills weakness: if more examples in the course will be better",
    "This is a great introductory course for writing a systematic review at the end you produce a full review with meta analysis that you can publish. To improve please consider a series of workshops focused on Revman or Stata for meta analysis mechanics, that would be highly appreciate it.",
    "Great",
    "Important course, needs more emphasis on how to use Revman.",
    "This was an outstanding series, even for those conducting research there is a lot to learn (always), this was truly useful semester topic for me and allowed me to better appreciate the complexities of gathering and critically evaluating research evidence",
    "I think it's tough if you don't come in with a topic in mind that is suitable for systematic review. I would recommend looking into touching-base with students prior to the start of the semester. Dr. Humphries does something similar where students get their research group in December in anticipation of the spring semester. If there was a way to start working through the topics a little bit sooner, I think it would be an improvement. I think that Dr. Wang did the best he could in covering so much material while we had already started working on the projects.",
    "We should have one year course on the topic of systemic review with computer lab teaching revman",
    "The class is helpful for writing as systematic review. I think it is difficult to focus on writing a variety of systematic reviews as the course progresses. The focus shifts to your own systematic review and how to best write it. I think it would be helpful if there were quizzes or mini assignments on the many types of reviews and how to do them in order to keep the students engaged."

    "Instructor: Shiyi Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang is great. He really gets to know you and your topic, and makes a very personal and genuine effort to give you advice and feedback, even if your area of interest is outside of his area of expertise. I really appreciated how much time and energy he put into the class, be it through providing an exhaustive amount of outside literauture and resources or through personalized feedback in person, through email, or on assignments.",

    "Instructor: Shiyi Wang \u00a0He is incredibly responsive to students and cares deeply. It was noticed and appreciated. He put a lot of time into guiding each student and being there for them and their review.",

   "comments": [
    "I wish we could have more time to review RevMan and have more step-by-step guide to doing our systematic review. Perhaps other students knew how to do the analyze, but I think it would have been helpful to at least talk about it in lecture or perhaps get a list of resources of videos on how to do it. it would have been helpful to all review the same article and assign people or groups to present the findings or quality assessment or the data abstraction. I think it would have made discussion more fulfilling during the small group sessions.",
    "Very good introduction to systematic review and metanalysis. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Excellent course and extremely useful for anyone interested in research and academia. Highly recommended!",
    "This course is based solely on completing a systematic review on a topic of your choice. Tuesdays are lectures on selected topics while Thursdays are \"discussion days\" where you present what you've worked on thus far for your paper. I recommend if you are interested in diving deep into a topic you are interested in and dedicating a fair amount of time writing and reading about it. Many students are doctors, and the class is geared at (though not limited to) reviewing RCTs",
    "Yes, good class to learn",
    "Excellent course if want to produce a systematic review and understand the mechanics of meta analysis.",
    "Great course Yes",

    "Dr. Wang does an excellent job covering how to do a systematic review, although you quickly learn that it's difficult to pull it off in a semester if you don't already have a lot of experience with the topic. I did learn value skills, and referenced the course in job applications. I do recommend it.",
    "Do this course if you are willing to put in a lot of work and get a decent start to a systematic review in the process."
