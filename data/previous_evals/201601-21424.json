    "MATH 430 is a really interesting course, and explores a lot of cool material that many other courses in the math department don't really touch on. Because of this, I would definitely recommend it to any math major. I'd make sure to have a somewhat decent understanding of the basics of point set topology before going in, though, because it covers a lot of general topology very quickly before exploring the main themes of the course.",
    "Such fun material after the first 4 weeks.",
    "Great!",
    "First third of course is spent doing fundamental point set topology covering topology, product topology, homeomorphisms, concepts like connectedness and compactness, and more. The last two thirds of the class after first midterm takes a significant jump in conceptual difficulty and complexity by moving into algebraic topology with fundamental groups, Seifert-Van Kampeu, and other applications. Very interesting."
