    "YES!",
    "This class is difficult but manageable. There were only four problem sets and a take home final. The problem set were difficult especially if you haven't taken analysis.",
    "Meh.",
    "A very good class. Prof. Karbasi is clear and engaging, and his emphasis on in-class participation makes sure that no student gets left behind. Topics are rather theory-heavy (think proofs), but great! Who doesn't want to learn about martingales, Markov chains, and truncated renewal processes? That said, be careful not to be left behind. The material moves quickly and builds on itself, and it's not easy material either. The problem sets are infrequent enough that you'll have to self-assess performance regularly. No matter what, you'll definitely learn a lot - if painfully. Luckily, I think I got much more comfortable with the formal probability theory the course requires by the end of the semester. Fair warning: STAT 241 is NOT adequate preparation for this class. I would recommend at least a little real analysis - this class has a lot of mathematical formality!",
    "Well, stochastic processes are a profound topic with a lot of abstract theorems and proofs. I don't think Prof. Karbasi spent enough time to prepare for lectures, but it's a good material.",
    "A nice intro to random processes. Take it if you're interested.",
    "Amin is a good lecturer who often sent inspirational emails to his students. He clearly wants people to enjoy learning and to challenge themselves. This, however, sometimes manifested itself in strange ways. He enjoyed cold-calling on students during the lectures, which was not the best idea since, despite his best efforts, lectures weren't always clear, so even students who were paying attention would give wrong answers to Amin's questions. I don't know what I would've done if the assignments weren't take-home. I collaborated with others just to get through the problem sets and did what I could on my own for the take home final. I probably would've gotten a 20% on an in-class final. Maybe. Grading was 60% based on 4 problem sets and 40% on a take-home final. Finally, despite Amin's claim that he'd cold call on anyone, he spent the entire semester terrorizing one girl who sat in the second row. He'd cold call on her up to seven times per lecture. It made for some very uncomfortable moments.",
    "STAT 251 is a must-take for people interested in applying math and statistics to the real world. Stochastic processes can model a wide range of problems, and the material covered in this course will be useful. I definitely recommend taking it.",
    "Stochastic Processes is a solid class with some interesting applications. The first couple weeks covers the foundations of formal probability theory, and the rest covers interesting random processes. The material here is subtle but very important for analyzing real world stuff, and I think it's very valuable to see all the places your intuition about (sequences of) random variables fails. The workload wasn't too bad (I enjoyed the psets), and although this year the psets were all shoved into the 2nd half of the course, I wouldn't be surprised if this is fixed if Prof. Karbasi teaches it again. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in applied probability."
