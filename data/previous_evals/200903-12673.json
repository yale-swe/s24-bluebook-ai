    "Interesting foundation for film theory, entertaining professor, intriguing articles, and open paper assignments. I would definitely recommend to any other student interested in discovering how film is what it is today and how it has affected\/been affected by our culture.",
    "A great course with a great instructor. If you get a chance to take a course with Francesco Casetti, then do. He is one of the foremost film theorists around the world, an all-around great guy, funny and approachable, and he knows his subject matter. The course load is absolutely manageable - not too many readings, but enough, and three writing assignments in total - a midterm paper, final paper, and \"final exam\" which is really just another paper, this one more a commentary and reflection on the themes and topics discussed over the course of the semester.Also, Franceso Casetti is one of the few teachers I have had at Yale who seems to truly care about teaching, who considers and likes to get to know his students and who is not concerned solely and first and foremost with his research, although he is the author of countless books.The guy makes you like theory! And more importantly, the course is structured so you are not studying theory for theory's sake, but as a means to an end. You read the great texts and early film theorists in order to understand film from their point of view, in order to understand the idea of modernity, as a current and as a mode of life, and you ultimately gain a greater appreciation for this period of history and are even pushed to further your learning about this side of theory.",
    "Only take if you are a film studies senior and in dire need of a theory course. Definitely the worst class I've taken within the major.",
    "You read lots of essays, short and long, written in continental Europe before 1930, about cinema. The aim of the course is to examine how these writers, who were not film theorists (this category of theorists didn't really exist yet), but people in various fields who regarded film as an emblem of modernity. The readings could be very dry, and only interesting after Casetti talks about them.Take it if you have to, for the benefit of hearing Casetti's lectures.",
    "If you like film theories and their reflection on the modern age, you should take it.Otherwise, it's not as demanding and interesting",
    "Probably not, though it isn't a ton of work.",
    "This is a very relaxed course with many engaging ideas. I'm a film studies major that did not yetget the chance to take more theory-oriented classes, so as an introduction I felt it was pretty good. There was great strength in the readings -- some were somewhat irrelevant -- but the relevant ones were perfectly concise. The class could have been improved with more space for engagement from students, and more of a focus during the latter part of the semester (it seemed to fall apart a bit towards the end).Casetti is very passionate about his work, always intrigued by new questions. He claims his English is not outstanding, but some of the things he said caught me off-guard because of how eloquent and precise they seemed. He is quite funny at times. However, sometimes the structure of his lectures are not very transparent and he moves from point to point without clearly delineating his intent. He is very willing to meet personally with you and seems like an amiable person.I would recommend this course to film studies majors who do not want to stress themselves out.",
    "It's required if you're going to be a Film Studies major. It can be interesting, if you try hard to make it interesting. Some of the reading was pretty boring, but some of it was pretty cool too.",
    "This is not your typical \"film\" course. If the subject matter seems interesting, this is a \"must take\" class.",
    "Yes."
