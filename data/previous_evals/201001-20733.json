    "It's a neccessary class for building environmental engineering background.",
    "I would recommend this. It was a good class, with an appropriate amount of hw and readings. Exams and final paper were very fair.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend it cause this course covers a lot basics for environmental engineering study.",
    "This is a great environmental engineering class that I would highly recommend to another student. It covers a lot of relevant, interesting material. It is worth taking if you are an environmental engineer or if you are just interested in the topic.",
    "This course is great for a broad overview of environmental physicochemical processes. Some concepts are tricky at first, but the notes and lectures are very clear and detailed. I would recommend this course to someone with a basic background in engineering or who is interested in issues such as water treatment.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who needed to learn the nuts and bolts of water treatment principles. This course would go well with one covering transport processes.",
    "see above for summaryYes, especially those in the environmental engineering field.",
    "Would recommend without hesitation; excellent professor and very useful material"
