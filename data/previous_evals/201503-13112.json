    "I would recommend this course to others because it makes you more aware of the challenges we will all face as teachers of the Russian language. The course forces you to think about your own pedagogical strategies, as well as your teaching philosophy.",
    "The course is a review of pedagogical techniques as they apply to the Russian language, including an in-depth review of challenging grammar topics (a very, very useful aspect of the course).",
    "RUSS 834 is a good introductory course for those who have not taught Russian language in the past. It provides students with a general overview of the materials that are used in the discipline as well as the types of issues that frequently come up for second language learners."

    "This course definitely helped me prepare for my profession, as it forced me to think through Russian grammar in a different way. It also encouraged me to think through how I will want to present material to my own students in the future."
