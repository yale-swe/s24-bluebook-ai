    "Take this class, but be prepared to WORK. Its a LOT of reading and sometimes the reading is extremely extremely hard to get into. If this class had only met once a week then maybe I wouldn't have felt the work load so heavily, but twice a week, twice the reading. Damn sometimes I would be up at 4 am reading about the culture of Weimar and pulling my hair out. This has intellectually been one of the best classes I have taken at yale though so take it.",
    "Interesting subject matter. Very broad cultural history of the period. WAY too much reading, though, and discussions were sometimes dull. I don't think that's the fault of the subject matter though."
