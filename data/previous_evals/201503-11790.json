   "comments": [
    "ECON 465 is a very cool class, one with a heavy workload requirement. There is about 500 pages of reading per week, and it is important to do the readings in order to get enough out of the class. Professor Zedillo is awesome and a great instructor. I would definitely recommend it unless the T.A. is an unfair grader (like the one we had). The T.A. does all of the grading and Professor Zedillo does not really look at our midterms or weekly reading responses.",
    "The class has great potential and isn't too much work, but is bogged down by student presentations. Listening to Zedillo is fascinating, but there's way too much summary of readings rather than organic discussion. Take it to hear Zedillo and do pertinent readings, but you'll probably be disappointed by class discussion if the structure of the class remains focused on presentations.",
    "The topics covered were extremely timely and relevant.",
    "Absolutely yes! Great course - lots of work, but no bullshit! Very rewarding, you will thank yourself for taking it!",
    "This is a great course for looking at a variety of different topics that fall under globalization, although students should carefully review the syllabus to see how globalization is covered in this class. It is such a huge subject that no class could adequately cover all aspects so be sure that the way this course defines it (primarily as the trade in good and services across borders) is what you're actually interested in. There is not as much discussion as one would expect out of a seminar, class consists mostly of student presentations of the readings which can get a little boring at times and then limited debate with the professor although most students won't say anything during the 1:50. Weekly reading responses are pretty manageable to the readings on weeks when you're not presenting. Overall worthwhile class to take for the sake of Professor Zedillos insight.",
    "Econ 465 was a phenomenal course, that covered many of the major issues pertaining to globalization in both the past and the present. The topics covered in the course, as well as the assigned readings challenged me to think more critically and become more aware of issues pertaining to international relations and globalization. After taking this course, I have been able to understand current events much better, such as those related to climate change, developing and developed nations, and the challenges to global governance. It was also a wonderful opportunity to hear Professor Zedillo's personal experiences with some of the major international conferences that were mentioned in class. I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "YES! It's kind of a surreal only at Yale class. The student presentations are a little boring since they just summarize the reading, but Zedillo's nuggets of wisdom are awesome! In addition, you get to learn about major globalization issues like the Eurozone, immigration, inequality...etc. Really awesome senior seminar! People may warn you not to take it because of the reading, but you can definitely skim to get the main meanings for your reading responses.",
    "Teaches you a different side of globalization. Unique opportunity to learn from a former president. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Very solid econ senior seminar. The workload is pretty manageable, although the reading responses do take some time because there is so much reading each week and you have to be able to synthesize it into a two page response each week. I'd definitely recommend this class, though, because it's amazing to learn from Professor Zedillo and the other students in this class.",
    "Exactly the types of kids you would expect, minus the amount of learning you would hope for. Take it if you want a good conversation starter for cocktail parties."
