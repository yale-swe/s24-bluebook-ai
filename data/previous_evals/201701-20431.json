   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "The class fosters two skills -- a much improved command of the Latin language and an incredible amount of patience. The compositions force a student to think outside the box and solve problems not encountered in translating from Latin to English. The prose passages solidify Latin reading knowledge and offer an introduction to a more thorough analysis of Latin style and purpose. (I also learned quite a bit about Indo-European linguistics).",
    "We learned to read Latin so much better than we did before. The point of the class isn't really to be able to compose, since that's a skill that rarely gets used. Instead, we learned to approach Latin like a natural language with its own diversity of style and idiom, rather than a dead and frigid language as it's often taught in earlier years.",
    "This class undoubtedly helped me to understand the nuances of the Latin language that one kind of skips over in learning elementary Latin.",
    "This course is very challenging and very valuable. Plan to spend 3 to 4 hours each week on translating English prose passages into Latin, and 1-2 hours each week preparing an assigned Latin text written by any of the most notable Latin prose authors, including Livy, Cicero, Seneca, and others. You will succeed in the class if you are careful and meticulous with the mechanics of your translating (English to Latin) and you have a moderate to strong grasp on how English and Latin writers communicate ideas through diction and style."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Course has a solid rhythm, which allows the ability to work ahead if desired. Seminar-style makes it easy to gain feedback and interact with other students. Instructor clearly cares about the subject and is willing to help in any way he can. Weaknesses: Understandably time-consuming.",
    "Clearly a course perfected over the years. No real weaknesses, could be improved possibly with a TF and a mandatory section, but this wasn't really necessary for the class as it stands.",
    "This course requires a great amount of difficult work--it was often hard to give each composition the full amount of preparation it deserved, simply because combing over pages of Latin with the Oxford Latin Dictionary is extremely time-consuming and tedious. I can't really suggest improvements to that, however, because it was worth it.",
    "The weekly translation assignments are thoroughly challenging and sharpen the translator's attention to detail, mostly mechanical but also stylistic. I wish we could have spent more time addressing the elements of style and prose structure characteristic of each of the different authors we discussed."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, although the student should understand the expectations going in. Each weekly composition requires substantial work, and the smaller reading assignments are not to be merely glossed over. The course will, however, greatly improve Latin comprehension and introduce some authors with which the student might not be familiar.",
    "Take this class, but be prepared to work! This class is challenging but rewarding, and Solodow is tough but fair. Very engaging and stimulating, it is a smaller class that will improve your Latin beyond belief, and one you will never question whether you ought to have taken.",
    "I would. It is a requirement for the Classics major, and I can see why: we left that class knowing far more about the language we study than we arrived with.",
    "I would say if you have a strong inclination to understand Latin grammar and have the time in your semester to really dedicate to the close reading and studying that this class requires, I would recommend taking the course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are intent on majoring in Classics, or some other discipline in the humanities, especially involving writing and language. You must be prepared to take great care and spend a lot of time on your weekly assignments, both the English passages and the Latin texts."
