    "Learned a lot about famous Spanish poets and books. Also learned a lot of new grammar tenses.",
    "I learned a lot about the more technical side (grammar, phrases, etc) of the Spanish language as well as significantly enhancing my vocabulary.",
    "By taking this class, I was able to expand on the grammatical rudiments that I began to learn last semester.",
    "I learned a lot about not only spanish language and grammar, but also about the spanish culture.",
    "More grammar, got better at speaking and listening, learned more vocab.",
    "This course develops an intermediate level of knowledge of the Spanish language, and in particular focused on basic grammatical structures and the past, present, future, and perfect tense with emphasis on the subjunctive as well. The course was also framed so that students gained an understanding of Spanish culture and literature as well as economic, political, and environmental insights of five South American countries. I also enjoyed how the course emphasized real-world use of Spanish through skits and realistic scenario conversation.",
    "I learned Spanish."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - meets every day, you get much better weakness - lots of people in class, not as much individual talking.",
    "The biggest strength was the instructor- she was always more than willing to help when necessary and available to talk. A weakness is the amount of reading we did that wasn't covered very thoroughly in class. It wasn't necessarily a waste of time, because reading the language is always helpful, but they could have been analyzed and applied more.",
    "I felt like this course was too fast-paced. Though I learned a lot of information in a short amount of time, I think my retention abilities can't possibly process and retain all the things I learned this semester, which is actually counterproductive.",
    "The strengths are class participation. Since we meet every day, we are able to speak in class and practice every day, ehich is really helpful in learning a language.",
    "The main issue with Spanish 120 is the fact that it meets every day -- the class became more draining than they needed to be, simply because the coursework was so relentless. The course would benefit, I think, by offering students more intensive ways to practice the language (more time spent working on conversation skills, etc.), rather than extra course time.",
    "I think it would be better if we did more speaking\/listening (non-graded) because they allow for a low-stress, valuable means of practicing the language.",
    "Smaller sections!! We were 18!!",
    "Too formulaic and we did too many contrived activities that didn't help.",
    "The department policy of not allowing makeups for in-class assessments without a dean's excuse is extremely restricting and doesn't account for students who may have to miss in-class assessments for circumstantial reasons but cannot get a dean's excuse.",
    "The course is extremely structured and pretty well made. I think a strength is that there is a good balance of speaking, listening, reading, and writing throughout the course. A weakness is that the workload can be overbearing and very stressful, and I am not sure if I completely agree with the number of assessments that students have to go through (two oral exams and an oral presentation, two compositions, two tests, listening exam, Flash Cultura, etc.). I think the course should adopt something my teacher tried this year in which the class has a Facebook page and everyone can post to it for the weekly responses."

   "comments": [
    "Most definitely.",
    "Yes because it is necessary for learning the important grammar of Spanish",
    "It's hard but my Spanish has improved a lot since Spanish 110. I would recommend getting a Spanish tutor outside of class because it's difficult to keep up with the unrelenting course work.",
    "Yes, even though it meets everyday (and early, at that), you learn a lot and I at least made a bunch of friends because it's a small class size and you see each other every day.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is very face paced and the amount of in-class activities and homework make it so that you can constantly improve throughout the semester.",
    "Yes. I t is a great Spanish course to develop your Spanish exponentially for L1."
