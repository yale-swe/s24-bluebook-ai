    "A good amount of work, but not enough to make you feel lost.",
    "This is a class with quite a lot of reading, kanji and grammar. If you love Japanese, I definitely recommend it. If not, the time commitment is probably too much.",
    "If you want to take a straightforward Japanese language class, this is the class to take. The classroom materials aren't that engaging, but it's a pretty good way to keep up your spoken and written Japanese.",
    "I highly recommend this class to those who are motivated to understand not only Japanese but also their culture. This class gives you more than a understanding of Japanese."
