   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in the subject. Far too many people have no real understanding of Native Americans and they are an important part of US and global history.",
    "We discussed the history of Native American peoples across the country (though at times we focused on particular tribes) from the pre-Columbia era up until the present day.",
    "Take it if you're interested in it. Not too much work and good teacher\/TAs.",
    "This is an extremely important subject of history that has traditionally been under-taught at Yale. It is a very reasonable amount of work compared to other History lectures, and has an emphasis on writing and critical thinking instead of two big exams that comprise most of one's final grade. Occasionally it was a little hard to keep track of the direction of the course, but Professor Blackhawk's digressions were always interesting and enriching and the fabulous teaching fellows were helpful in making sure we didn't miss anything. A crucial historical subject and a great Professor.",
    "It's a very interesting course that I would recommend. Its workload is definitely very doable.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting course (not the best lectures), but the professor is great and the material is amazing.",
    "It is a great class for gaining an understanding of the other side of American History and I think everyone should take it.",
    "Take it if you like history. Not a bad class at all.",
    "Interesting class and a good way to get a writing credit. That said, make sure to shop the course to see if you like professor Blackhawk's lecture style.",
    "A decent writing\/humanities credit that doesn't overload you with work and is mildly interesting. It wasn't entirely what I expected to get when I signed up for the class, and focused a bit too much on the nitty gritty details of Indian culture at the expense of actually learning the history in my opinion, but overall I enjoyed it and wouldn't say it's a bad class to take. There are probably better options, but if you are interested in the subject it's not a bad choice.",
    "Recommended if you have not taken a US history outside of high school. Lectures were a little too much a review of AP US history but the readings are definitely interesting.",
    "Great course! Best history class and easy WR.",
    "History 107 01 was an extremely interesting course. I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more of Native American history and how it relates to the rest of the world. I would definitely recommend this to another student, especially if they are also in need of a WR requirement and would like to enjoy captivating lectures at the same time.",
    "History that everyone needs to know, but that you probably didn't learn in school. Must take class. Not too difficult.",
    "Take this class! You will learn things you should know. It is not too challenging but you work hard enough to learn.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class as a rushed but effective introduction to the role Native Americans have played in the course of American history.",
    "Important information to learn, not a very hard class. I'd recommend it, especially if you want an easy writing credit.",
    "Yes take it! The workload is totally manageable, and the assignments are usually pretty interesting and fun to write (like the final essay, an interpretive piece using themes from the course in relation to Sherman Alexie's short stories)."
