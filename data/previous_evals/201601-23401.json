    "The material is important but I felt it was not presented in a way that was easy to learn. I felt like even simple concepts were not introduced in a way that allowed me to incorporate them into my pre-existing knowledge base, and I ended up with an assortment of random facts and ideas that I feel are insufficient to apply these methods in the real world. I think the material needs to be presented systematically, and the homework assignments need to help demonstrate concepts so that they help solidify the material. For example, when learning model building, provide step by step instructions for what to do, and then tell me what to look for. That way, I would be learning how you as the instructor would do it and why, and then I can begin to understand the rest of the material. As a student, I should not be \"shooting in the dark.\" Assuming that I already understand the material and then asking me to derive equations does not help me to learn the material better.",
    "Lab note is great but need some more information about interpretation. Current lab note focuses on line-by-line interpretation on each code but there is no good information about the interpretation they got from the result. I very much enjoyed longitudinal class but thought it would be better if we have neater lecture note. Lecture note had very good information but it was hard to read because of the design. I believe just simple black and white would also be helpful.",
    "too much work",
    "I am sad to say this class is the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Longitudinal\/multilevel data analysis is so important, but I feel like I have walked away with nothing from this class. Lectures were dry and too complicated, the notes were unclear, and the assignments were incredibly difficult. I am frustrated because the course evaluations from last year show that no actions have been taken to change the problems in this course. It could greatly be improved with clearer lecture notes, and a different professor.",
    "Overall quite useful. Good application parts, but I would have been happy if it was even heavier on the application and interpretation of the models. The breadth of topics seems to have grown in recent years, in part due to the noble effort of incorporating topics based on student suggestions. However, I wonder if a refocusing would be in order, perhaps reducing the content on the initial anova discussions.",
    "It's a difficult, time-consuming class, but it's useful.",
    "The course was useful. It was a bit challenging for me but it was interesting.",
    "This was one of the most difficult courses I have ever taken, and one of the most difficult topics to understand. The lectures were very theoretical, while the homework were more applied. The instructor did not do a good job of preparing students for the assignments. Luckily, the lab TA was excellent and addressed all of our questions. This is an extremely important part of data analysis, and it is unfortunate that many students do not feel well prepared to perform longitudinal data analysis.",
    "The TA session and homework have been very helpful to understand what's going on in class and actually put the method into practice. And the midterm is a great chance to review first half materials covered in class. I gained a basic understanding from the review work for the midterm.",
    "Lab materials are really helpful."

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Instructor is clearly intelligent but I think there should be some improvement regarding communication, presentation of the material, and the structure\/format of the homeworks. Lectures were not clear. She repeated phrases without providing additional clarification. I felt like we spent a lot of time on certain concepts but glossed over others that ended up being important later on.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Professor Lin is energetic and passionate. I always enjoyed going to this course.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was very nice, but not a good lecturer. She seemed to have no concept of how lost everyone was with the material, which is the last thing you want from a class with such difficult content. She was also incredibly insensitive to students' workloads, assigning the longest homework for the same week as the midterm, and a final homework due days before the final project. Her notes could have been much clearer, as I found them of no help in studying for the midterm or completing assignments. She jumped right into theory before explaining in simple terms why we were learning what we were learning, and I would suggest she work on giving simple explanations.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin gave really clear lectures and has an amazing ability to come up with example scenarios and experiments that demonstrate some aspect of what is presented on her slides. Unfortunately, because so many of the examples were off the cuff, I've found using information in the slides challenging, even having taken notes. I wonder if it might be possible to incorporate more of the examples into the lecture slides.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She was patient in explaining difficult topics.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is very nice and tries to teach us a lot. Her slides has a lot equations and can be a little confusing sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instruction of this course could be improved. The instructor mainly taught theory, and the lectures were disorganized. The homework was mainly applied, and very SAS heavy. There should be consistency between the lectures and the homework. You can tell that she is very knowledgable in the subject area, but is not very good at presenting the information to students."

   "comments": [
    "Not worth taking; the extensive time that you spend doing irrelevant work greatly outweighs the amount of information you actually learn. This summer I am taking methodology workshops to better learn the material, and that is what I would recommend to any other student. I would HIGHLY discourage anyone from taking this class.",
    "Great lab session. Very passionate professor. Good grader. Interesting topic. But due to lack of communication and poorly formatted lecture note, it was very frustrating and didn't made students to get interested into this topic. I think if could have been a great course with the guidance of instructor.",
    "intense",
    "I would never recommend this class to a student who does not need to take it as a requirement. I wanted to learn how to analyze longitudinal and multilevel data, but instead I spent the semester stressing over material I never got a good grasp on.",
    "A practical and helpful course.",
    "Provides a solid background and codebase for longitudinal analyses. Workload is pretty high but for the most part the questions are useful analyses of interesting datasets. To a large extent the students' knowledge was assumed from the biostatistics masters track; be wary if you're coming from a different background.",
    "Very useful.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless the instructor, course outline, or both changed. It is a requirement for many students, and needs to be drastically improved."
