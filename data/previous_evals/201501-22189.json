    "Harder than L1, more grammar and expressions to learn, but if you put in the effort you truly feel like you can understand everything and be able to speak German quite well -- if you put in the time to memorize and practice things.",
    "Very well taught. Elisa has been a great teacher all year long. It's not too much of work, which disappointed me a bit, but I learned a good amount of German.",
    "a bit harder then GMAN 110, of course, but in generally a nice and low stress language class.",
    "More German more fun.",
    "The course is really good! It feels like you're learning the language quickly, but at the same time, you're not overloaded with work.",
    "TAKE IT WITH ELISA.",
    "GMAN 120 is pretty much like GMAN 110, and if you took 110 you know the basic structure of the course. There are exams every other week, online assignments twice a week, oral presentations every once in a while, and a final project consisting of a video to be presented to the class during the last week of classes. There are classes every day of the week, which implies that the workload is well distributed, but is constant. However, it is pretty manageable, and you will improve your German skills very fast."
