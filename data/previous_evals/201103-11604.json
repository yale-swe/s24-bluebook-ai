    "Yes. Of course",
    "Definitely, I highly recommend this class if you want to experience the case method of teaching and actually read the documents that go behind a company's IPO or capital raising process. Yes, it's more work than any class I've taken at Yale, but it's also the most valuable course I've taken.A must take if you're going into finance, or even consulting because you also learn how to qualitatively assess businesses. You delve into regulation and the nitpicky details of contracts that become extremely important in legal proceedings. If you're confident of your ability to time-manage and want a highly rewarding and challenging class, then definitely try to get into this seminar.Above all, the professor is incredible. Read his bio and make your decision.",
    "Yes- only if you are interested in the material. Also, you should take it if you don't need a good grade because that is almost impossible to get.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Every senior in econ major should strive to take this class if they can. Not for the faint-hearted though.Strength is that Professor Schmertzler really cares about students learning how to think critically.If anything.. weakness is that workload is ridiculous big, and you will have no idea what your grade is going to be b\/c you don't really get any feedback from him.Overall, I loved the way he teaches. Never spoon-feeds. All about how much effort you put in.",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in going into business or finance at some point in their life.Professor Schmertlzer has fantastic insight into how businesses operate and is overall is just a great guy. You'd be missing you not to take this class.",
    "Don't take this class. For the amount of time and effort you put into it, you don't get a lot out. Don't bother wasting one of your final classes at Yale on this course.",
    "Take the class if you either have prior financial modeling or investment experience, or have a job offer already so you can put the required time into the class. Otherwise you will be miserable and drop out early.This is by far the most practical, insightful and rewarding seminar that you can take in the economic department -- only if you are willing to put in the time to prepare for the class.You get the rare opportunity to learn from an extremely seasoned professional, and you can probably learn more in a week than you do from doing \"deal facilitating\" formatting and number crunching in a summer at a BB investment bank. (Though you should probably have some financial modeling experience, and perhaps have done an investment banking internship before taking the course -- otherwise be prepared to struggle for a few weeks). Professor Schmertzler really cares about his students, and can offer tremendous guidance. The cases you get are mostly based on real events, so this is as close to the real world as it can get in a liberal art school's econ class.The class is almost too short both in term of session time and number. Just as you think you have a basic understanding of how to think about private equity and business analysis, the course is over. There is no repeat of topics, and almost everyone misses the key \"trick\" to analyzing a case the first time, so there is no second try to reinforce what you learned (if anything, it leads you to the wrong direction when you try to apply the message fromthe prior class to a different category of investment).The class session is also too short: very often the class will be about what are the wrongs thing to do, rather then the correct way of thinking. By the time we went over how everyone messed up, the session is over.Because there is a lot work and preparation involved, be prepared to start working a few days every week. Most importantly, be thick-skinned in class -- you are bound to make mistakes and get grilled on them at some point class."
