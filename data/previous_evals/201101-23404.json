    "Q4: Susan assigns A LOT of reading, and I never was able to keep up with it. But it was nice because it really seemed as though she understood that we would not realistically be able to do all of the reading she assigned.Q7: Not everyone is going to enjoy a class with Susan Clark. Some people love her, and some just don't like her style.",
    "I think it would be a good idea to move the presentations to earlier in the semester. This would build a trusting atmosphere in the room that could benefit later discussions.Some case studies of groups or organizations applying principles from the readings would be nice.",
    "Wonderful class, topic, and professor! Need more of these classes that are interdisciplinary and examine environmental psychology!",
    "#2: The professor provided a nice overview of the material, but it was almost simplistic. I would like a more substantial presentation of the readings.#10: This course is unique. Although it's not related to the technical program for the master of forestry degree, it is an interesting class and pertains to understanding the person. Understanding this the person will help me in my professional career when I work with the public. The class also provides a platform to express ourselves in a way that we cannot in other courses at FES. This is invaluable."

    "it was hard to understand exactly what some of the takehome messages were from some of the lectures. listening to people talk at the end of the year, it was clear that some material resonated with everyone and some material did not stick with anyone. i think more explicitly talking through some of these other issues, if they are important to understand, would be worthwhile.",
    "The amount of reading required from the class was too much. Most of the students in the class seemed not to have time to read most of the papers.",

    "It would be nice to delve more deeply into the course topics.",
    "Some of the class readings posted online got cut off when they were being scanned and were un-readable when we printed them off. A few guest speakers may have been fun (but it certainly was fine this semester without them).",

    "I am interested in environmental education, and this class fit very nicely because it taught us about how to talk to other people about values and big, important issues. mostly, it made us learn about ourselves, which i think is important for anyone who is going to put themselves out there for people.",

    "To understand how to engage with people who are in opposition to the environmental agenda",
    "I am looking to pursue a career in environmental\/conservation psychology, so this class is the most relevant class I have taken at FES. Understanding our own behavior\/limitations\/weaknesses helps us improve ourselves as individuals and as professionals. It then helps us to understand the behavior\/thought process of others, and is crucial to any line of work\/job we end up doing. This class is extremely relevant to all of FES students, staff, and faculty. It is imperative that FES offer more social science classes like this to its students. This should without a doubt be a foundations course for FES students."

I feel better prepared to engage with people from vastly different viewpoints and backgrounds after this course.",
