   "comments": [
    "Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "Interesting readings and discussion. Average amount of work for this type of seminar. Beware though, although Prof. Clarke is easy going and the class atmosphere is relaxed, she is NOT an easy grader. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested though.",
    "Interesting introduction to gender sociology.",
    "Yes. It's a good sociology class. Discussions are fun and relevant. The topic is important in Sociology and to your own life. The institution of marriage affects everyone, so it's great to look at it critically.",
    "Yes. Very interesting, but the grading is a bit tough and without reason.",
    "Marriage and Family is great class. You explore the implications of aspects of 'family' for society at large. Prof. Clarke is GREAT. If you are interested in this subject, you will definitely not be disappointed.",
    "You'll learn a lot about things you never considered. The discussions could be quite dramatic, and the reading are interesting, not too hard. The material applies to your life, whether you like it or not. Prof. Clarke is a harder grader than she seems, and sometimes crazy, but that's OK. Take it!",
    "Don't take this class unless you're REALLY interested in the material. The discussions can be interesting but don't really help prepare you for the papers\/exam, so you're really left to do a lot of thinking\/learning on your own. I also think it would be helpful for someone to have taken some other SOCIOLOGY classes (not just social science classes) before taking this class, because that could help fill in the information gap between what you need to do to perform well on papers\/exams and the actual information that Prof. Clarke gives when assigning them."
