    "This course covers a series of assessed performances from the work of Shakespeares cannon: sonnets, monologues, duo-scenes, and 10-minute solo character workshops. There is a focus on verse speech and meter, and different theories of acting and reading Shakespeare for performance.",
    "This class is intense and will expand your knowledge of Shakespearean acting and text.",
    "I learned SO much about acting, and about myself onstage.",
    "This class is great for gaining individualized acting instruction. I will use the skills and acting tools I learned in this class, not just for Shakespearean acting, but in all of my acting going forward. It is an excellent course.",
    "I learned INVALUABLE lessons about how to perform, just just as a Shakespearean actor but as an actor of all texts and as a person as well. I could feel myself improving not just week by week, but literally moment by moment. It was an invaluable learning experience as someone who hopes to pursue an MFA in performance in the coming years.",
    "I developed a wider array of tools to help me engage with Shakespeare's text as an actor, including detailed scansion work, thorough paraphrasing and active, brave choices during every rehearsal. I gained insight into the traps I set for myself and the habits I fall into during performance, as well as the areas in which I must work to improve. I also learned to be an effective critic of my own and others' work and to approach every rehearsal, especially Shakespeare, prepared and focused to maximize the work that happens in that time. I learned to express an opinion in every moment of a performance and to delve deeply into a character's preoccupations and the things that make up their world to find their journey."

   "comments": [
    "The format is probably pretty much ideal it follows the structure of a lot of the work covered in the YSD Acting program, which is a huge asset and a great opportunity to anyone studying theatre as an undergrad. The one thing that is lacking is transparent and consistent grading and feedback throughout the semester. We received one midterm grade several weeks into the class, yet it was just a number with no indication of the scale it was represented on, or how this might translate into letter grades at the end of the class. There is no way of knowing how much each week's performance is affecting your standing, and this was certainly a stressful part of the experience.",
    "I only wish this class met more often so we had more opportunities to workshop our performances.",
    "I felt like there wasn't enough time to rehearse and get feedback. If there were a way to have more class time, that would be amazing.",
    "Overall, I love the way the course is designed--especially that we do a certain assignment for two weeks in a row so that we can improve and get feedback. One thing, though, would be that I wish we had done another scene. I thought the scene-work was particularly helpful to students. Also, the final project was an incredible project and a lot of fun to do--but I think making it shorter would be helpful. What I liked about the course was that sometimes we got to go line-by-line and get really in-depth feedback and instruction, and with a 10-minute project, giving that level of acting help just isn't possible.",
    "This is an incredibly strong class overall. However, because it attempts to cover an incredible amount of material (the same as many classes in the Drama School) I wish we had spent more time on monologues and scene work and half the time on our character workshop. Because the character workshop (which is the class's final project) is such a difficult project we spent almost half the semester working on it which only left time for one monologue and scene apiece. One more scene at least would have been helpful to really have the toolkit for the character workshop and make the most of our time in creating and rehearsing them.",
    "The expectation in this class is that you will always come in thoroughly prepared, ready to work hard and find new moments and delve deeper into the piece. James sets a tone for the class and creates a culture of hard, detail-oriented work that definitely pays off, and this culture is a great strength of the class. Having scenes and monologues chosen for us was also wonderful, and it gave us the chance to get to dive into a character we may have never seen before and approach their analysis from square one. The first several weeks of the course also progress in a helpful way that I think maximizes our progress as actors--moving from sonnets into monologues into scenes. Looking back, I think the course (and the actors) could have benefitted from one more scene assignment before moving on to work on the final project. In such a limited number of classes, I felt as though the number of weeks devoted to the final project impaired the momentum that the class already had. It's hard to adapt a drama school class to an undergraduate schedule, as James mentioned in our first class, and while I do not wish to claim omniscience, for my own progress, I think it would have been helpful to work with another scene partner. I am sure this could be accomplished in multiple ways, but if we had workshopped our first draft of text for the project independently with James and the TF, and we had gone straight to the final performance the class after working on the second half of the piece, we would have had two more weeks to work a scene."

    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in pursuing acting and have the chance. James Bundy is an excellent teacher and obviously hugely useful person to have had the opportunity to work with. You absolutely get a great deal out of this class, in terms of handling meter and verse language texts, as well as expanding your knowledge of the Shakespearean canon. I would in all circumstances recommend taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail, though. Professor Bundy claims to not really believe in grading, and yet still decided to do so, and quite harshly, with very little indication of what precisely these grades and assessments are based on, or when they are taking place. Though this class isn't overwhelming in terms of workload, I would deeply recommend only taking it as one of four classes. Bundy is not the kind of professor you want to risk disappointing as a prospective actor, and his challenges are the kind that are fun and rewarding only if you are willing to dedicate a lot of the time to thoroughly rehearsing independently so bear that in mind for when you elect to audition!",
    "Want to really challenge yourself to improve as a performer? Take this class.",
    "YES!!! Absolutely take it if you get in. Bundy is one of the best teachers I've ever had. But don't expect an easy class, or easy grading. You have to work HARD, but it's worth it.",
    "Absolutely! This class is excellent for actors who are looking for one-on-one, formal instruction by someone who really knows what they're doing. Every person in the class showed marked improvement and it was incredible to watch. James Bundy is an excellent teacher and really knows how to get everyone to do their best work.",
    "Do it. Learning from and with James Bundy is a rare joy and one of our great privileges and Yale students and performers. The skills I learned in this class will absolutely serve me for the rest of my life and it was a humbling, beautiful and deeply moving process to acquire them.",
    "If you are interested, definitely audition for this class. James is fantastic, and even from the audition alone, I learned so much as an actor. And take it for sure if you are ready to put in the work. He expects you to come thoroughly prepared, ready to work, to every class, and you will get way more out of it (and have much more fun with the material) if you do. It's definitely time consuming, but it is a lot of fun, and it is a great opportunity to work with an amazing artist and professor. No matter what your experience level with Shakespeare, you will grow as an actor, you will learn a lot, and you will gain a new appreciation for the text.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Do the work. You will grow as an actor and a human being."
