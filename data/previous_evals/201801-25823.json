    "I think this course is structured well - the professors are very kind and helpful, it meets every day, and we have a daily quiz that forces us to learn the characters. Sometimes because the course is every day, the workload is quite demanding, but the professors are pretty understanding of that. Students often get tired in class, so perhaps if there were more fun activities that would be nice. We did watch some movies outside of class and take a field trip, but perhaps watching a fun movie at the end of the year, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or some movie like that, would be fun!",
    "It was pretty fast-paced, and we covered a lot of new material each week. Sometimes it felt like the amount of characters we were learning was overwhelming, so it was easy to forget what we learned during the previous week.",
    "Instructor Liu and Instructor Chan are very effective teachers. They combine discussion and written work nicely."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I've learned a lot, and though it was hard, it was overall a very good experience, and I feel like I've been able to connect more with my Chinese heritage at Yale through this course.",
    "Yes, if you have the time. This class is very time intensive.",
    "Yes, this course is very effective in improving students' Chinese skills.",
    "Yes. Good way to start a strong foundation in reading\/writing in Chinese.",
    "I would recommend if the student is very serious about learning Chinese."
