    "In 382, you do 3 longer experiments, so there is time for in-depth exploration of the experiment. I learned a lot more and had a much better experience than in the intro labs. The choices for experiments are all very cool topics in currently-useful physics. Also, the 1 formal write-up and 1 presentation are good practice.Prof. Lamoreaux is great for this course. He is very helpful and organizes it well.",
    "Take it if you are a physics major, you'll like it and it's required; don't take it if you aren't a physics major, you'll hate it.",
    "Definitely worthwhile. I highly recommend this course to any prospective Physics majors.",
    "If you are Physics major, I highly recommend it!",
    "Definitely recommend it, especially if you are interested in experimental physics. Professor Lamoreaux is great and the labs are awesome",
    "Nearly everyone who takes this course is an Intensive Physics major, which is just too bad. This course would be a great one for anyone seriously interested in physics, not just people who want to go to grad school. For the first time (except in summer research) you'll do experiments using techniques that are also used in real contemporary research; and you'll get in-depth experience with a variety of experiment types and techniques. Even if you don't use that experience later, it's an exciting thing to do."
