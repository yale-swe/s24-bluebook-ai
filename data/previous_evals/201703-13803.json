   "comments": [
    "I learned how to effectively communicate in writing. In particular, the course teaches you how to be efficient and engaging.",
    "I learned how to write a better personal essay.",
    "To put it simply, I learned how to write succinctly and honestly about myself.",
    "I got a sense of what it means, and what it takes, to write a good essay. Not only did my writing improve, but I also have a stronger sense of how to work on my writing in the future.",
    "This course gave me a new appreciation for reading and writing modern, creative and non-fictional essays. I learned to write more effective introductions and to measure the impact and importance of my words, and especially to organize my thoughts efficiently to maximize the effectiveness of my public point. It especially made me better at editing and revising my essays. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to writing, and I learned to let go of the sentences and words I usually get attached to.",
    "How to closely read a text and find the author's intent and the techniques they used to create meaning in their writing. We also learned how to apply these techniques in our own writing.",
    "Close-reading and writing non-fiction",
    "I learned how to write an engaging essay in order to communicate my ideas (with techniques such as building concentric circles, designing tensions and surprises, including details, writing shitty first drafts, and more)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The grading, in my opinion, is a bit too harsh.",
    "STRENGTHS: structure of the class forced us to learn how to write efficiently, a perfect blend of reading and writing, gave us a clear avenue for growth WEAKNESSES: At times, the class could be fairly repetitive. There were often discussions that felt redundant. Sometimes, I felt like I learned more from my own writing and my teacher's personal guidance than the in-class discussions.",
    "The biggest strength was the syllabus. We had the opportunity to read so many amazing essays which I feel have made a big impact on me as a reader and writer. The class time is primarily focused on close-reading, whereas I would have liked to spend a little bit more time actually speaking about writing.",
    "I loved this course because Professor Stuart allowed us to engage with the material in an effective manner. We would pick one of the essays we had to read that we liked and analyze the literary tehhniques that were effective in the piece. We would each discuss our opinions on the pieces we commented on in a particular order: Professor Stuart would carefully guide the discussion so that similar themes were discussed simultaneously in a piece or between the works. The revision process was also great, and I loved that Professor Stuart gave us 'coupons' or 24h extensions we could earn by visiting authors on campus. We would write a first draft of an essay for the first week and revise it for the next. I would have loved on some occasions to write a third draft of my essays: I still felt as if there were things to improve in the second version.",
    "Strengths: Reasonable workload, clear feedback from the professor (regarding our essays), Professor Stuart posted the assigned readings\/syllabus at the beginning of the semester so we could plan ahead. Weaknesses: The readings were assigned unevenly so some days had a lot of assigned readings while others were relatively light.",
    "Strength: insightful critical feedback from the instructor and peers; masterful reading; life-saving coupons; cookies at the end. Weakness: since writing is painful for me, there are too much writing in this class; sometimes the reading can be long and tedious (the good news is we get to pick them)"

   "comments": [
    "THis course will absolutely make you a better writer if you take feedback and put in the work. Know that the grading is very harsh.",
    "This is an amazing class that really helps to improve your writing across multiple subjects.",
    "YES!!! This class is fundamental to becoming a good writer. The high expectations of the class force you to learn how to write efficiently and honestly about yourself. 10\/10 recommend.",
    "Yes. If you are looking for an intro-level course that will greatly improve your writing, definitely take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to people who love reading any type of essays: news pieces, memoirs, nonfiction or creative compositions. It really made me appreciate reading well-crafted and thought provoking essays, and there are many more than I had anticipated.",
    "Yes, especially if this is your first English class at Yale. You will be exposed to so many essays and writing styles and you will find essays that really resonate with you and inform your own essays. The course is structured in a way where you continuously work towards one goal throughout the semester, so you will feel like you are actually learning a new skill.",
    "If you like New Yorker style essays, rants, humor pieces more than literary analysis on the symbolism of Macbeth's dagger, then this course is for you."
