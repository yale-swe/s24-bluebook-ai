   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - it was a pleasure to take, and I learned so much! I am not an art major, either, and really appreciated the course.",
    "I would recommend this course highly to anyone, even non-art majors. Although there is no homework, it is a stressful\/ tiring process especially at the beginning of the semester. You need a lot of patience and your skill is sure to develop.",
    "Yes, absolutely! You will get more comfortable drawing the figure and translating space just by the process of doing it for at least two hours twice a week in class. Be willing to get messy and try new materials.",
    "Take it if you want a venue to practice drawing, not if you want your hand held.",
    "you will sketch nude models every class - there were a few homework assignments of hands and feet which really helped learn proportions - you will work with lines, value, and different materials and by the end of the course combine everything you learned in your drawings",
    "I 100% recommend this course. It helped me improve immensely and gave me a new perspective when drawing the figure and really anything else out there.",
    "Yes. A really laid back environment to learn figure drawing. It was very much a hands on class, all work is done during the figure drawing sessions. Because you're drawing all the time you really see yourself improve over the course of the semester. There's not a lot of instruction, just trial and error.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Art 224 to another student. It improved the way I draw and perceive the figure in so many ways. Every class, we had a model, and our assignments would change slightly (sometimes we'd use charcoal, sometimes we'd do a deletion drawing, sometimes we'd use ink, sometimes the pose would be 30 min, sometimes 1 hour, etc.) just enough variation to avoid boredom and enough consistency to see steady improvements throughout the semester. I think I would have liked if there had been more critiques because one thing that did bother me about the course was that I had no idea how I was doing in it until late in the semester and I really would have liked to gain perspective by really sitting down and looking at other people's work as well.",
    "Figure drawing was really relaxing and fun; however, I don't know how much I learned. There are only 2 critiques; otherwise you're pretty much on your own to figure out how to improve. Nonetheless, much of the class really got a lot better by the end and it was fun to try out different materials.",
    "two hours twice a week of exploring how to draw a range of nudes with very different body types using different materials and different approaches. no homework, either, which makes it a fun and manageable fifth class--easily my favorite class this term",
    "This class is suitable for those who have little experience with the figure but also for those who know the figure and want to focus more on it. I came in comfortable with my skills, but William Villalongo consistently pushed me to go further in my drawings. In-class time was used well. There was not much outside work--though we all (students and teacher and t.a.) agreed that our practice assignments could have continued for longer. It is invaluable to have four hours a week devoted to drawing a live model--definitely take this if you are even considering it. The buildup to mixed media drawing is an excellent process to go through.",
    "Figure drawing every day. Starts out with charcoal and ends with all types of wet media. Not too much instruction, but improvement comes with repetition and practice. No homework.",
    "I would summarize the course as a valuable drawing course. It's incredible that we get to have a model every class. I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "This figure drawing class was not very intense, which I think was probably due to the instructor and his more laid back vibe. There was hardly any homework. The only thing I disliked was the kindof static direction of the course, in that we worked in charcoal for almost the entirety of the course until the very end, and then had no idea how to use new materials.",
    "Highly recommend this class"
