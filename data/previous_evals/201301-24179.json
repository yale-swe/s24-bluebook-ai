    "I didn't know what to expect from this class. I don't think I fully understood what it was about until the very end when we interviewed politicians. However, a lot came together for me then. I learned a ton about things that you never really think about in college, which was very cool. Dean and Berg are awesome guides in the process.",
    "Amazing class, chance of a lifetime, absolutely the best class of this semester, I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who has the chance to take it.",
    "Absolutely. Best class of the semester.",
    "This class is amazing. Dean and Berg make such a nice team, and the class forces you to think - about yourself and others - in a way that no other class at Yale has made me do. It's a super easy work load, and really interesting class sessions. The people in the class are a key though - if they rock, the class will be the best you've ever taken, if they're ok, then the class is still great, but it could be better.Overall, TAKE THIS CLASS. Berg is the smartest, Dean is the coolest, and both are so unbelievably nice.",
    "This is one of the most unique and rewarding courses I have taken at Yale. You really learn to reflect on the motivations and feelings behind your actions and how you interact with groups, and the guidance of an organizational psychologist and famous politician provides excellent fodder for this. Consider taking Cr\/D, though since the grading is based on 2 papers, which are a very minimal part of the course experience.",
    "This class is one unlike any other. There is no way to really summarize it for you. Just take it and you'll find out.",
    "Not what you expect. But easy and not much work",
    "I am so happy I took this course. The way I think about the world and talk about myself has changed, permanently. This is not a course that will WOW you at every turn, but the slow build-up and investment will mark you, for sure. Honestly, I think it is the type of experience Yale should require of each student, as it is less about acquiring some type of knowledge than it is about learning about yourself, and that is important no matter what you study. That said, so much of the course depends on the incredible devotion and partnership of both David Berg and Howard Dean (whose friendship is the best thing EVER), so this is a uniquely awesome opportunity.",
    "BEST CLASS AT YALE. LIFE-CHANGING. DAVID AND HOWARD ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST.",
    "This course will really help you if you want to spend some time thinking about yourself and the way you work with other people. This type of thinking can be really helpful for interviews, personal statements and other situations in which you are asked to articulate your strengths and weaknesses. You'll end up feeling very close to your classmates and Professors. I didn't learn very much about politics on a large scale, but the professors make it explicit at the first class that that is not the point of this course.",
    "such a unique experience among all of my Yale classes. Howard and David (and they ask you to call them that, you'll get used to it eventually) are awesome, and class is mostly just getting to talk about interesting, relevant topics that you wouldn't normally get to discuss with them and your classmates. Definitely take the class if you get in for an amazing experience"
