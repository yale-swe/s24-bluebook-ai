   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as conservation biology where you talk about saving the world's nature through the lens of ecology and biology. I would recommend this class to other people.",
    "Basically, it was a simple introduction to a pretty relevant issue presented in a way that non-science majors could understand. The lectures could be interesting at times (or they could be pretty boring). Readings are totally irrelevant; if I were taking the class again, I wouldn't even waste money on the textbook since I didn't open once all semester. This isn't a difficult course, even though Jetz tried to make it into one during the second half of the class. If you need an easy Sc credit, this class is for you. The lectures were posted online which can kill your motivation to actually go to class. And since the tests just basically require you to remember examples for certain principles, going to lecture is kind of pointless anyway.",
    "Yes, definitely. Very easy...only a midterm and a final.",
    "This is a great science course for non-majors. Highly relevant and not too difficult.",
    "good science credit",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course, especially for non-science majors. The material was easy to grasp, very interesting and well-taught. There was not too much work; 2 exams and some section assignments but very manageable.",
    "I would recommend it-- it's interesting and not that hard, especially if you need a science credit.",
    "The class itself looks a lot at climate change and the current state of our global environment. It also discusses the multiple ways of approaching our current environmental problems, so you leave the class feeling like you are on top of the debate on climate control and nature protection. I would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "Basic introduction course. Lectures aren't too thrilling but the professors try to make it applicable to non-science majors. Besides lectures and section there is no work, but the exams are pretty difficult, more so than you would think.",
    "Excellent class, workload is light, and the exams are easy. Especially for non-science majors, this class is good.",
    "Lecture notes are all online, so you don't really have to go to class. There are only two exams, but they're each worth 40% of your semester grade, so there are pros and cons to that. The TFs are super helpful.",
    "Yes if you need it as a science credit, take it, or if you really want to learn why our ecosystem is in danger. You do learn stuff and it's not that hard.",
    "I would recommend it because it's interesting if you want to know about conservation efforts around the globe and a relatively light workload. Watch out for the tests though. They seem easy, but graded extremely difficultly so be careful that you say all the key words that they want to see.",
    "Good science credit to take overall--but you do have to study for the tests, but you don't have to do the readings--tests based only on lecture--two tests are ok, just you have to know specific examples for most questions",
    "Good course, nice way to get a Science Credit.",
    "A sleepy course without actual substance. Thesis: conservation is a fuzzy and near-impossible science.",
    "This course is a wonderful science credit for non science majors.",
    "a good class for a science credit not requiring too many difficult concepts",
    "Yeah for sure. I really liked this class, it was interesting and you learn a lot. The professors are cool and section isn't too bad.",
    "Conservation bio really is a good class to get you exposed to all the complexities of conservation science and applied conservation. If you are at all interested in conservation, take this class! It got me thinking about issues that I was completely unaware of, despite being interested in conservation and wildlife to begin with. The class was rather easy though, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it had it been more demanding.",
    "The class goes over topics related to conservation. Lectures are interesting and section is easy. The tests were fine too and besides that we only had to make two section presentations, one alone and one as a group.",
    "i would recommend this class to ppl looking to get rid of the science credit.",
    "Pretty easy, jetz is good. Not super profound.",
    "I would recommend this course for any non-science major looking for a relatively painless way to fulfill the science credit. This was not the most interesting class that I have ever taken but the concepts were very straightforward and not terribly difficult to understand. One problem with this course is that a lot of the people it attracts are very unmotivated, which can make discussion sections feel painfully long. There were two exams, one short report on a science lecture on campus, and a reserve project. This was the first year that they had done the reserve project, so it was a bit rushed at the end, but hopefully they will improve the scheduling of this. The second lecturer, Walter Jetz, was better than the first lecturer and he included a lot of multimedia in his presentations.",
    "I would recommend this course but do not expect to be overwhelmed by it. Good course for basics.",
    "Good course for someone with no knowledge of the subject",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Such a great SC credit!",
    "Yes. I would recommend this class to anyone looking to fufill their science requirement",
    "delievers good basic knowledge on evolutionary and ecological theories along with a lot of empirical examples. if u are interested: take it!",
    "This is a wonderful gut science course for people who don't want to take a class that will bore them senseless. The information is interesting and the work load is small. Only two midterms and no final exam. The second half is better with Jetz though.",
    "The exams are much more difficult than you would expect; beware, especially, that the class doesn't give out +\/- grades.",
    "I took this class for a relatively easy Sc credit, because I am interested in environmental issues, but I ended very disappointed. The first half was okay, relatively easy and pretty interesting, even for me, a humanities major who is not interested in science at all, but the second half was terrible. The professor for the second half was not good, and gave confusing lectures. Section was also not helpful. I ended up with a not-great grade in the class as a result of my grade on the final, which I didn't feel prepared for, despite how much I studied for it. There are no pluses or minuses, which is frustrating - if you're getting an A-, it bumps you to an A, but more likely, you will end up with a B - or even a C - screwing up your GPA. Don't take it unless you're willing to put work into it, because it's not the gut people expect it to be.",
    "This is a decent way to fulfill a science credit without a lot of work. An interesting topic, but never very interesting in class. I can't decide if I am glad that I took it to get science out of the way, or irritated that I didn't take advantage of one of Yale's better offerings.",
    "Great SC credit. The material is a lot more interesting than what I expected. You learn about contemporary issues regarding conservation biology. It's important to attend lectures and pay attention. Readings aren't necessary. You can do well on exams if you go over class lectures."
