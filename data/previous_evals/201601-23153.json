    "You don't have a choice about whether or not to take this class if you're in Ed Studies, so here's some advice about how to approach the project: Start early and work hard on it. This is your equivalent of a senior essay, so make it seem like one. Lizzy is an excellent resource, take advantage of it. There are very few faculty members at Yale who are willing to dedicate themselves to their students in the way she does.",
    "Amazing freedom to choose topic that interests you for this project. Lizzy Carroll is a great mentor. Not easy to balance with other work you have senior year, but overall a good experience!",
    "So worthwhile! Lizzy gives you so much support throughout your project -- it is such a joy to work with her & the rest of the cohort!",
    "It will be early, but it will be worth it. Sometimes, you'll feel like your hand is being held, but then you'll realize how desperately you need that (especially in your other major). You will love your small collaboration group; go to it. Don't start your work at the last minute. Remember that Lizzy is always there to help. Enjoy the presentation day; it's really fun!",
    "EDST 400 gives senior Education Studies Scholars an opportunity to independently explore an aspect of education that has sparked their interest during their previous years in the program. The independence that students have in selecting a topic means that each student has the chance to produce something that they care about personally and are proud of in the endbut I would also advise selecting a topic that you won't get bored with: you'll be spending many hours on the project, so choose something that you're willing to see through to the end! If you do, the fruits of your labor will be bountiful. Also look forward to the opportunity to get to know the work and interests of your fellow cohort members, as you will be spending much time collaborating in small groups throughout the semester.",
    "The capstone project is a great way to explore an area of special interest. Ed Studies is a great program! It's also really fun to learn from your classmates' projects. Professor Carroll is great!"
