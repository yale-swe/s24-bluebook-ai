    "Highly relevant to urban design, general planning strategies, and issues related to \"industrial ecology;\" however, these parameters caused spatial exploration -- and architecture as a built form -- to be largely ignored in most if not all of the studio projects. It became a theoretical project, which relied heavily on gimmicking and hand-waving to be \"provocative\" enough to solicit a larger discussion. In addition, large fabrication requirements gave this theoretical project a slight identity crisis; it asked for the projects to be largely architectural, when their conception and foundation were mostly abstract and situational.",
    "Gregg and Brian held our projects to the highest professional standards. (I'll also note now that I really appreciated their conscientious effort to consider us as colleagues \/ future colleagues despite the natural hierarchy of the situation) It was a mark of their mutual respect for us that the projects were allowed to remain in concept \/ diagram development as late into the semester as they did. When they said \u0093go,\u0094 however, the studio was expected to step-up to the challenge. Issues of structure, planning, systems and other related disciplines were then dealt with as realistically as possible. In hindsight, because of the fast-track nature of the final weeks (and the giantleaps that the projects go through during this phase) it might have been helpful to include some small workshops with disciplinary consultants.",
    "Gregg and Brian,The studio was incredible; the best I've had. I believe the mission of the semester was a novel and important one, and one which I felt comfortable getting completely behind. I want to express, very simply, my admiration for you both and thank you for an excellent semester."

   "comments": [
    "I found the least valuable aspect of the studio to be the first assignment. I think the studio's energy would have been better invested in research on Brazil and Rio. The exercise ran on too long as well.",
    "Larger group pin-ups and guest-critics were most helpful. However, the framework of the studio never ceased to provoke discussions beyond the studio and the projects themselves. Our ideas were often received, yet critics\/jurors failed in all of the projects to really examine the architecture\/space created; instead, moved on to what they projected onto our projects, and ultimately what the projects 'could be' instead. While helpful, this is not a critique on the architecture we were trying to create, but on the studio as a whole. As a result, architecture was never developed in any of the projects to the level it should have been. This studio resulted in discussion, rather than architecture.",
    "The closed loop exercise was not that valuable. I believe the readings relating to this subject were fascinating and sufficient to understand the concept. More could have been gained from more directed research, either on precedents, industrial ecologies or Brazil\/Rio.The 3\/4 review was a very helpful tool in structuring our work process.Scale was daunting, though the site allowed for true programmatic daring, and allowed for abstract work.",
    "Midterm was strange, because it required a first-draft architectonic as sacrificial lamb. The jury is still out if this \u0093sketch\u0094 provided a model for discussion or a distraction from the main concern, which for me were the thesis, program and site strategies. In the end, no one ignores form \u0096 particularly when it's weak.Readings were very helpful in focusing the discussion.The final jury was a great mix of personalities and opinions.",
    "One of the more valuable aspects of this studio was the amount of time that we were able to spend with Gregg. He was able to come to New Haven at least once every week and sometimes both days. This, in addition to the fact that we worked in pairs, allowed us to have at least an hour each Monday or Thursday to discuss the work that we had done. This amount of time was really important to our projects and to the studio as a whole.Because our brief was fairly abstract and relied on the students to define its parameters, it was important to have a jury that was not only able to think broadly in scope, but also to be able to prioritize their comments. The critics that Gregg brought to our reviews were immensely helpful because they had worked on similar types of studio projects and competitions. More importantly, the juries (not necessarily the final review) were more like working sessions with a panel of interested outside enthusiasts, rather than Q and A sessions.There were relatively few valueless experiences in this studio. Still, I do think that we spent an overabundance of time (basically everything before midterm) making an argument for why we were proposing a particular solution to a problem. While this process was instructive and led to legitimate conclusions of basic formal partis, I think that most of the groups found themselves scrambling towards the end of the semester to put together complete architectural proposals. I think that the schedule would have been more helpful if one or two weeks of the beginning analysis were pushed to the resolution of the project in the end.",
    "The fast-paced discussion and crits set a tone for the studio as a whole, and the trust conveyed by you both led to great projects across the groupings of students."

    "While it was nice that the studio was so open, it was difficult in general to find focus and direction early on in the studio. The studio as a whole was constantly confused and questioningitself, not knowing exactly what the limits or expectations were.",
    "comments above\/below.",
    "The focus on designing a problem and argument were fantastic. I felt I truly learned how to clearly articulate a problem through graphics and narrative. That said, again, I think more could have been achieved architecturally, if this process began earlier (i.e. forego the closed loop exercise).Really, the main let down of the studio was that we got to architecture so late in the semester.",
    "It was a tight schedule due to the scope of the problems tackled. One week less of phase I (diagramming, concept) might have been helpful. Or, if an architectonic really is necessary to the discussions at midterm (see above) then it should be introduced a bit earlier. (At least two iterations).",
    "Our studio sessions were spent effectivey, and I knew where I needed to go."

    "see above.",
    "While I was disappointed architecture was never reached, or granted much attention\/merit throughout the semester, I did expect and acknowledge that this studio would be mostly theoretical and conceptual. Many of the discussions that hindered the architectural evolution of the projects were thought-provoking and relevant to architecture\/urbanism today. It is the type of studio project I expected at the advanced level, requiring a mini-thesis, program\/site selection, and research to further the idea. However, because it tackled so much in so little time -- wanting to be architecture, urban design, and an answer to larger pedagogical questions of industrial ecology -- it somehow lost much of its cohesion, resulting in gimmicky projects that had to sell themselves on their unique or off-beat program juxtapositions; this as a means of architecture falls relatively flat, and somewhat unsatisfactory. It often seemed a fall-back to a lot of situational\/gimmicky\/machine\/space-frame 60s architecture.",

    "Greg and Brian are great studio critics, and even further, an excellent pairing. Greg is straight to the point: what are we doing, how is it pertinent, and how do we sell it. Brian asks the larger pedagogical and philosophical questions. While very different in the way they teach, their styles complement each other perfectly, and are almost always on the same page when it comes to developing the project. Straddling between the two on their respective studio visits was never a hindrance, as it can be with multiple studio critics; instead it gave a different point of view about what the project meant, and how the ideas could be conveyed. Their discussions were always thought provoking and engaging. They were both always enthusiastic, eager, and excited to see where the project would go next. While I was disappointed the studio did not develop architecture to the level I hoped, this is not a reflection of Greg or Brian as critics; instead, the studio's unique discussions and explorations can be seen as a reflection of their excitement and enthusiasm to push the limits of architecture. They largely treated this studio as an experiment, of sorts, and to that I feel is a very successful.",
    "Brian was extremely helpful and committed, often going out of his way to communicate with us and offer criticism and resources. However, at times it seemed as if a larger agenda for the studio was getting in the way of individual critique. The focus on new infrastructures and closed loop ecologies, though important, always felt somewhat ill-defined throughout the studio. Perhaps defining terms more clearly at the beginning might have helped.Gregg was unique in his ability to inspire and motivate.",
    "They were a great team; if anything, these observations are for my own benefit:Throughout the first half of the semester, Gregg and Brian played in contrast. Brian consistently took the position of devil's advocate. His stubborn critique of argumentation was extremely helpful in keeping the discussion \u0093on target\u0094 vis a vis the studio's stated objectives. Brian clearly cared that every project deliver a strong and focused thesis. Gregg, on the other hand, tended to form his criticism in a more positivist light. While Brian's critique might tell us what our project WASN'T doing, Gregg's strength tended to be in rooting out what it WAS or COULD BE (but that we had yet to see). He pushed us to take risks and to make bold, intelligent moves. (Generally, the above relates to desk crits, as their responses were more unified in the context of class pinups). These two positions were complimentary.At some point in the last half of the semester, Gregg and Brian began to speak about the projects in a more unified and pragmatic way. Still critical, this shift seemed formulated to maintain our excitement about the work and to encourage further risk-taking. The timing was excellent. I've never seen an entire studio \u0093make architecture\u0094 as quickly and solidly as did this studio in its final weeks (I think we caught most of the 4th floor by surprise, actually!). They created the essential atmosphere for each of these projects to thrive.Keep teaching (at Yale).",
    "Both Gregg and Brian established a discourse in the studio which led to hugely experimental projects and leaps of faith on the students' part. As the lack of these very characteristics in Yale's program has been my biggest complaint of the school as a whole, Gregg and Brian reaffirmed my decision to attend in the first place. I cannot thank them enough, and I wish every student could have had the experience that we had."
