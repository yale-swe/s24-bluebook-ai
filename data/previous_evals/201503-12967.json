    "Good course.",

    "What a beautiful class",
    "Easiest class I have ever taken at Yale. It was a breeze when Maho Ishiguro taught it last year, but Professor Sumarsam somehow managed to make it 10 times easier. Meets once a week, you learn how to play beginner pieces on an instrument that's basically a xylophone with 7 total keys, and literally zero work outside of class. The only evaluated work was the final exam performance, in which everyone dressed in traditional Indonesian robes and performed the pieces we practiced all semester. A great time all around."
