   "comments": [
    "Try to take this course with Mahler; he made what might have been a boring class interesting.",
    "Requirement for sociology majors. Take it if you need to. Workload isn't too great and quite interesting class on research methods",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I am not a sociology major, but I think I learned the most in this course out of all of my courses this semester. This course really helps you when preparing to write your senior thesis. I loved 90% of the readings we had to do. They were pretty interesting and engaging, and they really made me think about the role we as students and researchers have when producing knowledge. Professor Mahler was very helpful along every step of the way as we had to draft our research proposal. I would say this class is a lot of work though. I enjoyed it because I think the work in the end helps us as we write our senior projects. I'd recommend taking it as a junior.",
    "This course sounds like it will be boring, but if Professor Mahler is still teaching it, it won't be. He's a great professor - good at explaining material, great at responding to student comments and initiating conversation. If you approach the course with an open mind, then you'll definitely learn something!",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who plans to conduct research but has not narrowed down a research topic. It's a very practical class! All the assignments (and comments from the professor) culminate into a viable research proposal.",
    "This class is a helpful resource for senior research preparation. Much of the reading and discussion is dry and might seem irrelevant, but later very useful when adapted and personalized to individualized projects. A bit of a drag, but should be taken by every student.",
    "Methods of Inquiry is an excellent overview of research methods for any social science major. The class focuses particularly on qualitative and ethnographic methods, which I found very useful. You will still need to do some research on the specific of your preferred method, but it is a great way to get exposed to the possibilities of research. The workload is very reasonable, and it builds up so that the final research proposal becomes manageable.",
    "Take this class if you are a junior preparing to do your senior research with qualitative social science methods over a summer or a semester. The assignments essentially make you write up a solid proposal. I think it is best timed at this point in a Yale student's time at Yale. Only qualitative methods, so if student will be using both qualitative and quantitative methods in research, will want to take an additional class."
