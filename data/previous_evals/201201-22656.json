    "This is definitely harder than L1",
    "A good class if you're looking for a little work every day to stay on top of the material.",

    "Much more difficult than SPAN 110--don't be fooled. A ton of people in this class have taken Spanish before so beware if you're new to the language. People might take certain rules for granted that are never explained to you.",
    "I would say it is not very difficult work, but there is work every single day.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 120 for a language credit.",
    "It was a lot of homework that I feel was unfairly and unnecessarily graded hard, but it was your average language class at Yale. Having class everyday can definitely take a toll on you.",
    "Spanish 120 was great. The workload is very manageable and class is enjoyable. By the end of the semester, you will be much better at Spanish than you were before because the teachers are awesome. Oscar was the best. He's really nice and enthusiastic about everything, so class was always fun. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "A continuation of Spanish 110, focusing heavily on vocabulary and verb tenses.",
    "It was a L2 language class, homework every night, not too much though. I learned a lot and Oscar was a funny and nice teacher!"
