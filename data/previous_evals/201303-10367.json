    "Math logic is a great course, which will challenge you in many ways. Having taken 115 was helpful, but not THAT helpful. This class is hard, and I had to put a lot of time in it, but if you do, you'll feel rewarded in the end. The first couple of problem sets are fairly easy, but then they increasingly get harder and harder. I usually worked on problem sets for a whole week, but maybe that was just me! Take advantage of lecture, office hours, and sections - those are great ways of understanding the material better. The final was really long (I don't really know how many hours it took me to complete, but probably around 50+). However, solving those proofs definitely feels good in the end!",
    "Recommend if you're interested in logic--it's a solid logic course, considerably more difficult but also usually considerably better taught than first order, com what I've heard. Helps if you have background in proofs: if not though, it's a great class to start learning to write them.",
    "I would only recommend it to people who are interested in meta-level thinking but who don't mind getting bogged down in the important details. It is 6 problem sets, which is pretty manageable of you stay on top of stuff, and interesting if its the kind of material you're into. Don't take it if you are not super interested in the material, it will not grow on you.",
    "Yes definitely. It is proof based so it might be challenging for people who are new to that sort of way of thinking. But it's really interesting stuff. As a math major, it was really interesting to learn stuff about logic and language and I really enjoyed it.",
    "If you have a strong math\/logic background, I recommend the class. She was pretty chill about not showing up to class so long as you got the work done. She has great handouts with explanations for everything, so as long as you get those, you're good.I thought we proved some pretty cool theorems by the end.",
    "It's a great class if you're interested in the topic.",
    "ONLY take this course if you absolutely love not logic, but logic THEORY. The material covered in this course has useful applications, but only if you take several later courses as well, and it's only useful in some highly technical computing applications from what I can tell. Otherwise, the material is extremely boring, useless, and utterly inapplicable to everyday life.",
    "The goal of intro to mathematical logic is to prove g\u00c3\u00b6del's completeness theorem. I found it fascinating, but if you're not into math and philosophy, this class will be insufferable. The material is hard to understand, and though the end result is very fascinating, you will need to actively engage with it. I would recommend taking it if you think you might be at all interested.",
    "This was a fantastic class. The proofs are challenging, but if you give yourself enough time and are willing to ask your TF for help, they are very manageable. You'll learn a great deal about logic, but the class is also a great one to train you to think mathematically and rigorously about proofs and arguments. Prof. Shin is amazing. She is a great teacher and offers hilarious commentary and life advice along the way.",
    "Great class, I definitely recommend it. Sun-Joo Shin is an excellent and entertaining professor. It covers the underpinnings of logical systems and moves on to proving meta-theorems (ultimately the completeness and consistency of first-order logic). It is very helpful to have a background in proofs, but (contrary to the description) Phil 115 is not necessary, though a basic familiarity with predicate logic is good. The workload is not bad at all (but start the last homework early!).",
    "Great class. Definitely take it. Sun-Joo is a great lecturer. Only 6 Psets, no final."
