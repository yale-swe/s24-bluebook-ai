    "Take this class if you're interested in cultural studies, educational theory, and music as it affects larger questions of culture and society. It was really interesting and very different from other courses in the music department.",
    "Yes! There are few classes where you learn about opera and rock music with equal attention and fewer that discuss music criticism. Take advantage of this scarce resource.",
    "This is a really interesting class, but requires a lot of work. The readings are really long and dense. If you are already a really good writer you will love this course, but if you are not, just be warned that the professor is a tough grader.",
    "Definitely -- good opportunity to learn about music culture and become a better writer.",
    "Take it!I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and consider it one of the most valuable classes I've taken at Yale thus far. I found it both exciting and refreshing to be taught the craft of critical thinking and writing through exposure to a broad range of contrasting--and contradicting--critics of music and art. The course effectively encourages the creation of a personal value system as a consumer and critic, and suggests ways in which that value system can be concisely articulated in writing. Class discussions were both evocative and engaging. I particularly enjoyed the use of outside elements like sound recordings, guest lectures, and a class trip to see a concert in NYC.It's a lot of writing--about five papers in the semester--but I found the topics to be generally interesting and not unbearable.It's just a cool class. Where else do you get to chat about Lady Gaga and and Wagner in the same hour?"
