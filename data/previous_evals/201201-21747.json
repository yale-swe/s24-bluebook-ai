    "Take it as a 5th class, or as a chance to explore. It may not offer a whole lot to serious artists, but it's definitely a different way to think about sculpture, and therefore valuable. Low time commitment too!",
    "YES! YES! YES!There was one art major who took this class. The rest of the class was a mixed group--from engineering and compsci to architecture and global affairs.Sandra is an amazing teacher; super patient, super easy going, and you learn a LOT! You learn about digital media--final cut pro x, shooting film and photos with DSLRs, woodshop, metal work...etc. Easily one of my favorite classes I've taken at yale.",
    "Introductory Art class that teaches the basics of video creation as well as introduces you to a slew of great video artists.",
    "It's really great. You can basically do any type of work that you can imagine from videos to wood or metal sculpture to performance art. Sandra is very open to any idea and is willing to help make those ideas come to life. If you want a broad introduction to sculpture, this is definitely the class to take. I really loved it!"
