    "Much better than nat. sci. class, although amazingly less rigorous.",

    "readings complemented each other very well and gave different perspectives on the weekly topic.",
    "Question 7C: I did wish that the TA had been more engaged in class discussions; she rarely spoke out, and did not provide comments on final student presentations. Her thoughts would have been valuable, as a second year who has gone through this process already.",

    "Openness to discussion by classmates and ta and professor. Time to talk about research and hear about other's research.",
    "Interesting students and a good opportunity to learn what one's colleagues are working on\/interested in. Also, a good opportunity for direction\/feedback on your research from the Prof.",
    "It was an opportunity to develop your research ideas and write a sample proposal for funding.",
    "Developing my research with personal weekly attention from trained social scientist.",
    "The assignments that required us to create \/ administer a survey and to conduct an interview.",
    "Teaching all you need to start your research",
    "The assignments and outputs were practical and useful. It was great to discuss research project ideas with classmates.",
    "1. The practical research exercises2. The peer group review of research topics and proposals",
    "As someone new to social science research, assignments that required us to actually practice the methods were very helpful. While only so much can be covered in one semester, practicing and receiving feedback on first tries at surveying, interviewing, coding, etc. were valuable.",
    "The out of class practical assignments were all incredibly useful and fun. In particular, I enjoyed the interview and coding assignment - both the exercise itself and the class discussion that followed were rich and edifying.",
    "The class allowed me the time to focus on my project and gain valuable feedback from my peers and the instructor. Additionally, the instructor's flexibility really allowed the students to shape the course to their collective needs.",

   "comments": [
    "This course was billed as a qualitative methods course in social sciences, but it turned out to be a course about anthropological qualitative methods. Although the instructor was open to discussing other perspectives, she did not provide any readings or teachings incorporating other perspectives. This is a course that should feature a variety of approaches to qualitative methods and should also feature guest lecturers from across FES and Yale.",
    "Lectures seemed relatively haphazard and unprepared.",
    "Having students present readings that no one else has read in advance was kind of a waste of time.",
    "Lectures. The instructor spoke too quickly, oftentimes preparing more information that could be successfully completed in one class period.",
    "- readings sometimes don't match up too well with the lectures.- the article presentations were often a waste of time \/ hard to follow without having read the article oneself.",
    "We could have used more time dedicated to discussing research project ideas with classmates. At times the teacher seemed disorganized and scattered.",
    "1. Overall the course was great, an area of improvement can be including some more practical sessions in class.",
    "Breaking out into groups to discuss research was helpful, but class discussions felt thin. I think it would have been helpful to bring the readings into discussions, discussing the issues they address, andanalyzing the methods of the papers and considering discrepancies or differences in methodological approaches.Many of us were hearing about our classmates' research for the first time during the end of semester presentations, not having been in break-out groups with them. I would have felt much more able to comment\/make suggestions about classmates' research if we had all submitted a synopsis of some sort on classes V2 before the presentations.Based on my conversations with other members of the class, I think some of us felt that we needed more guidance with certain practical elements of the process of developing a research project, especially with regard to making on the ground contacts.The guest lecture on statistical software was not very helpful, and I think an overview of the various statistical options for data analysis, and which methods are appropriate for which kind of data, would have been more beneficial.",
    "The research article presentations could probably be dropped. Although going through the analysis itself was useful, listening to everyone's presentations was not particularly interesting or useful, and it took away from class discussion time.",
    "Improved scheduling and time management would benefit the class. For example, the assigned readings (which were very interesting) were hardly discussed in through out the semester."

    "Both the Professor and the TA were very accessible and helpful. And nice. Also, though I thought the class was not very well organized and sometimes seemed like not the best way to spend my time, the prof. was often available and provided helpful feedback, ideas, etc. So while the class itself maybe wasn't so great, it did provide the opportunity for valuable interaction with a knowledgeable and generous Professor.",

There is a fine line between abusing this freedom to wander into a hallucinatory maze of alternative possibilities versus using the time to refine your ideas.
