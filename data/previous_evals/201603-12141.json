    "I did learn to think outside of the francophone literature box and into the anglophone literature--something I do not often have practice doing.",
    "This course introduced me to the fascinating history of the concept of the 'creole' across the Francophone Caribbean and beyond. By examining historical documents as well as literary and theoretical texts, I was able to think diachronically about the creole as a fascinating nexus of racial and linguistic anxieties in the Caribbean.",
    "I was exposed to literature from a wide variety of traditions (Caribbean, French, English, American) and, by exploring the term creole, learned different ways in which to approach these works."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were comprehensive, varied and interesting. I enjoyed being tasked with an in-class presentation, and listening to the presentations given by my peers. Professor Miller is an invaluable source of knowledge on the subject of the course, as well as a respectful facilitator of discussion.",
    "The strength and weakness of this course was the same: it covered a broad selection of literature from the 1700s to the twentieth century. All the readings were great, and I think that they did fit together. Yet at times it felt scattered. And since creole is such a nebulous, historically-contingent term, it was not always clear what the connection between the different readings was and where the class was going."

    "Yes, it was great."
