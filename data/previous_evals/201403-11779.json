    "An amazing course that analyzes the intersections of so many important social and ethical issues. Highly recommended for anyone looking to examine not just gender and sexuality, but also colonialism, (Western) imperialism, race, religion, culture, and (the potential conundrums) of human rights. Be prepared to question your own ethical assumptions, and to read lots of academic material (~4 journal articles a week), so most of the work is done outside of class, but you'll learn a lot in the process, promise. The way the syllabus is structured is also engaging and effective - ever wanted to post on Tumblr as homework? This is your class.",
    "WGSS 206 is a great class -- you have to take it for the WGSS major, but non-majors who are interested should take it as well! This class gave me a new perspective and vocabulary with which to talk about issues of gender and sexuality that \"go global.\" Professor A-J is fantastic, and I really liked the class assignments: weekly Tumblr posts (like reading responses, but more fun) and 3 slow critiques, 5-7 page essays that make you really dig into the reading. Overall, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Definitely recommend. Lots of reading, lots of fabulous discussion, and lots of writing. The course is about learning how to be feminist critics and it was FABULOUS.",
    "It was a really great course. Professor Agard-Jones is incredibly smart and an amazing professor. The only suggestion I would have is that she spent more time lecturing us\/guiding us through the material. In the middle of the semester, she allowed the class to lead the lectures. I wish we had more direct guidance from Professor Agard-Jones.",
    "It is a fantastic course taught by one of the most exciting professors in the WGSS department! You learn SO much.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a great study of international issues from a WGSS perspective, with a particular emphasis on the ways our own biases and assumptions influence the way in which we view these issues. It is a course in which your assumptions will be challenged, and you will be made uncomfortable. However, Professor AJ is an amazing presence throughout discussion, guiding you through the discomfort to really get you to push back on some of your deepest assumptions. Professor AJ is really dedicated to her students' learning experience and tries very hard to make sure all students' learning styles are utilized. Beyond that, she is a great mentor and a joy to work with. Take this course!",
    "A great and thorough introduction to transnational gender and sexuality studies. Professor Agard-Jones is lively, approachable, and a lot of fun, and is very good at driving critical and nuanced discussions. The course itself also allows students to engage deeply with issues in other, non-Western cultural contexts (female genital cutting, Iranian transsexuality, etc.) to understand how to critically investigate issues that are both local and global in their implications. There's a decent amount of work -- it is a writing credit! -- but it's all fairly manageable and Professor AJ gives really great feedback. So be prepared to spend time on the class, but it won't overwhelm you and you'll get a lot out of it!",
    "This class covers issues regarding gender and sexuality but forces you to analyze the topics from a global perspective in which you must consider a plethora of viewpoints and opinions. I would recommend this class to those outside of the major as well as in.",
    "Before you go off and save the world, take this course or one like it not because you shouldn't try, but because the enterprise is a lot more complicated than you might imagine.",
    "This class is amazing! Professor Agard-Jones seems to have revolutionized it in a grand way. Very, very engaging and challenging (for a non-major, at least). Be prepared to make it your baby--i.e. to spend a lot of time on assignments, both because there are a lot of assignments and because you care so much. There is a significant assignment every week, ranging from 3 tumblr posts and short reading response per week to a 5-7-page paper three times a semester. But the reading, though dense, is fascinating, and if you have a good group of people, class discussions are lively."
