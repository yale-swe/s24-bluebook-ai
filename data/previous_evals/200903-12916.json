   "comments": [
    "Only, ONLY take this class if you need it to become pre-med. It's very difficult (even with a background in BC Calc) and is just a frustration. I'm so glad to be done with it after this semester.",
    "Math 115 is a good math course for those who might want to take 120 and beyond, but are unsure of their knowledge of BC Calculus from high school. If you're looking for an easy course, take 112. If you want a more challenging intro course that will quickly open the door to other options in the math department, take 120. If you took AB in high school, feel like 112 would be a cop-out and want to learn SOMETHING new, this course is fine.",
    "Unless you have taken AP Calculus BC, this class will be challenging. Take it ONLY if you must.",
    "If you've already taken AB, but not BC, take 115. If you've already taken BC, please take 120 so you don't mess up the curve for everyone else (unless you genuinely don't remember anything from BC). 115 professors will expect you to already know whatever was covered in AB. The professor will go over some AB material (mainly integrating, volumes of solids of revolutions, area,&probability), but he does it very quickly and doesn't explain very much. I thought that he would slow down when we approached BC topics, but it was the same way. We went over the ideas maybe in a little more detail, but the material was still presented pretty quickly. That said, the professors are approachable if you need any extra help understanding the material and the material isn't very difficult in itself (and if you enjoy math, the material was interesting as well!). The problem sets weren't very hard and didn't take up much time if you knew what you were doing. Just be warned about the midterms and final (especially the final)! Don't expect to see similar questions to the ones on the problem sets. Problem sets are MUCH easier than any question on the midterms or final. There tend to be several theoretical questions on the exams, and occasionally they'll introduce a new concept that's somehow related to the ones you review in class and expect you to apply it on the test. This personally upset me, but I still enjoyed the class. If you take it Credit\/D\/Fail, it shouldn't be bad at all. If you don't take it Credit\/D\/Fail, you should still be okay, as long as you're willing to apply yourself. And the curves were also pretty gracious.All in all, take 115 if you like Math and want a taste of BC :) It's not much work. Just be prepared for the finals! And take the class with either Prof. Previdi or Prof. Orszag. Both of them tended to be on time when it came to covering the material and Prof. Orszag is known to give hints about what's coming up on the exams. Prof. Previdi was also helpful when it came to that.",
    "I would only recommend this course for someone who needs it as a pre req for other math classes or for their major. It is not a very enjoyable class but is not too difficult if you are willing to put in a decent amount of work.",
    "A solid introductory course for those interested in taking a couple of Math courses.",
    "I would say that this class is very typical of an introductory math course and, while overall slightly poor in comparison to most courses at Yale, is a class that should be taken if one is interested in math\/science. The content is very intriguing, but it is taught in a less than effective fashion. The math department could really use some revamping.",
    "I would only recommend it to a student if they had to take the class for pre-med or for credit toward a major. It is not a fun class and it is not well taught. While the two midterms are fair and reflect the material learned in the class, the final exam is ridiculous and unnecessarily difficult. This class makes you strongly dislike mathematics.",
    "Not too challenging of a course, but with that, it is not all that interesting or eye-opening. Still need to do work (follow lectures and put effort into problem sets) to understand the material, as it all culminates at the end.",
    "The course introduced several key concepts in calculus. The exams were fair and challenging, although the final several questions on the final exam were inappropriately difficult and completely unlike anything that had been covered in the course. The entire introductory mathematics department at Yale is a poor department all in all, and the 115 program is no exception. Many of the TA's are poor instructors, though there are a handful of effective ones. I recommend that you choose your TA wisely if you are taking this course.",
    "I would recommend it if you were willing to work on your own and were interested in the math to begin with. Otherwise it would be a difficult class if you had no interested in calculus.",
    "No, terrible course. If you have to take it, suck it up and take it- but find the best teacher you can, as hard as that can be. The tests are ridiculously hard and expect a level of understanding that we cannot grasp from class.",
    "Do NOT take this class unless it is required for your major\/premed. It is the most miserable class I have ever taken at yale. Unless you really enjoy math, and maybe even then, it will be torture. My advice is get a tutor, early on.",
    "115 seems really simple at the beginning, with integration and probably things you have all seen before, but do not be fooled...it (and the problem sets) gets harder.It isn't really an enjoyable class, and it is not taught well, but most people need to take a maths class. The good thing is that you can skip a class and that doesnt effect your grade and because its basically just copying examples from the textbook you're not missing anything you couldn't do yourself. Maybe if you got a good section teacher it would be better, although I think the maths department is lacking in good teachers. The work load is not too bad though.The final this year was MUCH harder than the examples they gave us, which was pointless and did not test what we had learnt in class."
