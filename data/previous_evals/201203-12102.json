    "An Introduction to vocabulary and grammar in the Italian language.Yes. I would definitely recommend this to another student. It's a great way to be introduced to Italian.",
    "Yes! Italian is fun, you should take it!",
    "Italian is a bitchin' language. Take it.",
    "Italian 110 covers basic grammar structures that are the foundation of Italian. If you want to learn to speak, read, and write Italian, take this class.",
    "This course is challenging yet fun. It will be rewarding if you put a lot of work into it. This professor is nice especially if you have never had languages before because her first language is English and she can better relate to students in that way, when translating and such.",
    "Definitely! It's not the easiest course, but at the end of the semester you'll certainly be happy with how much you've learned. The students who were in my section were all bright, cheerful people who were interested in learning but not killing themselves in the process. Although I took the course to fulfill a requirement, I am now considering being an Italian major."
