   "comments": [
    "The strengths are Professor Tomlinson's insightful discussion of texts\/themes. There could be a little more class discussion, but I don't know if that's possible with the material.",
    "The readings were really interesting.",
    "This course was ultimately confusing and very disengaging. It was a seminar that essentially functioned as a lecture. You could expect to be called upon at any time to answer questions about the dense and opaque material (worst of all Professor Tomlinsons own book...) the readings felt disconnected and were often highly technical and far above the comprehension of any of the students, which Professor Tomlinson seemed just mildly frustrated by rather than concerned for our learning.",
    "The class is too interdisciplinary, the readings are far too advanced for almost everyone, and there's no clear navigation through human evolution."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for humanities-focused students with an interest in science. It definitely isn't a science \"gut,\" and will only be worth it if you engage with the material.",
    "No. Absolutely notthis class was highly stressful, since the standards for the assignments were so arbitrary and confusing. It was also overall a minimally informative course in which everyone basically felt bound to try to echo back Professor Tomlinsons own opinions in a wild effort to participate, which was enforced by a practice of ruthlessly calling on students during class. I have never been in such a hostile classroom and would urge any student to stay away, and not be taken in by the appeal of this as an interesting class in both science and humanities: it is anything but.",
    "This course is a great introduction to these issues for more humanities-minded student. Professor Tomlinson is great. I would absolutely recommend this course."
