    "Overall, it is a good course! It offers exposure to a selection of research topics in Biostatistics beyond what is learned in the typical classroom setting.",
    "It is a great chance for me to be familiar with the update knowledge and information in biostatistics",
    "Strengths: 1. Interesting topics 2. Adequate length of class 3. Journal club and lunch with speakers provide the opportunity for in-depth discussions of the paper",
    "The seminar was good. One way that it could be improved would be to include more public health focused biostatisticians. There were many first semester students who were just now beginning to learn statistics and felt that they could not fully engage in the seminar because they either didn't understand the concepts in the presentation or did not spark their public health interest.",
    "Since this course is Biostatistics Seminar, there are no homework. However, it's better to discuss the paper in advance before the seminar speaker's talk.",
    "The seminars this semester is much more interesting than those in last academic year. May be proved by inviting more distinguished speakers.",
    "The course provides us a chance to learn what biostatisticians are doing in their real research. It is a very good course.",
