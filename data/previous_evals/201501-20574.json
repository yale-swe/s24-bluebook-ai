   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. You learn a lot about historical method and Asian American history. I thought it was a great survey of the field. However, I would point out that the course only focuses on Asian American history and not Asian American Studies more broadly. Since this course is the only grad level Asian American Studies course, I think the distinction is important.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course for anyone with experience\/knowledge in Asian American history and\/or anyone wanting to learn more. It is fairly historical, so it would be in the student's best interest to have some familiarity with how to write book reviews, historiographies, or break down a historical text. Although might not be absolutely necessary."

   "comments": [
    "This course definitely helped me with my dissertation project and research more broadly. It did so in two ways. One, it helped me get more exposure to historical methods and the strategies in Asian American history. Two, it helped me (content-wise) build my knowledge of Asian American history and the different areas within the field. Also, it helped give me some practice writing academic book reviews.",
    "This course was extremely important to deepening my knowledge of my discipline and the specialization of Asian American history. This course was most helpful in providing a broad survey of the field and helping me to place my own research in the context of previous\/ongoing scholarship. The final historiography was especially helpful in this regard. With all of the visiting Asian American scholars\/events that were incorporated throughout the semester, the course also was helpful in gauging how the field is developing. In terms of very practical skills, the book reviews, presentations, historiography essay, and class discussions all offered me fundamentals that I'll use later in my research, career, or teaching assignments."
