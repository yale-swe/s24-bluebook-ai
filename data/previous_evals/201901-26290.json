    "Yes. Krystyna is absolutely amazing and Polish is an amazing language. The class is not difficult (although the Polish language is) and is so much fun. You'll develop a really close relationship with Krystyna and your classmates because there are so few people who take the course.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. It has been so much fun and I have learned so much. Krystyna is truly the kindest professor who cares so much about teaching- an often rare attribute among Yale professors.",
    "Absolutely, Polish is a great language and the class is usually so small that everyone gets much more attention than they would in a different language class.",
    "100% would recommend."
