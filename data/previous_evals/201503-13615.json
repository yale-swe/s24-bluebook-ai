    "This class was phenomenal. Every week, you read something interesting and discuss about the fundamental issues of Islam. Even if you do not the Islam very well, this class is a must-take because it paints a broad picture of the contemporary discussions on Islam by connecting them to the works of the early Muslim thinkers. Very low in reading, easy in grading, low-key in class participation. Only 4 paper of 500-750 words. One final paper for which you get much help from the professor. It was much enjoyable experience with people who were really interested in the subject and was willing to listen to you.",
    "If you've ever wanted a better understanding of Islamic philosophy and theology this is the class for you. Don't take it because you want a modern philosophy class; but also don't take it expecting to just learn about old material. Islamic philosophy and theology is one of those fields where works from 1200 years ago are as influential today as ever, but there is also a flourishing modern movement. This well designed class will give you an appreciation of the full span of it. Some of the readings are challenging in format if you're not used to classical Islamic texts but prof van lit is endless helpful on these points. Also a knowledge of Arabic is definitely not necessary. That said it surely adds a huge dimension to the class. Overall fascinating course, historically very interesting but also very relevant to the modern world. The assignments are mostly extremely short and will force you to condense ideas a lot. The final paper is as big as you make it in terms of scale so don't overburden yourself. Great class.",
    "This is an interesting class that gives a broad survey of considerations involved in the reason\/revelation debate. It does not go into depth on anything in particular, and the sessions were not that in depth.",
    "MMES 231 is class that analyzes the discussion on the relationship between Islam and science\/logical reasoning through both contemporary and classical texts. I would recommend this class to students with an interest in Islam, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of science, or the relationship between religion and science. I would also recommend this class to any student that enjoys doing close analysis of shorter pieces."
