    "This was a great class -- definitely take it!",

    "TAKE THE CLASS",
    "The best class I have taken at Yale; an absolute must take. For one thing, I learned so much about a side of American history that is arguably hidden from most people. Did you know \"This land is your land\" is a communist song? Or were you aware of the importance of American communists to the civil rights movement? I certainly didn't know about these things before taking this course, and it was fascinating to learn about them. However, what really makes the course is Professor Gage, who is simply wonderful. Since it's a seminar students will speak the majority of the time, but after every two or three comments Gage will lecture briefly to tie everything that has been said so far together and pose some new questions. As a result, the discussions were so engaging that I looked forward to class every week. The workload is moderate; there's probably around 150-200 pages of reading per week, but the vast majority of it is interesting. If you have the opportunity, you really should take Communism and Anticommunism!",
    "I would recommend it as a good basic junior history seminar to take. Accessible, yet detailed.",
    "This is a heavy duty class that will demand a lot, but will be one of the most intellectually satisfying courses you'll take at Yale. Engaging material that is surprisingly applicable to your everyday life and current American politics. This is one of those classes you'll leave looking at the world--especially government, foreign policy, and politics in general--in a completely different way. You'll also learn how to conduct your own in depth, original research project, which of course you do in most junior seminars. But for this one, I can honestly say I've never worked harder on or felt more proud of a paper as I did in this class."
