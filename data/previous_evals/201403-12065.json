   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in learning the Russian language this is a great way to start.",
    "It's Russian... Obviously very difficult but I would highly recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest inclination to take it. It's just a fantastic language with a ton of culture and history.",
    "Great class. Julia's teaching style is fantastic. Pace alternates between fast at the beginning of the unit, and slower towards the end so you can really learn all of the new material. She's also very clear about what we need to learn for the tests. Definitely would recommend to anyone interested in Russian.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student. If you want a strong foundation and thorough introduction to the language, you will find it in 110.",
    "Russian will prove to be a very valuable language to learn in the future. Learning Russian is a rare and unique opportunity offered at Yale. There are easier languages to learn. However, the fact that for most students the chance to learn Russian in high school was nonexistent, and the availability of Russian language course offerings after graduation rare, I would recommend this course to anyone planning to travel or work globally.",
    "Introduction to Russian alphabet, basic grammar, and vocabulary. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend it. It's basic Russian, and I'm looking forward to next semester so i can learn more!"
