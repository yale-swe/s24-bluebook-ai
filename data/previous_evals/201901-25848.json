    "Strengths were that it was very hands-on, which made it easier to learn. Weaknesses were that it was boring at times",
    "Well taught and paced with sufficient time to understand the material at the needed depth for this course.",
    "Assessments were given in too close proximity to learning the material. I understand there were time constraints, but it was very difficult to succeed on a pop quiz given on a subject before we even correct the homework. If I didn't understand the topic the night before, I clearly wouldn't be able to understand it in the morning, and so tests seemed more punitive than anything else. Other than that, this was a pretty good class. It would have been better if we could have had more engaging classes instead of just lectures. It was very difficult to stay awake during early morning classes, and so most of the time I struggled to keep from falling asleep instead of focusing on taking notes. If the material had been presented in more diverse ways, it would have facilitated learning. During one class, we watched a video about weather patterns. This was awesome, and more of it should be done in the future.",
    "The course was overall well structured in terms of facilitating student learning. It was at times difficult to wake up so early to attend 7:30 class two times a week, but that's probably necessary considering that it doesn't conflict with other non-Navy classes.",
    "Strengths: great hands on preparation"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it covers topics in Naval Navigation that normal civilian classes would never cover. However, note the early class times. The instructor was also not the most engaging, although he is nice and tries to be as helpful as he can.",
    "The course was useful for figuring out how to maneuvers vessels."
