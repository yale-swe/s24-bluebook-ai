   "comments": [
    "Yes. One of the most useful classes I have taken thus far. Really interesting reading and the field project is an invaluable experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to gain experience of qualitative research and an overview of the research techniques and methods of analysis available to the qualitative researcher, as well as a deep understandingof the ethical issues. Be warned: it's a lot of work because there is a substantial amount of reading to do for each class, plus your own research project to plan, research and write up.",
    "I absolutely would recommend the course and would say that ANYONE in political science who is doing anything qualitative for their dissertation (including fieldwork, interviews, etc) should take the class.",
    "a must-have semester of hands-on ethnographic research training with a teacher, readings, assignments and fellow students that are truly transformative. i wholeheartedly recommend this course: don't leave yale without studying with prof. wood.",
    "I'd highly recommend the course, and warn future students that it is a considerable amount of work if one wants to truly make the most of the fieldwork segment.",
    "This course was my first introduction to qualitative methods, and I feel very well-introduced. The coursework split between a field project of your design and course readings, most often on theory.The readings were accessible. Most often, they offered direct advice to a future or current researchers, and these lessons were clearly delivered in the text and well discussed in class. Specific methodological recommendations came up frequently, along with the opportunity to implement them in our own projects. A few more general pieces on theory, as well as extensive ethnographies, rounded out a great reading selection.The field projects were an excellent foray into qualitative research. There was plenty of support from Professor Wood and from other students. Since the stakes are relatively low (some students are electing to continue their projects but many were limited to the semester), you got the chance to trouble-shoot the method in a way that is incredibly helpful to future projects."

   "comments": [
    "It was helpful in rounding out my knowledge of quantitative methodologies with a solid introduction to complementary qualitative methodologies.",
    "This class is likely the most useful class I will take in the department in terms of contributing to my dissertation and research.",
    "While I still lack the note-taking and data-coding habits I need to finish my dissertation, this course certainly informed my research practices and gave me a sense of what using my time well in the field would look like."
