   "comments": [
    "I took this class after taking Chinese 130\/140 at Yale then doing 3rd year at a Light program over the summer in China (ACC). I thought 154 was definitely the perfect level to place into after that. I felt like I maintained my Chinese skills more than improved them, but you can learn a lot if you put in the effort. It's not nearly as structured as lower levels of Chinese at Yale or Light programs were, so it's really up to you how much you get out of it.",
    "Yes I would recommend if you want to continue Chinese.",
    "Depends on what you're trying to get out of higher level Chinese. If you're trying to advance further, don't take it- you won't make enough progress to get to the next higher levels of language, especially if you do it after the Light Fellowship. But if this is the end of the line for your Chinese study, it's a decent class. Shen Laoshi is really nice and helpful and does a lot of interesting things in class, but it just isn't as intense a Chinese experience as I would have liked.",
    "This course is fairly good at helping you to maintain your Chinese, but don't expect anything but your reading to improve. Unlike 150, it only meets three times a week, and there are very few opportunities to speak in class; for me, this meant that I lost some of the confidence in speaking that I gained in 150. The readings are interesting, though, and Shen Laoshi is very nice.",
    "I'm hesitant to recommend it per se. If you're looking for a course in which you can just sustain your current level of Chinese, I think this should be fine, but I think higher courses, while a bit more challenging, may allow you to learn a little bit more.",
    "It's pretty similar to the previous Chinese course. It has the same problem of forcing students to cram too many vocab words per lesson and not using the words in subsequent lessons to make students remember.",
    "It wasn't a spectacular class, but if you already have a good foundation of Chinese, 154 was good to maintain your level and improve a bit. I entered 154 not having taken a Chinese class for a year, and this class quickly and effectively got my Chinese back up to where it had been the last time I took a class. If you're looking for big improvements, though, you might be disappointed.",
    "This is a good course. It is challenging. The students in the course have very different backgrounds in Chinese.",
    "This is a good class and will help improve your Chinese. It is still a lot of work though.",
    "I certainly recommend this course as a challenging but manageable fourth-year class. Shen Laoshi is excellent, and there is never a boring moment in class. It can occasionally be difficult to keep up, but it is well structured and ensures that students do not fall behind.",
    "Chinese 154 is the requisite next step in the Chinese language sequence\u0085 One would have a difficult time skipping Chinese 154 to go from the third-year culture& conversation course to the literature courses.I would recommend Chinese 154 not necessarily as a course that should be taken for its own merits but rather as an agreeable means to further one's understanding of and appreciation for Chinese language and culture.",
    "Take it if you can't go to China just to keep up your fluency. Don't expect to become better than going to China would make you, though.",
    "There are no surprises here. If you've made it this far and want to continue, go for it.",
    "If you're a returning Light Fellow, Chinese 154 is a good easy way to continue studying Chinese, although you won't really feel like your Chinese is improving much because the course is so much less intense than what you've taken abroad. Nonetheless, it will help keep your Chinese from decaying, and it is a fun course in which you'll learn some new stuff.",
    "This is a somewhat awkward level to take Chinese at. If you have the confidence to take the next level, I would recommend that. You can learn a lot more, faster by studying in China. We went through a variety of lessons, with the standard amount of vocabulary, but the discussion of grammar was very unstructured. We had weekly vocab quizzes, and the tests were all very easy. There was one discussion class a week, but other than that not much chance for talking. If you just want an opportunity to practice and keep up your Chinese its a relatively easy way to do so.",
    "I took CHNS 130\/140 last year, did Light in the summer in Taipei (which is not as intense as the Beijing programs), and then took this course, and it was perfect. As someone who's always struggled with speaking and listening rather than reading and writing, this course was much better suited for me than the literature courses that you can also opt to take if you get to L5. There's lots of discussion time in class and you also meet with a tutor, so there's plenty of practice time for talking. There were also plenty of vocabulary words for me to learn in each lesson, so I never felt like the class was too easy. Keep in mind, however, that this is a language class - there are tests on grammar and tingxie as usual. Also, Prof. Shen is very sweet and a really fair grader."
