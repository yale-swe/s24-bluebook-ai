    "The class you want to take if this is the area you want to study, or if you want to learn about diplomacy and international affairs from history.",
    "Athenian Imperial Democracy is epic. Professor Kagan is the preeminent scholar in the field and not a minute iswasted. The discussions are always spot-on and the course allows you to look at history in a new way. This has, been by far, the best history course I've taken at Yale and the more you prepare, the more you get out of it. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take it!",
    "Outstanding--structure perfect to learn--reading and two easy to write papers--though a tough final which you must study hard for--but probably will be your favorite class. Period.",
    "A course with Donald Kagan is worth the price of Yale tuition.",
    "This is a great history seminar. Interesting material, incredible prof. Your fellow classmates might annoy you at times, but Professor Kagan is amazing. He's an adept leader of discussion and asks all the right questions. His command of the material is without parallel, and his writing is some of the most lucid, well-argued historical work I've seen.Be prepared to read a lot and discuss a lot. The format of the seminar (50% participation which consists of in class-participation, two five page essays you send to the class a week in advance of discussion, and two reports on those essays, 50% final) is a bit odd, but it works. Kagan is going to force you to defend your assertions and clarify your thinking, and it will make you a better historian.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Analyze each situation from the perspective of the historical players. Kids in the class can be rather Y-PU but Kagan is just the best.",
    "Kagan is an incredible professor; however, be aware that this class does attract some of the worst stereotypes of the yale classics\/history major types. The seminar is based on people writing reports on the weekly reading, and then being grilled on them by Kagan. If you can accept the people, its worth taking just so you can be in that close proximity to Kagan.",
    "These Kagan seminars are some of the best courses at Yale. I have taken all three, and I wish there were three more for me to take. You should absolutely take one of these if you get a chance. The way in which Kagan conducts seminars is excellent, with the perfect mixture of student and professor input, within firm guidance to make sure the discussion stays on track. The report format for the papers is also incredibly rewarding.",
    "If you have any passion for ancient Greek history, especially the military and political history of the time, take this class. Professor Kagan is recognized globally as the expert on the Peloponnesian War, and you understand why when you take this class (even though it only reaches the opening days of that second conflict!). Perhaps my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Donald Kagan is the best teacher I have had at any level of my education. A more intelligent, helpful, kind, and challenging professor could scarcely be imagined. If you can get into any of his seminars, regardless of the subject, you would be well advised to take it. If you decide to enroll in one of his seminars, try to do all of the reading - it will be well worth your time. And if you're either in his seminar, in his lecture course, or just an intellectually curious person, you would be well advised to go to Prof. Kagan's office hours. He will be glad to advise you and engage in discussion on a variety of topics. As for this course specifically - Athenian Imperial Democracy - it covers an incredibly fascinating period of world history: the birth of classical Athens, the golden age under Pericles, and the causes of the Peloponnesian War. What could be better? If you're reading this review and have the opportunity to take this course, do not pass it up. It very well could define your Yale education.",
    "This class is a Kagan classic! Though perhaps less historically controversial than Spartan Hegemony and less famous than Peloponnesian War, the Athenian Democracy seminar is perhaps the most immediately relevant seminar to today's world. How do rival powers work with one another in an increasingly multipolar world is the issue facing the United States today, and the looming questions of the semester - is war inevitable and how do individual actions play a role in shaping international circumstances - is one that draws parallels every single week. Absolutely recommended; taking one class with Kagan is a treat, but taking all three is a blessing!",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Prof. Kagan is a brilliant and wise professor. His questions lead a productive class discussion and debate. Over the course of the semester, students start using Kagan's and their own insights into political motivations to piece together what happened oh so long ago in Ancient Greece.",
    "An advanced, old-school history seminar with the best living historian.",
    "My god where to begin. I consider myself somewhat skeptical when it comes to people who say this is a \"can't miss\" course. But dear god, if Kagan ever teaches a seminar again you should be willing to scrape and maim to get youself a seat. You have alumni from 30 years ago who you talk to and they say that the most formative intellectual experience of their lives was a Donald Kagan seminar. The care he takes to your learning coupled with the fact that he is perhaps the most prominent classical historian of the 20th century means that you'll be able to feed off of his both incredible historical breadth and personal warmth. You will not find another professor in the country who will challenge you to do your best possible work with as much rigor and caring.Plus-Ancient Greece was the world's most influential\/badass civilization."
