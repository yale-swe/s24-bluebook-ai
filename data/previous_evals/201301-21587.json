    "If you have come this far in studying Chinese at Yale, it is absolutely worth it to continue. Prof. Zhou is extremely nice, humorous, and an all-around great teacher. If you are willing to put in the time to listen to the supplemental recordings online, learn the characters well, and pay attention in class, you will definitely improve (or at least maintain) your level of Chinese, while learning some useful vocab and grammar in the process.",
    "A great continuation to the first half of the course. The tests get a bit harder, but certainly not enough to deter students from taking it.",
    "I would recomend it as a way to improve writing and speaking skills about advanced topics.",
    "Take it id you want a way to keep up your Chinese. It is a manageable workload and you will learn a lot of Chinese.",
    "This is a course similar to chinese L5. Zhou laoshi is always willing to help and it was very easy to follow. If you want to keep up your Chinese, this class is a good course to take. Though, like any other language course, you will need to do work every other day as there are pre-class quiz and homework for every class.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is an amazing teacher, and his class is unique in the Chinsse department in that it is not only informative, but interesting. Usually topics are more mundane, but modern Chinese follows interesting topics like the one child policy, marriage, and cross strait relations. Zhou truly cares about his students and their enthusiasm in the course. Must take! I am sad I did not have more time to dedicate to this course. Challenging, but doable. Structure consists of exams, daily homework, essays, and oral exams. A lot of work but consistent and predictable."
