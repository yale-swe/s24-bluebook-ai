    "I wouldn't say it's useful engineering wise, maybe a bit too easy but I guess you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend it if you are going to take it for your major.It is a required class. The material is interesting but we don't get to get into the real nitty gritty yet.",
    "This is a great class to take, and you will learn a lot about Chemical and Environmental Engineering. The math in the class never gets too insane, and in fact was quite reasonable. The dimensional analysis unit in particular is really cool, and you'll get to see how to do things like build a scale model of the Alaskan pipeline (which is actually more complicated than it sounds)\/",
    "Take it because you're ChemE and you have to. Otherwise, look elsewhere. Nothing special, a fairly straightforward class, but super boring and lectures are often handwritten and hard to read. Haller is a great man, go to office hours and talk to him, but as a lecturer, he is definitely sub-par.",
    "Useful if you're interested in any career in Engineering.",
    "Basically, the course is an introduction to the chemE major. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terribly difficult, and if you like chemistry and engineering then you should find the topics relatively enjoyable. Prof. Haller is really smart and eager to work with students, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad lecturer. The course would be perfect if the TA did the teaching and Haller advised. Ask questions in class even if you feel stupid. Haller won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you feel stupid and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only way to stay awake. And make friends and work with them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general advice for making the major a lot more survivable and enjoyable.More in-depth description: 210 is a good introduction to chemical engineering \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it gives you a good sense of what the scope of the major. The textbook is relatively clear and enjoyable to read, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like a textbook in that it is not methodical in the way it presents material. Throughout the course, you get a sense that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaining entry into the major, which is nice for those starting out in chemical engineering who want to obtain a better understanding of what the field entails. There is a good balance of theory and applications (which is especially nice for engineers). Professor Haller is very nice and approachable, and it is clear that he is very intelligent and knows a lot about the field, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great lecturer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evident that he is invested in the students \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he accommodated me for two exam conflicts, gave me an extension for the final extra credit project, and was helpful in office hours. He also generally recognizes his weaknesses and makes special arrangements to make sure they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interfere with student learning: he knows that spreadsheets are not his forte, but recognizes that it is important for students to gain familiarity with them, so he has the TA work with us instead on the spreadsheets. He also realizes that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for us to pay attention throughout the entire lecture, so he had us do interactive activities (which I was thankful for in helping me stay awake!). It was often hard to pay attention in lecture, and some of the hand-written lecture slides were impossible to read. The TA was Magda, who TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099ed this class before, and she is phenomenal! Her grading was really fair: I went to office hours for psets, and she was happy to help and was good at explaining things, and she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take points off for silly mistakes. She also told us when she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure of something and found it out for us. Even when she away, she was quick to answer emails so that we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be left alone with any lingering questions. She was very helpful one-on-one as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I went to her for help with almost every pset even if I knew how to do the problems because I always understood the topic much better after talking about the problem set with her. She also acted as a mentor for me, answering my questions about the major, grad school, and careers in science in general, and helped me figure out summer plans and research plans for the coming semester. Sometimes I went to office hours, talked about the pset for 15 min, and then just talked with her for 1.5 hours. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome.",
    "I would walk out thinking \"wow, that stuff is cool\" to think about it 10 minutes later wondering what I had just learned. The class isn't difficult and Professor Haller is a great person. Sometimes though, it would've been good to remind him that the end of his sentences should also be directed at the students and not the blackboard. The material is interesting and the course is very doable.",
    "Class is boring, the PPTs are confusing, and the textbook is mediocre at best. As for the material itself, sometimes it felt like a ray of sunshine would pierce through the clouds and I'd say to myself, \"Oh, I can see why this stuff is cool.\" But those moments were few and far between. Surprisingly, this class is pretty easy. Everyone else will probably assume it's really difficult, but the workload is minimal and the tests are pretty easy (high-school level memorization, really). Professor Haller is easy to talk to and accessible, but his attempts at making the class engaging are pretty ineffective."
