    "Yale elementary courses for east asian languages are world class. Absolutely fantastic curriculum, teaching style, and overall structure. Demanding, rewarding, fast paced.",
    "Very good introductory grasp of modern Chinese.",
    "You learn how to write around 400 characters. It's fantastic. You learn so much about pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and a little about culture.",
    "I gained a solid foundation in speaking, reading, and writing Mandarin Chinese, plus a beginner's understanding of Chinese culture.",
    "This class is a wonderful opportunity to begin learning Chinese and I strongly recommend both the language and the department to anyone looking to take a language here.",
    "This class taught me how to learn a foreign language, how to handle a high work load, how to be comfortable with speaking in front of others, and how to use basic conversational Chinese and how to write many Chinese characters!",
    "This class has been vigorous, but extremely rewarding. Without any previous knowledge of the language, I found myself having difficulty with tones and pronunciations, however, the professors have been instrumental in establishing a solid foundation. I recommend taking this class if you have a interest in learning the language.",
    "This course has taught me so much Chinese, considering the relatively short amount of time studying it. I am able to speak Chinese without considering the different tones and recall grammar and vocabluary into use through much practice and instruction from the teachers. This course has helped me have a greater appreciation for the Chinese language and I've come to enjoy learning Chinese because I'm able to do it well under the guidance of the teachers.",
    "I learned basic Chinese language skills. That will help me communicate with Chinese in business environment in the future.",
    "I learned how to read, speak, and write in Mandarin Chinese. Through the culture that is interwoven within the culture I also learned about some ideals traditions and other cultural ideas throughout the course. At a critical level it helped me be more open to the way people communicate with the different possible building blocks a language can have."

   "comments": [
    "All strengths, really. I love the structure of this course. It would be useful to hold the tutorial sessions in bass cafe or a more central campus location, considering how brief they are.",
    "Pace is slow if one has experience with other difficult foreign languages. Textbook is useful but borderline juvenile. Perhaps an intensive Chinese course is in order?",
    "Strengths: Rigorously taught, highly structured, small classes, tons of opportunities to speak in class Weaknesses: You can't take any days off",
    "I found the course very engaging and well-organized, taught well by teachers who were all on the same page.",
    "I think we could have focused a bit more on immersion, which is obviously difficult starting from L1 but I wish that there had been more of an emphasis on discovering for ourselves through asking how to say new things etc.",
    "It is highly personalized, which I really appreciated. The class size was very small, and the individual tutoring was helpful. I feel that the level of tutoring could be improved -more equalized throughout.",
    "This class taught me a lot of Chinese. I went from knowing nothing to being able to speak and write basic Chinese. The class is very effective at teacher and you truly learn a lot of the language. The only pitfall is the intense workload.",
    "The strengths are being in a small, interactive class that allows you to be fully engaged with you're classmates and professor. There are no weaknesses.",
    "the strength of this course is definitely in as much in the teaching of the material as it is in the learning of the material - the latter being on the student's part. It is made clear to all students that succeeding largely depends on individual drive and preparation for each daily class, which constantly puts you in competition against yourself as well as with some peers. A weakness in this course is that sometimes it is unclear which characters exactly one is meant to study - I always found the weekly schedule to be a little confusing when it came to characters and how the teachers would handle quizzing us over characters that we were meant to study over vacation.",
    "This was one of the most intense classes I have ever taken.",
    "The strengths of this course is its ability to teach any student how to speak Chinese. The course creates a firm foundation by focusing at the beginning of the semester with pronunciation to build good habits. The only weakness is the rigor and speed of the course. It is easy to fall behind once you something in class as the course compounds what it teaches beforehand consistently."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, take Chinese and go study on a Light-approved program. It's a rare opportunity!",
    "Take it! It is a little slow-paced and can seem a bit tedious at times, but it seems to be a good way to acquire basic knowledge of Chinese. The teaching team is well-organized and very good.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese at any point, take this class, but you should make it the focal point of your semester. It demands a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's valuable and it's taught well.",
    "Yes, provided you have time in your schedule. I had an extremely rough semester both as far as work and mental health, and Chinese was a lot to handle, but it was 100% worth it.",
    "I definitely would recommend! I heard before that Chinese is one of the strongest language programs at Yale, and it was right. I learned so much in just one semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody considering starting Chinese or just staring a new language in general. In high school I went through four unsatisfying of Spanish and wanted to try something different. The Yale Chinese program is literally the best in the world for a reason. The teachers are really great. They teach the content really well and in a way that is easy for understand, even if you know absolute about nothing about the language. Before Yale, I knew nothing about Chinese. By the end of the semester, I was able to speak with my Chinese friends and write an essay in Chinese. Going to class today was a really enjoyable experience and I'm really going to miss the teachers and my class. The only thing that I would warn someone who was considering taking Chinese L1 is that the workload is really intense. I spent a majority of my time studying Chinese and there is a lot of daily assignments. It is very possible to get an A with no background, and to be able to speak basic Chinese with your friends, but it will require countless hours of studying and practicing. The class is a lot of work, but its very rewarding and I'm glad that I chose Chinese over another language.",
    "This class will improve your Chinese tremendously. I 100% recommend taking the class if you have a deep interest in learning the language. The professors are engaging, interactive, supportive, and will help you in achieving your language goals.",
    "Chinese 110 is a large workload, but by the end of the semester you will likely not believe how much you have learned. I had no previous experience in Chinese when i stepped into the classroom the first day of shopping period and now students that I have met from Hong Kong University complement my pronunciation and are amazed at how many characters I know. I'd highly recommend this course. The teachers are fantastic and eager to help you grow, and the resources that Yale offers to a student wanting to go beyond the classroom are incredible.",
    "This course is a great introduction to studying Chinese. It offers a strong foundation of the Chinese language from its basic elements and helps one develop skills that are tremendously useful for speaking Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is passionate about Chinese and craves a challenge.",
    "I highly recommend this course to my classmates.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. It teaches you strong fundamentals of the Chinese language all while leaving you at the end of the semester as someone who can pursue learning the language on your own, if need be."
