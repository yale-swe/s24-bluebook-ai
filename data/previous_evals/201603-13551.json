   "comments": [
    "Critical thinking as one of the greatest benefits of this course as I learned to analyze and criticize arguments from some of the world's greatest philosophers.",
    "I learned how to properly structure a philosophical reconstruction and what the main concepts espoused by major thinkers are.",
    "How to develop a philosophical argument. Reconstructing arguments and assessing them for validity and soundness. History of Philosophy from Parmenides to Aquinas.",
    "DS Philosophy helped me develop logical skills that I had by forcing me to reconstruct arguments by premise and analyze them for soundness and validity. It also involved tackling and analyzing relatively difficult texts. DS Philosophy texts really forced me to think more about the \"bigger questions\" and how they apply in my own life. DS Philosophy also developed my abilities to participate in seminar-based courses.",
    "This course was my first experience with philosophy. I learned how to reconstruct a philosophical argument, as well as read difficult classical texts.",
    "To think critically about philosophical texts and to defend my arguments better.",
    "Having never taken a philosophy course before, Prof de Souza definitely opened my eyes to what philosophy is and how we can talk abot without necessarily agreeing on anything.",
    "I learned how to examine arguments and think logically about what people say.",
    "I learned how to evaluate philosophical arguments for soundness and validity. I also gained a good working knowledge of the basics of major philosophical movements in the Classical and Medieval period.",
    "I learned about different philosophical theories from Ancient Greece and Rome through the medieval Islamic and Christian eras. I also learned about methods of philosophical argument and how to reconstruct an argument.",
    "This class specifically out of all DS courses helped me learn how to think and how much of my value system and worldview is structured from a set of assumptions.",
    "DS Philosophy was my most enjoyed course this semester because of the works we studied and how the class discussions were structured in our section. I enjoyed reading about the different philosophies of prominent thinkers and developing my own perspective from there. I actually loved writing our philosophy papers because they forced me to think in a way that I never have thought before and sometimes I thought so hard my head started to hurt. That is the kind of reasoning that is fostered in this class, one where I need to back up my own argument with relevant points and strong evidence. And my writing has certainly benefited from that kind of challenging thinking too."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is characterized by a developing view of philosophy across time, and it is amazing to see how it developed from one period to the next and from one school of thought to the next. The breadth of the material makes it difficult to treat all of it in seminars, which leaves some ideas very unclear.",
    "I personally would have liked to read another couple of Plato's works, though the ones that we read were also great. Perhaps for a few of the more complicated concepts, such as many of Aristotle's, a bit more time should be taken. And some of the philosophical terms could be explained better (epistemology etc.).",
    "This course was very well organized. I think however, that we were trying to take on too much material at once, and so I only received a superficial understanding of some philosophers' positions.",
    "Often times I left the class feeling more confused than before, like my brain had been spun around in my skull and successfully discombublated. I wish there was a way to discuss philosophy without this.",
    "Strengths: encouraging and engaging group discussion Weaknesses: the discussion can be more streamlined so that it doesn't go all over the place",
    "The course is great as an introductory philosophy course. The readings give a great scope of the Ancient and Medieval philosophical movements. It also gives a wide range of writing prompts that allow students to play to their strengths. Some weeks, the reading is overwhelming and the faculty could perhaps pay greater attention to that. For especially difficult works such as Aristotle's Physics, the faculty could perhaps give more direct guidance than with other more easily grasped works.",
    "I thought it was helpful to discuss the texts we read in class, but sometimes the discussion veered off-topic or we didn't get to discuss key ideas from the readings.",
    "I thought the syllabus, schedule, and lectures were strengths. I really liked the works we read.",
    "This class was fascinating and challenging and a struggle in all the best ways. Like all DS classes, the volume of content was huge, but this especially which made going through philosophers confusing if we only had one class to talk about them. It really took the whole week (minimum) to understand each philosophical school and when we were inundated with multiple in a week the discussions were less interesting."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in improving understanding of classical philosophy and its history and their capacity to write persuasively and logically.",
    "Professor DeSouza is chill. Great section. Just the right balance of student and teacher contributions to class. DS is a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend DS Philosophy to anyone who is thinking about doing work in philosophy. Philosophy involves a lot of understanding previous philosophers, and DS philosophy sets that up well by leading you through a progression of Plato to Aristotle to Aquinas.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in classical philosophy. There is a lot of reading and writing, so if you are not passionate about the topic -- the course is not very enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely, Professor De Souza is great.",
    "Yes",
    "I would if the student in logical thinking and philosophy.",
    "DS, and the Phil course, is a great program. The Phil course seems daunting at first and the first lecture might leave your head spinning. But this is one of the few courses that actually makes you feel smarter. After taking the course I feel like I have a new skill set.",
    "I would recommend this class overall, because the readings were interesting and provided a good introduction to philosophy.",
    "DS Philosophy is a challenging class, and the papers especially are very difficult because they are so foreign and different than other types of writing. That being said, philosophy is as thought-provoking as it is challenging and frustrating.",
    "Yes I will definitely recommend this class to other students especially if they are already interested in philosophy. This class could be a good introductory philosophy course but it is also a challenging one as the semester progresses so most students can get something meaningful out of the course."
