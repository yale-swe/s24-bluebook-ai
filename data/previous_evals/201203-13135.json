   "comments": [
    "I recommend it if you're interested in learning the basics of a couple different types of printmaking. It's a pretty time consuming process, you'll definitely have to be working during moniter hours, but its a cool class, you get to use new materials, acids, metals, tools.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I do recommend this class to those of you looking to learn a lot of new techniques. If you want to specialize in one type of printmaking, this is not the class for you. There is a fair amount of work outside of class and only a limited amount of time to do it. Definitely shop it, though, if you are at all interested. It may seem hard to get into but lots of people drop it so it isn't too bad. Annoying to share the press with lots of people, though.",
    "Yes take it if you want to make prints. Important skill if you draw and paint.",
    "If you are interested in understanding how much printmaking can achieve as a medium, take this class. Marie's enthusiasm will make you want to learn all you can about the various processes. While in the class, we learned how to do linocuts (including reduction prints), collagraphs, and various methods of intaglio printing (etching, aquatint, and sugar lift). The course is time-consuming, but extremely rewarding.",
    "This is a class in printmaking - you will learn how to make various prints by hand and using different presses or types of machinery. This is a technique-strong and prompt-driven class, so you work on an assignment-by-assignment basis using skills you pick up throughout the class, so you have to do your best to keep up and master the printing techniques to the best of your ability in order to produce here. The class is good for people who have already had experience in art classes and, specifically, in keeping up with the output that's expected of them - so if this is your first art class, be prepared to make a lot of work very quickly, while your creative direction is, in large part, suspended. You still have a place to speak through your work but certainly not as much as you would in a freeform, self-directed art class.I'd recommend this class if you're out to try something new while also building technique, researching artists, and engaging with the physicality of the a making process.",
    "Good intensive hands-on course. Learned a lot of new printing techniques using different grounds, copper\/chipboard\/rubber plates, and mixing paints with thickener\/thinner substances. Because each printing process requires rigid steps and drying\/chemical reaction time, this class especially taught me how to manage my time. Procrastination was never an option. I loved the rigor and variety of projects in this class. A GREAT college-level art course."
