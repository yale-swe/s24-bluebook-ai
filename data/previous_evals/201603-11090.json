   "comments": [
    "Most directly, this course encouraged me to think of writing history (even, writing, in the most general sense) in new ways. Through reading many provocative works of history, I developed better skills to analyze historiography. Additionally, this course encourages creative, independent work, while providing helpful deadlines to structure the research process. Professor Rosenfeld does an incredible job helping along the research process -- she made the rather daunting process of producing a 20-page history paper (\"experimental\" in some sense) an achievable and educational process. Both in course content and independent research\/writing, this course helped me to develop as an analytical thinker -- especially in relation to historical writings.",
    "Professor Rosenfeld was incredibly careful with developing the research process, so that I felt as though I was actually learning how to \"do\" history rather than just learning about a subject.",
    "This was a great introduction to thinking in new ways about historical method. The course does teach you something of historical events themselves, as each book covers a different set of events in a different region of the world, but primarily, the focus is on how history is written. It was refreshing and challenging to read a book every week and think of the mechanics behind it instead of the historical event. like being an F1 engineer instead of a racing driver.",
    "I learned so much about the research process involved in writing a history paper, and I was so appreciative of all of the guidance given us in producing bibliographies and research questions and answers. I also learned how to read history texts critically and with nuance, and the discussions in class were always lively and interesting.",
    "1. How to articulate my thoughts into precise, economically-phrased questions. 2. How to approach writing histories of unconventional subjects.",
    "Understanding the different ways in which history can be approached, critically analyzing authorial intent and purpose, intensive research skills",
    "I think I learned how to read history texts in different ways and thus think about history as a disciple differently\/from various approaches."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I would say the strengths of this course are similar to answers above. Professor Rosenfeld chose fun, engaging readings that really challenged the genre of \"history.\" Class discussions were enriching. Pre-seminar questions encouraged advance thinking about the readings. Although a long final paper, Professor Rosenfeld included many intermediate goals that made the paper less daunting. I really see no weaknesses. Professor Rosenfeld is not easy -- but I believe that she supports students in reaching higher achievement. All around great class, perhaps one of the best that I have taken at Yale.",
    "The course was very strong in terms of its structure--Rosenfeld wrote a syllabus that carefully walked us through the research process. However, I did feel that the class could have benefited from encouraging even more experimentation, not in terms of subject matter, but more in terms of how we were writing our own papers.",
    "Sometimes the spark of conversation was lost by the orchestrated use of putting hands up and then lining up to make points. The alternative would certainly have meant losing some thoughts, but new ones would have come in their place.",
    "I thought this class did exceptionally well in preparing each of the students to write a larger-scale paper. Professor Rosenfeld was always willing to speak with students to push creative ideas and explore new arguments. Every student had an opportunity to speak if they wanted to, and sharing each of our projects with the class was also extremely helpful in generating arguments.",
    "Strengths: 1. Great selection of texts 2. Wonderful professor 3. Guided discussions that build upon themes discussed in previous weeks, rather than essentially serving as a \"book club\" for one week's reading. Weakness: 1. Lack of feedback on paragraphs written -- not really a big deal since we discussed bibliographies and outlines, but would have been nice to get some notes on a draft.",
    "I think a lot of the things people said in discussion were often repeated\/not completely unique. The texts themselves were also often repetitive in terms of the historiographical ideas they conveyed. Prof. Rosenfeld did a good job structuring discussion, but I don't think significant time was allotted to discussing the final papers (worth 50% of the grade) and various experimental approaches that we might take in writing them. As someone who hadn't ever written a paper of that kind before, I felt like I was sort of improvising throughout the writing process. As we had no other graded assignments, I was unsure of Prof. Rosenfeld's expectations. However, this may just be how history seminars are conducted."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student, especially someone interested in how history is written and how we define what qualifies as historical writing. It is also a great opportunity to take on a challenging paper, coming up with a topic that is outside of the box and might be more difficult to pursue in another course. The seminar itself was also very well led -- Professor Rosenfeld balances appropriately between all students, creating a friendly atmosphere. Conversations prove productive, as, generally, all students attempt to build on previous statements. Really a fantastic course with an exceptional professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's good to take something experimental and practice oriented. Most seminars you can take will throw you in depth into history itself. Few will teach you so much about how to write about it in an interesting and compelling way. Even other professors who gave me advice on improving my writing style never offered such an interesting look at the structure behind, and how it can shape an argument.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in the process of creating history, not just consuming it. Professor Rosenfeld was fantastic at illuminating the creative process, both by looking retrospectively at books already written and published, and prospectively at our own papers.",
    "Most definitely. For history majors, this course is a great way to learn how to think about one's area of interest in an original manner. For those looking to get the writing credit out of the way, this is a great opportunity to dip one's feet into historical modes of thinking.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend it. It's a different way of engaging with historical writings and provides a different perspective of what it means to write history in general. Plus, it's an overall enjoyable class with Professor Rosenfeld who's a gem.",
    "If you like historiography, this is a good class for you. But if you don't, I probably wouldn't take it."
