   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to any student interested in the cellular and molecular basis of behavior.",
    "I would say that it is a useful class to gain basic knowledge about the brain from the cellular to circuitry level. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a neurobiology course that explores various aspects of neurobiology from the cellular to the systems levels. The course only requires very basic physics and it is appropriate for both undergraduate and graduate levels. I would highly recommend this course to those who have no previous neurobiology background or only a basic neurobiology background. The course is very well taught and the textbook is very informative.",
    "I think this was a great course even for those who have never had a course in biology. The material was taught in a fast pace but it was explained well enough to grasp the key concepts. I would strongly recommend the lab along with the class since you can see the practical side of the concepts presented on the board and in the textbook.",
    "An excellent introduction to major principles of modern neuroscience. Covers the breadth of anatomical organization levels. Has the right mix of quantitative description (i.e. single neuron membrane electrophysiology) and qualitative description (i.e. synapse development and refinement).Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "The course gave me a good foundation in cellular\/molecular neuroscience, which is useful for investigations of systems\/behavioral-level issues.",
    "It gave me good basic information that I did not get in my undergraduate university because I was not a neuroscience major.",
    "The class provided a great overview of neurological systems, especially neuromuscular interfaces. This will prove very vital in my future work and research at Yale. The Lab course (MCDB 721) showed the practical side of the experiments performed by the researcher who were referenced in the textbook.",
    "The course helps me set a good foundation in neurobiology. I can build from materials learned in this course in my more specialized studies later on as a Ph.D. student."
