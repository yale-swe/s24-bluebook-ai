    "7.b. I would just like to comment on how useful Adrian Cerezo was as a TA. He is truly brilliant and an asset to both the class and the school.",
    "I love Dr. Kellert as a person and scholar, but Tuesday classes consisted of him reading verbatim from a text, and I think this really took a lot away from the class. This is not a professional style conducive to student learning and being engaged with the material. Overall, Dr. Kellert is a great and attentive professor and it is a shame that FES is loosing him. Half of my field of study's curricula is gone once he leaves.",
    "It's unfortunate that Kellert was so checked out of teaching that he used this class solely to get feedback on his book. He just read excerpts from his book at each class, and then would rarely show up for discussions, leaving those for Adrian to lead. Kellert was a big draw for me coming to Yale, and it's a shame that he's the only one teaching this subject and could apparently care less about teaching at this point.",
    "I loved this class and it was one of the few here at FES that really stretched my brain.",
    "I think other MF students would benefit from this course, as it puts our task as a professional forester in perspective."

FES needs more classes like this.. we are fragmenting courses and fields of study and moving into disciplines rather then interdisciplinarity. FES needs to wake up and be more progressive.",
