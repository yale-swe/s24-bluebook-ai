    "Take it! It's a great way to improve your writing skills.",
    "A fantastic exploration and training in writing narrative essays. A good introduction into whatever future writing you may want to pursue. TAKE IT.",
    "If you like reading and writing non-fiction essays and if you are willing to put in the effort to write an essay every weak, simply put, this class is for you.",
    "I loved this class! Each day was a thorough discussion of a selection of modern essays. Voice and style were both focused on heavily, and I certainly grew as a writer throughout the semester. If you're just looking to improve your writing, this is a wonderful class to take--you'll get helpful feedback from both your instructor and classmates.",
