   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in Exoplanets, Black Holes, and Dark Matter, but who does not have the mathematical background to pursue these interests more seriously. It gives you a solid understanding of the phenomena, methods used, and direction of current research. I am very glad that I took this course and I would recommend it highly.",
    "this is the easiest class ever. you'll probably feel really dumb, but you'll get a SC or QR so....",
    "It's clear and easy to understand. The slides could have been more comprehensive though. Stuff come up on the exam that wasn't covered in lecture, like the HR diagram. But overall, if you know basic physics your grade in this class is secure.The scientific papers were good. Though sometimes we're not sure how much to read for it. What happens when you have a 30 page science paper and not enough time? Of course you skip it. But I realized this didn't really affect my exams.",
    "If you're looking for a SC or QR, TAKE THIS! It's not a gut, because it's actually regular work and the material can be hard if you don't study at all. But the professor is fantastic and the support system is very strong with the TAs, and the material and exams is very fair. I would definitely recommend - my first foray into science at Yale as a sophomore's verdict not bad!",
    "If you're a humanities major looking for a science credit, this is not that bad, definitely a gut. I attended approximately 1\/2 of the lectures and aced all the tests. However, I would not say it's painless. The lectures are painful, the homework is a burden, and everything feels unnecessary. I would recommend taking a class you actually have an interest in. At the end, you feel like you need to purge your brain of all this unnecessary information clogging it up.",
    "Great course. I would've liked a little more scientific rigor and time in the observatory but it's mostly for non-science majors.",
    "I think this class is a great way to get a science or QR credit out of the way. Easy, weekly problem sets, two midterms (the one you do better on is weighted more, so it works in your favor) and a final. Professor Fischer is really nice and is happy to help you out. There's no textbook, so the concept-based part of the course is really straightforward, directly off the powerpoints, and the QR part of the class is easy if you like math!",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a straightforward QR or SC credit that covers fairly interesting material. You don't have to know much math or physics going in, since all the necessary information is presented in the slides, and the math involves plugging numbers into given equations. The course didn't blow my mind, but Professor Fischer is very sweet and helpful. You'll learn a little bit about exoplanet detection, black holes, and dark matter over the course of the semester.",
    "Highly recommend taking it. The material is extremely fascinating, and you will learn a ton.",
    "Solid science\/math credit for humanities types, especially if you have an interest in the material anyway.",
    "Exoplanets, Black holes, and Dark matter",
    "Fascinating material that is presented in a very comprehensible way! Prof. Fischer is amazing--Her enthusiasm is infectious! It was fun to go to class to hear her talk about a (really cool anyway) field that she's so passionate about. She's also very conscious about the different math abilities in the classroom, which is helpful. The work is very reasonable.",
    "A great choice for a science credit. By no means a gut, though the workload is light (just a weekly problem set, two midterms, and a final; no readings, etc). Prof Fischer is really engaged and a lot of fun, if a bit aloof sometimes.",
    "If you're passionate about astronomy already and have a solid science background, take it by all means because the course material is very interesting. If you're taking it for a science credit, don't.",
    "Astro 160 is well thought but the more you go deeper into the material the more you become skeptical of the facts thrown at you. At times the whole course seems a collection of conjecture and speculation that are bound to change in a year or two. It's also not necessarily the easiest way to get a science credit.",
    "If you are interested in black holes, exoplanets, or dark matter, it's an awesome class. I would recommend it, but with the caveat that it is not an incredibly structured class--which can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the type of learner you are.",
    "Astronomy 160 is fun and interesting. Problem sets are not too long and are helpful for exam preparation. Sections are low maintenance and very helpful as well. This course has the opportunity to go to the observatory which I think everyone should do at least once in their Yale career. If you have the time to take this class and you are interested in Astronomy, I would absolutely recommend it. This would make an excellent fifth class."
