Chad is a great professor and mentor in the program, and having access to him as a resource through this course is a great benefit. The course itself will not challenge you and you can fly through it unless you choose to delve into the material. Chad's overall purpose for the course is very worthwhile and interesting.",

    "The course content is great. Lots of resources were discussed and spoken about.Prof Oliver is extremely knowledgeable and super helpful with presentations and exercises. He is also accessible and provides real world knowledge that is great in context.For the exercises, we had a second chance to make up for any mistakes the first time we submitted our work so that was a good learning platform. With feedback, I was able to understand where I had missed key points and able to add that later.",
    "The lectures and PPTs were well prepared and delivered with expertise.",
    "The best aspect of this course was the exercises, particularly the Exercise 2 and 3. Those exercises enabled us to focus on a particular resource and increased our understanding on the resource. I was able to learn the present condition and to make a projection on that resource. The exercises also served as a meaningful learning for presentation.",
    "The part of the course I found most productive were the two required presentations you do on a topic of your choice. It is great to be 'forced' to practice presentation skills and nice to be able to study basically any topic you wish.",
    "Focusing on the future state of a resource",
    "The 2nd and 3rd projects allowed a lot of independent application of your own area of interest.",
    "Despite their dry tone, I really enjoyed the lecture and the overview it gave of global resource issues. Chad's stories are great and really ground the information he is teaching. The final student presentations were really fun to listen to as well.",
    "Able to learn some basic fundamentals of global resources and to some extent how to manage them.",
    "The resource projects were the best part, since we got to explore something deeply on our own and present our findings to the class. It was a really fun project that taught me many things I didn't know, and tested my ability to data mine, present data, and explain it to my peers in a meaningful way. Most students displayed real improvement between their two presentations, which was exciting."
