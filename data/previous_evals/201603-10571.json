    "I learned Chinese vocabulary and sentence structure and greatly improved my writing ability. I also learned more about the Asian American identity.",
    "I learned about Chinese traditions, customs, and habits in moderate depth as well as insight into the modern American Chinese era.",
    "My Chinese improved.",
    "Chinese grammar and vocabulary",
    "Great Chinese language course that taught and corrected many of my past Chinese habits. The heritage track is very excellent for learning Chinese in a formal setting.",
    "I developed my ability to read and write Chinese, particularly in terms of grammar. I also improved my pronunciation and learned more about Chinese culture.",
    "I deepened my knowledge of Chinese grammar and vocabulary and learned to speak with greater clarity and proper pronunciation. I also learned more about traditional Chinese culture and etiquette, which I appreciated since it isn't really practiced in my household. I enjoyed how varied our class topics were and how we were able to present to our peers in our two projects. It made me appreciate Chinese more as a language and as a conduit for my heritage.",
    "I learned a lot of new Chinese characters and learned a lot of grammar structures to improve my Chinese, allowing me to express more complex thoughts both in writing and in speaking. However, as I try to consume different types of media in Chinese, I know that I still have a ways to go."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was very well structured. Though the class had a fair amount of work, the intensity of the work allowed students to greatly improve their Chinese speaking, reading, and writing abilities. I would have liked more opportunities for practice speaking in the course.",
    "This course has great potential to improve one's reading and writing skills; the daily quizzes and focus on grammar really encouraged vocabulary retention. There could have been improvement on more oral work; a lot of oral speaking was based off memorizing and repeating sentences from the text instead of incorporating vocabulary into conversational chinese.",
    "Strengths were that the lessons were engaging and many of them were interesting. Weaknesses were that the class seemed more interested in burning through material than actually spending time on learning material in depth.",
    "It's a strong course that requires a lot of work. Some of the directions are slightly confusing, but overall there is a lot to be gained from an intensive language course.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was how much you learned in each semester. Because you only spoke Chinese in the class, your speaking abilities improved a lot. And we covered a lot of grammar and new vocabulary. I think it could be improved if there was some way to keep reinforcing old vocab that we learned; because we covered so much vocab each week, it was easy to forget what we had learned previously.",
    "Strengths: - focus on learning grammar and vocabulary - careful attention to the development of all areas of language (speaking, writing, listening, reading) - transparency between the professor and the students Weaknesses: - sometimes too fast paced, I felt that we had not spent enough time on certain topics and grammatical structures",
    "Strengths: I learned new characters and improved my Chinese. I think essays were the best way to help me synthesize everything that I was learning in the class. Weaknesses: The teaching could have been a lot more effective. Homework: The homework was very short and encouraged me to quickly complete it for the sake of completing it without really forcing me to actually learn anything. \"Optional\" homework: WangLaoShi claimed that we had optional homework problems to improve our grade. But I felt as though I had to do it to improve my grade. But the biggest problem with optional homework is the same problem as the regular homework. It doesn't actually do anything to help us improve our Chinese substantially. Essays: I did not understand what I did well or did poorly on whenever I got an essay back. WangLaoShi made no attempt to expand on the content of my essays. Instead, she only made \"grammatical\" corrections. She never did anything to push me to use the new vocabulary or new grammar structures to improve the content of my essay. I feel like my writing would have substantially improved if she took the time to talk to me about the ideas Im trying to develop in my essay. Content: The \"new\" lessons written by WangLaoShi was absolutely atrocious. This is especially the case for the last three \"new\" lessons she wrote. Each individual lesson made an awful attempt at being a coherent essay. The content did not flow; it was obvious that the lesson was an attempt to cram new characters for the sake of new characters. Translation: There are entire studies devoted to translating between languages. Yet, WangLaoShi asks us to translate terribly written English into Chinese. In theory, it might be fine. But in practice, the English she gives us is designed to force us into one and only translation. As a result, I feel like Im learning to memorize specific sentences when I should be learning how to master a language. Tests: Like much of the other feedback from our work, we are just told were wrong. There is no attempt to tell us why we were wrong. It would have been nice if we went over a few commonly wrong questions on the tests. Overall, I think the biggest weakness of this class is how the class is structured to improve language. Language is thought coherently strung together by grammar to communicate an idea. WangLaoShi has forced upon us new grammar phrases that does not always allow us to express our thoughts and ideas the way we might want to. This can be seen in the puzzles questions where I have to piece phrases together to form a sentence. Rarely do we get a chance to just use the language. When we do, we don't get enough feedback to help us improve our communication."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Although I initially took the course to fulfill a language requirement, I ended up enjoying the classroom environment and content of the course much more than I thought I would.",
    "Absolutely! The teacher is very kind and caring. You will definitelt get a lot out of the course if you out good effort in.",
    "Yes, if they were really interested in Chinese and had a good Chinese background. Otherwise I would recommend a different level.",
    "Yes, this is a great heritage Chinese course. Would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to the student who is willing to put in the time. I think a lot of the course is you get out what you put in; if you're willing to put in the time, you can really learn a lot from it.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you want a rigorous, comprehensive Chinese course that will challenge you. However, if you're a slower learner, this class may be especially difficult since the pace is very quick. But you will learn a lot and Wang Laoshi is very approachable.",
    "I ended up learning more than I expected to from this class. However, please go into this class knowing that there are major problems in the class and in the style of teaching that WangLaoShi uses. 1. The workload starts off easy, but somewhere in the middle of the semester, it skyrockets and all of a sudden, it begins to disrupt the schedule that you have created for yourself at the beginning of the semester. As a result, you are forced to scramble together to finish all your work (including work from other classes). Thus, learning is thrown in the backseat. 2. Even though this course is designed to help you learn a language, please be aware that if you want to improve your Chinese, you're going to have to take a lot of initiatives. WangLaoShi is better at assigning work and expecting you to learn from it on your own rather than looking at your work and coming to tell you what you should be doing instead."
