    "Yes.",
    "If it's with John Treat take it. He is the best of the best. Avoid Zwigenberg. He's rude, he's disorganized, and each lecture with him was disjointed rambling.",
    "I don't think this class will ever happen in this way again. It was a DISASTER because Professor Treat left halfway through the semester. The subject matter was incredibly interesting but, due to the shifting professors, we went from studying cultural issues\/literature in relation to atomic bombing to a more historical memory-based approach. I learned a lot about atomic bomb literature under Professor Treat, who came across as quite brilliant if very opinionated and quite odd. Under Professor Zwigenberg we learned a lot more about the history of Hiroshima post-WWII. Had Professor Zwigenberg displayed a different attitude in class, the transition might have been better. As it was, he came across as passive-aggressive and class was frankly painful. He would ask questions that had no basis in what we had learned so far in the course, expect us to know the answer, and still wait for a very uncomfortable period of time for us to answer, often treating us disrespectfully by counting down, etc. Another example- in our final paper prompt he told us to avoid weird fonts and sizes but couldn't leave it at that, adding \"This is not high school.\" In a class with three grad students and mostly upperclassmen, this was unwarranted and disrespectful. While it wasn't his fault that Professor Treat could not continue teaching the course, it did not have to be as painful and awkward an experience in the classroom as it was with the transition. I've never had such a disrespectful classroom experience at Yale and I'd recommend avoiding his classes.",
    "Great subject matter, bad professor. Zwigenberg is difficult to understand, penalizes students for things not mentioned on the syllabus, and treats students as if they do not know how to write while not being the best of writers himself. Look elsewhere to learn about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",
    "Not enthusiastically, because the lectures and class discussions often disappointed. The readings were great though! If you're interested in nukes, might be worth taking."
