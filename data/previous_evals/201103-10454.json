    "Take this course, it is a great foundation for a career in Spanish literatura.",
    "yes",
    "It is a a great course, necessary for anyone studying literature given the influence the text has had.",
    "This is a great course for students who are interested in deepening their knowledge in Spanish Renaissance and Barroque through Don Quijote.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student because the material, however direct or indirect, will be influential in one's study of literature and approach to the study of literature. I would describe the class as an extended practice in close reading with a very rich text providing ample opportunity for personal interpretation while exposing one's self to the interpretations of other scholars.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It was one of my favorite courses."

   "comments": [
    "The study of Don Quijote is essential to understand the Spanish and Latin American literature after the first half of the 16th century.",
    "I'm not sure that this course directly contributed to my dissertation or research at this point in time. It has, however, opened up a variety of new ways of looking for important details within literature. The course's emphasis on reading other critics' opinions and writings about the Quijote have been supremely influential about how to break down the text for analysis as well as develop my opinions about what I saw in the text and where my views differ from other critics.",
    "Being as how Don Quijote is such a critical text that has influenced most other texts in the Spanish language, it has been very useful to take this course in preparation to researching texts in my main field of interest (Latin American Contemporary)."
