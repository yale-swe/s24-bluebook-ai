    "Definitely. Great course. You will form a rather intimate bond with the class since the discussions are engaging and on topics that could be a little personal if you wanted them to be.Pretty intellectually rigorous, especially with a lot of the theoretical readings. Really great intro to a whole vastly under-represented field of study and understanding literature (and how we think about gender, social relations, women).It was pretty neat to straddle the WGSS and ENGL line. The class was pretty engaging all around: in terms of material, professor, other students, readings AND assignments (which indluded a couple of reading responses and two papers, one of which we workshopped; especially since Prof. Campbell is super avaiable and helpful with paper comments, I think I developed a better understanding of paper writing).One warning: Reading solely feminist\/women authors with very radical ideas about a system I had come to revere was a bit of a shock for me during the first two weeks (and we read other authors later too), but then I completely fell in love. Def. def. consider taking it!!",
    "YES! A gem in the English department. Wonderful syllabus, and a balance of theoretical feminism with novels you never knew were \"feminist.\" Jill Campbell is one of the best professors I've had-- she's very accessible and good at mediating class discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as well as any course taught by Jill Campbell",
    "This is a fun literature class that will change your view of women and society. The work load is not overly arduous - the readings are manageable and there are only two papers. We had a great small class with lively discussion. Your classmates really make the experience. At times the readings can be dry and overly theoretical, but this is a worthwhile class for women and men alike."
