    "Overview of Global Health. Recommend for general knowledge.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Radin is awesome. If she were teaching anything, it would be worth it, but not only will you be getting a wonderful professor - you'll also be learning interesting material and themes that are important of course for public health and medicine minded people but also for people interested in religion, politics, philosophy, and ethics. The workload is very manageable - 1 exam, 1 final, and 3 short papers, and it's pretty cool that you get assigned a country to work with throughout.",
    "Pretty straight forward class, interesting topic. Don't take it if you aren't sure about it. Take it if you love global health",
    "Yes I would recommend!",
    "This course is a quick survey of the entire history of global health. The first half of the course covers hundreds of years, while the second half focuses more on particular themes that have emerged in the last 100 years or so. Joanna is such a lovely and caring professor. While history can sometimes lull you into boredom, she is always able to keep the energy up in the classroom. The workload is light, and Pressor Radin truly wants everyone to be successul and tries to cultivate a passion for some aspect of Global Health in each and every student.",
    "This great is a great overview of the history of global health. I found the topics very interesting and would absolutely recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Gives a broad historical background on health. If that sounds interesting to you, then take it. However, there is a lot of busy work. Weekly reading responses, three essays, a midterm, and a final like WHY",
    "Yes, do yourself and the organization you will work for one day (NGO, government, non-profit, hospital, UN, WHO, World Bank) a favor and take this class. It will help you be better at your job, encourage you, and give you tools that will make your work more effective.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is AMAZING!",
    "Take this class!! The topics are interesting and the knowledge gained is definitely worth it if you are interested in health or history in itself.",
    "Fantastic course, great material, and very knowledgeable\/friendly instructors.",
    "This class is GREAT! If you are mildly interested in the field, it is a great start and Prof. Radin is a great interesting lecturer. It does have 3 essays, midterm and final so it is a bit of work, but the readings every week are great, and if you like the subject you will love it!",
    "For a survey lecture course, this class is pretty fantastic. The lectures are engaging, and Prof. Radin has some very interesting perspectives. Section could be improved, but I could say that about most lecture courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're at all interested in global health.",
    "It is a fantastic class that hopefully will get stronger and be more refined over time. The papers can become annoying to write but their purpose is understood and do help with the understanding of connecting the principles to the course.",
    "Definitely take this class. If you even have an inkling of interest, it is a must take. The material is so interesting and engaging that it would be difficult to not want to take more Global Health courses. It was also very eye-opening, for me at least, regarding the situation of our population today.",
    "HSHM 212 was my favorite class so far. It is more historical than I initially expected, but it is definitely a great class. I would MOST DEFINITELY recommend it to another student because it was INCREDIBLE.",
    "YES.Really interesting material.One of the best teachers at Yale.You'll be sorry if you don't take this class.",
    "Great class if you're looking for historical context to global health. Expect to write a lot of papers on a developing country.",
    "It's a great class, take it!",
    "Historical perspective of global health and its impacts over the past 300 years. A broad overview. The readings are not all necessary and the workload is completely doable. Take it if interested in the history of science and medicine.",
    "I would recommend it to another student who's into HSHM or global health because it's exactly that and it does it well.",
    "A great historical perspective and lecture series on things that interest a certain group of people - those interested in global health. Pretty basic stuff. Not a lot of work. Fairly easy class. 3 papers, midterm and final that are easy, lots of reading, section... standard.",
    "Yes. Definitely recommended.",
    "Take this course! It's one of the best ones in the major!",
    "This was a great class- especially for the first time being taught. Some people were turned off in the beginning because Radin read her notes to the class vs lecturing but this improved significantly throughout the semester and she was a great lecturer by the end! The classes were always very interesting and well put together. You do have to type fast to keep up though!The workload for this class is 3, five-page papers which are very doable, a midterm and a final. The midterm and final are both VERY fair, and only address major class concepts. There are also bonus questions on each! I don't think the combo of papers and exams should turn anyone off. No single assignment is very large, which is much nicer in some ways than having a huge paper worth 50% of your grade at the end of the semester.Another nice thing about the class is that it is twice a week for 50 minutes+ section. The TA's are good but Jenna Healey is the best so try to get her!There are not very many global health classes at Yale, but this is a very solid class. I learned a TON and it was all very interesting, applicable material. Many people took this class after taking public health in America or Skolnik's Global Health Class (health 230)in the fall and found that it complemented these classes very well.Overall- take this class!! You don't need to be an HSHM major or pre-med to really enjoy the material.",
    "This could be a good course if you're looking at a global health career, to get some critical perspective, or just a generally good course for a history or HSHM person. It's pretty conceptual and more interested in critiques and themes in global health than on a specific series of events.There's a lot of assigned reading, but you don't really have to do the ones you're not interested in.",
    "It was a great introduction into the history of Global Health. I really enjoyed the split between the course material as well as concentrating on a particular country for our papers. I felt that while the papers weren't directly connected to our readings, the papers still allowed us to observe public health measures in a more practical sense. The one criticism I have is that the lectures didn't always connect in a smooth manner from week to week. Three papers, a midterm, and a final is a lot though, but it all covers different materials, so it doesn't necessarily drag on.",
    "This class is a really good overview of global health and its transition throughout history. It was a bit too much reading in my opinion for a lecture, but you don't have to do all of it. You are assigned a country at the beginning of class that you will write 3 papers on - one from the 18th\/19th century, one from the 20th and one from the 21st. It's a really good way to learn about the progression of global health using your own little case study. The exams are not hard at all.",
    "Yes take it if you're interested in global health! It touches on a lot of important historical themes that continue as problems or issues in global health today. I enjoyed many of the readings.",
    "I definitely would.",
    "Historical Perspectives was an overview of how the field of Global Health has developed and changed over time. It shows how historical lessons from health interventions can be applied to modern day problems and also examines the overarching question of what it means to help.",
    "This course does exactly what it promises: gives you a historical toolkit to evaluate current trends and efforts in global health. You will learn about everything from imperialism in the 1400's to modern disease eradication efforts, tracing themes that are at once philosophical and relevant, suchas, \"What does it mean to help?\" The readings are interesting and very manageable for a history class (generally 100-150 pages a week), the lectures are fascinating, and Professor Radin is incredibly committed to the course and to her students. Take it for a wonderful introduction to the field of global health through a historical lens!",
    "HSHM 212 was a fantastic introduction to the historical basis for the current state of global health. Beginning with a broad overview of how 'global health' is defined and has been defined historically, the course created a thorough and in-depth timeline for how historical events and developments have contributed to contemporary issues and challenges in global health. Though this was the first semester this course was taught, I thought it was extremely well-structured and well-conceived. The one qualm I have about this course was the amount of assigned reading each week: it was often quite unfeasible to do all of the assigned reading in a given week. Though all of the readings did noticeably relate to what was being discussed in lecture that week, the course itself could have been just as successful with a slightly reduced reading load. I would nonetheless highly, highly recommend this course for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the increasingly relevant field of global health. Before taking the course, I was lightly considering entering the field, and after taking it I have only become more sure of this trajectory.",
    "Hist. Perspectives on Global Health is an excellent class. Whether or not you are pre-med\/concerned with health issues, this class helps you to understand global health issues in a way that is both approachable and interesting. TAKE IT.",
    "This class gives you the basic theoretical ideas to understand the history of global health, and traces these ideas through a number of case studies. It is fascinating, and I certainly would recommend it.",
    "Very good class for getting a thorough introduction to the health field. The tests are very fair, and the readings, though long, are really interesting."
