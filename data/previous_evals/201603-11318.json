   "comments": [
    "A superficial understanding of biochemistry, which I'll forget in ~2 months.",
    "Honestly, I don't know how much I will retain, but generally speaking we learned about many cycles and processes in the body. The urea cycle, Kreb's Cycle, Calvin Cycle, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation, fatty acid synthesis\/breakdown, glycogen synthesis, etc.",
    "biochemistry and how to teach myself material because the professor was not good",
    "Learned about the metabolic pathways and cycles of nutrients that make life possible",
    "Deeper understanding of a lot of topics, esp. DNA\/enzymes\/metabolism. I think I'll be using a lot of this information in the future.",
    "Knowledge of metabolic pathways and their regulation",
    "I learned a lot about metabolism and how the biological molecules within our bodies can recombine a thousand times over to create all the compounds necessary for life.",
    "I learned a lot about the specific mechanisms behind major metabolic pathways, protein synthesis, DNA replication, etc. After you get past the initial hurdle of rote memorization (of structures, pathways, etc.) it is really fun to know how larger systems\/diseases play out on the molecular level.",
    "Had to memorize a ton of biochemical reactions, not a whole lot of insight. My memorization skills were definitely tested.",
    "I learned about membrane biology, basic enzyme kinetics, and a few mechanisms of metabolism: glycolysis, TCA, electron transport chain, photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, etc.",
    "This class covered a wide scope of biochemistry. I'm very glad that I took this class as opposed to the MB&B version because I felt like I learned a lot. The professor was very knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "Learned about amino acids, phospholipids in the membrane, DNA replication, transcription, translation, and metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, electron transport chain, etc.).",
    "I developed an ability to sort through an immense amount of information and pick out what is most important. That is, I learned how to first study the major concepts and ideas and then learned surrounding details."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor and TAs were significantly below the Yale standard. The lectures were often disorganized and sections are basically just the pset solutions. The material could have been presented in a better way.",
    "There is just so much to memorize that it really feels like information overload, but I do not know if there is really any way to fix this. It's bound to be a challenge no matter what.",
    "the lecture is terrible, way too fast, way too little explanation, no continuity, and no connection between ideas. tests were unfair and misleading",
    "The sections were helpful in completing the problem sets, but I wish there had been more connection between lecture, section and the HW assignments. I wish we had gone into more detail about mechanism during the course (arrow pushing, for example), I personally would have learned more that way.",
    "I wish that metabolism had more \"breathing room\" in terms of course time. The first half of the semester was very conceptual in terms of learning, but the second half got really in-depth really quickly. Still, metabolism is taught very well, and is probably the most important part of the course. You just have to keep up.",
    "Did not like Engelman's lectures -- too dense, esp for what was tested on the exam Clay's lectures were really good, esp toward the end of the course",
    "The organization of the class is abysmal. The four separate units with non-cumulative examinations discourage cumulative understanding and retention, and are almost entirely separate. It would be better to bring the units together, and perhaps have a cumulative final, rather than set the knowledge of each quarter aside as soon as the exam has passed. The practice of literally doing the homework together in section also seems like a waste of time and counterproductive to the basic idea of homework; section time could be put to better use with homework being done individually as normal. The organization of time devoted to subjects covered is also quite questionable. The entire first quarter, and almost half of the second, is basically review, and should not be necessary for a class with the prerequisites. There should be no reason to be learning basic thermodynamics and acid-base for several weeks, when that time could be to devoted to the more difficult and more valuable actual biochemical knowledge of metabolism. The refusal to test reaction mechanisms is clearly a concession to make the class easier, perhaps in response to past complaints, but it does little to encourage learning. Mechanisms are essential to biochemistry, and I usually ended up learning important ones on my own in order to understand the metabolism, where I could have benefited by learning about the mechanisms in class and on the exams (particularly if the time between subjects is redistributed, there would perhaps be room for mechanisms). As it is one can do well in the class simply by memorizing the metabolic pathways, without understanding the chemistry behind them, which should not be the goal of the class.",
    "This course was poorly taught. I felt that the instructor didn't understand how to teach the material or how to respond when students asked for help and clearly demonstrated a lack of understanding. Having a more visual approach beyond powerpoints, such as drawing our processes andhaving more rigorous problem sets would certainly help. I felt that the material tested did not always correlate with what was taught, or at least what was tested was not communicated as essential for study. I would prefer to have more difficult problem sets that were more heavily weighted, than have memorization based tests.",
    "This course goes into depth about a range of biochemical pathways and mechanisms. However, at times this class felt like rote-memorization and there wasn't as much focus as I'd have liked on placing what we were learning in context. For example, we would learn about a specific mechanism without first making it clear where it was used in the body, how it was regulated, etc. I think it is mostly the students' responsibility to say when the teacher is bring unclear or could slow down, but oftentimes the reaction mechanisms, especially towards the end of the course, were indecipherable to most people in the class. I think when evaluating this course it's important to remember that many students in it were taking it as a pre-med requirement and begrudged the fact that they were in the class. I thought the homework assignments were well-designed to help students learn the material.",
    "Pretty dull material and dull presentation of the materials",
    "I wanted to see more arrow pushing to have a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms. The course covered a good breadth of topics and was decently thorough.",
    "I think the teacher could definitely teach better. I felt like I was teaching myself biochem instead of actually learning anything in class.",
    "If you are pre-med, an MCDB major, or preparing for the MCATs, trust me when I saw take this course. Professor Clay is an awesome teacher and she is so damn clear when she teaches. She also goes at a very good pace during lectures. Also, what's great about this class: 1. Meets 3 times a week is in Watson, MWF. Each class is 50 min. long, which is the perfect amount of time to retain information. The MBB Biochem meets twice a week and you don't have enough time to absorb everything you learn in class. 2. The class starts at 10:30am, so you can wake up at 10:00am, roll out of bed, and go to Watson Hall and make it to class on time. 3. The class had around 40 kids, and is in a small hall in Watson. It's the perfect classroom setting that is conducive for effective learning. 4. There are 4 exams every 2.5 weeks, and NO FINAL. THIS IS HUGE. Trust me, you will die in any biochem class that has a cumulative final - the amount of info is astonishing. The 4 exams were not bad at all, Clay gives really fair questions.",
    "There's a ton of information that needs to be presented, so I understand the fast pace of the class, but sometimes it very much feels like it is being taught to only the top 5 students in the class. Very rarely did I leave lecture feeling like I understood what were the key points and how those key points connected. I really liked the setup of four, non-cumulative midterms.",
    "The lectures are often difficult to follow because there is so much information being thrown at students. I wish there was more supplemental reading materials."

   "comments": [
    "Take it only if you need to for MCDB or premed. Don't take it in any other circumstances.",
    "Not really. You likely have to take it though. I would have personally preferred a course that focused on many fewer topics and went much slower.",
    "never in a million years",
    "I would recommend this course. The material was worthwhile, and the presentation was solid.",
    "If you are pre-med you pretty much have to take this course. I'd take this, because it's a good challenge. You learn a lot, and the material is actually applicable in the future, unlike some other classes you'll have to take.",
    "Yes, I believe this is the easier biochem version (as opposed to MBB), but I didn't take both courses, so I can only speak to the MCDB version. The content\/information may seem like it's not very well taught, because you're absorbing it for the first time. But it really helps to go over the slides again, and you'll realize that all the material fits together like a puzzle.",
    "Absolutely take the other biochem class unless you're obliged to take this one (even if you're E&EB try to convince the DUS to allow you to do the MB&B one). Neither the class nor the professor is terrible, but the syllabus and class structure are poorly organized.",
    "I would not. Unless you have to take this course to graduate with your major or to advance to another class (I want to take immunology which necessitates this course), I would take the other biochemistry course or skip this course entirely. The material is interesting, but I learned more watching YouTube videos than going to class.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you're required to take it. Though Professor Clay clearly really cares about her students, her explanations were often rather confusing and I was often frustrated after lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who know they have a passion for biochemistry, as most of the learning takes place by reading the textbook. I would not recommend this course to students who are not willing to put in significant time outside of class to learn the material.",
    "Take it if you have to. Nothing on the 4 tests is cumulative, which in my opinion made it easier than the other biochem class, but you really just have to pick your poison",
    "The workload isn't too bad, and the grading isn't extremely harsh either. It's kind of a must-take for pre-meds, so there isn't really any avoiding it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another teacher, but they will have to be prepared to teach themselves the material.",
    "Definitely take this class instead of the MB&B biochemistry version. I was shopping both biochem classes, and I have absolutely no regrets with taking this class. In fact, I thank myself for choosing this class every single day. Professor Clay is great at explaining things (and even if you don't get it the first time, she's very patient and will take the time to make sure you understand). The class size is also smaller than the MB&B version and has fewer gunner premeds, if that's what you're looking for (and that's what I was looking for). The grading and the exams were all very fair. The TA's were also pretty chill. This was a great class, and I would highly highly recommend this (especially over the other one- I have friends who took the MB&B version who said they wished they took this one instead.)",
    "YES OMG TAKE THIS CLASS AND NOT MB&B Biochem. If you are pre-med, an MCDB major, or preparing for the MCATs, trust me when I saw take this course. Professor Clay is an awesome teacher and she is so damn clear when she teaches. She also goes at a very good pace during lectures. Also, what's great about this class: 1.

    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for fun, but chances are you have to take it, so you don't have much choice. I would shop both biochem classes offered and see which one you like better. This is a very difficult class, and you will have to put a lot of time into studying. That being said, if you do put the time and effort into it, it won't be terrible.",
    "If you are a pre-medical student or require biochemistry I highly recommend this course. Although difficult, Nicole Clay and the TAs offer an immense amount of support throughout the semester."
