    "The content is not easy, but it is valuable. Professor Plata and her TA are both very nice people and are always willing to help. So if one determines to learn the materials of this course, he or she could finally make it. ENAS 640 should definitely be a required course for all Chemical and Environmental Engineering students.",
    "We cover a specific set of methods\/techniques to learn\/understand water chemistry. It differs somewhat from other methods that are not reliant on tableau, which is a benefit and a drawback. I think those engineers interested in water chemistry and related processes should take this course because it provides part of the fundamental basis needed to understand different processes of interest in this field. One difficulty with the course was the time commitment, which is a reason I would hesitate to recommend this course to anyone that is not required to take it (you have to REALLY want to learn aquatic). My other two courses involved about 6 hours per week (each) of additional work outside of the classroom, which felt like an appropriate amount of additional time commitment (one of these courses involved lots of p-sets\/computation, the other involved heavy amounts of journal article reading and writing\/evaluation). I do recognize that working through problems is one of the most effective ways at understanding and applying key concepts, but p-sets that take 15-20 hours to complete is excessive. Maybe it is a function of my ability to \"get it\", but I know that my experience in terms of length of time to complete assignments is not unique compared to others in the class. My thought to improve this condition would be to go through more example problems\/scenarios in class and perhaps scale back the number of questions in each p-set.",
    "ENAS640 01 is a required course for every Environmental Engineering graduate student, but I am happy I took it. I would recommend it to most Chemistry students, but in most cases, it would be a required course, so it's a case-by-case.",
    "The course discusses the calculations and assumptions involved in analyzing the fate of different chemicals in natural waters. I would recommend this course to another student as it provides a fantastic overview to aquatic chemistry.",
    "Yes, definitely if that person is interested in natural water systems."

   "comments": [
    "I don't believe this course contributes to my planned dissertation research in a meaningful way. The course was good in that it introduced the tableau method, which is an approach to tackling aquatic chemistry problems.",
    "Though I work with air, there will likely be a time when knowing this material will be useful. It does not directly contribute to my research, but whether it actually does remains to be seen.",
    "As a student in environmental engineering, understanding the chemistry involved in natural waters is pivotal to my discipline.",
    "I didn't have much environmental engineering knowledge prior to coming to Yale. My research focuses on water, and this class filled a pretty large gap in my knowledge. However, I still feel like I lack knowledge in the geologic details of natural water systems, and the fate of organic molecules in natural water systems. Very useful class."
