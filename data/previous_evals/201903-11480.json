   "comments": [
    "I develop the skills to recognize different hieroglyphs and how they form words. I also came to better understand English grammar by being introduced to grammatical concepts that I did not realize existed.",
    "I learn how to recognize glyphs and construct vocalizations using transcription of the glyphs into constants sounds. I also learned a lot about the grammar and structure of Middle Egyptian language, as well as history of Egypt.",
    "I learned how to transcribe and translate basic Egyptian sentences, as well as some smatterings about ancient Egyptian culture.",
    "I learned so much from this class! We learned lots of different signs and their sounds\/meanings, and the basics of grammar from nonverbal sentences to some more complex verbal forms. Although this was only L1, I definitely learned a ton about Egyptian culture and feel like I can translate a number of types of sentences, and at least pick out individual words (like common nouns and verbs) from actual Egyptian texts, which we did when the class took a trip to the Peabody museum.",
    "I learned a great deal about Egyptian language and grammar.",
    "I developed how to analyze the different grammatical structures of ancient Egyptian hieroglyhics.",
    "How to read egyptian! (Basically)",
    "I learned how to transcribe, some important grammar, and a fair bit of translation for Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphics during this course.",
    "This was a great (and unusual) language class, that effectively taught me the necessary steps to translating Egyptian Hieroglyphs, the grammatical structures, and the history that influences the language.",
    "This class teaches you at two levels -- the Egyptian language and the hieroglyphic writing system -- and each is extremely cool. By the end of the year, we could take chunks of ancient Egyptian texts, transliterate them, and translate them. It's awesome."

   "comments": [
    "I had a hard time learning the material in lecture, so needed to read the textbook a lot. However, the midterm and final are open note (except vocabulary which needs to be memorized).",
    "The emphasis on learning to recognize character was fantastic and was paced very well. However, in term of improvement I think that attendance marking is the biggest challenge with this class. Many students missed classes this semester and as I understand that this is a 9AM, please wake up on time and attend class it really make it so much more engaging when more people are there. I think that Gaelle really tried to work with all students about attendance and also incentivizing learning the material by having bonus quizzes (an awesome way to encourage learning the vocabulary)!!",
    "Strengths: the subject material is fascinating and exciting. Professor Chantrain is knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "The strength of this course is the textbook, how interesting the subject, is, and the professor. Gaelle was so, so nice and made the class such a comfortable environment where we could make mistakes and not be judged (which is good, because hieroglyphs are hard). Also, the tests were very fair, even easy, and the homework was also never too bad and never graded harshly. This made for a great class which was not at all stressful, making it even easier to get excited about the course.",
    "I learned quite a lot in the course. The speed in which we work through the grammar is exciting and rewarding. The one issue I had with the course is how class time is used in the course. Often, we would learn slides which were nearly identical to the notes in our textbook. The most helpful moments in class were when we would work through a passage together on the board or with our classmates.",
    "The textbook and summaries are super helpful.",
    "Instructor is awesome and very understanding. Very fun and easy going atmosphere.",
    "9 am is can feel early...but ultimately I think the only potential weakness is in the course's level of difficulty. For some, it might be so easy as that they aren't incentivized to apply themselves until exams. Much of the learning\/studying is done on one's own schedules and driven by one's own motivation, although there are nightly translations that were helpful for learning grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I loved this class a lot! Lectures can go quickly, but the textbook is very informative and supplements them well. The grammar is not too hard to pick up -- the main struggle is learning the vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it only meets two days a week and fulfills your language requirement. Also, when else are you going to learn hieroglyphics?",
    "Yes. I am not much of a language person and was recommended to consider unusual languages. I am so glad that I decided to give Hieroglyphics a try. It is amazing to learn the similarities and conservation of linguistics! Also Gaelle is an amazing professor who was always willing to accommodate and work with students to maximize learning. Even though you may not use the language outside of the course and Yale, it is pretty cool to have the opportunity to take such a course as how many people can honestly say that they can read Hieroglyphics. Also, we took a trip to the Peabody and actually were able to read some of the glyphs in the Egyptian collection which was a great way to end the semester.",
    "Yep, it's a no-brainer if you don't want to continue Spanish. Fun, meets twice a week, good conversation topic.",
    "I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in Ancient Egypt OR anyone interested in getting their L1\/L2 language requirement out of the way. This is a very fun, chill L1 that only meets twice a week (!! very rare), yet you still learn a lot. Definitely go to class because it does move pretty fast once you learn the basic signs and Gaelle is really good at explaining things and making sure you understand it, but if you miss class you don't benefit from this and have to learn it from the textbook, which is doable but not ideal.",
    "Yes! Egyptian is a fascinating language that requires you to think in fundamentally different ways.",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting and unique course.",
    "Very much so! Amazing language credit!",
    "I definitely would. I loved learning an unusual language, and very much appreciated that I could apply it as a language credit. For those who don't necessarily feel comfortable with a modern, spoken language, it's a great alternative. Furthermore, although the class wasn't necessarily incredibly challenging, I still felt as if I learned the material thoroughly.",
    "I love Egyptian! A fun class on one of the oldest written languages (it could be the oldest!). Amazingly cool to know how to read hieroglyphics. Professor Chantrain is excellent. She taught at the perfect balance between practice and theory, quickly but not so fast as to leave me behind, and her side-notes make for interesting and informative discussion. She planned a trip for us to read hieroglyphic inscriptions on some Egyptian artifacts at the Peabody, and in addition to getting practice with the language, this put an image to the culture we were learning about for the semester. I especially liked how thorough she was, and how attentive she was in teaching us every detail and nuance."
