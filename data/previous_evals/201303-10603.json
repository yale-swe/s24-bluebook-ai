    "so much work. rewarding, but only if you're willing to go through daily worksheets, homework assignments, etc.",
    "I would recommend French 130--you get a good grounding in French grammar and the class is pretty interactive. The audio homework can get pretty annoying, but overall I'm glad I took this class.",
    "My section was taught by Audrey Hoffmann. It was an excellent intermediate level review of the French language. We had a lot of fun in the class as we practiced writing, speaking, and listening to one another on a daily basis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. Mme. Hoffmann is excellent, and you will definitely learn a lot of french throughout the course!",
    "All the French courses at Yale are great, and this is no exception. Like all the teachers in the French department, Madame Hoffman is engaging and enthusiastic in the classroom. I would definitely recommend taking the course: the daily requirement to speak French improves speaking skills a lot."
