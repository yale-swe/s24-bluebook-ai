    "Much more interesting subject matter than first semester, same structure.",
    "A great syllabus, great lectures, great sections: philosophy was my favorite part of DS (and I love all of DS!). I think the readings are very well chosen and the lectures help a lot to understand the readings (especially all of the three Kant lectures were really helpful).Prof. Sattler is a great teacher who will really help you understand the material and make you enjoy talking and thinking about philosophy!",
    "If you liked the fall term of DS Philosophy, you will most likely enjoy the spring term. Personally, I found the material even more engaging and relevant to my own life. You are lucky if you get Professor Sattler. She is very clear and helps you understand the material well, although her class may not be the most fun and dynamic.",
    "Excellent class, I definitely recommend it. Sharpened my thinking considerably.",
    "The second semester of DS: Philosophy seemed to do just what it's supposed to do. It gave students an important (though in many ways also understandably shallow) understanding of the most important philosophical thinkers since Descartes. The lectures varied in their helpfulness, but many did successfully aid me in coming to a greater appreciation of the material as a whole. Small-group sections then seemed to help students understand the main arguments within the great philosophical works.",
    "DO DS. that is all I can say. reading great books, and discussing them and writing about them-- this is what college is about...",
    "Many of the philosophy readings are extremely difficult to understand especially for someone who did not take philosophy in high school, so the class largely depends on getting a good section professor. The lectures were frequently confusing and often more biographical than helpful in terms of explaining the main ideas of the works."
