    "I learned French diction for the first time and solidified my German diction. We forayed into Russian diction, which was fun and interesting. I gained a good base of knowledge about the music of the four composers we studied.",
    "I learned about a selection of vocal music and composers, some french, russian, italian, and german pronunciation, as well as vocal technique. Much life wisdom was also imparted.",
    "I learned how to sing in four new languages and how to better support my classical voice.",
    "This course was fantastic for making me comfortable with IPA and generally reading in different languages. It was also extremely useful for practicing my memorization skills, which were fairly weak before this class. Also both Sara and professor Lalli were excellent critiques of my performance technique and helped me break out of my shell a lot.",
    "I learned lots and lots of repertoire, along with excellent tips on how to improve line, intentional singing of text, professional performance practice, and lots of the finer points of pronounciation in the major classical music languages.",
    "I gained extensive skills in singing and playing piano."

   "comments": [
    "Above all, learning French diction was very valuable and probably the best thing I'll take away from the class. Collaborating with Sara Kohane was also an invaluable experience; she is a gifted musician and incredibly patient. I wish that we had gotten more one-on-one coachings with Professor Lalli because he has a lot of knowledge and insight to offer on our performance. I also wish that we had learned more music history. Aside from that, I had a great time getting to sing with classmates and listen to beautiful music.",
    "Some individual sessions moved a little slowly, but for the most part I felt very engaged in the course. I was really pleased with the pacing of the language learning, which gave us solid foundations without lingering too long on anything particular.",
    "This is an awesome, awesome course. Prof Lalli is the absolute best, and you'll learn and grow so much through the semester.",
    "Strengths are the dedication of the professor and assistant."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in singing\/performing art songs. The class is fun and engaging, and you walk away with so much knowledge about the world of classical vocal music. You do have to put in a substantial amount of work into this class, but it is not typical \"homework\". Instead, it is translating music, learning how to pronounce new languages, and learning music. I would highly recommend this course!!",
    "Take this class if you are a musician. You must.",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE. It is so fun and you literally sing for credit. There is a decent amount of work in memorizing the music, especially if you don't come from a classical background, but it Ian so worth it and I have grown so much as a performer and singer this semester. Also Lalli is one of my favorite professors at Yale!",
    "This course is a great way to get experience with new languages, and to get comfortable performing on stage physically and mentally.",
    "This class is great for all levels of singer. Both the beginners and the experienced people in the class were engaged and challenged. As well as that, it's just a real pleasure to be in the class.",
    "Definitely, if you want to be a better singer and player."
