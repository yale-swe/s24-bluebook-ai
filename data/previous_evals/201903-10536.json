   "comments": [
    "Strengths: None. Weaknesses: This course was all busy work. For every single class, we would have to read a research article about a very niche area of chemistry, and be prepared to talk about it. This made it impossible to learn any broad trends present in bioinorganic chemistry, because we were just directed to focus on minute details. During class, we would not learn anything. We would just sit there while Pat put a bunch of overly complicated figures on the projector, so complicated that any point he was trying to make was completely lost. We students learned absolutely nothing. Moreover, Pat assigns two research proposals, which means we have to read at least 20 research articles per proposal to get an idea for something to actually propose. This is nearly impossible, given that Pat already assigns 10 hours' worth of reading per week, so the work just keeps taking away more of students' time, while students learn absolutely nothing in return for their hard work. The result is that students spend 8 hours per day doing work for this one class during the entire Thanksgiving break. Yes, this class removes a designated week of break from your life. Furthermore, the exams are designed to take 30 minutes longer than the time Pat actually gives to you, and there is no curve, so it is literally impossible to earn an A in this course. The highest grade anyone is earning is a B+, and the highest grade a graduate student is earning is a High Pass. So for undergraduates, this course will both teach you nothing AND lower your GPA to a number that will lower your odds of getting into graduate school. This course was awful beyond repair. It should not be offered again in the future.",
    "A high workload, but it ultimately pays offs and translates into literacy in bioinorganic chemistry through articles and research topics.",
    "general strengths - student engagement encouraged. As frustrating as the time commitment for the presentations was, it was good practice. I liked when we practiced things on the board in class general weaknesses - too much busywork. I felt like I was in highschool again with all the assignments and quizzes. Reading a chapter of the textbook and a paper is too much. It got very frustrating to have to put other classes aside in order to complete the assignments for this class. Many of the papers didn't necessarily feel very relevant to what we were learning in class. It would be much better if you assigned maybe one reading per week, because then I would actually take the time to read it carefully. I stopped reading the papers carefully after the first couple weeks. Spectroscopy - it was emphasized that characterization techniques were the most important part of the class. And I agree, they should be. But we were rarely actually taught how to look at spectra. Pat showed us spectra, but would fly through the slide so fast I would have to idea how he got the information from the spectrum. It would have been helpful to spend more time on them. I'd recommend having a whole unit on spectroscopy at the beginning, with a problem set that has spectra that you have to interpret. That way we'd feel more comfortable looking at spectra while in class. the midterm - the grading was a little unclear. A few times I was penalized for not providing an explanation for my answer. However, most of these questions did not ask for an explanation. When the question did ask for an explanation, I provided one. In the questions where an explanation wasn't asked for, I chose not to provide one because of the time constraint and the fact that I didn't know that an explanation was necessary. It was a little frustrating to see that I lost points not necessarily because of a lack of understanding, but simply because I didn't know to provide extra information.",
    "You learn a fair bit about techniques, improve basic scientific thinking, and learn how to write proposal ideas. I liked him as a teacher but be cautious taking this course with Prof. Holland. He insists on giving what amounts to busy work (daily readings + quizzes) over content which is never tested and partially touched in class. What we do in class often focuses on fundamental chemistry and physical techniques. This feels like a pain when you have multiple other classes to study for on top of other activities. What's worse is that these assignments are worth such as small portion of your grade, but you still HAVE to do them. Why? Holland is one of those \"good work gets a C\" type professors who grades fairly harshly. Going into the final, the highest grade someone could feasibly get in the course is an A- provided he didn't intervene and move the curve. He has no issues giving Bs to most people. While this is OK for graduate students, being this obstinate with undergrads is an issue. Let's not kid ourselves: an undergrad taking this class is probably academically oriented and is looking to do well. When GPA determines undergraduate awards, grad school, distinction, Latin honors, etc... giving a student a B(3.0) for great work in a grad class when the average at Yale is ~3.5 is not only ignorant but can also have other consequences down the line. I actually prefer harsh grading as it provides more useful feedback. Since no one else knows he grades hard and that isn't how its usually done at Yale, the net result is a low score on a transcript for a class which requires a fair bit of effort- wonderful."

    "No. This course was horrible. All assigned reading is just busy work that will teach you nothing. Pat does not teach you anything in class. He just talks about some new results that his colleagues got, but without giving his students any basis for understanding what those results actually mean. His exams are unfair, as they require more time than he allots to finish them, and they are not curved, so it is impossible to get an A in this class. Signing up for this course means spending 15 hours per week outside of class doing some sort of work, hating yourself, and being told \"you're not good enough\" when Pat just hands you a B in the class for all your hard work. This class is a complete waste of tuition, time, and energy. This course should not be taken by anybody unless an instructor who is actually competent (i.e., not Pat) is teaching it.",
    "for an undergrad, probably. But a grad student maybe not. The time commitment for this class was way more than other grad classes.",
    "If you like chemical biology\/MB&B or inorganic chemistry, this class is a good extension of your understanding. HOWEVER, based on circumstances I wouldn't recommend it to some people- especially if Holland is teaching it. You learn, but the busy work is annoying and the grading can be deadly for undergraduates, especially the ambitious kind who might consider this course. If you have any sort of high energy\/ high time commitment activity to focus on this semester, this is probably not the best elective for you. While good activities, the proposals can suck a lot of time if should you lack preparation or have a tough topic. If you can get over that and don't have to worry about grades, certainly consider it. I improved as a scientist, and I'm sure you will to."
