   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in art, its history, and its composition. A basic knowledge of art history is helpful, and I would not recommend this as an introductory course. For someone with an artistic or art historical background, it's the perfect class. It's a convenient mix of theory and practical knowledge, and does a lot to work on the close observation skills that more theory-based classes do not touch upon.",
    "This was a really interesting and informative class. Although some sessions feel really long, many of them are very hands-on or interactive, and I felt like I learned a lot. I felt a bit overwhelmed with the long assignment, not being an art major, but I found most of the classes very interesting and easy to listen to. Also, other than that assignment the workload was light. Overall a very useful class if you are interested in the art world.",
    "This class is a great introduction to all types of conservation. It's easy and there's hardly any work, but the class is never boring. We were exposed to so many of Yale's amazing art resources, and I would definitely recommend this class for any art history or studio art majors.",
    "A class that teaches you about the physical aspects of art and its conservation, wonderful.",
    "it's an easy class without too much work that will really change the way you see a work of art of any age. a must for art history majors!",
    "YES. If you are at all interested in painting, or just in general how things are made, take this course. You will start looking a things in a very different way. Also, the workload is VERY manageable (read nonexistent= one paper, one other exercise, NO final paper, NO final)."
