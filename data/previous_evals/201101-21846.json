   "comments": [
    "It was very interesting, but for a lab, there were no specific objectives or things to do and accomplish. we werent searching for anything, we were appreciating diversity.",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT.",
    "Yes. Even if you don't have to take the lab with the lecture, the lab definitely lets you actually see animals and plants that are just talked about in lecture. It's fun to look at various animals during class and it really makes you want to be an EEB major. You get to go to the greenhouse and the Peabody museum which are really fun trips.",
    "Take it! Lots of fun, good group of people. But it's all about diversity, so don't expect this to be a lab of breakthrough ideas.",
    "If you're going to take a lab, take this one. It's fun, interesting, and you will look at nature differently.",
    "Basic biodiversity lab. Labs each week are slow but not challenging, and more interactive\/appealing than a chemistry lab. Write-ups can be a bit redundant, but they are nearly not as long as MCDB 121L write-ups, or as repetitively technical as Chem\/Orgo write-ups. If you are interested in biodiversity or need an EEB lab, this is a good, easygoing lab to take.",
    "Great bio lab course. A lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the material. I know a lot of kids really enjoyed it (though I wasn't particularly fond of it because I got kind of frustrated with the repetitive looking and drawing).",
    "Take it! Although there is a fair amount of work, nothing is too difficult. Also, several of the labs are a lot of fun!",
    "Definitely! This is the best lab I've taken-the workload is completely reasonable and lab was never boring. If you like wading in streams and feeding tarantulas, you will like this lab.",
    "If you are interested in taking a lab at Yale, I definitely recommend this class. Out of all of the labs I have taken at Yale, it was the only one that I was excited to go to. Of course, like any lab, it can be tedious. Yet, it is taught in such a way to make you excited to learn more about biology.",
    "Yes deefinitely one of the best labs ive taken at yale.",
    "EEB is not a stressful course, but it does involve many exercises on a single day, which means for long lab hours and sometimes tedious tasks. However, all the TAs and Marta are great and make the time more fun and less lab.",
    "Folks: take. this. class. Dr. Wells is without a doubt the warmest and most enthusiastic instructor I've had at Yale, the TAs are all funny and helpful, and the work to payoff benefit is very high. Low stress, but you learn so much and have tons of fun. I didn't much like the accompanying class when I took it last year, but I'm so happy I revisited this lab.",
    "It's worth your time if you are interested in EEB. If not, you won't use all this lab's potential, and that would just be a waste for everyone.",
    "It's fantastic - I took this to complete requirements and it ended up being one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Marta is the BEST and you get to learn so many things hands-on, it's fantastic.",
    "This is a great lab! I would strongly recommend it to anyone! The labs are exciting and the professor is great!",
    "Just take it. Best lab of all time. Learn about diversity, write mini-lab reports, and Marta buys everyone ice cream.",
    "Yes.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student because I dreaded going to it and I dreaded writing the lab reports. Unless you're willing to draw in your lab notebooks for hours each week and answer questions in the lab report that are intended for third-graders in order to get a taste of a miracle berry, I would not take this lab. The take away message - that there is tremendous diversity in the tree of life - could have been taught in a much better and more concise way.",
    "The lab covers the widest range of organisms, teaching us so much about each of them. I feel like I understand all organisms a bit better now. I enjoyed the material we were presented with, and the enthusiasm of the professor and TAs :)Lab could be more organized, however. Often parts of the lab couldn't be done because a resource was missing, and we never found out until searching a while and then asking the TA.However, the lab writeups were some of the most time consuming ones I've ever done at Yale. The results section was normally just typing up what we had written in our lab notebooks (and this just felt tedious). The harder part was that we had to write elaborate discussion sections each week, which felt like an essay each time. This essay usually had to include information from outside of the lab to support it, and the fact that we had to do research on top of lab work was quite frustrating. :\/ (Although I have to admit, I learned to write them quite clearly by the end).I could spend 5+ hours on a lab writeup, and still lose a bunch of points. But a friend in another section always told me she could throw something together in 2 hours and never lose points. The big difference was in expectations for the discussion section. This could probably be solved my making the lab writeups more structured and standardized?",
    "I've heard it's better than other labs, but really it's a lot of work for something rather basic. We routinely stayed in lab for a long time, but lab reports were easy to do, and fairly repetitive \u0096 just say fish\/birds\/bacteria are diverse and amazing and you're golden! Marta is a hoot. Fieldwork labs were really interesting, and Marta takes you for ice cream afterwards. I took it for a prereq; honestly fairly painless.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - even if you don't need it for anything. It's just a great lab.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab. Lab reports are due every week, but the TA's do a great job at explaining what needs to be in them. Also, Professor Wells is amazing and really invested in making the material as fun as possible",
    "I totally reccomend it. It allows you to get your feet wet in to many different aspects of Biology. If you love nature, it's a great coruse.",
    "This lab was AWESOME. It was a great introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology, sampled a lot of subjects, and allowed you to taste exotic fruits for several hours. You get to look at Peabody specimens, explore a stream, and generally bond with your lab-mates and undoubtedly awesome TA over cool biological facts. Many fun videos were watched, many cool presentations were given. Lab writeups do not take long and are fun to do. TAKE THIS LAB!",
    "The lab is organized around the diversity of life. The labs themselves are pretty laid back and the lab reports and quizzes are fairly easy.",
    "An easy and fun lab! Sometimes the lab runs for too long, and there is annoying busy work both in the lab and in the weekly report. But it is fun and you get to go on field trips. The professor and TAs are passionate and really interesting. Really cater to the students. You get to play with a lot of different animals, too.",
    "It is a class that looks at all the different classification systems in great detail. I would recommend it to another student because it is interesting and laid back. However, the lab write-ups can be lengthy, and the class generally always goes to 5 pm.",
    "If you think this will be an easy bio lab to take for premed or major requirements, no. The lab reports are frustratingly long and annoying, even if you do BS most of it. The labs themselves are also incredibly long. Most of the time, you literally just look at things and draw them, or categorize them. The quizzes were also pretty difficult and counted for more than the lab reports, which makes no sense to me.bThe lab was overall just annoying, plus I was not interested in the material.",
    "This lab is awesome! Take it! It starts off a little unexciting with bacteria, but quickly moves up to tarantulas, fish, birds, and other exciting creatures. At the end, you study a stream ecosystem (fun) and do a final presentation (unexpectedly cool). The lab reports are not bad at all, about 4-5 pages, and usually without tedious data copying. Any TA is great, and Marta is wonderful. be warned, you will look at plants and animals a little differently after this lab. have fun!",
    "E&EB 123L is a very enjoyable lab course. In the end, the most important thing I took away from the course is a great appreciation for the diversity of life on Earth - the course accomplished this very well. The course is outstanding for premed students: it is a biology lab course that is not very challenging, is quite enjoyable, and has a great associated biology lecture course.",
    "This lab is very easy, fun and interesting. Please take it!",
    "This is a great lab! It is a good introductory lab to ecology. You learn a lot of material while having a great time. One of the best labs I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a fun lab. Compared to gen chem\/orgo labs, I found it to be kind of a joke in terms of difficulty. The lab write-ups are annoyingly long and descriptive, compared to those in chem, where you are asked to state your results as concisely as possible. You have to give a presentation at the end of the semester, which isn't too difficult.",
    "Although this is an intro lab, Organic Chemistry lab was much easier, much more manageable, and more relevant. EEB 123 labs would have been interesting and informative if they had not been 4.5 hours long. The labs require you to do an enormous amount of tedious work and do not teach you very much. However, Marta is a great professor and is passionate about the material. This lab takes up a lot of time and the lab reports can be tedious, so be sure that your schedule has room for it.",
    "If you are planning to the course because it's a prequisite, you're in luck! If you are looking for a science credit, then this is also a fantastic course. This has been one of the best lab experiences I've had. The course is an exciting, hands-on encounter with all of the major branches of the tree of life. It also gets you to think about major clades in the light of evolution. Most exciting of all though is the opportunity to work with the Peabody's collections and to visit and the Marsh Botanical Gardens and the Peabody Museum's research collections. Marta is also very generous and enthusiastic, she treated us all to ice cream after the stream ecology lab and gave us over 30 different kinds of fruit to taste for the lab on flowering plants.One downside of the course is that the labs are quite long, and the lab reports quite extensive.",
    "EEB lab is awesome! Take it, take it, take it! it was a great experience and it unlike any lab you have taken at Yale. You get to do things like, dissect fish and other insects, visit the Peabody, and go to Q-Pac to do some stream ecology lab. The lab is very relaxed and Marta Wells is awesome!",
    "It is a wonderful introduction and overall review of all the different aspects of EEB labs. The teacher and the TAs truly care about how you are doing and would go out of their way to help you. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this lab to another student. It is probably one of the most fun and low-stress labs you will take. The lab reports did get tedious and often took a long time to complete, but that's just the nature of lab reports. You will learn a lot about many different organisms. Professor Wells is fantastic! Her enthusiasm really makes the course, and she's extremely helpful with the labs."
