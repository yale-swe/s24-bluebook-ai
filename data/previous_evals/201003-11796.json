    "No, avoid it at all costs.",
    "A really eye-opener. Changes how you look at environmental issues and any political issue in general. Absolutely one of the best classes at Yale. Definitely take it, even if you aren't an environmental studies major. Yes you'll feel a bit out of place, but Prof. Doolittle is really understanding to those who don't have as much background on the topic as everyone else. Seminar is basically student-run however, so don't expect much out of the professor. Sometimes this is a good thing, other times its not- especially when discussion leaders are not good engagers.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a \"philosophy of environmental studies\"-type course. Definitely worth it!",
    "Yes. This class is not just a class, it is a way of thinking and approaching issues. It adds so much depth and complexity to each element of every seemingly obvious issue that you will find yourself questioning ideas you have taken as commonplace for years.",
    "Having been exposed to similar issues before, the course got a little too repetitive for me.if you aren't familiar with the nature\/culture dichotomy, with theses of marginalization and degradation, with challenges to mainstream ways of doing things, then consider take the course.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it, but ambivalently. Political Ecology is fascinating, eye-opening, life-perspective-changing material, but the structure of the class is sub-par. Essentially, this class has huge potential and is extremely disappointing in its realities.Reading load is light (60 pages a week), so students actually do it. You have to do a short (1 paragraph) reading response a week and two weeks of the semester, you have to lead discussion. You write a 12-15 page paper at the end of the class. Overall, a very manageable workload.This class has changed how I see the world because of the concepts we learned and the articles we read. But, the actual seminars were always disappointing. While Professor Doolittle is nice, she adds very little to the discussion. Two to three students lead the discussion for the entire 2 hours every week. This means she sits and listens as all the students discuss the concepts. This class could have been phenomenal if she were more invested in it and actually shared the burden of leading discussion with students. Often, we would get stuck at discussing non-points and the 2 hours would really drag on. I just really wish that Professor Doolittle would provide more of her expertise to the discussions in the class rather than let us aimlessly discuss and debate to no particular use.",
    "This class does not provide answers. It leaves you with more questions and doubts about the way you approach environmental problems. But more than 90% of my classes at Yale, it has radically changed the way I think about env. issues (esp as an EVST major). There's a lot of reading, and the class is just a big discussion every week, so the students in your class really make or break the class. Take it if you want to ask a lot of questions and have the way you think changed.",
    "This is a class that as almost student run. Do not go into it expecting to find an answer to anything- we had trouble defining even the simplest of terms and agreeing on terminology. This class is meant to broaden intellectual horizons and cause you to question everything, which can be a good thing if you are willing to keep an open mind.",
    "This is one of those courses that will change the way you think about the world, if you spend much of your time thinking about the environment. It focuses on how dominant interpretations of environmental degradation and dominant narratives of environmental history may be dead wrong. It challenges your long-held beliefs and for me was difficult to accept for a while. Whether you agree or not at the end of the semester, you'll be thinking differently. Professor Doolittle is a great seminar leader, and strikes a perfect balance of moving things along and letting students talk. The workload is not that heavy, either. One warning is that the success of the class is highly dependent on the students, as two or three lead every discussion. If the discussion leaders were consistently bad, this could be a rough course. Most were quite good this semester, though."
