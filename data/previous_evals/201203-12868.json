   "comments": [
    "The course looks a lot at literature dealing with the end of the world, an otherwise morbid subject matter if not for the quality of \"apocalyptic aestheticism\" considered in each one of the works. A great course to take if you are a German major or interested in this area of literature.",
    "This was a great class. You get to see a lot of different works - spanning a broad range of media - and have interesting, deep yet laid-back conversations about these works during class. Professor Wetters is awesome and structures the workload of this class to maximize learning and minimize stress. Take it from somebody who really didn't have to take this class and could have just as easily been the 300th body in Cold War - Visions was awesome and I really saw a lot of works that I wouldn't otherwise have seen.",
    "Highly recommended. This class is really a testament to the power of interdisciplinary education, especially with regard to the arts. You begin to see the incredible way that artists and thinkers across a broad spectrum of humanistic fields have raised similar questions (and offered similar answers) to the question of existence, creation, life, and death.",
    "I would recommend this for those who are concerned with apocalypticism and epic works."
