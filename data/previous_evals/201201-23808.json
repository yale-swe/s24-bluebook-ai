    "This is one of the courses that I spent the most time on this semester, but well worth it. While homework are long, they are useful and adds credentials to CV. Learn to manage emergencies, construct table top exercise, and also earn certificates from FEMA. Most practical course I have had in Yale so far. Able to put knowledge into practice. Would love to see emergency response\/ESF 8 public health track in the public health school.",
    "A course providing exposure to the topic of emergency planning for future health professionals; highly recommend!"
