    "A discussion of how Latin American writers' experience in journalism affected their literary production. I would certainly recommend this course, as it offers a good starting point for study in a variety of fields, languages, and time periods. The course also has a good balance of discussion of broader aesthetic movements and specifics of an author's life and work.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class to another student. The class takes an historically comparative approach to analyzing the evolving relationship between journalism and literary creation in Latin America from the beginnings of Modernism through contemporary times.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in literature, Latin America and\/or journalism. The variety of texts and authors allows for a myriad of new approaches and reflections."

   "comments": [
    "Very good diachronic analysis of a theme. Also showed the various ways in which writers interacted with social, political, and international circumstances.",
    "While the novels that we read in this course appear in our departmental reading lists, because of Professor Gonzalez's seminar, I learned more about these novels and about how to read them than I otherwise would have.",
    "The process of researching an author not covered in class and forming my own conclusions about how his work interfaces with journalism was a valuable foray into independent literary research. In addition to proving gratifying, the research experience led me to explore possibilities for future research, and I will try submitting my paper for consideration by a panel that organizes an annual Mexican literature conference.",
    "It will contribute to my future research since I'm interested in interdisciplinary approaches. I would also like to specialize in 19th and 20th century literature, so the course was very enriching."
