    "Strengths: Both theory and more practical aspects of ethics were discussed, I enjoyed the small class size, student presentations increased the amount of discussion in the classWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes all over the place and weren't very organized. Also, I would have appreciated more concrete examples, since sometimes ethical theory took over and the public health side was sort of lost.",
    "Amazing class. The professor has really put together a good class and it shows. He has really focused on ethical themes and has applied them well to public health issues. I was really impressed.",
    "The readings in this course were great! We were exposed to many different facets of public health. I really appreciated learning about the theories behind public health ethics, then being able to apply those theories in practical examples of public health practice. I really appreciated the instruction of Professor Jennings and I think the class addressed the topic in a comprehensive manner. I really enjoyed writing the papers using fiction books and information on ethical theory applications to public health. This was a very enjoyable class.",
    "The class is okay, but we it only scratches the surface of the ethical issues. We spend more time talking about Charles Dickens then we do on the questions raised by public health research.I would get rid of the two book reports and replace at least one with another public health related assignment (maybe have us respond to a particular policy or media report about it to see how its framed).Also we need to have more discussions rather than lectures.",
    "Wish we had focused more on how ethical concepts applied to public health--too much discussion of utilitarianism at the beginning. But otherwise, I enjoyed this class- felt like it gave me a framework with which to approach public health as a field as well as specifically in the course of doing my own research and evaluating the implications of public health measures.",
    "Gives students an idea of what and how ethics are considered in public health. Some bit of philosophy."

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Prof. Jennings has great knowledge of ethics, though his lectures sometimes go off on tangents. I think his lectures might be improved by having lecture slides or another more organized system. I also think more class discussion would break up the two-hour lecture format.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Professor Jennings is such an impressive man. He is so humble yet knows so much and really has a heart for students. This was a small class but the professor showed what could be done well in a discussion\/seminar style of class. This was really one of my most enjoyable classes this semester.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0great, really knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Professor Jennings always made himself available and his instruction in class was phenomenal. He made sure to make topics clear to use and explain thoroughly. In addition, he facilitated discussion very well. He made a great syllabus and I enjoyed being one of his students.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Professor Jennings tended to be a lecturer rather than a seminar leader. While he said that he would \"open the class up to discussion\" after he made his \"brief\" point, he often took the reminder of the course. I would suggest that he allow more time for discussion.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0I thought Jennings did a good job with this course- I enjoyed hearing his very intelligent thoughts on various matters and thought he did a pretty good job of stimulating discussion amongst the class.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0A wonderful instructor. Well-rounded knowledge of ethics in public health. Good teaching style. Readily available and eager to answer questions."
