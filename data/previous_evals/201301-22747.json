   "comments": [
    "A broad look at the Ramayana and its social political and ethical implications.",
    "Very low workload, interesting material. Seminar in name only - Professor Flick will go off about a topic for a while, turning it into a lecture sometimes. You get out what you put in.",
    "Good course, with interesting readings and discussion.",
    "very informative class and not too much work",
    "It's a great class, you really learn a lot and Dean Flick makes the class very interesting. Most of the grade is dependent on midterm& final papers as well as a short in class presentation on one of the readings (of your choice).",
    "Dean Flick is awesome and really laid-back. Really chilled out and open-ended class.",
    "This is a great seminar that I would recommend to anyone who is interested. Most of the people in the class are not south asian studies majors and no background in Indian literature is required.",
    "I really really liked this class. I really enjoyed hearing all the different students' and professor flick's perspective on a story I've grown up with. I also appreciate the open-ended discussions\/analyses.",
    "Great class! Dean Flick is so knowledgeable about the topic, and is an overall interesting professor to listen to no matter what he is talking about. Although I expected to come into this class and learn about the Ramayana, I ended up learning about it and a lot of other social and political issues within South Asia with a really new and clear perspective I had never heard before."
