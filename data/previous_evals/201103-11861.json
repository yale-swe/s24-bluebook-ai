    "Fantastic, but only if you are good at keeping your own schedule and being self motivated!",
    "Ok I guess. I wish I had more chances to discuss things with my advisor, but he was really busy.",
    "Yes! It's a great way of getting one-on-one attention with a faculty member of your choice",
    "Yes, do it if you can find a great faculty member to work with in something you're interested in doing specifically. Don't limit yourself to just professors teaching courses and just traditional lab research work.",
    "Writing a paper on your own is a lot more work than you think it is. Make sure you pick a topic you're really interested in.",
    "Loved the class. Learned about the importance of being independent and conducting research. Everyone should take it.",
    "This is literally whatever you make of it because you do your own research and meet with your professor according to what you and he\/she establish at the beginning of the semester. I enjoyed it, but it is not for everyone. If you want to do research on your own, you should do it--I used the work I did for my psych thesis and I hope to get distinction in the major.",
    "I would recommend this for senior psych majors who don't necessarily like the seminars being offered. You get to read about something that interests you, which ultimately makes the paper more interesting and rewarding. It's pretty easy for the brunt of the work to fall at the end of the semester, though, so if you don't want that to happen be sure to set strict deadlines with your advisor. Often you can coast for two months and then find yourself scrambling to write 20 pages -- but because the topic interests you, it's surprisingly easy to churn out more than 20 pages. Less work during most of the semester, but more work at the end. A coolchance to explore a particular facet of psychology that might only be touched on briefly in other courses. Worthwhile.",
    "Yes - definitely do it. As long as you have a topic that you are interested in and are okay managing your own work schedule.",
    "Truthfully your experience is mostly based on the professor you are working with",
    "Find a professor you respect and like and a subject you are passionate about and go for it."
