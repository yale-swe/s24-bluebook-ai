   "comments": [
    "I gained a working knowledge of basic French.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and write in French.",
    "Generally, I went from no French knowledge to basic proficiency in grammar, vocabulary, listening and reading comprehension, writing ability, and speaking.",
    "Really good understanding of the basics of the French language, how to interpret oral French and speak back, as well as how to write a little.",
    "Though the class was very rigorous, I have learnt a lot in the French L1 class. My french speaking skill did improved and my writing skills also saw improvement as well. It was very interactive class.",
    "Very solid understanding of basic french. Writing, reading, speaking and audio skills.",
    "My french speaking and listening comprehension abilities have absolutely improved at a much greater rate than previous french classes in high school.",
    "I learned SO much there is no way for me to tell you everything in 4000 characters or less. In that vein, I think that this course should be a bit slower paced. I cannot believe how much French I learned in so little time. The course is frustrating because there is so much work, but it is rewarding.",
    "I learned basic French grammar and I can now hold a relatively simple conversation in French with my French best friend covering multiple tenses. I learned to be confident when speaking and to always just give it my best shot no matter how unsure I was."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Its a lot a lot a lot of work and sometimes the number of exams is overwhelming.",
    "I really enjoyed the style of this course and how the workbook and videos worked together. I think more individual speaking practice would be helpful.",
    "The course was fast-paced and demanded much from its students, but I found these aspects fundamental for language acquisition and appreciated the wealth of resources for self-improvement through writing, reading, listening, and speaking. \"French in Action\" was a tad outdated as it pertains to modern French communication. Perhaps a new story around which to center Beginner French?",
    "This course is a very strong course for giving students a foundation in the French language. Strengths are the French in Action method, style in which students participate a lot, and organized curriculum. Weaknesses are the fact that the course moved too quickly for a true beginner and the homework assignments should be designed in terms of letting a student practice as much as he\/she\/they needs to as opposed to just completing tasks for the sake of completing them.",
    "I understand it has to be strictly french speaking class but I believe English should be used to explain some of the french terms. Lack English to explain some french words made it difficult for the most part. There should be a book that has french words with the English meaning for effective teaching and learning.",
    "I loved the immersive approach taken in this course. I also found it helpful to have various types of tasks, which allowed to develop a broad set of skills. The classes itself were very well organized and engaging, I looked forward to learning French every day. In terms of areas of improvement, I think watching videos beforehand would be more effective than trying to skim through it in the classroom. Also, more reading and speaking practice would be very useful. The speaking part of the exams was always the most challenging one and I think was not very effective in building and evaluating speaking skills as it was very distinct from real life communication.",
    "I think the French in Action curriculum is really great and the immersive environment was so helpful. It would be great if the FiA curriculum could be updated because of course language evolves but I understand that that's a long term project.",
    "Oh, la la! There are too many books and things for this course. We have our textbook, workbook, course packet (which is really a workbook), and our folders for class notes and handouts. That's a lot to carry around! I think that the French department should find a way to collate everything. We really shouldn't have to buy our textbooks because Yale owns the rights to its contents, so please just give us a pdf. The Capretz Method is a contemporary mess. The videos are out of touch. It's time to update them or move on to something new. Students spend a lot of time watching and reviewing the French in Action videos and don't gain that much cultural and linguistic knowledge from them. The Captrez method is abandoned in Level 3, so why not start early? The workload in the course is ridiculous. It makes you hate French, which is sad because it is a beautiful language. The videos, worksheets, handouts, and studying amounts to 12-20 hours a week (depending on if we are covering one or two lessons). I know many students who regret taking introductory French courses because of the amount of work and content they are responsible for on a weekly\/daily basis. French at Yale has always been infamously laborious, which is one of the reasons, so few students stick with it from level 1 to level 5. You learn French, and quickly but I owe that to my professor and my work ethic NOT FiA and having class every morning.",
    "I enjoyed everything about this course, but I think the French in Action videos we watched are incredibly out-dated and I feel like there should be a similar method of learning that doesn't require us to watch racist and sexist videos."

   "comments": [
    "Dont take this class if you arent prepared to do up to an hour and a half of work each night.",
    "Yes, I think French 110 is a very effective and efficient way of learning French and is one of the better language courses at Yale.",
    "If a student were wanting to learn French, I can think of no other pathway for proficiency. I would recommend the course, yes.",
    "Yes, if you are committed to really learning French and are willing to put in a lot of work. For students who eventually wish to become fluent in French, this course offers a very strong foundation. If a student is just looking to fulfill the language requirement and has no prior experience with French, this might not be the right course.",
    "In as much as it has its own weakness, I would recommend other students to take French class. The world is gradually becoming a global village and language would play a crucial role.",
    "Absolutely! It was one of my favourite classes at Yale so far, in large part thanks to Professor Calhoun. If you decide to take this class, I would strongly recommend taking it with him. In this class, you don't feel bored or detached from reality as it might happen with other classes. You constantly feel your progress, which is extremely rewarding. The creative tasks (writing and skits) were very fun to do and definitely helped in learning. Additionally, some students say that French is tough at Yale but I would say that if you are good at languages in general, you will be totally fine; just go to classes, pay attention and do the homework on a regular basis.",
    "This is a wonderful way to gain a basic understanding of the French language.",
    "Yes! The class was fun and very helpful. I left every class accidentally speaking french to people.",
    "If you want to learn French and have no life, then yes, take FREN 110. All the professors are great.",
    "Definitely, to anyone who wanted an introduction to the French language at a pace were you really feel like you're learning something."
