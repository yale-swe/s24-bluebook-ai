    "We read an anthology of fiction each week and write 2-3 page stories focusing on a specific skill set, usually modeled in one of the stories we read. Some of the stories are outdated, the writing style maybe not appropriate for today's audience. The class is very chill.I most enjoyed the workshop at the end, where you write a longer story of about 6-10 pages, and get to read your (talented) peers' work. Usually you can see the influence of the stories we've read throughout the semester, so everything comes together!",
    "We read great stories\u00e2\u0080\u0094and stories of very different kinds, at that\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the weekly writing assignments are always fun to attack. Professor Hopkins is willing to let us take risks with our weekly assignments\u00e2\u0080\u0094we aren't constantly worried about \"the effect of one assignment on his opinion of our writing, as a whole.\" In short: stellar stories and stellar weekly writing prompts.BUT: if you want a course that's going to rigorously improve your writing, this isn't it\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least not with Professor Hopkins, who's more likely to be encouraging than critical. This isn't a workshop course, for the most part, which means that your writing isn't going to be scrutinized the way it might be in other creative writing seminars. As a baby step into the pool, though\u00e2\u0080\u0094a means for you to get comfortable with your fiction voice\u00e2\u0080\u0094this would be a good choice.",
    "Absolutely take it. Definitely the high point of my week.",
    "I liked that this class was more relaxed so that it made a good, not intimidating environment because creative writing is a little scary and sharing writing is a bit scary. I really enjoyed the readings we did. I would have however liked a bit more in depth discussion on specific writing techniques, maybe a bit more concrete advice, rather than letting students talk and speculate for the entire class. Hopkins is funny and hilarious and I really enjoyed his goofiness in class. I love that he was so approachable and warm and not scary to talk to about writing. It was just a nice, very warm environment to write in and I'm glad it was my first foray into creative writing workshops at Yale.",
    "If you have any interest in writing, take this class. The workload is very manageable, and it forces you to practice writing and expand your experience in ways you probably wouldn't otherwise. Some of the assignments are bizarre, and they really give you an opportunity to stretch your brain and be creative. It's also a ridiculous amount of fun! The discussion is very informal and interesting, and you learn alot from the people around you. English 134 is the perfect introductory writing class, and no one should hesitate to take it.",
    "I'd recommend this course, most certainly. I looked forward to class every week and wanted to do my homework for it right away, because the work is reading awesome short stories and completing short writing prompts. It was like constructive story time. We analyzed a lot of fiction and wrote our own. You get exposed to many different styles and structures by reading published short stories as well as each other's. Recommended in a heartbeat!",
    "Of course! Whatever major you are, this is a great course to let your imagination free. You will not regret taking this course.",
    "ENG 134 is a very fun English class to take if you enjoy creative writing. There is a pretty hefty workload of readings and a short story must be written every week, but what you put into it is what you get out of it. Lots of discussions and workshops as you get to explore a wide variety of authors and their various writing styles.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a workshop where you write a 2-3 page story every week, then a final story. You read contemporary fiction, which is nice because it gives you an idea of some of the great authors working today. It allows you to explore your creativity and express yourself. It's really fun and interesting.",
    "The concept: English 120 for fiction. The execution: varies widely by section - ask around and look at instructor-specific reviews to make sure it's what you want.",
    "I would recommend the course as a good introduction to writing fiction.",
    "I would not take the class again, however, I think that my experience was colored a lot by what I wished the class had been. The readings were very good, and the writing assignments accompanied by LeGuin's book were helpful and manageable. I did not appreciate the classroom environment very much. Only the final assignment was workshopped, which was disappointing for a class reputed to help one work on one's craft. While the readings and some of the discussions got me thinking about new aspects of writing, the class was not very rigorous,and I don't feel prepared for a higher level creative writing workshop."
