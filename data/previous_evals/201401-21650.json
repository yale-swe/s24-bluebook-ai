   "comments": [
    "Not as bad as I though, being an Economics major and not a science person. Totally do-able for non-science people. Just put in the work and do well on the problem sets.",
    "Great class; very enjoyable to take.",
    "Even if you don't have to take this class for the major, I highly recommend it. The material is important for this day in age and the workload is totally manageable. Prof Peccia is hilarious and super engaging. While the problem sets can be difficult, the tests are very straight forward.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you're taking it to fulfill the requirements of the environmental engineering major. It's not really paralleled to the environment in many meaningful ways, and becomes more of a chemistry class as it wears on.",
    "This was easily my favorite course this semester. It was a true intro course: a perfect overview of each section of ENVE that wasn't made to be too difficult. The workload is very manageable and it is just an overall enlightening, fun time. Peccia is wonderful, as are the TAs. It was a nice course for my GPA as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially for non-STEM majors who are looking for an easy, interesting science credit and taste to environnmental issues. For most engineering majors, this will be an easy requirement. The workload is light and the professor is amazing.",
    "A great introduction to the subject matter with a great professor and great TAs. No stress, really cool stuff that you should probably know. A gem.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's an excellent overview of major environmental issues (water quality, air quality, etc.) and it's not too difficult. A couple people in my class were prospective environmental engineering majors, but many were just taking it because they found the material interesting. It helps to have a solid chemistry background, especially for the psets. The 2 midterms and final are super simple and straightforward. Also, Professor Peccia tells the best anecdotes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENVE 120 to a fellows student. Professor Peccia is awesome and it is a great introduction class",
    "If you are truly interested in the environment--pollution, air and water quality, and the like--you should take this course. The problem sets have a tendency of taking a while (due to Professor Peccia's requirements on how to go about doing each problem), but tests aren't too difficult. Professor Peccia is a pretty funny guy, but he has a tendency to skim over important calculation details during lecture, which can be frustrating. Make sure you have at least a decent general chemistry background before taking this course.",
    "ENVE 120 is a great introduction to the major. The class is well taught and the concepts are interesting. The p-sets can be lengthy and difficult, but are totally manageable if you work together with friends or use the TF's as a resource. The tests are very fair and much easier than the p-sets. Take this class if you have an interest in engineering or the environment.",
    "This ended up being my favorite class of the semester. It's not that hard but super interesting. Peccia is really quirky and funny though scatterbrained at times.",
    "Great introductory survey course, balanced work and learning, good way to get a sense of whether the field is a good fit.",
    "I took it for an SC credit, which I would not recommend, since the ideas are not beautiful enough to justify the workload, which is small but mundane.",
    "To a Env Major: yes its good - you really get a taste of what you would do as an env. eng. student. Not too hard of a class To a non-major: sure, take it if you are interested in it. It will be a good survey of environmental engineering, and you will get a good feel for what the discipline does without having to take any further classes",
    "Great course - Professor Peccia is really nice and friendly, material is pretty interesting and not too challenging. Workload is very manageable, although the homework requirements seem a bit unnecessary. Definitely a good introduction to what environmental scientific work might involve. To clarify though, this course is heavy on problem-solving and calculations and fairly light on theory.",
    "ENVE 120 is an enjoyable course that provides a quick look into the world of environmental engineering, while not being too demanding. Going into the class, I thought that I would find the mechanics of chemical transport in the environment (a major aspect of the class from start to finish) rather dull, but instead found myself interested in the engineering models used to describe these situations. While the first few days of discussing units and unit conversion went by slowly, the rest of the course included presentations on the research (especially that being done at Yale) and history pertinent to the topic which interrupted the comparatively more monotonous presentation of equations and other information. Professor Peccia is a solid instructor, and made the class enjoyable with the occasional tangential story. He is very approachable and easy to talk with, and is very reasonable in terms of negotiating due dates for homework or test dates. The tests are easy and straight forward as far as the material is concerned (especially if you study by redoing the homework problems). Though there are not that many problem sets (~biweekly), they demanded the most nuanced understanding of the material and did take a good amount of effort to finish. Don't leave them for the night before they're due and you'll be fine.",
    "It's a pretty introductory course, but there's no curve in the course. You'll have to get above 90 to get an A.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental science or engineering. Professor Peccia is engaging and helpful and the workload isn't too difficult."
