    "Not too useful, awful awful awful discussion time and location. Learned lots of \"how to be a scientist\" tips from Tian Xu which was inspirational, but not GENETICS. Liked not having tests. Did not like never receiving my HW back with feedback.",
    "Survey of concepts one would find useful when trying to understand history of genetics research and its future.",
    "In its current form i would not recommend this course to other students. If it was taught as more of a survey course with a little more cohesion it would have been more helpful to me.",
    "It's a course that teaches you basic knowledge in genetic studies, which is very useful. I strongly recommend it to fellow students, for it shows some amazing aspects of genetic research.",
    "it is a very good and useful course, I will certainly recommend it to other students",
    "A good course for students who want to have a comprehensive understanding about genetics. I will recommend it to another student because I have learned a lot from it.",
    "Good practical course on genetic tools for research. Would recommend to a student using model organisms or genetic tools for research.",
    "I would recommend to this course to individuals that want a historical overview of genetic approaches."

    "Learned that taking risks as a scientist is good. Did not learn anything super new by going to lecture. Mark Hammarlund and Jim Noonan were awesome.",
    "This course gives me not only the basic understanding of genetics, but also the ways to conduct genetic research and how powerful genetics is. As a student who intends to conduct research in genetic department, I think this course is very useful to me.",
    "It deepen my knowledge about genetic analysis and concepts. Genetic tools are definitely one of the most powerful tool for research. Understanding the principle is important.",
    "The course improved my understanding of all the different genetic tools available for various model organisms."
