    "The resources are great!",
    "All the expected resources were available.",
    "The resources available were adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work.",
    "Yes, the resources were adequate.",
    "yes all resources were readily available.",
    "All resources were available.",
    "The resources in the shop and fabrication labs were good. Due to the assignment schedule, all class members needed to mill their project over one weekend. This created some issues in scheduling.",
    "Yes, these resources are all available.",
    "If planned well, everything was available to us in timeframe that we needed. The facilities are simply amazing and we are so fortunate to have them at our disposal.",
    "Yes, I think it is adequate for me to fulfill the assignment. I think if the shop can provide us more materials instead of going to Hull's to buy, it will be more convenient for us.",
    "The student shop monitors are terrible. They don\u0092t show up on time to turn the power on, and they leave whenever they feel like it instead of when their shifts are up. They pretend like they know everything and they know nothing. They don\u0092t take their jobs seriously and they are useless.There needs to be greater communication between the instructor of this course and other fabrication courses and the faculty in charge of monitoring and operating the shop equipment.",
    "A second industrial laser cutter would be nice. Everything else was more than adequate.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, the facilities and faculty are amazing and contributed to the success of our coursework."
