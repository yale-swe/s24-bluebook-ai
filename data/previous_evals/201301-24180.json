   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's a great class to get a science credit and to learn interesting things.",
    "Yes. Great, fun, intimate way to get a science credit.",
    "I would recommend the course for those who don't feel very scientifically literate and want to brush up on concepts that have received some media attention.",
    "Meh class - easy Science credit but the kind that's so easy it makes you feel guilty for not being academically diligent enough",
    "I would recommend it if you're really interested in biomedical science but are not a science major. The applications to the media were really what made the class fun for me; the science was necessary for me to understand.",
    "A great way to get a science credit and learn a lot about basic biology and immunology on both a scientific level and a practical level. I highly recommend it for students who don't have much of a scientific background but still want to learn about aspects of biological science that are very relevant to society today. If you know a lot about biology already, you might not get a lot out of the class.",
    "Yes, it was a fantastic class that introduced the science behind popular scientific topics in the media and also how to assess\/ identify scientific (in)accuracy. Professor Marshall is great, and the course was a very enjoyable seminar that was a nice blend of science with its applications to the media. The course reading was very interesting and well-selected, and the workload of weekly assignments, two papers, and a final project was very manageable.",
    "I'm not sure if the class will be offered again, but this year it was a fun and easy overview of some basic scientific concepts you're likely to see represented in the media, plus a (shallower) analysis of why various media portray science the way they do. A fun science credit, and you do learn some stuff! You are also given the tools to read more if you are interested in a topic. Dr. Marshall would probably be very willing to help you explore whatever interests you.",
    "Overall, the class offered a fun way to learn about scientific concepts. I'm not sure I learned very much, but it was interesting. Instead of learning about media misconceptions of science, we just learned about a variety of concepts and barely saw how they were portrayed in the media. Dr. Marshall is lovely, committed, and very kind.",
    "Great science credit!",
    "One of the easiest but also one of the least inspiring classes I have ever taken. Dr. Marshall is nice and her lecture topics are interesting, but this is the kind of class that attracts people who don't really care about learning but like to hear themselves talk. Because the class had a large participation component, this was an especially unpleasant combination."
