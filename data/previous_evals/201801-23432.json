    "I developed an understanding of how critical human geography developed as a field, the foundational theories of early marxist and critical geographers, and how feminist\/queer, critical race theory, ethnic studies, and indigenous studies have contributed to geographic scholarship. I found the course especially useful for developing skills to analyze problems spatially -- particularly through ideas around the production of landscape and deconstructing maps -- for use in my home field of environmental studies.",
    "an overview of major concepts in critical human geography and how to apply them",
    "A good introduction to the field of critical human geography, a broader sense of geography as a discipline, exposure to authors who are not usually highlighted in Yale syllabi (people of color, women, queer authors, etc.)",
    "Learned very broadly about the field of human geography.",
    "Learned fundamental concepts in critical human geography, really thought spatially for the first time, understood how different disciplinary areas can convene via spatial concepts.",
    "I learned about the field of critical human geography. I developed working definitions of key terms from geography, such as space, place, location, locale, landscape, and contour. I was exposed to many different critical human geographers and the justice-oriented work they produce. I learned about anti-blackness, settler colonialism, migration, gender, sexuality, and education.",
    "I learned a lot about the field of critical human geography, something I had no previous experience with. I learned how to think about place and peoples experiences in particular places, and how moving geographically can modify peoples behavior. I learned how to think about physical and affective landscapes as actors in the stories that take place in them, and to ask questions about the role of those landscapes in inequalities, social divisions, and peoples ability to express their sexuality. In general I found the class extremely helpful, giving me tools highly relevant for my own work.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has a very strong syllabus and fills a much needed gap here at Yale! One of the greatest strengths was being able to work through discussions together as a class and in small groups to build our understanding of difficult theory. The book review assignments are an excellent way to engage with the course topic through material directly relevant to each student's interests and research project. One improvement idea would be to include two or three reading responses and discussion leader sessions throughout the semester. I find these would be useful as documentation of what I learned to refer back to in the future.",
    "diverse syllabus was really appealing, would like to have seen inclusion of more transnational\/non-Americentric works",
    "Laura is a great discussion leader, and really made the classroom into a nice community. I appreciated the thought that went into creating the syllabus, and will definitely be returning to it in future years. Laura also made a lot of time to meet with students and help us think through our larger goals in relation to taking the course, which was very helpful.",
    "We definitely need a class like this at Yale -- it was great to have both FES and GSAS students together thinking about space and place. It could be improved by incorporating more critical readings, perhaps. While I appreciated the discussion, it felt a little lackluster -- perhaps a result of it being a larger morning course?",
    "The strengths were a commitment to reading non-white male geography scholars, which really broadened my conception of what people in the field are working on. I also really enjoyed the small group work, which made engaging with new concepts a lot easier to do, and I think there could be more of that. Also liked the list of terms on the board.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus was amazing! Weaknesses: Maybe monthly Canvas responses could have helped synthesize key terms.",
    "Professor Barracloughs organized and methodical teaching style was very helpful. By putting key words and concepts up on the board, and theb making sure we covered those things during class, we were able to get a better and more structured understanding of the material each week. This is not really a weakness of the course, but I sometimes felt that it was not clear what made something critical human geography or not. This was partly because we read non-geographers. While I understood that the definition has a lot to do with orientation and the kinds of questions being asked, the boundaries still feel quite fuzzy.",
    "I think the assignments could have been structured in a way to help us better engage in the readings."

    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested interested in the topic from across any department at Yale.",
    "yes, spatial thinking feels applicable across so many disciplines",
    "Yes! It was well run, interesting, and a great reading list. It also brought together a really cool mix of students from across different departments, which I personally benefitted from a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students interested in geography.",
    "Yes. Anyone wanting to engage with their discipline in a spatial way would stand to benefit from this course.",
    "YES! This class has greatly influenced my thinking and methods and I am so grateful. We all interact with space and place, and thus I believe everyone should take a geography class, especially a human geography class. For anyone in AMST, geography opens up avenues for interdisciplinary, critical work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot and found the material to be presented very clearly, but with plenty of room for atudent engagement and questions.",
    "YES! This is a must take course!"
