   "comments": [
    "If you really really really want to major in econ, take it. If you're on the fence don't bother. You will hate it.",
    "If you arent good with maths or very commited to econ dont take it. It will ruin you semester",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially apossible Econ major.",
    "Take this course if you are an econ major and you have to... it is definitely the hardest econ course and it was not fun. Samuelson is supposed to be the hardest professor though so maybe shop around, but this was tough tough tough",
    "Just for your major. If not, you can do other things with the>10 hrs\/week you will put into this class.",
    "Good class, not too much mathematics without sacrificing the mathematical foundations of microeconomics. Problem sets are very long and take up a lot of time, although they do help in reviewing and reinforcing the material.",
    "The course is really heavy on the mathematical modeling, and not terribly interesting. If you're an econ major and need to take it, Samuelson is a good professor.",
    "It's really hard! Only take this class if you have to.",
    "This course is about the method for doing economics. You learn microeconomic principles from a mathematical perspective. It's pretty logical and intuitive and therefore easy, for some people, but very hard to grasp for others. Prof. Samuelson is very energetic and gives engaging and interesting lectures. Richard Van Weelden is a good TA, though other sections I've gone too were awful. The exams are pretty good - if you truly understand the material you should do fine.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need to take it. This has been the hardest class yet and unless you *REALLY* love the subject, you will suffer. Problem sets are LONG. The class is very model-based and requires a certain comfort with mathematics.",
    "Only take it if you have to. It's so much theory.",
    "This class introduces economic modeling and uses those models to explain basic microeconomics. I would definitely recommend the class--modeling the world around you is an amazingly effective way to understand how it works.",
    "If you really like microeconomics, then it's an interesting and engaging course. If not, then it's really a lot of unnecessary work that will quickly frustrate you. The psets take a while to do, and the only way to get through them is if you really enjoy the material.",
    "Don't take it unless you plan to major in econ.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are an Econ major. If you are an Econ major, I have heard that this class is much easier in the spring",
    "Yes I will. But make sure that you have a strong background in multivariable calculus. Altho math 120 is not a prerequisite, it is best that a student should have it!",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics is not the most exciting class that one can take. However, if you are an Econ or Econ+Math major you have to take the class for your major. Compared to the freshman intro micro classes, this is one is far more competitive. All the students study hard and complete their problem sets diligently, so the competition for a good A\/A- grade is really stiff.The problem sets take about 5-6 hours (assuming that you always target for a 10\/10), and attending the lectures is also really important. However, the book and the lecture notes that the Professor posts online are really helpful and they can complement for a missed lecture.The math skills required in the course, are not that high. Some multivariate differentiation, which is not that tough, and beyond that solid understanding of graphs are required. Sometimes, especially the people that have taken math beyond 118 might feel like some essential math concepts are skipped or severely simplified for the sake of making the material more accessible. These people should probably consider Micro economic Analysis.In general, econ 121 is a hard, demanding class (the first midterm is relatively easy, the second midterm much harder and the final requires really good understanding).",
    "Take it.",
    "Economics 121 is not an easy course, although it's doable for sure - the first problem set tries to scare you away from the course, but after that, you will use the principles from that first one time and time again, so you'll learn to be good at optimization and other mathematical principles used often in intermediate microeconomics. That said, some of the psets took lots of time to complete. If you don't have the time to dedicate to this course, you might want to reconsider taking it, particularly if you are not thinking about being a major. The midterms and finals are quite tough as well.",
    "Mandatory for Econ Majors unfortunately. Very boring but you have to sit through it. 9 AM is bad too. No new material from intro, just the calculus of all of it. This will make you question whether you want to continue with the Econ major for sure.",
    "Take it if you need it for the major, or if you like micro. Take this section because you will learn a lot and I hear the spring is awful.",
    "There's two sets of recommendations:If you're considering this class because it's a requirement for Econ major: Take it with Samuelson. No doubt about it.If you're considering this class because you think it will be interesting and helpful: Stay away and consider yourself warned.",
    "This class was okay. I thought the material was really dry and difficult to get excited about, but Samuelson is a good prof and he explained concepts very clearly. The hardest part of the class were the problem sets, which were usually quite difficult and were often very different from the lectures. My section was very useful and made the class more manageable, although I know a lot of people had the opposite experience.",
    "This course was a complete disaster all semester long. Larry Samuelson does not teach the material that he tests or puts on problem sets. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FOR YOUR MAJOR. It is actually a shame that this class, in which we learned nothing more than we had in introductory micro but were forced to manipulate endless number of equations, is a requirement to be an economics major. I feel no better off having taken the course and probably could have learned just as much searching econ terms on google for a couple hours. The problem sets in this class were a royal waste of time and seemed to be just an outlet for Larry to show us how smart he is and how difficult he can make an assignment.",
    "Only take it if you have to. If so, try and take it with another professor.",
    "Econ 121 can be tricky but you actually learn to derive fundamental principles that are simply given to you in intro econ. Samuelson's a good professor but he always tries to throw in a curveball on the exam that's only tangentially related to what we learned in class. The curve ends up being really nice.",
    "Hard, but not that hard. Wish the curve was more transparent. Make sure you brush up on multivariate calculus before the class, and try to go to lectures, but that's not necessary to understand the material for the class. Problem sets were annoying on Sunday nights, but find some friends to work on them with.",
    "Umm...well, if you are not a major I don't see why you should be taking this course, it's not pleasant. If you are not great at math, it may be your hell. But if you are a major, you have to take it anyways, so you just have to suck it up and get it over with. Unless you are willing to take it in the spring, which is easier.",
    "Yes for Econ majors. No for non-Econ majors though. It is very specific for economics training and doesn't really increase one's knowledge of general economics. Even though this is a core class for Econ majors, it definitely could've been more tedious. The problem sets were pretty long but they were very helpful for reinforcing topics taught in class. Samuelson is a pretty good lecturer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, because it is a good challenge without ever being impossible. The main difficulty was my lack of instruction in Multivariable Calculus. However, everything that was necessary was clearly explained in lecture and section. This class really provides the reasons for why the principles taught in introductory economics are the way they are.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major. It is a lot of work. A lot of math and even if you manage to do well in the class because of the enormous curve, you probably will never understand what any of it means.",
    "I would not. Its a waste of time for real world living....along with most classes at Yale.",
    "Econ 121 is a course that goes into micro econ in depth. I would recommend this to another student if they were an Econ major, and if a student was not an econ major and they were interested in the subject, I would suggest taking the course Credit\/D",
    "If you need to",
    "This course is interesting if you make it interesting and actively think about the material for yourself. Neither lectures nor section are particularly fabulous. But the material is cute. Problem sets are a way more math-heavy than is particularly useful. Take this class if you have to, if you like the material or if you like applied math.",
    "I would only recommend this class if the student is very interested and well-versed in economics and mathematics, or is an econ major. Not worth the grade-slaughter if you don't love the material.",
    "Difficult, but not as bad as everyone says it is. Just study hard for the exams.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. Good overview of the material with a good professor.",
    "Kind of a difficult class. Make sure you keep up with the material and fully understand the homework.",
    "Under no circumstances should you take this course unless you are using it to fulfill your economics requirement or are looking for a class with mathematical economic theory.Professor Sameulson is a good professor, and I appreciated the effort that he put into the class. He is one of the best economics lecturers I have had at Yale; he tries (and almost universally succeeds) in making the material clear by posting the slides online before the class, going slowly though lectures, and frequently pausing for questions, which he answered without being condescending. In questions emailed to him, he was quick and cordial in his responses.Where Professor Samuelson failed was making the material applicable to real world situations. While he would provide occasional examples during lecture, the material rarely came across to me as anything but theory and math, especially the work on the problem sets. Be ready to calculate infinity Lagrange multipliers and perform countless optimizations that are altogether meaningless.",
    "Real interesting class if you want a challenge.",
    "Econ 121 is boring and its not easy, but if you are an Econ major you have to take so just get ready for really tough, time consuming weekly problem sets. The curve for the midterms will help you, but you will often find yourself attempting a pset or midterm question and having NO idea what you are doing. Prof Samuelson is very nice and understanding, but has high expectations. Also, it was offered at 9 am when I took it... made it pretty rough to stay awake through it, but the professor is good, so it might be worth it. Make sure to get a TA who speaks English and explains things clearly - I definitely shopped many sections before choosing my TA, best decision I made.",
    "Although this class was very difficult (and the exams sometimes threw some curveballs), I felt that I learned quite a lot that will be useful in upper level classes. I don't know about the other professor, but Larry Samuelson was good.",
    "Honestly, I would go for the spring option. I cannot imagine that it is any harder than this class. This class was a ridiculous amount of work (the psets are absolutely insane in the end), and the material is very mathematical\/technical but not very relevant. Even if you are an econ major, you will probably really not like this class. Also, be sure to get a TA that is good.",
    "Great class if you like the concepts of economics. Though it is a lot math, the math helps to elucidate economic principles on a deeper level than that which is possible without the math. Professor Samuelson is a very clear professor. It's not easy, but it's worth it if you enjoy economics.",
    "If you are interested in economics, this is an interesting class, but be prepared to work a ton. The problem sets are sometimes nearly impossible. The tests are incredibly challenging. And you move at a pretty fast pace. Make sure you have a good background in math, because you need it throughout the course. Warning: the TA's were not that great. I guess that changes everyyear, but make sure you take it with some friends so you can work together on problem sets. I can't imagine taking this course on your own.",
    "Basically intro micro except harder and with a lot more and going more in depth into every subject.",
    "Well, if you're an econ major, you don't really have much of a choice, and this class with prof. Samuelson is arguably one of the more accessible of those choices. It's a lot of work, and the problem sets are long and tedious, but overall it's manageable. Think of that Yale econ degree you'll be getting at the end of college, and plow through! It's worth it.",
    "class is intro concepts with a mathematical empahsis",
    "I would recommend this class highly if you need to it as a pre-req for another class or to fulfil your major. Professor Samuelson is a really nice guy, knows his stuff and isn't averse to answering questions during lectures (rather, he encourages them). Class is enjoyable and you learn a lot about the basis behind solving math-based microecon problems. I would not recommend this class to those looking for a \"fun\" class as, outside the major, there is not much you can learn from the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're pretty sure you're going to be an econ major (in which case it's required). It's good stuff to know if you're going to be pursuing econ, but it's not fun; nor is it useful stuff to know in a broader context. I took it first semester of freshman year... do not make the same mistake. Take a class that will make you like econ first.Samuelson is a great teacher--engaging, friendly, and accessible. He's a good lecturer. However, his lectures don't prepare you to do the homework, so expect to do a lot of figuring stuff out on your own (luckily there's a lot of tutoring resources available).",
    "Take it if you have to or are interested in econ, otherwise don't bother.",
    "This class uses a lot more math than the intro as a means to explain different pricing\/policy\/firm\/etc. decisions. I would recommend this for EPE majors (who must choose between this or Theory), or for anyone with an interest in figuring out the different benefits\/impacts of different economic decisions.",
    "Just take it if u need to!",
    "Only take it if you are going to be an econ major, it's a very hard class.",
    "Although I have heard bad things about this class, I didn't think it was so bad. Samuelson teaches the concepts well. The problem sets took awhile to do but most of the time he walks you through the steps you need to take so they're not too horrible.",
    "Recommended! ECON 121 builds on what you learn in intro micro. You learn a lot of technical tools and you learn about the foundations of micro. The course was pretty theoretical at times, but I think it's important to understand the theory. (If you don't understand the theory, then you won't know when you can apply economic models. So there are practical reasons to learn the theory.)",
    "It's a required class for Econ majors, but it's not too bad. Samuelson does a pretty good job teaching the material.",
    "Tough course. I would not recommend this course for non-econ majors.",
    "Take it. If you are an econ major, it is one of the better econ courses at Yale. If you are not, then it will still help you since the course makes you think like an economist. Problem sets are a bit challenging, but you can work through them if you invest enough time.",
    "Economics 121 gives a detailed look at the concepts presented in Economics 115. It requires an amount of work comparable to other Yale courses. The course is very interesting, and as an Economics major, I know I've definitely improved my understanding of my chosen field after taking this course.",
    "Yes. I recommend it to other students.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking econ 121 in particular unless you have to take it for econ major.",
    "If you don't have to take this class, don't.",
    "You will take it only if you're majoring in Econ. It's a good course but needs a lot of work.",
    "This is a truly excelllent course that is hard to get excited about, so it doesn't get as many raves as it should. The professor is excellent. If there's an ideal way to teach math-y stuff in a giant lecture, he has found it. He takes a ton of questions, is responsive to them, and explains things very clearly.The course itself is not totally easy, but it's way easier than I expected based on the reviews. Honestly, you just need to pay attention and you'll basically get it. Content-wise, there's some interesting ideas about risk aversion and the value of life, and a lot of repeat of past econ courses. The thing you gain is an ability to actually model the ideas, which makes them clearer and more precise (in my mind at least). Overall, I highly recommend this course!",
    "Take it only if it is required for your major.",
    "I would recommend Prof. Samuelson's Econ class mainly because of the professor. I liked Samuelson a lot and he made the class definitely manageable.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, a lot of work, every week.",
    "The class felt very disjoint, as though we were learning random topics that were pertinent to the course in a very non-formative manner. By the time the final came around the material that we learned in the first part of the course felt very distant and irrelevant. The material is presented in what feels like a very comprehensive and rigorous way, but it doesn't feel like you come out with much that has made your knowledge of econ more rich. Also, the 10 longest problem sets I've ever done.",
    "Challenging. I would recommend this to a student planning on majoring in Econ because it is one of the requirements, but otherwise I would not recommend it. Be prepared to spend long hours doing the problem sets and possibly attending a few tutoring sessions on top of that.",
    "Pretty hard but managable, if you have to take it being an econ major, take it, if not, maybe not since it just adds math to the intro material.",
    "Economics 121 is useful in evaluating econ in the world, i.e. taxes, preferences, behavior. Very logical. I would recommend this course to another student. The material we cover is good to know regardless of whether or not you're an econ major. However, the problem sets can get pretty difficult. Try to get a start before going to section, so you can ask specific questions.",
    "Only take it if it's required -- that's what everyone else in the class is doing it for.",
    "Thiswas a class that uses limited calculus tools to solve similar intro microeconomics topics. However, the material goes at a much deeper level than the intro course, and the problems are subsequently more difficult. The tests were difficult, but the curve is nice. I felt though that all I learned was to solve a couple of problems, and I don't think the material really came alive for me. That being said, I did like how it taught me a new way of thinking: the need to optimize utility given certain constraints.You have to take this class or micro theory to be an econ major. If you want the easier class, take this one. It is not that easy, though, and requires much work.",
    "The problem sets are really, really long and the lecture is at 9AM. Just consider that before you decide to take this class.",
    "Intermediate microeconomics is inherently dull. It's a multivariable calculus approach to questions broached in introductory microeconomics, and as such, can be tough to sit through. The material is harder, less interesting, and seemingly less relevant than the stuff covered in intro. It's only value seems to come from instilling in one a mathematical approach to economic questions.That said, professor Samuelson is about as good as it gets. He's clear, concise, helpful and generally excellent. If you have to take this class (and, all told, anyone who calls themselves an economist should), there is no better professor to take it with. He's really as good as they come.The problem sets are very, very difficult. The TA's are essentially useless. Don't even bother buying the textbook--you won't need or want it at any point (trust me, even the best students in the class agree). The exams always have 2 fairly straightforward questions and 1 weird question that you either get or completely miss the point. The curve is pretty good--I think almost 40% get some sort of A.In short, take the class if you need to because Samuelson is great, but it'll be boring and the PSets will be tough.",
    "Have to take it for the econ major, not the most enjoyable class ever",
    "Take this only if you need it as a prerequisite for Econ or, as in my case, EP&E. Make sure you scope out friends in the class, or else you'll have a miserable Sunday night as you struggle with the dastardly problem sets. This class was far too theoretical for my liking, but at least the professor is a nice man (and interesting to listen to). You could be worse off, although I have no idea whether this will destroy my GPA.",
    "Don't take it unless you are really sure you want to be an econ major.Very hard class. It's very challenging and it requires a big commitment.Problem sets are excruciatingly long.Lectures are ok, but sections are where the actual learning takes place.",
    "Take it only if you need to.",
    "Only if you have to!",
    "Excellent course to take if you are considering studying further economics.",
    "I would recommend this course only if your an economics major",
    "This is not a class for the haters of math and long derivations. I would recommend it definitely, but you have to willing to put in the work and even go to the tutors if need be.",
    "A very rigorous, tough class which is worth it if you like econ\/math. If you don't, don't take it. I really enjoyed it, but it is heavily math-based and work-intensive. THe problem sets and tests are difficult\/time consuming. A tough curve. The teacher is great however, and the material interesting.",
    "This is a difficult course in that it is very skill-based. You learn to tackle traditional problems of microeconomics (utility maximization, finding competitive equilibria, etc.) from the ground up using mathematical methods. I found the problem sets to be very challenging. One challenge about the course was that the TAs varied widely in knowledge and teaching ability. Although I had a very strong TA (Richard), some others were not nearly as good -- referenced, for example, in one's inability to solve a problem during a review session for the final exam. Get a good TA! The exams were difficult, but the professor said he would curve them fairly. I found the book not helpful at all -- don't waste your money because Prof. Samuelson's lectures and the problem sets are all that the exams are based on (the exam covers MUCH more material and not in the same level of depth). Learn to do the basic types of problems very well for each unit, and you will succeed. As a freshman going in with only AP econ from high school, I'd say that I'd probably not do this again given the choice, but only because I had a very difficult schedule even without the course. Seek out sources of help (a study group, the econ tutors, and your TA) early so that you can use them later.",
    "A strong math background will be very helpful. I am not sure if this class is the right one for you if you are not a econ major and just want to learn about basic economics.",
    "It's an excellent course that I would recommend to anyone who wants to go past the basic concepts learned in AP Micro or Intro to Micro and learn how to apply them to models using calculus.",
    "If you are econ major you have to take it so take it with Samuelson.",
    "It is interesting to get a deeper understanding of how intro micro concepts work, but besides the mathematical complexity, I'm not sure how much this class adds to intro. It's not as difficult as many people from previous evaulations made it sound.",
    "One of the harder classes in the Econ department",
    "I would not recommend this class to those who are not econ majors but those who are should do so with Samuelson. econ 121 could have been a far less bearable class if not for the Professor. Firstly, he was a very dynamic lecturer and this made a difference since otherwise it would have been easy to fall asleep in this class. The powerpoint notes that he prepared for lectures were extremely clear and helpful and replaced the textbook which I never read. He was good at explaining the math as well and went slowly and repeated things if the class didn't follow. His only weakness were the problem sets and the exams that were more difficult than should. The final exam had questions that weren't really covered in class.",
    "This course is a prerequisite for Econ majors, and Prof Samuelson teaches and administers it excellently, which helps since the class is difficult. For non econ majors, do not expect to glean much new insight beyond intro micro, but rather mathematical techniques.",
    "This class has been by far my most frustrating class till now. Many smart people felt mad by how randomly the class was assessed. By that I mean that many smart people would bomb the midterms even after studying their asses off because the questions were either poorly worded or they asked for topics not covered in lecture (and the class is said to be self-contained...Not true!)",
    "Take if it you need it; there's no reason to stress yourself if you don't need it, unless you don't like having free time and enjoy worry about each problem set.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU NEED IT FOR YOUR MAJOR. It is not worth your time, unless it is a requirement. The material is interesting enough, but the exams are horrifying."
