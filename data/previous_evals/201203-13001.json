   "comments": [
    "\"Timaeus\" is a course on Plato's dialogue giving an account of the cosmogony. Each class is an in-depth examination of a section of the dialogue in which one student presents the readings and the class as a whole discusses the more contentious parts. Professor Sattler does a very good job of refocusing discussions and making sure to mention\/explain important passages of the dialogue when a student presenter overlooks these. This class examines the dialogue line-for-line and the reading as such tends to be quite face-value\/analytic; there's less room for broader questions of implication, purpose and tone of the dialogue as a whole, so this class is less suited for those seeking a synthetic approach to reading the \"Timaeus.\"",
    "Great in-depth analysis of an understudied work. Take it if you like Plato; avoid it if you don't. The course overall is very much grounded in the text.",
    "If you want to take a deep look at a fascinating work of Plato's, this is the class for you. Professor Sattler is phenomenal and knows the material backwards and forwards. Much of the discussion is led by your classmates in the form of weekly presentations, which can be both good and bad. A terrific philosophy course that will increase your knowledge of the Timaeus, Plato and close reading of philosophical texts in general. The two papers are very manageable, and the presentation is not too daunting. Read the assigned section of text before coming to class, it helps a lot!",
    "This is a great course. The text of the Timaeus is much more interesting than I had first expected from the course description. Cosmology turns out to be a much more important part of philosophy and understanding Plato's philosophy and theology than I knew. I got so much out of the course since it gives a very important and interesting perspective on Plato's philosophy, but also much broader on what the role of cosmology is in philosophy. The discussions led by prof. Sattler were very interesting and everybody got a chance to speak. Sattler has a very good way of taking you through the text clearly and efficiently so that you get a good idea of the problems. Every class is also led by a student and the quality of that just depends on the student. Another part of the course that is great is that you get to study the part of the Timaeus that is most interesting to you, by gearing your presentation and paper towards the parts you find the most interesting. Sattler is very open-minded and allows all kinds of topics, and she is very available to guide you through the process. Take this class! Im a senior philosophy major and its been one of my best classes. And if you are not a philosophy-person, I would still recommend this class. You'll be able to pick up and get an interesting insight on Plato's thought!"
