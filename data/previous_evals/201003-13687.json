   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class for anyone who does low-energy physics both experimentalists and theorists because Prof. Glazman can answer any questions that you have in mind and he really address physics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a course about phase transitions that connects many areas of condensed matter physics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who considers it. It is not as demanding as some other courses, yet it is interesting and bring some interesting new concepts. It is a course on phase transitions and there is a little bit of renormalization group. The stress is on physics, it is quite direct, without lengthy formalism and abstract algebra. It is only introductory course to the topic, though, and misses another course that would develop the ideas further.",
    "Yes. If Leonid Glazman is teaching this class, I would recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommended! One of my favorite classes so far. What really interest me the most was the emphasis that was place in the physical intuition.",
    "This is a good course, I would recommend it to someone who intends to use methods of statistical physics in research and is interested in the field.",
    "I would describe the class as a generaloverview of the theoretical basis for describing critical phenomena in classical condensed matter systems. The class begins by looking at a toy model (Ising) to demonstrate the importance of dimensionality. Noting especially the lack of a phase transition in 1D and exactness of mean-field in infinite dimensions. Extension of mean field to Landau Ginzburg formalism is discussed. Failure of the LG expansion at the critical point suggests a deeper treatment. We then discuss scaling, scale invariance, and the application of the renornalization group transformation. Universality is discussed. Special topics are discussed with the remaining time.The class covers interesting and deeply relevant material in a transparent and easy-to-follow way. I would highly recommend the class to a peer.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to another student. The problem sets were relevant, and light. While, the lectures gave you all the tools necessary to do the hw."

   "comments": [
    "In this course I met for the first time some concepts I might use in the future.",
    "I didn't know much about phase transitions; now I do. I would say on a scale of 1-10 (1 being useless, 10 being critical), this course was a 7 as far as contributing to my research.",
    "It taught mesome methods that were very new to me like renormalization group as well as a general understand of the structure of statistical physics",
    "After this course, I am more interested in phase transitions and the \"renormalization group\" ideas."
