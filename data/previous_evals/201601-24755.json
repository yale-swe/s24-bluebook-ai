    "I am interested in the time period after the Cold War ended until now and the fact is, U.S. Russian Relations have colored almost everything the U.S. has done since the beginning of the Cold War. This class was important to me to better place the U.S. actions in world context.",
    "The course deepens my understanding of US-Russian relations and world politics. It helps me a lot to analyze contemporary Russian foreign policy.",
    "Taught me multiple perspectives on competing issues, and the deeper causes underlying those issues."
