   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you have any interest in opera or even think you might have an interest. It does not require knowledge of opera, but unless you are very well read, you may get lost by Prof. McClatchy's references. As a writing credit, this is an excellent choice. You get the opportunity to write about any English language opera in one 20-page paper. It was intimidating, but I was able to make something I was proud of. Prof. McClatchy's style is refreshing in seminar. He is opinionated and doesn't just ask stupid questions to make people talk. He recognizes that he is the most knowledgeable person and actually teaches history and literary analysis. There are times for student input, but it is opinion instead of menial facts, which I appreciate.",
    "Spending any time with opera and operatic texts is exciting, of course, but this class may not be the best opportunity to do so. As someone said in a previous year's review, it goes down easy but is really not very substantial.",
    "A great way to become more familiar with some great shows. Every week, you spend around an hour discussing a libretto, then the second hour watching extracts from the opera on DVD. Professor McClatchy is knowledgable and charismatic. Not a crazy workload, a lot of fun, and you get a free trip to the Met along the way. Highly recommended.",
    "If you are interested in opera, I would highly recommend this class. It is very relaxed, and your only assignment is a 20-page paper due at the end of the semester. Every week, you come in having read a different opera, and you discuss and watch performances. I've broadened the scope of my knowledge of opera AND was able to go to the Met for the first time, on Yale's dime.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if the student wants a deeper understanding of opera as a whole",
    "If you're looking to learn more about opera, the process of adapting literature, or poetry, you should definitely consider taking this course."
