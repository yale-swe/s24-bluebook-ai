    "\"The Scholl lab meetings are usually based on a weekly research topic. Sometimes, the topics are closely related to a student's current research project, but more often, the topics are just something the presenting student found cool and wanted to share. The breadth of the topics is great because many of the papers I wouldn't have known about otherwise. It's a good environment for bouncing ideas off people or sharing opinions. \"I'd recommend it to another student."

    "The best part of these lab meetings was that the broad-range discussions tied into the larger framework of perception and cognition. I learned a lot about academic \"taste\" and feel that I gained a better sense of how to approach scientific articles."
