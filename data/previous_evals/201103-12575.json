    "I would definitely recommend DS with Professor Capodivacca. She is a ball of energy and enthusiasm for the reading that made section a true joy.",
    "Prof. Capodivacca managed to draw me into Lit and make it my favourite DS class, although I expected the exact opposite. Don't be scared by her unabashedly strong Italian accent - you will soon come to not only understand it but love it. Her insights into works written in Romance languages, especially Latin and Italian (Dante!), appeared to be quite unique.A note applicable to all of DS, though: If you want an intriguing survey of the most important literary works at the core of the \"Western Canon\", that is what you will get. The class, however, lacks in a purposeful building of writing skills other than having to write each of the three essays in a week. If your interest in ancient works is questionable but you are after the improvement of your writing and heard that DS will do wonders for you, look to the English department's classes - they might serve you better.",
    "It is a interesting class focusing on a broad collection of great literature works. If you are interested in western traditional literature then DS Literature is your choice.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a very good introduction to themes and characters that will show up constantly in future literature and will provide a grounding for dealing with lit in the west.",
    "I would recommend taking Professor Capodivacca's literature class SO much to any student. She is the most amazing professor -she lets you tell it like it is in class (even if that involves curse words) and express your opinions, she never tells anyone their opinion isn't valid, she gets so excited about every reading that it's impossible for you not to, her office is always open for questions or just to chat, and she is also the most insightful close reader in the world. Her comments in class if we're ever stumped for what to talk about are illuminating. She is simply a goddess.",
    "Take Angela Capodivacca's Directed Studies section, and you'll know what it is to explore literature deeply, purposefully, and joyfully. Best of all joyfully. Section is at once a comfortable and intense atmosphere, with deliberate, probing discussion punctuated by laughter. Fact of matter, we often walk out of section still debating certain points in discussion (e.g.: the merit of sequels, as it pertains to the Aeneid and The Little Mermaid II). Beware little stuffed Cerberuses flying towards your head if you get too rowdy, for Professor Capodivacca's secret wish is to be a \"tiger teacher\" after the style of the Tiger Mom Colloquium this year. The general consensus on this point is that we love our tiger teacher, but she doesn't quite give us the feel of one. Maybe if she threw her hippogriff (Buckbeak, anyone?) at us.With regards to the essay, be prepared for original thinking. Essay topics are provided, but much discouraged. You are free to write about whatever you choose.",
    "The aim of this class is to read what the DS admins have deemed the foundations of Western literature. I would recommend this class for establishing a foundation in Western literature through these texts, not as an exercise in analysis or critical thinking.",
    "Lots of reading, but it'll all be worth it, trust me. Take DS!",
    "DS Literature is great course. The reading material is wonderful and I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Lit is probably the easiest section of DS. Although you read at least three full epics, multiple plays, and lengthy selections from other works, the reading is enjoyable and not hard to get through. Capodivacca is by far the best Fall DS Lit teacher, with the possible exceptions of Jane Levin or Pericles Lewis (but really Capodivacca is best). Greatsense of humor, runs a good section, fair grader, and has a wealth of knowledge about the classical world, love poetry, and all things Italian. Take it with her.",
    "Take Directed Studies. Though it's a lot of work and at times discouraging, the course improves your rational and analytical skills as well as familiarizing you with many of the most important, and beautiful, works of philosophy, literature, and politics.",
    "I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND DS 00104. You will discover amazing works through a dynamic and inspiring approach, which will greatly open your mind and arouse your curiosity. I loved this class and Professor Capodivacca is really wonderful.Sections met twice a week, and that was definitely the highlight of the week! Discussions were very lively and ideas seemed to bounce off the walls. There was a lot of quality to our debates in the sense that students listened to each other and respected the other\u0092s opinion. This enabled class discussions to be a real construction rather than a pool of disconnected ideas. Angela Capodivacca is a passionate teacher who brings the class together with a dynamic approach to the subject and her enthusiasm pushed our motivation and ambition. For example, to our very first class she brought an old original copy of Homer\u0092s Iliad along with pottery from antiquity just so we could immerse ourselves in the period we were about to study. That was hardly all, Professor Capodivacca continued throughout the semester to bring additional material to class (paintings, power points, videos, music\u0085) thus giving another dimension to our studies. She constantly made room for additional office hours sometimes up to three times a week just to be there for help or discussions.Everyone was excited to go to section and by the end of the semester we were all close. Professor Capodivacca really created a wonderful atmosphere in class organizing group works and bringing cakes and chocolate to class on several occasions. She also organized a final class lunch during reading week were every student was sad to see the term end.",
    "This was an incredible class. I would definitely recommend it because the texts were so enjoyable, class discussion was engaging, and Professor Capodivacca was one of the most fun and interesting teachers I have ever had.",
    "Some of the works you read in DS Lit will captivate you and some are great if you have trouble sleeping at night. The course itself is alright, but Professor Capodivacca is by far one of my favorite people, ever. She is always smiling and puts on a good mood that is truly infectious; she makes me eager to go to section. At the same time, it is very clear she is brilliant and insightful and guides students into discovering the masterpieces of the works we have read. If you have Capodivacca, don't give her up for anything or anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student: it was maybe my favorite DS section in large part due to Capodivacca. The little details about the text that she told us really stayed with me, and I learned a lot about how to carefully analyze small pieces of the monumental works we read (i.e. the proems of different works, invocations, etc). In Literature the development of a Western tradition was incredibly clear, and it made me glad I did DS...also, the books were just fun to read for the most part, which was refreshing after some of the drier history and philosophy texts. Loved the class."
