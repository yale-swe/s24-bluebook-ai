    "You either like Connie or you don't. She has her own way of doing things and pretty much sticks to it. The one thing that is great about Connie is she is not afraid of expressing her opinion, so if she thinks a scene is in bad shape, she will say so. Not a lot of Yale acting teachers are like that.",
    "Great scene study class that goes over some of the nuts and bolts that a lot of Yale acting classes skip over. You will definitely improve as an actor and leave with a better understanding of technique. Connie's style is heavily influenced by Uta Hagen and she really kicks your butt, in a good way.",
    "definitely take it if you are interested in acting. and take it with connie- she is fantastic and makes you work hard",
    "The class focused on scenework and some monologue work and helped each student try a wide variety of types of scene. I would recommend the class to those pursuing an acting focus or interested in really getting to know the acting process. The class is wonderful, but will require a lot of time and focus.",
    "Advanced Acting is a more in-depth version of Intermediate. Your experience of THST 230 depends entirely on your teacher: Connie is perhaps the best acting teacher at Yale, and as such, I had a magnificent experience. I definitely recommend this class, especially if you find the right teacher."
