    "Took it because it's a prerequisite for most of the courses I am considering for future terms. You learn basic linalg but my mind was blown or anything. Felt like a typical high school math class.",
    "A thorough introduction to linear algebra. This course races through the textbook, completing ten chapters, thoroughly, in one semester. By the end of the semester, one will be proficient in all things elementary linear algebra, from row reduction to eigenvalues, Markov Chains, spectral matrix decomposition, and so much more. This course is heavy on computations, but I also learned a large amount of the theory behind linear algebra.",
    "how do matrices work, linear transformations, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, SVD",
    "Basis for linear algebra computations and some applications, mostly about data and computer science.",
    "You learn the basic methods of solving linear systems of equations. Pretty standard linear algebra course, very conscious of having applications as part of the class.",
    "As this was my first Linear Algebra class, I learned a lot about matrices, vector spaces, and several applications (PageRank was especially interesting).",
    "By taking this course, I learned a lot of linear algebra - Gaussian elimination, vector spaces, bases, linear transformations, eigenvectors\/eigenvalues, Markov chains, inner products, Gram-Schmidt, QR decomposition, least-squares solution, orthogonal diagonalization, and singular value decomposition. I became much better at abstract math thinking and thinking about n-dimensional spaces spanned by a number of vectors. I also learned how to apply these tools to certain examples (i.e. Markov chains)",
    "We learned about matrix calculations, transformations, and many applications to these formulas.",
    "basic linear algebra, how to work with matrices, some theory- will be useful for modeling in my field!",
    "I developed my linear algebra knowledge and some skills very applicable to the real world.",
    "Some linear algebra.",
    "Basic linear algebra techniques and their applications.",
    "I learned linear algebra with real world applications.",
    "This course was a thorough but approachable overview of topics in linear algebra! We cover Gaussian elimination, matrix operations, applications of linear systems, calculating the determinant, vector spaces and subspaces, linear independence, linear transformations, eigenvalues, QR factorization and orthogonal projections, orthogonal diagonalization, and singular value decomposition. This includes basically everything that you need to know for the computation portion of linear algebra topics. Though some proof-esque explanations were sprinkled in, this is not a proofs-based class.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were unclear, un-engaging, and sometimes even incorrect in their information.",
    "The instructor was sub par. I get that this was his first time teaching 222 and he was very generous w extra credit problems etc but 1. it is often very hard to follow his chain of thought 2. he sometimes explained an entire concept wrong and then went back to his notes and tried to quickly rehash, leaving us all completely befuddled",
    "Course bites off a bit more than it can chew. While the other sections of Math 222 covered approximately 5 chapters, our section covered the full 10 chapters. In order to really cement the knowledge of linear algebra, it's imperative to spend time on each section. The first half of the course moved at a fair speed, covering 4 chapters before the midterm, but the second portion of the course moved at a breakneck pace, covering over 5 chapters in only 5 weeks. The grading of homework is a bit terrifying in this course. For each homework, only 3 questions are selected and graded out of 15-20, and the homework is graded out of 3 points. Particularly concerning, given that homework is 30% of the grade. Exams are out of 4 questions as well - be prepared to do well, since one miss will ding you a third of a course grade.",
    "The material for this course is a bit dry, and I frequently found myself daydreaming during class. The first half of the course is ridiculously easy, but then all the sudden it gets really hard. It would be nice if the first half could be taught a little quicker so that more time could be spent explaining things in the second half.",
    "I'd have liked it if we had more practice questions that have worked out solutions, not just the ones in the textbook which didn't have the step-by-step solution. Also, I think the logistics of the class could have been better, as we would submit a pset, and only get it back in 2 weeks (on an irregular time scale).",
    "It's pretty easy to follow and very useful if you are studying something closely related to linear algebra. Since it was application-based, and not proof and theory-based, it was relatively easy to follow and I feel like the course material was efficient and practical. I hope this course was a little better structured, in terms of coordination between different sections, and the lectures (we went through everything but there were no linking chain or bigger concepts why we were learning stuff in that sequence?) Maybe we don't have to go through all the theory background, but some hints of where these come from mathematically would be very helpful in understanding the context.",
    "The course seemed simple and straightforward in the first half of the semester and became comparatively very difficult after the midterm. I think it would make sense to move through the material in the first part of the course much faster to allow more time for the more complicated concepts at the end. The final was much harder than the midterm -- I think the midterm could have been more challenging (especially if we had covered more material by that point), and the final was unreasonably difficult.",
    "Strengths was that we covered a lot of necessary material. Weaknesses had to do with the fact that the material was presented in a pretty dry fashion and could've been more engaging.",
    "It was a very solid introduction to linear algebra. I wish there were some additional examples of applications other than factorization.",
    "It was very good.",
    "The class moved a little fast and jumped around in the textbook a lot. Still, it was nice that we covered a lot of material.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, well taught, clearly explained. Prof. Tran is an excellent professor. Had a great TA (Ethan) as well. Weaknesses: pacing. I felt the course moved very, very fast, and it was overwhelming to keep up with the second half of the material. It would have been nice had one or two topics been eliminated. Other classes did not get nearly as far as we did either.",
    "Professor Tran is often hard to follow and I left many lectures fairly confused.",
    "I think overall the materials are interesting and we cover a lot of topics in the course. But I wish that there could be a way to make the lectures more structured.",
    "Strengths- the class was well taught and had just the right amount of work- the psets were long enough to be helpful but not so long they were frustrating. i would have liked to have gone a bit faster at the beginning of the class so we could have gone a bit farther at the end. I think as far as tests go it would have been nicer to have 2 midterms and a final, because so much of our grade ended up coming from one 50 minute test, especially because the exam wasn't hard so small mistakes could be detrimental.",
    "The course teaches you a lot of interesting topics however it is extremely fast paced.",
    "I felt the applications-based approach to this course was beneficial, as it allowed me to understand how the techniques are really used, which gives me confidence going forward as an engineer.",
    "The class is pretty different for different sections. For my section, I think the material is too back loaded. The second half of the class i.e. after the midterm had too much material in too little time.",
    "This course was very well-organized, followed the textbook closely (which was very helpful), and also covered very accessible material. The course also had an interesting assortment of applications sprinkled here and there that did not at all take away from the theoretical integrity of the topics we talked about, but were interspersed occasionally in the discussion of these topics to make them more interesting. This course is a great introductory math course to keep from scaring away students who are trying to get a taste of a basic math class by weighting homework heavily and providing extra credit opportunities for students to redeem themselves from the more challenging final. In future years, less time should be spent on the beginning units (matrix operations, Gaussian eliminations) which are very intuitive and more time should be spent on the final units (QR factorization, diagonalization, singular value decomposition). The beginning of the semester went at a very slow pace while the end went at a pace that was much quicker. This could be better distributed in the future (but is totally understandable, given this was Professor Tran's first year teaching this course)!",
    "Sometimes various ideas from the course could have been connected better.",
    "MATH 222 was a very good course when taught by Professor Tran, and I really enjoyed it. I thought that the level of material was perfect for what this class was - Tran usually showed us why things worked but did not go into laborious proofs for the most difficult concepts, and typically held us responsible more for the practical applications of the material than for the high-level theory. Everything was straightforward, easy to understand, and seemingly simple even as we learned a lot. My only complaint was that the first exam was too easy, and therefore dropping a negative sign or two could put you below average without making a single conceptual mistake, and that the final exam, instead of increasing the conceptual difficulty, remedied this only by giving questions that included uselessly difficult computation. I think that such an interesting and well-taught course would benefit from more fair examinations that tested the students more on their mastery of the material than on their numerical precision, particularly considering that all of this math is done on computers anyway.",
    "I thought the course was excellent, and I liked the application emphasis.",
    "I think that the topics explored during class are very useful for many majors. I hated the way that homeowrk was graded-- we were assigned psets with 15-20 problems, but only 3 randomly chosen problems were graded. I frequently got almost all of the problems correct, with a few tenths of a point taken away for small mistakes. However, a 2.5\/3 is less than 85%, so my homework grade sucked even though my psets were mostly correct.",
    "Tran had a very efficient style and led us through a sizable chunk of material, little of which seemed irrelevant. However, it was a lot and too fast at times (felt like one new and important concept per class). I preferred at the beginning of the class in which Tran reviewed concepts at the beginning of each class - it helped keep students up to date with the skills that we would then be building upon. That said all skills seem applicable in some way - not necessarily in my field, but there was enough that would certainly be useful such that little felt wasted, and that which would not be in my field still felt useful in understanding matrices."

   "comments": [
    "No I would not, just because I found the lectures very un-engaging.",
    "I mean, it is a prerequisite and like many other intro courses, is one of the classes you have to labor through to get to funner classes (Econometrics for me). Wouldn't recommend the course for fun or as an elective or even for the learning, however",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you need it for your major. Billed as \"Linear Algebra With Applications\", yet lectures are filled with proofs, which should be reserved for Math 225. Professor Tran is an extremely funny and friendly instructor, but lectures are painfully dry. Mathematical jargon and symbols are introduced with no explanation as to what they mean. Lots of kids have taken linear algebra before, and it's not particularly difficult, so grade averages are extremely high. Not a hard course, but not an enjoyable one, either.",
    "Totally recommend if your major needs Linear Algebra. I wish I had taken this course earlier.",
    "A good overview of linear algebra. The first half is pretty easy (basically just doing stuff with matrices and solving systems of equations). The second half gets a little more difficult when you get into vector spaces, transformations, and more complex matrix things like diagonalization and SVD, but overall the work is not difficult, especially because it's not proof-based. If you're looking for a relatively chill way to learn cool math then this is a good class.",
    "If you need to take linear algebra, take it. If not, then don't. It's not a very hard math class, but it isn't taught very well, so it gets really boring. This is a shame, because linear algebra is actually a really interesting branch of math, but a lot of the connections and bridges that make it so useful and cool weren't mentioned to us, making it feel very removed from the real world.",
    "If you are thinking of taking 222, you either need it for a major, or just want to learn the computational methods of linear algebra. This class fulfills what it sets out to do very well. You learn how to compute eigenvectors, determinants, do singular value decomposition, but you can survive without knowing why those algorithms work. (which is fine by me). If you actually want to gain an understanding of linear algebra, and not just apply it in another field, you would be better off taking 225. But I think this is a good class, we could have covered more concepts but it's good overall. The textbook is also very clear and helpful. Read that, which may actually be more useful than lectures.",
    "Take it if you have to, but if your major is totally unrelated\/you're taking this for fun or because you like math, this course is too application-based.",
    "I would recommend if you want to take a course that is standard linear algebra with some applications sprinkled in. Linh Tran was a good professor but he was only here for a year, so while I recommend him, he won't be around in the future.",
    "yes with this teacher",
    "This is a great introduction to linear algebra.",
    "I would recommend MATH 222 WITH PROF. TRAN to students who need to take it as a requirement for their major. It's not the most exciting course subject-wise, but Prof. Tran makes it as painless as possible. It's well taught with Prof. Tran, so you'll learn a lot, but on the flip side it's very fast paced. I wouldn't recommend any introductory math class to any college student to take for \"fun\", unfortunately.",
    "While I think the course has potential to be fairly interesting, I found Professor Tran's lectures often confusing and difficult to understand. If your TA is Ethan he is incredible--I didn't start going to his sections until the end of the course and I really regret that because he makes the material easy to learn and understand. Really, the material itself is not too hard, you just need the right person to teach it to you.",
    "How much you learn depends on the sections you choose. Overall, very useful materials if you want to continue with the math track.",
    "Yes take this class! Especially if you might need to be able to understand how a computer model works in the future or deal with data, linear algebra will be a big help, and this class does a good job teaching you a lot without making anything harder than it has to be. For example, we were often shown proofs for our understanding, but never had to reproduce them in detail on exams.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student if it was taught by the same professor.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The course was poorly taught, with no clear connection between anything and anything else, no narrative to the order in which we did things, and no justifications for what we were learning provided. You have to learn all the material on your own, and none of the homework problems are even related to the material being gone over in class.",
    "Linear algebra is an incredibly useful subject to know, so take it if you are interested in STEM at all. Otherwise, no need.",
    "I would recommend this class. I considered 225 and 222 at the start of the semester and although I personally like proofs more, I think taking 222 made it possible for me to stay grounded in the application of linear algebra. If you would like to know how the theories can be applied into real world cases, 222 is a very good class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has to take linear algebra for a requirement and is looking to understand basic themes and applications. We cover matrix operations, determinants, vector\/subspaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, QR factorization, orthogonal diagonalization, and singular value decomposition. I was debating between MATH 222 and 225 at the beginning of the semester because I had taken some linear algebra and had to take this course to fulfill a requirement. Because I had not learned many of the topics we covered at the end of the semester (everything after eigenvalues), this was definitely worth it for me! Problem sets took only ~2 hours\/week, there were extra credit opportunities, and the mid-term and finals had equations sheets. Together, this allowed me to focus on the material rather than having to stress out about the grade. I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Tran to anyone who wants to take Linear Algebra and doesn't have the time\/interest to invest in the proofs-based version of this class (225). You will still learn a lot (with very very very light proof-related explanations sprinkled here and there without you needing to replicate\/fully understand them)! Be sure to get into Professor Tran's section. He explains things very clearly and is very approachable and loves to crack low-quality jokes in lecture - you will love him!",
    "As a prerequisite- yes. In general- maybe. I would have preferred taking MATH 225 which I think gives you a more theoretical and solid foundation of the concepts, but my schedule didn't allow it.",
    "Absolutely. MATH 222 is a perfect class for someone interested in math and its applications but not willing to take on a burdensome class - it covers enough material to be interesting without ever being particularly difficult, and allowed you to enjoy learning the math without forcing you through challenging proofs (if those are your thing, I would take 225). I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Tran, who was always very clear when covering the material and was very good at judging the appropriate speed and depth for the class. My only warning is that the exams, this year at least, focused far more on computational ability than on mastery of the material, but I hope that this will be fixed in the future.",
    "Great introduction to linear algebra and vital to future studies in other fields such as economics.",
    "This class was pretty bad. It was at once super boring and easy, but somewhat difficult to get a good grade. Classes were confusing and not engaging and taught straight out of the textbook. The psets aren't that bad, but because only 3 problems are graded at random, it is tough to get a good homework grade. If you take this class, be prepared to learn out of the textbook and GO TO SECTION-- especially if Ethan is the TA. Ethan is so awesome!!! He is amazing at explaining difficult concepts and manages to teach a whole week's worth of lecture material in an hour. Don't take this course unless it's required.",
    "Linear Algebra is not a bad idea for those looking for a nice QR credit. It's not easy, but it seems easier compared. That said you will need these skills in the science - electrical engineers, you will want to take this before EENG202 and may find it useful in EENG203. (It can also help with EENG200, but you don't need it. You won't need it at all for EENG201. I cannot speak to further classes.) Take the class with Linh Tran if possible: he is incredibly efficient at teaching and loves to help students. That said, here is his grading system for spring '17: a pset a week, three problems from which will be graded out of 3 (you can get partial points), two exams, and occasional in-class extra credit problems that is set up such that at the end of the semester those with above-average extra credit scores will get a boost if they need it for their grade. Do the homework problems - you may understand the in-class explanations but it's doing problems that will help you actually understand and able to enact the required skills."
