    "This class has the reputation in the Korean language community at Yale for being a big step up in difficulty from Professor Lee's classes, but in reality is very manageable. The class format is very different, but in some ways more effective. The expectations are obviously higher, but Professor Choi really goes out of her way to help her students and tailor class material to the needs and interests of the students. The only downside to this class is there is significantly less speaking practice than in earlier levels of Korean.",
    "This course is unlike L1-L4 Korean courses because of its emphasis on reading more somewhat more difficult texts and acquiring vocabulary at a much faster pace. While you won't get the same conversational practice as you would in a lower-level course, you will greatly expand your vocabulary and learn new grammar patterns. Professor Choi's style isn't quite as animated as those of other Korean professors, but she pays careful attention to detail and will definitely push you to improve.",
    "Good class for improving your vocabulary and working on more nuanced grammar. Sometimes gets a little tedious. Take it with friends and you'll enjoy it.",
    "TAKE IT. It's extremely productive and gratifying. Professor Choi is not Professor Lee, but as much as she seems to not smile or joke the first week of class, she will warm up and engage you, and eventually invite everyone to her housefor homemade Korean lunch! Beware of the final. It is very very hard."
