    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, at least if you get Miki as your teacher. I'm not even sure whether I need this class to fulfill any of my requirements but I still enjoyed it a lot. We covered a lot of material but I always felt like there was enough time to ask questions and really understand the material.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Take it with Miki to make it more enjoyable!",
    "Good course but too fast paced and not taught interestingly. Only take it if you have to.",
    "Math 120 essentially covers all topics essential to the fundamentals of multi variable calculus. It has many applications to other fields, especially physics. I would recommend the course.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless the student had a serious interest in math. Otherwise it is a lot of rigor and a tough class. It is a prerequisite for a lot of things so otherwise it's necessary.",
    "Math 120 is a good course to take if you want a solid foundation for multi-variable calculus. However, this is by far one of the hardest courses I have taken at Yale. The content really isn't bad, but the midterms are graded in a way that makes it extremely hard. I feel like the tests in general are rather poor indicators of people's true math abilities, for every small mistake results in many points taken off. For example, if you happen to miss a negative in the middle of the problem, 4\/20 points may be taken off. It is also a course in which many people who have taken multi in high school already will take, making it much harder for people learning the material for the first time, like me, to do well in the course. I do recommend this course, as it is extremely useful and a prerequisite class for many classes for many majors, however, just be aware that this course may be harder than what you are used to. Many of my friends dropped out through the semester, even if it meant having a W appear on their transcripts. Overall, to be completely honest, I learned a lot, but I felt like it was hard to do well in the class if you didn't have prior knowledge. Then again, this is the most infamous math class here at Yale, so if you want to take it, take it! Just know what you're getting into.",
    "If you want an easier route for multi-var take ENAS 151, but if you want to have a stronger pure math background then take this class with MIKI!",
    "This is an awesome course if you are into calculus and if you are good at it ! It requires a lot of work, you have to be dilligent when it comes to doing pset, and there is a lot of material to cover (with increasing difficulty) so don't get behind. I would suggest you take this course only if you like mathematics, or if it is a requirement (or both). Like most reviews, I would strongly advise you take it with Miki who is an amazing teacher. She is the best lector I've had so far at Yale (she even won an award for that). She is passionate about mathematics and teaches her material effectively, no matter the difficulty. Time flies by and the lessons are fun. She is also super caring and wants her students to succeed and will help you with whatever question you have - so go to her office hours, send her emails and talk to her because she will help you out ! There are other teachers, but taking this course with Miki will make you life so much easier and it will definitely reflect on your grades.",
    "Math 120 is a prerequisite to many other courses, so it is unfortunately a class that many students are forced to take. It has a reputation of being a very challenging class, which it is, although it does cover a number of interesting topics. One of the keys to doing well is to do problem sets early before they are due, in order to have a chance to attend office hours and ask for help. Students must also do lots of practice problems, as one of the biggest challenges in this course is to identify what kind of problem you are given and the correct way to approach it. I would recommend trying to get into Miki Havlickova's section, as she is the Math 120 head and her lectures are clear and to the point."
