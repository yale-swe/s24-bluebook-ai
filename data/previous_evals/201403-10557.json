   "comments": [
    "The course is good, and offers an interesting perspective on 19th century literature. I would therefore recommend it to another student, but would encourage her to read more theory on the side to get a broader understanding of the topic at large.",
    "Comparative Literature course looking at a set of Russian and American literary texts about serfdom and slavery. Knowledge of Russian would help a lot but is not necessary. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in comparative literature as well as anyone who wants to know more about the institution of serfdom in Russia.",
    "Great course that opens new avenues of looking at things. I would suggest it, lots of material and ideas not commonly covered in Slavic studies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course; the topics of the course are in some ways a refreshing change of pace from the typical examinations of literary representation, but the material and methodology are still extremely relevant to our studies in general.",
    "Comparative survey of literary representations of slavery; yes! Great in depth comparative\/historical approach."

   "comments": [
    "This course surely gave me a new perspective on Russian 19th century literature, and I therefore found it very helpful for my understanding of my field. The course itself did not directly contribute to my dissertation\/research, but still presented intriguing perspectives.",
    "The course was irrelevant to my dissertation topic but it was still interesting and useful.",
    "Informed me a great deal about the important institution of serfdom, which I knew very little about before. This understanding of serfdom furthers my knowledge of Russia and its literature."
