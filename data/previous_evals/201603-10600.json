    "Improving Japanese to an intermediate level with new grammatical structures, vocab, and conversational awareness.",
    "Reading skills and written composition in Japanese were greatly enhanced. Speaking and listening also improved, but to a slightly lesser extent.",
    "My speaking, listening, reading, writing, and overall familiarity with Japanese improved tremendously in one semester. I gained a firm foundation on basic Japanese grammar and feel much more comfortable conversing in Japanese.",
    "Learnt a lot of useful grammar skills. It was harder to retain the vocabulary (especially those that we didn't use in class) as much though.",
    "The course has improved my Japanese all-round, particularly my writing and speaking skills, while drawing context from Japan's rich history and culture.",
    "Japanese presentation skills and conversation skills"

   "comments": [
    "The course is significantly better than 1st year Japanese in my opinion. No CCs means class is more focused on digesting new concepts than memorization.",
    "The only weakness is the workload, but it is necessary to make significant improvements in a language as difficult Japanese. There is seemingly slightly less work than in the introductory courses.",
    "The strength of the course definitely lies in its experienced instructors; Maruyama and Seto Sensei are a great teaching team and explain Japanese grammar points very clearly. I would say that the weakness of the course is its relative inflexibility, which is understandable given usage of a textbook and drills from the textbook. However, I think the instructors could be more clearer about the requirement to memorize daily dialogues, which was not reinforced strictly.",
    "Strengths -- really useful and fun course, and the people you get to meet through the course are amazing. Weaknesses -- I felt that the teachers didn't emphasise on drilling important conversational usage\/intonation (compared to the L1-2 teachers).",
    "The course's strengths lie in its engaged, enthusiastic faculty and strongly structured curriculum. It's evident that the pedagogy has been polished over many years. However, I felt that that was an underemphasis on speaking in terms of intonation, and it would be nice if more time could be allocated to formally teaching correct intonations so that our spoken Japanese sounds more natural.",
    "the strength is the interactive dynamic of the course, weakness is sometimes that grammar explanation went by too fast"

    "Absolutely! It was incredibly fun and engaging, and it gives you a good reason to continue past L3. I really enjoyed the professors who were both funny and interesting.",
    "Only if they are past L2 Japanese and are looking to fulfill language requirement, or are seriously interested in picking up the language.",
    "Absolutely. Great teachers who challenge you, and you get to know the other members of your class well. This class is a great opportunity to improve all facets of your Japanese.",
    "Take it to bring your Japanese to the next level! :D",
    "definitely recommend"
