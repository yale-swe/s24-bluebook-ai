    "Good class!",
    "This class was an interesting and useful overview of the ways that data and data analysis is changing our political system. It's a TON of reading, most of which is important for the assignments, but less so for actual class discussion. I liked it - it was really helpful and surprisingly broad and detailed, and drew on stuff that are familiar and new to the children of the Internet age. I would recommend for tech geeks and Internet nerds, and people who are okay with putting in work for assignments but not necessarily for class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! Prof. Farrar is great and knowing about how digital media influence politics will only become more important.",
    "This seminar had guest speakers from the world of digital media every week. This is good, if you are interested in the speakers and what they have to say. But this is bad if you want a course that delves deeply and thoughtfully into how our changing digital media landscape is affecting democracy.",
    "Everything about the class, from the material, to the workload, to the professor, made this a class that pretty much anyone can take and enjoy.",
    "If you are interested in how the internet interacts with media, take this class. If you want to take a cool, not too difficult poll sci seminar, take this class. \u2026take this class."
