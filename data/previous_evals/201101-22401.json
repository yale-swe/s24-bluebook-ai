    "Well... I recommend it if you are an Econ&Math Major. Otherwise, no.",
    "Do not take this class unless you must for the Econ\/Math major. The material is dull and unsatisfying, and you will not learn anything practical or interesting.",
    "It is a challenging and hard class for Math Econ students. The underlying theory of General Equilibrium is really deep and hard math (Bolzano Weiserstrass, Minkowski's separation theorem etc.) However, the exercises and examples are less mathy. They are still heavy on calculus (multivariable and single variable) but intuition is more important.In general, this class teaches you a couple methodologies and helps you get a more intuitive and profound understanding of economic theory\/optimization.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to (econ math major). You don't need to know anything this class teaches, and this isn't anything interesting. It's basically doing the same thing over and over again (solving for an equilibrium in several different models). It's really repetitive, and after all, the exams boil down to painful algebra. I don't think this class taught me much of anything besides how to solve for competitive equilibrium, and I don't see how this is useful or even interesting. And as for the rest of you econ math majors, this class isn't really that terrible. The workload isn't heavy, I'd say around 3 to 4 hours a week. The exams aren't terribly difficult. It's kind of painful in that it's messy algebra, but it's not really conceptually difficult. I'd suggest you go to class, because the textbook isn't very good, and it's quite painful trying to learn from it because it's unnecessarily complicated. Professor Bewley speaks pretty softly and he tends to talk to the blackboard when he writes, but he's a nice guy.",
    "required class for econ-math, not that bad if you read the textbook but the lectures are generally very boring",
    "I would only recommend this class if you plan to go to econ grad school or if you have an interest in economic models of the economy. A lot of material is covered. This semester, we had 2 midterms and a final as well as weekly problem sets, though in past years there has only been one midterm.",
    "Overall a worthwhile course. Like most econ&math courses, the material gets difficult pretty quickly. Assignments and tests were difficult but fair.If you're an econ&math major you have to take the course, so, no choice there. If you're anything else, I suggest starting out credit\/D or even auditing it, and making the switch later if you feel comfortable."
