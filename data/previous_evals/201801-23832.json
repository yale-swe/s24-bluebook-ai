    "Too little coursework",

    "Nice structure, Maybe more details into the proof and theorem.",
    "interesting materials covered could add more topics on machine learning methods could provide R codes and packages of the methods covered",
    "it had both theory and applied part. this course is very important for biostat students",
    "The course is well organized. However, as the only nonparametric course provided in the department, I feel some important topics were not covered. There were only five homeworks and the first two were too easy.",
    "Strength: Detailed lecture notes. Weakness: More demo and application\/codes of each concept will be much more helpful.",
    "Great!",
    "great",
    "I don't understand why the nonparametric course contains a lot of parametric topics.",
    "good",
    "it is a good course overall. combined theory and practice use",
    "introduced lots of useful non-parametric topics some concepts are difficult to follow and understand",
    "It covers most of essential topics in nonparametric statistics. However, I fell like this course might need to pay more attention to rigorous part of some topics to get student a better understanding."
