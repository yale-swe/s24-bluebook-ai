   "comments": [
    "If you're serious about the social sciences, you must take this course.",
    "I'm not really sure what this class was about, but it was a very helpful one if you want to know about methodological trends in political science and what Professor Shapiro thinks of them. Professor Landemore also made a number of impassioned appearances. The students spoke very little and seemed generally confused about what was going on, philosophy of science being a very difficult subject. Luckily, it wasn't clear that this class was actually about the philosophy of science, so you didn't really need to understand the readings anyway. All in all, this class was quite confusing but I enjoyed it most of the time.",
    "The first half of the course was an excellent introduction to the philosophy of science while the second half of the course was only a so-so introduction to the philosophy of the social sciences. The greatest weakness of the course was the assumption that the lessons of the first half (on the natural sciences) could be applied to the second half (on the social sciences). This assumption should be walked through systematically with the students. Nonetheless, the instructors were excellent and the material informative and comprehensive. I would recommend this course."
