   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Too much material trying to be covered in not enough time",
    "Very disorganized, and not very well taught. It was very hard to keep up with the material and figure out how everything actually fit in together...understanding the math was not great.",
    "I was not a fan of this course. The lectures were very difficult to follow, and problem sets were often very difficult and required a ton of outside help, and I didn't feel like I had adequate support. The office hours were held at the most inconvenient time possible for the problem sets (the day after the problem set was due), there was no textbook for outside help, and we had to rely solely on lecture notes that were often unclear.",
    "The class taught many useful skills for analyzing systems that are applicable to any technical field. The handouts for the class were extremely helpful. If the lectures more closely followed the handouts, I think I would have gotten more out of the lectures (as the lectures were not always organized in a way that I could follow very well).",
    "The class teaches important material; theoretical skills that we will need in the future for sure. However, the method of teaching is not the most efficient one. The professor should have enforced a final project, instead of talking about it to us literally every class. The issue is that he spent more than half of the classes telling us that it is too late to start a project. Yes, he asked us to come talk to him, but he could have used the time he spent in class asking us to talk to him to tell us about these projects.",
    "Professor Narendra and Prashanth are very good teachers who make difficult concepts easier to understand. Overall great course. I would suggest a more formalized set of project-based work in the future to contextualize the course material.",
    "The notes for the course were really good and easy to follow most of the times. It would have been nice to have an actual book to refer to (some formulas that would have been helpful were not on the notes). Also, sometimes it was hard to follow the lecture in class because we would always start from the conceptual stuff and then much later move to the actual implementation, but sometimes it would have been simpler to learn about the application and math and then move on to the general concepts. Also, I think this class would have been better with projects instead of a final exam in order for us to see the applications of this class."

   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course unless you have to. The material is absolutely useful and interesting, but in the context of this course, you will not learn much from the professor, and you will instead watch hours of videos, and search though hundreds of pages to just start to understand the material of this course....Narendra cares a lot about his students, and will make time for you, but I found it almost impossible to meet with him and he missed a number of lectures this semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially if it were not required. I learned a lot, but I felt that I had to mostly teach myself the material. EE202 covers a lot of the same material in a much more effective way.",
    "The course is difficult if you do not have a strong systems background, but it is helpful if you are interested in better understanding how to analyze the behavior of systems.",
    "If you have a deep interest in signal processing and systems analysis, take this course. Otherwise, this would not be a very interesting course.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in signals, signal processing, want to work with neural networks, systems, voice recognition"
