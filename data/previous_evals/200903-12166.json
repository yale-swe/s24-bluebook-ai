    "Awesome class. Don't wimp out because of the early time. It's just once a week and it's so, so worth it. Exposure to really diverse literature; teaches you new ways to think critically.This class is really hard, but I got more out of it than I have out of almost any class I've taken. Blattman is an abnormally hard grader but he rocks.",
    "YES. Take it. One of the best classes I've had at Yale. I loved it, which is what makes all the work bearable - because it is a lot of work.Prof. Blattman is amazing but be warned that he will push you to your limit and then a little more.",
    "yes, if you are strongly interested in its scope. otherwise, if you are looking to take a political science seminar simply to follow your interests or to be in a smaller, discussion-based class, you might be better off finding one that is a little less high-maintenance.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, take it. Also take it if you're looking for a serious exposure to real academics. Brilliant class.",
    "Yes, it's a good class to gain a solid, foundational understanding of civil wars.",
    "This seminar is okay. It is a lot of work so beware. There is a ton of dense reading and you have to do a fairly long and graded reading assignment every week. The pace of discussion was pretty fast as well.",
    "This is a great seminar with an awesome professor. Take it! Significant weekly reading and graded reading responses and a term paper at the end, but the result is that everyone is really well prepared for class meetings and discussion is consistently good! Also, if you are at all serious about polysci, this is one of the few classes that helps you learn to use the 'disciplinary lens' of political science.",
    "This is a really good class that initially spends a lot of time analyzing the limits of political science but ends with a few insightful readings about civil wars. The discussions are quite challenging and engaging."
