    "Very good primer to programming and a solid foundation in Java. Even within the course, I started to take on my own projects aside from Java and am finding that my knowledge of computing and programming translates very well from this class.Everyone should take it, even if you don't plan to be a CS major (as I am not).",
    "Yes. The professor is funny and does explain programming a lot better than my previous programming teachers. However, if you are hoping to work on object oriented programming here, look elsewhere. The topic is barely covered at the very end of the semester.",
    "Not a hard course at all. There is so much extra credit and extended time, and office hours to help you on the PSets, which are not hard anyway, AND the midterm was not too bad.Overall, a good introduction to computer programming, specifically to Java, take this course!",
    "CS112 is a great class that provides you a new way of thinking and, if you're considering majoring in CS but have never taken a course, is a great introduction to the field. The problem sets are time-consuming, but they are unique and can be fun unless you are really overloaded with other work. Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "If you like doing puzzles or messing around on a computer, definitely take it. It was one of my favorite classes I've had at Yale. The material is fun and interesting, and Professor Yang is great. A few problem sets take a while, but they're really fun to do, so it hardly even feels like work. Most of them don't take more than a few hours, and it's definitely better than doing math problems or reading. Professor Yang is great, and presents things clearly, and will tailor the pace based on what the class tells him. The TA's were also amazing, and helped quickly with any questions you have.If you have any interest and want a fun QR, take it. If you're interested in programming at all, definitely take this class.",
    "Provides you with basic programming skills in java. I would definitely recommend it because it is a great jumping off point if you're interested in programming or if your programming skills would help you sift through data you need for other classes. It's also a fun and relatively low pressure class because the problem sets are weighted so heavily.",
    "Any student even vaguely interested in computers would probably enjoy this class.",
    "This course was definitely very time-consuming for me. The problem sets took usually around 7-10 hours by the end of the course. However, it was also a very rewarding experience. The subject matter is interesting and relevant, and the different way of thinking you learn in the course can be applied virtually anywhere. I say take it if you have an interest in the subject matter and you're willing to put effort into it, but it's not a class you could (nor SHOULD) blow off.",
    "Great class. Fun to learn how to program. Take it with Yang Yang as the material is fun and the grading isn't too harsh.",
    "The workload progressively increases as the semester rolls along, but is never large. The materials covered are logically structured and well-ordered.",
    "CPSC 112 was really, really fun. The strength of the course is definitely the TA's. They were all very helpful, approachable, and available. The extra credit parts of the p-sets were time consuming, but really encouraged me to learn a lot more than I would have otherwise. Professor Yang is a super nice guy, and understands that programming is best learned by actually programming. Lecture can get a bit dull on occassion.Overall, I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Prof. Yang is teaching it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I feel like everyone should have some programming skills, and java is a great place to start. CPSC112 reallyhandles the material well, and provides an excellent introduction to programming. The quality of the class really depended on the teacher, and I would really recommend taking the course with Professor Yang--he's just really awesome!!!As a side note: Even if you are struggling with the material in the course (happens to most people), there is such a strong support network that you can definitely catch-up. Beware though, that the course moves pretty quickly at the end, and you should try to keep up even when that happens.,",
    "This was by far the best class I took this semester. It was well-structured, very interesting, and a lot of fun. Sure, the assignments tended to be rather time consuming, but CS assignments always are, and these were quite manageable and fun to do. The professor and the TFs were available for office hours every day, so you can never be stressed out about getting stuck on a pset on the day of the deadline.",
    "Work is easy at the beginning but gets hard a few weeks in. Take it for credit if you want to learn java, otherwise its pretty difficult.",
    "Recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is an introduction to Java.",
    "Awesome class. Good teacher and textbook. Problem sets are challenging and fun. Definitely take this.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another Yale student whether or not they plan to to pursue computer science as a major. Great course, great people.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF PROF. YANG IS TEACHING IT",
    "Take it, even if you think it's not your cup of tea. Between Prof. Yang, the TA:s, and the quirky assignment, you'll probably end up changing your mind if not your major. Be prepared for a LOT of work though.",
    "CPSC 112 is an excellent introduction to object-oriented programming. Java is a useful, versatile, and ubiquitous language, and learning it will facilitate future endeavors. Anyone with even the slightest interest should definitely take this course.",
    "Lot of work, but if you do the problem set you can do well.",
    "Take this class! This class takes a lot of time, but what you learn is very useful. The most valuable part of this class is working on the assignments - in the beginning they are very easy, but they quickly become harder after about prob set 4. However, the problem sets are worth the time, because there is really no other way to learn to program well - much more useful than the lectures.",
    "It is a great and straight forward introductory programming class, do take it.",
    "AWESOME. DO IT. Yang Yang is the BEST. He's really fun and I think the material is really cool. I'm not a comp sci major, but I enjoyed the heck out of this class. There was even a really awesome tournament at the end of the year. The grading is REALLY fair and clear and the material is super easy. You go at a snail's pace, so it's easy to keep up. You also don't have to go to lecture OR read the book--I got a really high A by just looking over lecture slides before problem sets\/exams. The problem sets are also really fun to complete. TAKE IT.",
    "Yes! CS 112 teaches Java programming. If you want to review the basics of computer programming or Java, take this! Take this with Professor Yang!!!! He is really nice, and he tries hard to help students. Students in this class could get help whenever they needed.",
    "A solid foundation in programming with java. Even if you haven't had any programming experience, don't be intimidated. The class starts off very simple, although the topics in the last month were somewhat complicated. Overall, definitely a manageable and useful class.",
    "If you want to learn programming, take this course instead of the one for scientists and engineers. Professor Yang teaches very well, gives fun assignments, and he (along with the TAs) are available for help. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and had such a positive experience that I will pursue further CS courses even though I\"m a history major.",
    "It is an interesting class. A lot of work. Especially if you don't get it. Prof Yang offers a lot of ways to improve your grade though. Still, a lot of work...",
    "Absolutely. It's a very good introduction to Java. The assignments takes up a lot of time, but they all have been very interesting. Definitely take it with Prof. Yang.",
    "Programming has become a very important skill for almost every industry out there, and this course was a lot of fun to take. I would highly recommend you become familiar with some programming before graduation, and this is a great course to do so.",
    "it's a great class to get to know the basics of computer science.",
    "Fun but a lot of work",
    "-This is an amazingly fun class. The material is intellectually stimulating, fulfilling, and fun to complete.-Professor Yang is a funny and dynamic teacher.-The class was extremely structured, which I loved. You knew exactly what you had to learn and when to learn it by. All lectures powerpoints were posted online, and they were very thorough and informative.-Kids looking to major in Comp Sci should take CPSC 201 instead.-The class is overall not too challenging. I would recommend it to anyone lookingfor a 5th class with a moderate and intellectually fulfilling workload.",
    "I would recommend this class, but it requires a large time commitment. The lectures are not good - be willing to go to office hours to learn, and to read the textbook. A lot of self study, but a lot of learning.Problem sets take very long, especially if you do not get help.",
    "Very interesting course if you are a QR minded person at all. The assignments are a lot of fun and teach you to think in a very algorithmic way. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Tough class that if you work hard for will be very enjoyable.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Aside from being one of the most practical courses I've taken here, I enjoyed almost every moment of it. I thought the homework assignments were fun and weren't too arduous. Exams weren't too bad as well. I will say that as the concepts became more abstract, my attention during lecture began to drift, but it wasn't a big problem. I would definitely recommend this as a class to take before leaving Yale.",
    "This was an interesting and fun class. The programs are fun and sufficiently challenging. The lectures aren't always extremely helpful -- I often found the book to be more helpful than the lectures.",
    "I liked it - it's a lot of work, though, and gets much harder towards the end of the semester. I did it just out of curiosity, and so I was interested. If you're just trying for a QR, not sure it's worth it.",
    "Well worth taking as a classics\/history major. Very enjoyabe.",
    "Good class, take it even if you know nothing\/think you're bad at computers. Really dedicated TF team. Going to class is unnecessary because slides are posted and the book is more helpful than lecture anyway. Grading policy is relatively generous - you will have the opportunity to drop your two lowest problem set\/exam scores. Problem sets can sometimes take a while but are manageable, and TFs are constantly available to help. It's the only class I've ever taken for which I actually looked forward to doing the homework.",
    "Yes, take it...I would recommend this class definitely. It really teaches you the basics of programming. Professor Yang is great - if he is teaching, you should take the class. However, the class is a lot of work, problem sets could take around 12 hours sometimes. There is about one problem set a week. There are multiple opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester. The class is very work intensive, though, so make sure it will fit in your schedule.",
    "It's a really good intro to programming. I took it for fun (actually), not to fulfill any requirements or anything, and I definitely don't regret my decision. The team of TAs was super helpful all the time (exactly what you'd hope for from TAs\u0097I have zero complaints about them), and Yang was a kind, reasonable professor. I did find that going to lecture didn't help me learn very much, but I think that was as much a fact of my own learning style as anything else. The book was great and easy to understand, and the material was interesting and challenging, but neither too hard nor too easy.",
    "Take this class but only with Prof Yang. He makes this class into a solid course where we can easily grasp and apply the material. Makes you feel that you have learned something worthwhile.",
    "Great class if you take it with the right prof. Prof. Yang is wonderful, dedicated, and puts a lot of thought into his presentations each time. In addition, the TAs are also great and help a lot if you go to them. The problem sets were fun in general, although I wish that they would have given us more precise grading rubrics.",
    "CS112 by Professor Yang is an engaging and interesting class IF you really put your time in it AND do NOT procrastinate. Assignments gets harder and longer and everything accumulates at the end of the term - so, please do not procrastinate if you decide to take this class and really want to learn something.Professor Yang has excellent PPT slides that are self-explanatory and if you have to miss some class sessions, reading through those slides can pretty much get you there.For this semester (Spring 2011) particular, every Friday is like a review session and taught by a TF - for your information.Note that the assignments seem impossible at first but if you do them step by step and spend a reasonable amount of time on them, they can be done - by reasonable amount of time, I mean 5 to 6 hours or above according to my experience (I am a no tech person and don't know anything about programming).",
    "ONLY if Prof. Yang is teaching it. He is excellent and made the course worthwhile because he truly cares\/is very sympathetic. He got a great team of TFs together and was really available to the students. I've heard the class is terrible with other professors.",
    "yeah I would definitely recommend this class to others",
    "This programming class is relatively easy. I say this because the easiness comes with a bit of work: going to TAs' office hours. The teaching team for this class was INCREDIBLE in that they had office hours every weekday, with TA's that were always ready to clear up confusion. These TA's coupled with Professor Yang's extremely helpful nature and openness to even the silliest of questions, made this teaching team one of the best I've ever had at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class and would definitely recommend it to others with a teaching team like this. However, other professors are not as good so watch out.",
    "This is an in depth introduction to Java. It goes fairly quickly, and the lectures are a bit difficult to follow. However, the book is great and by reading the book and doing the assignments, it's pretty easy to keep up. There is great support from the professor and TAs.",
    "If you want to spend countless hours you don't have on problem sets and have a terrible life, then go for it. otherwise avoid avoid avoid. it's a good class if you want to be a programmer but it has the potential to ruin your life\/GPA.",
    "Yes definitely, this is a tremendous introduction to computers.",
    "Intro to Programming will teach you a lot of the basics about java and computing language and strategies. It took a while for the class to get going, but after the first two easy assignments, things got much more complicated. I spent as much as 20 hours on problem sets, but from what I know this is actually low as far as comp sci sets are concerned. I recommend this class to anyone- introduces good methods of thinking logically. There were 9 problem sets total, and 3 optional replacement ones.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in computer programming or are willing to learn a little bit about it.",
    "If you haven't done Java, it will take hours and hours of coding but it will often feel more rewarding after you finish then say writing a paper.",
    "awesome class. must take.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class quite a bit. The problem sets were often fun and rewarding, and the work load was never unmanageable. Professor Yang has a somewhat strong accent, and his teaching style is not particularly captivating. That, in combination with the comprehensive textbook from which he teaches almost straight from, makes it somewhat unnecessary to come to class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot.",
    "Good class, great support from Professor Yang and the TA's. Prof Yang really cares about his students and is probably one of the nicest professors I've had at Yale. The psets are challenging but rewarding. The tests are killer. To get the most out of the class make sure you go to lecture and keep up with reading. You can figure out the psets on your own (like I did) but then you won't really know anything...",
    "Yes, take this course!! It's a lot of fun and it's great to actually learn...well, real skills that can't be BS-d. This is a fun class, but it is difficult. I wouldn't take it with any other QRclass-unless, of course, you're one of the many students in this course with programming experience. I took this credit\/d and had a great time. Make this class your priority, though, and definitely start credit\/d. and go to office hours. YRY is great."
