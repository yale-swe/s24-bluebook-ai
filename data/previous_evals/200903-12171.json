    "Its a great class and not very stressful",
    "AWESOME CLASS!! DO NOT TAKE INTRO MICRO AND TAKE THIS INSTEAD - for non-econ majors I mean. I stupidly was one of those people who took micro because they thought they should leave Yale with some rudimentary knowledge of the economic world. This class taught me everything that micro most certainly did not. It's a comprehensive survey from economic thought as well as its political and sociological implications, and is threaded very nicely to the current financial crisis. The first half is theoretical and the second is a more practical, case-study approach that looks out how capitalism has evolved differently in different parts of the world: the U.S.\/U.K. vs Germany + Japan vs China + Russia vs the Islamic world, etc. Professor is also hilarious and very methodical, concise and rich in his explanations. With only 3 short papers and a short-ish final paper, this class is a real treat!",
    "I would recommend the class without hesitation, just because you will learn so much as long as you actually properly engage with it. The class is easy, and there is no incentive to go to lecture or do the readings beyond actually wanting to. If you do, you will get so much out of it. If you don't, you don't really deserve to.",
    "Gutty gutty gut. It's a pretty enjoyable class to go to, Szelenyi is a pretty good lecturer. The readings are usually interesting but you definitely don't have to do them. Ditto for class. The workload is incredibly light, 3 2-3 page papers and a 6-8 page paper (and a section).",
    "Ivan = the man. He is an incredibly insightful teacher. In lecture, he is both engaging and highly knowledgeable and in section, he challenges everyone to think deeper than they have thought before. He is unbiased in his argumentation. His sole purpose is to make his students think.I would highly recommend this class to anyone and already have to many of my friends. The workload is extremely manageable. 4 simple papers over the course of the semester to which I've heard all the TA's are flexible with the submission times. You will learn a lot and actually enjoy this class. Take it!",
    "Great class - pretty interesting material and almost no work. Papers are really easy to write. Lecture's are not bad, Szelenyi is the man. Definitely take his section if you can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great survey of economics for people who aren't intoall the mathematical jargon but want a historical perspective. Professor Szelenyi is a great guy and lecturer, the workload is manageable, and the content is interesting - can't go wrong here.",
    "The course provided an interesting perspective on the many different definitions of capitalism. It certainly helps you have an even greater understanding of how screwed up the political discourse is in this country. Questions addressed include-Where does profit come from? Exploitation?-What happens when managers run companies instead of owners?-Are socialism and market economies incompatible?-What's the deal with post-communist transitions?-What caused 2008's sub-optimal market returns?",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes",
    "Take this course. period. If you want to read not only about the great theorists of capitalism but also about the various experiments in capitalism around the world, take this course. There are numerous times where non-obvious points from the lectures and readings have worked themselves into my debates with both libertarians and socialists, showing the flaws in many of the common arguments that each pulls.",
    "If you are interested in Sociology or Econ, take the course. If not, don't.",
    "provides pretty good foundation of capitalism with adam smith and marx... then goes on to cover some stuff that's interesting and some other stuff that's not so interesting. You can pick and choose what you want to read because there are only 3 assignments and a final essay.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Easy class, not that interesting.",
    "Definitely! It is a laid back class and Prof. Szelenyi is an excellent instructor! I would take it again!",
    "The course WORKLOAD issmall, but the READING load is heavy. The weeks vary widely in difficulty, although overall the course falls on the easier side of things due to the lack of a final. If you are a poli sci, EPE, or sociology major, definitely take it; if you're an econ major, it's less up your alley.",
    "Yes take it.. It's not very hard.",
    "Absolutely take it - not terribly hard, but really interesting. Especially for econ\/polisci majors. I'm not sure why its listed as a sociology class.",
    "Varieties of Cap is a great course if someone is interested in capitalism. I would definitely recommend the course to a friend because it was very interesting and not too difficult.",
    "Yes. Absolutely.",
    "The problem with this course is incentives. There is no reason to attend class and barely any reason to do the readings. The only requirements are three 2-3 page reading responses and one final paper that is only 6-8 pages. The material itself is actually incredibly interesting. But thelectures are half biographical and the rest of just reading passages from the reading. Attendance fell below 30% by the end of the semester. My positive experience in this class is owed entirely to my TA leader.",
    "definitely take this class",
    "Great class, with a great professor, with freedom to write on what you want, and on very relevant material.",
    "Yes, if you need the credit for something, or are interested enough in the topic to actually do the reading.",
    "Please don't take it. I am convinced that this is the easiest class at Yale, but it's really, really not worth it, even as a throwaway fifth class.p.s. three two-page papers, a six-page papers, and section that's 10% of your grade. it's that easy.",
    "Easy class, only three 2-3 page reading reviews and a final 6-8 page paper. Interesting material if you're into the economy or politics or just want to know more about capitalism like me. This class really opens your mind about systems of power, and for this reason alone I would recommend it if you need an easy and interesting fifth class. The professor is hilarious too if thats important to you.",
    "good course, pretty straightforward.",
    "Yes, but it is not as much of a gut as represented (they never are). Papers must relate to the reading, so you need some understanding of the authors' general arguments. Lectures are actually fairly entertaining although sparsely attended.",
    "Reading about capitalism and different ways it is practiced around the world.",
    "Fun class, not too demanding, very interesting reading and relevant and current discussions in section, fun to participate in those discussions so its important to do some of the readings. Great class to take as your 5th class, does not have a final and no midterms, just 3 short reading responses and a longer paper at the end of the semester. You can skip lecture if you must, lecture slides are posted online. Take it, its not hard and its interesting.",
    "Yes. Not a lot of work but interesting stuff.",
    "Professor Szelenyi is really nice, but this class is not as engaging as I had hoped. The readings are all really interesting, so if you take this class, actually go to class (even though you don't have to) and actually do all the readings (even though you don't have to). Otherwise you won't get much out of it!",
    "Absolutely. Not that much work and great professor and TA.",
    "Too general to be interesting. A huge gut, but don't take it if you expect to get anything real out of it.",
    "Boring.",
    "Yes",
    "i would recommend it if you don't want to do that much work, but be prepared to be bored.",
    "Yes. The course is for any major. I believe its very important for people to have a basic understanding of capitalism, markets and the competing theories surrounding them. With a theoretical understanding of markets and the institutions that arise from capitalist development, people can be much more informed on economic matters that govern our lives. Very important and interesting readings. The course is also very balanced in the sense that it surveys a broad range of theorists, from neo-classical theorists to neo-keynesians and more statist authors.",
    "Great syllabus\/readings. You will learn a lot about the varieties of capitalism\/capitalism's foundations if you do as much of the reading as possible.",
    "Yea i would definitly recommend this class. Really interesting, not too much work and cool papers",
    "MAD EASY! Slides tell you everything you need to know. The reading is pretty dense though but you can just write about what you understand. Szelenyi is pretty funny but it still doesn't salvage lecture.",
    "Relatively painless, though my experience was influened by the fact that I had an incredible TF (get Jeff Guhin if at all possible; he's awesome). Only papers and no tests, so if you're a papers person, I'd go for this one.",
    "Szelenyi is awesome - really smart and really funny. His lectures were usually really interesting, but unless you're just motivated to learn, there is little incentive to go. (I would say about 25% of the class showed up regularly.)",
    "It teaches you about hte differeent ways capitalism is in practice throughout the world and in different time periods. It shows how some varieties have had much more success than others.",
    "This is actually a fairly interesting class if you do the readings. It brings a unique perspective which you probably haven't had before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's pretty easy and interesting. Certainly makes a great 5th class. The papers are easy, and there's no final. Szelenyi was a great professor, and I'd suggest trying to get into his section as well!",
    "basically a lot of philosophy and examples of different types of capitalism, strong social element involved",
    "TA Jeff Guhin went above and beyond the call of duty and took potentially dry material and made it interesting. He put in more effort than I'd ever seen from a TA at Yale, and I was motivated by him. He did a great job.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It is very easy but also very interesting if you can motivate yourself to stay in class. That said, going to class is not necessary to do well in and the lack of a final exam makes the amount of work minimal. Take it!",
    "3 short essays 1-3 pages. 1 longer essay 6-8 pages. No tests. Great 5th class and you learn about some interesting economic theorists and theories.",
    "The reading load is heavy and the course is not a gut. Take it if you're interested in the readings.",
    "I would definitely take this class. This is great knowledge to have just in general. Understanding how the modern economic systems formed and the fundamental economic systems that work in our society today is extremely useful. It's not that much work and a lot of benefit.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in a number of majors: Sociology, Political Science, or Economics. The information addressed in class is applicable to a number of different subjects.",
    "As it stands, it can feel like a gut class--few mandatory assignments, lecture notes made available to everyone. However, it's as much of a class as you want to put into it--the readings are all very interesting and the TAs and professor are more than willing to discuss them with you. If you don't want to keep up, you can still do well by putting some thought into the assignments.",
    "I would nto recommend this class to another student",
    "Definitely recommend it. Workload consists of 3 2-3 page papers, and one 6 page final paper. Professor Szelenyi is GREAT, very good lecturer. Discussion sections are also helpful. Information is easily accessible and understandable. Most importantly, from someone who had never had any exposure to the subject matter, it was INTERESTING. Makes you think about the times we are in, the global market, and basic economic interactions at a national level. Wonderful course.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. 1) It's relatively easy 2) It's interesting 3) Professor is hilarious. You cannot fall asleep in lecture.",
    "This is a good class that offers many readings by famous economists. The readings can be somewhat long, however. I would also recommend, if the powerpoints are still published online, writing only what the Professor Szelenyi (assuming he's still teaching this class, which he should be) says and then copying and pasting the slide notes from online onto your class notes. This is because his powerpoints are very thorough, and writing them in their entirety will cause you to miss the finer points that Professor Szelenyi is saying.",
    "Take it if you want an easy class...not interesting\/intellectually stimulating. Not a great class. I think I just wasn't a fan of sociology, but not many people went to lectures\/did the reading because neither was necessary to succeed in the course. Instead, people just went to section. If performance could be correlated with lecture attendance\/readings, then the class would be much better (because I liked the professor, and the material was interesting).",
    "An interesting overview of many great thinkers and theorists. The problem is the lectures are a a bit disjointed and there was no real repetition to reinforce general ideas\/concepts. The professor is sweet and tried to make connections between ideas\/authors throughout the progression of the course but did not really succeed. I learned the most from researching and writing my own papers. It was nice that we got to choose our own topics.",
    "This has really been one of my favorite courses at Yale so far. It's content was truly fascinating: it examined a concept so familiar to us, revealing, revealing just how much we perhaps take for granted about its true nature and universality. I can think of few more important lessons in our time of financial crisis and globalization, and professor Szelenyi does a good job of making these connections.Dr. Szelenyi is an amazing professor, one of the best I've encountered at Yale. He is both brilliant and down-to-earth and is basically a zany old man who's both sharp, humorous, and friendly. His lectures were always funny and interesting and not dull in the least. He's the only Yale lecture prof I've known who actually bothered to lead two discussion sections himself this semester, which were always full, and he truly shows an interest in interacting with students.There is one thing about this course, though, that could go both ways: people seem to take it as a gut, and yes, it's possible to get by without doing all the readings in depth (there was no final, just papers). While I at times enjoyed this, I felt that I would have gotten more out of the class and discussion sections if more people had taken the class more seriously.Overall, I would strongly recommend this course if you have any interest in it, and would also strongly recommend that you actually do most of the readings simply because they'll make an already-interesting course even more fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Even non Political Science majors should certainly consider this course. My comprehension of the inner-workings of capitalism and it's political theorists was greatly improved after this course.",
    "Total peach, though not graded as easily as you would expect. you don't have to do the readings OR go to lecture except for the weeks you write a literature review. no midterm no final, the final paper is 6-8 pages. you don't learn that much though... but if you wanted to i think you could. prof's lectures are kind of nutty (but entertaining...) but the powerpoint notes actually make sense so if you download them and read them, you'll get what's going on.",
    "Varieties of Capitalism was a good econ course for non-majors. I'd recommend with reservations, since I liked the content, but felt having a good section made the difference.",
    "Yes, interesting and light work load.",
    "yesssss! highly recommended",
    "Varieties of Capitalism is a broad survey course of capitalism and its modifications from Adam Smith to present day. You won't go in depth on much, but you'll gain an interesting historical and comparative perspective. That being said, this class was definitely a gut so manage your expectations (and effort) accordingly.",
    "100% take this class. The best class at Yale. Ivan is a legend and you'll get alot out of the class, especially if you're an econ major. I have no idea why the idiots in the econ department aren't giving credit for this class anymore, as this class goes over the basic theory behind every major variety of capitalism (free-market, social democracy, socialism, etc.).",
    "This class is worth taking as long as you do most readings BEFORE the lectures. Prof.Szeleny's lectures feel more substantive when this is done.",
    "With the current grading structure, you get as much out of the class as you want to put in.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in learning about different kinds of capitalism. I would also recommend that they get a good TA.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this class. This class was significantly underwhelming. I took this class because the reviews for the previous class were terrific, but the class really did not live up to those reviews at all. The lectures weren't terribly interesting and didn't help to explain the readings. The readings toward the middle and end of the course were mainly very technical sociological papers, which were sometimes difficult to understand. This is a course that I thought would be terrific but turned out to be a real disappointment.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend PLSC348. If you are willing to do the readings and keep up on your own, you are guaranteed to learn about these theorists which would in other classes be a little more harder to comprehend. THis class is a great, basic, overall introduction to the great social theorists, which is definitely useful knowledge for students of all disciplines.A great 5th class lecture.",
    "Easy class. Boring lectures, boring reading. If you put in a little effort (do even half the readings and go to class) you'll be fine. Don't take it if you're looking to be intellectually stimulated.",
    "I would recommend Varieties to another student. You will learn a lot about the interesting history of the theoretical aspect of economic systems, and examine case-studies.",
    "Yes",
    "Recommended fo sho",
    "This is not a bad course. You just have to do the readings and you'll do fine.",
    "This class is, simply put, a gut. There is a huge amount of reading each week, but you can get by without doing ANY of it. You don't need to go to lecture either, as he posts slides online. In fact, the only work you need to do in the class to get an A is 12 pages of writing (one 6-8 page paper, 3 2 page reading responses). If you're looking for a gut, take it.That said, there is a fair amount of rich information to soak in should you decide to put in the work. The readings are all things I'm immensely glad to have read and the lectures did a great job of synthesizing the readings. Again, there's a lot of reading each week, but if you choose to do it (prediction: you won't), there's a lot to get out of it.In terms of approach, if you're trying to slack off, there's no need to do the readings or go to lecture. You can get all your info from the lecture slides online. You can do a sufficient job of BSing your way through section and the papers are all a topic of your choice--so you can choose things you already knew about before you took the course. Make sure to focus on the final paper, as it's 60% of your grade!",
    "It's a really nice and easy course. The material covered is very relevant to economists and political scientists alike.",
    "Sociology 148 is a good class and presents information which is good to know about. The work is pretty modest so that was also a plus.",
    "Take it. Not too difficult. Very interesting.",
    "Most definitely",
    "I highly recommend this course. I came in knowing very little about capitalism as in institution but left with a greater appreciation for its subtle complexities. The course offered a good selection of readings that varied from theoretical to empirical perspectives on the varieties of capitalism. Professor Szelenyi was phenomenal. Few other professors can match the level of energy he has during lecture. This is particularly impressive given that he taught at least 40 courses in his lifetime. There are 3 critical review papers and one final paper. I learned much from writing them because they require you to synthesize what you have read as well as offer your own perspective on the issues. It is not necessary to do all of the readings, but students taking the course must plan wisely so that they have read enough to write interesting and meaningful papers.",
    "I would certainly recommend that other students take Varieties of Capitalism. This course taught me a great deal, from the basic theories of Marx and Weber to the violent tendencies of Luddites and the sales ratio of computers and cars in the modern United States. All the readings - both assigned and optional - are in the internets, and the students who take this course are a good mixture of political science students, economics students, and fair-haired members of the Ursidae family. If anyone were to suggest that this class is the among the best offered at Yale, I would respond: \"Bingo\".",
    "I would recommend it. I think it is an essential class to take considering all the people that you end up reading. But, if you are not one who will do the readings, this class will not be that fruitful for you (as with most classes). But, this class has an exceptional array of readers.",
    "This is a very interesting class that puts capitalism into perspective. You will not leave the class thinking that Obama is a socialist, and you will be able to discuss different economic systems, such as capitalism, socialism, and Islam well. Professor Szelenyi knows a lot, but usually never finishes the lectures, so don't bother taking notes. You actually don't even have to do all of the readings because there are 3 short papers where you compare only 2 theorists and one long one where you discuss whether you think varieties of capitalism exist. Unless you are super interested in the subject, you will probably end up doing half of the readings.",
    "I would recommend it because it gives a very good overview of different political\/economic\/social theorists that everyone should know about",
    "It's a great class, even though the lectures are kind of boring sometimes. The readings are pretty fascinating and you learn how to make connections by analyzing the politics and economics of a lot of countries. Take this class if you're interested in understanding political economic theory. Also make sure to take Jeff's section; he's the best.",
    "Take this course.",
    "take it if you need the cr. dont if you dont",
    "It was a great class with clear and reasonable expectations. The material is important to know.",
    "Interesting, makes some complicated ideas very accessible.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! take the class, no matter what you plan to do in life, it's necessary to understand the most important economic debates of the 20th century.",
    "If the student has no familiarity with politics or economics, I would recommend it. But for more advanced students, the class is fairly boring.",
    "It's an easy course. The readings are carefully selected and represented the evolution of ideas, although the transition between theorists is not explicit enough.",
    "More than just capitalism, this course looks at the economic models of a number of different countries, but not before describing capitalism as it is ideally construed and various evolutions in it. Managerialism, welfare capitalism, Japan, China, etc. are topics. The material is fascinating, even for someone with little economic background. The workload is light, and Szelenyi is great. I got a lot out of it for not that much input, and I think that with more effort, it would be even more rewarding. Definitely worth taking.",
    "You never have to go and it is just a couple papers, but if you plan on getting something out of it I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Professor Szelenyi is highly informative, fun and experienced, and it's a joy just to go to lecture. Work is hardly arduous.",
    "Interesting class on economic thought. Easy to fall behind on the readings for lectures, 3 short essays and 1 longer one, try to get the professor as a TA."
