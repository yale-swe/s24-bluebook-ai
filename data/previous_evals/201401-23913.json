Adhering to a reading list and having topics for each field trip would have been extremely helpful for stimulating discussion. It felt like the lectures were off the cuff. Many times I was just wandering around the museums, with no real objective."

I think just identifying a topic to study or think about each week would have done a lot to direct our efforts.It seemed like the TA did very little. He was supposed to schedule a final presentation day, which he didn't. This was disappointing, as I had prepared for a presentation, but then never got to give it. Also, he was supposed to show several videos, which also never happened. I feel like he could have accomplished his objectives in an hour of his time, tops, but it just never happened."

    "Go into this course with an open mind and you will have a wonderful time!",
    "The three hour long trips require patience on the part of those uninitiated to the arts, but over time one leans to slow down and appreciate subtleties and fineness. The classes will definitely make a difference, albeit one that will only become more obvious in the long term.",
    "This is a good course to balance an otherwise challenging work load. I had a difficult term otherwise, and appreciated the time each week to learn on field trips at museums and galleries. I also like the instructor and enjoyed his guidance on the field trips. The antiquities we saw and interacted with were fascinating.I wouldn't expect to learn a ton about archetypes, though perhaps with some initiative you could read the books that were on the syllabus (not followed) and get more out of the course. The instructor was available to speak with, and I think with initiative you could interact with him on an individual basis and gain more. Overall, the opportunity to learn a lot was there, but the course wasn't very rigorous and didn't quite meet expectations."
