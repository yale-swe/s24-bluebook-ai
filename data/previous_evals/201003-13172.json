   "comments": [
    "If you're going to take DS, Bakker is a pretty solid choice.",
    "I would recommend this class enthusiastically to anyone who loves literature, likes to talk about books, and is up for a lot of reading. There are three papers throughout the semester, 5-6 pages each. There are no midterms, and the final examination you will find very easy, if you've stayed on top of your work for the whole semester. Try to get Professor Bakker for literature - you will spend at least two weeks discussing Homer, and as a Homerist, Prof. Bakker will give you unique insight into the material.",
    "Great course - covers everything that should be covered. Fairly straightforward, not too intense grading-wise, although the reading is a lot.",
    "It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.",
    "Prof Bakker's lit section is fascinating for the early greek texts, but will become a little disappointing after. You'll enjoy comparing every character you read about to the \"greek hero\" (even Jesus!).",
    "The course is a great introduction to the classics of Western literature from Homer to Dante. Although there is a lot of reading, it's generally amazing, and it's difficult not to appreciate the depth and breadth of the class. As with most DS courses, the strength of each instructor varies by student, so it's a matter of making sure one gets into the class where one will learn best given the teaching style of the professor. That said, Bakker is very good at allowing students to control where the conversation goes in class. Occasionally this might lead to an awkward pause where students look around for something else to say, but it seems better than having a professor dominate discussion.",
    "Literature. From Homer to Dante. Certainly recommended.",
    "A lot of work...only try directed studies if you're sure you can handle it and the people in these classes. The students are hardworking and often seem to have background knowledge so it may be a bit daunting at first but it's really not that bad. Overall I would recommend the course as long as the student is aware of the work it entails.",
    "DS is the way to go. Everything is read far too fast, but what else can you do? Bakker is not a great section leader, but he has interesting things to say.",
    "I would say that after the course moved past the works for which Professor Bakker had valuable insights, the section meetings were not helpful, and more insight could probably have need gained by spending the 75 minutes re-reading the texts on your own.",
    "If you are enamored with CLASSICAL literature (and have had extensive exposure to epic\/possible background in either Greek or Latin), and you feel like you can stomach a teacher, or classmates, whose interpretive interests or methods do not align with yours, then go right ahead. DS Lit can be wonderful for some people; it can feel like recreational reading, not a rigorous, paper-heavy class with homework. If not, be prepared for disappointment. These books are multi-faceted, replete with historical tidbits and intertextualities that won't even be hinted at in the flash of time (usually a week) you spend in class discussing them. Scholars dedicate their lives to studying Dante; after reading most of The Divine Comedy, I unfortunately have little to no idea as to why he is important, literarily and historically speaking. If a teacher is not well prepared, you may be left with a cursory understanding of these truly great works, which is almost worst than no exposure at all. As a section, we groped around for over an hour each meeting, trying to tease out overarching themes (love, revenge, justice), and not really producing any insight. I never felt good after section. Tragically, I learned little about literature and even less about history."
