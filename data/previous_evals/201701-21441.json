    "At the beginning of the course, in January, I couldn't read French at all. Now at the end of the course in May, I can read with a high degree of proficiency.",
    "I gained a firm understanding of French syntax and the ability to promptly understand and accurately translate written documents.",
    "This course offered a helpful and helpfully rapid overview of French grammar, and I was surprised and delighted to learn techniques for decoding difficult passages of academic prose in such a short period of time."

   "comments": [
    "The only thing I can think of, which really wasn't a big concern of mine during the course, is that the lectures could follow the assigned textbook, French for Reading, more closely.",
    "The class is logically designed and builds in a very effective manner. The course text book is extremely useful. Professor Sanjabi relies on handouts to structure each class, which proved beneficial in reinforcing the high points of the accompanying text book. Homework was critical and manageable but very time consuming given my absence of familiarity in French.",
    "The strength of this course had mostly to do with the instructor's targeted overviews of relevant grammar, which helpfully sifted useful and extraneous material. It was also incredibly useful to do as much translation work as we did on a regular basis. The course could perhaps be improved by a greater emphasis on vocabulary. That we were permitted a dictionary made this seem unnecessary, perhaps, but it would still have been helpful to spend more time upfront on relevant words."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially for anyone needing to learn French for research\/academic purposes.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely recommend for anyone wishing to develop a foundation of the language or the ability to quickly and effectively translate documents. The course certainly delivers.",
    "I would recommend this course as preparation for, or in lieu of, the translation exam. It certainly helped me prepare, and it usefully required students to do longer translations than the tests typically require. This seems like a more important skill to me than being able to translate a short passage in a limited amount of time."
