    "\"Turn that shitty paper you have into somethingthat might get you an R&R.\"If Prof. Wildeman was teaching it I certainly would. Depending on who else is slated to teach it, I'd have to withhold my opinion.",
    "I think all students in the program should take this course. After this class, I have noticed that many others share some of the mistakes I used to make in writing and in presenting their research. From conversations with many students I have found that they share many of my same questions about the process of research and writing. A class like this should always be available in the program to address these needs.",
    "This class demystifies the publication process and teaches you how to write like an academic. I highly recommend the class."

   "comments": [
    "The professionalization side of the course was one of the unexpected benefits for me. I'd never been exposed to a frank discussion of generalist v. subfield journals, wait times on R&Rs between journals, and things of that nature. In that regard, this course would be invaluable to many students, especially those who might not have the strongest relationship with an advisor who would ideally be the one to teach them these things.As for my research, the paper was very useful for helping me work through a project from beginning to end, both in terms of framing, writing, polishing, and what I hope will very soon be submission. Can firmly say that the paper I have now would not be where it's at without Prof. Wildeman.",
    "This course teaches the kind of professional skills that are both essential and rarely taught. It should be compulsory for sociology graduate students.",
    "I now have a better understanding of what journals are looking for in an article and of how to improve the way I think about research and writing. I am sure that throughout the next few years I will often revisit the notes from this class and the books and articles we read in order to remind myself of the many insights I have learned.",
