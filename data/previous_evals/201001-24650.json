    "THIS CLASS WAS SO AWESOME!!! TAKE THIS CLASS! Not only is Prof. Freeman one of the nicest, greatest and most engaging lecturers at Yale, the overall outlook of the class really gets you thinking not just about the Revolution but even how Americans set out to grapple with their history and what it means for national and regional identities. This class was such a gem and I'm so glad it was recorded for the Yale Open Courses on line.",
    "Take this course because of Professor Freeman. She is a wonderful lecturer. The syllabus for this course is a good balance between primary documents and essays\/books. The course is social history, so do not take the class if you want to know details about the battles or profiles of all the great leaders. Section was not helpful in the beginning because it did not synthesize important information in the readings. Section is better towards the end of the course when there are actually debates on whether or not the revolution was radical. If you keep up with the reading and attend lecture, you should do fine on the 2 exams and 2 papers.",
    "I came into the class with high expectations and ended the semester disappointed. I don't feel like I got much more from the lectures than I could have gotten from just reading the books on their own.In fact, that might have been a better move.",
    "Absolutely. The subject is fascinating, and Professor Freeman is an amazing teacher. Even if you aren't interested in American history, just take the class for her fascinating anecdotes (and funny jokes!)",
    "Yeah I recommend it, IF you are really interested in the American revolution-SERIOUSLY interested. Prof. Freeman is awesome; she's an amazing lecturer and absolutely hilarious but most people have indeed learned this stuff time and time again and the syllabus really isn't that new or refreshing. The readings are kind of boring and thus the discussions in section are limited by the lack of interest in the extra material. Lectures are the best part.",
    "This is a course about the history of the American Revolution and coveres the years from about 1760 to 1790 when the US Constitution went into effect. It is fascinating and the readings are never dry or boring and they are not too long. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this if you are a history major. It's an awesome class.",
    "Pretty good history class. The professor has a bit too much of an informal style; however, I won't be taking very much from this course.",
    "Professor Freeman is a fantastic lecturer who is tuned in to the needs and expectations of her students. This course is definitely a must-take for History majors and anyone interested in early United States history. For the non-DS freshmen who are worried about having two papers in a class, suck it up: they're not very difficult and the first one is actually fun to write.",
    "This course feels more like a high school course than a Yale course. It's pretty easy and sometimes fun. The reading is very boring, but luckily you don't have to do it. Don't expect it to change your views of the world.",
    "I really enjoyed this course it gave me a much better understanding of the revolution and popped a lot of those historical myths I had been holding in my head.",
    "YES. Take this class. One of the most entertaining lectures I have ever taken with a passionate, funny and wonderful professor.",
    "A fun class with a not too difficult workload that is very insightful.",
    "American Revolution was a great experience! First of all, know that you will learn much more in this class about the time period than you did in high school taking AP U.S. History. The course is divided into three parts: the causes, the fighting, and the aftermath and the Constitution. Your experience will depend on what you put into the course, how you engage with the sources, your participation, and your enthusiasm. These will certainly be well-received. Professor Freeman was fantastic! Her lectures were filled with humor and interesting points...as well as lots of great quotes by our favorite founding fathers. I had a great time in section and was able to produce a final paper I was really proud of. I highly recommend this class, which has only supported why I have chosen history as my major.",
    "A fantastic overview of the American Revolution, with a good collection of themes and facts. Though the professor has limited time to convey all of the information related to the Revolution, she does a great job of hitting the high spots and revealing to students the true nature of many of the founding fathers and the events they engaged in. As an economics and political science major, I have not taken many history classes, but if they were all like this, it would make me question my choice in majors. Professor Freeman is a great lecture with a great sense of humor. She makes the topics so clear and easy to follow. The tests are fair and the papers are fun to write. There is no question in my mind that I would recommend this to fellow students.",
    "Must take. That simple.",
    "History 116 is a great overview of the American Revolution. I also thought it was also a great overview of the Constitution, even though that itsn't the focus of the course. I would recommend it to anyone looking to gain a solid base knowledge of the founding era and Revolutionary War. It's really a good class.",
    "Social history of American Revolution. Not overly difficult, but it cannot be neglected. Interesting lectures and interesting papers. I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend American Revolution.-Engaging lectures.-Really nice, fun professor.-You pretty much don't get tested on the reading, so you can just skip it most of the time.-Really fair exams (though you do have to study for them; it's not a gut).-Interesting subject matter!",
    "Take this class. Just take it. There are only two essays you have to write and the class is so interesting that you won't even care. The TA's are mostly good, the readings are mostly good, but the lectures are amazing. You will love Professor Freeman, and if you don't, you might not have a soul. The stability of having an engaging lecture class in a sea of classes that are unpredictable is beyond words a source of sanity. You will not regret taking this course.",
    "HIST 116 is a lecture course covering the years of the American Revolution. It includes background regarding the lead-up to the actual fighting and the social conditions that underlay the revolution as well. I would recommend the course if you want an easy American credit (if you're a history major) or if you're not a history major, but just want to take a course for the lecture. Freeman is a dynamic lecturer, not my favorite, but others found her really engaging. Two papers, not too hard, midterm, and a final.",
    "Good class, Freeman is a really interesting lecturer. Very much a social history class though, not too many dates (which can be really nice sometimes) but it can be a little bit repetitive though. Look out for the 'thank you John Adams' voice. Overall I would really recommend this course.",
    "Good course. Interesting. As someone who had not studied this period before, it wasn't too hard to catch up with everyone else's pre-existing knowledge.",
    "This is a fabulous class. I recommend it highly to anyone who has a love of history and to anyone who might have even a slight interest. If you take this class, you will fall in love with the subject.",
    "This was a great course. There was quite a bit of reading but they were all really interesting. Professor freeman was phenomenal and lectures were the one thing I looked forward to. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in American history or history in general. The course leaves with a fresh perspective on one the most monumental events in history.",
    "Great class. Joanne Freeman's lectures are amazing.Even if you can't take this class, you should stop in for a few lectures, like \"Heroes and Villains\" or \"The Importance of George Washington.\" There's a lot of reading, but sometimes you can get away with not doing all of it (sometimes you have to). Also, the IDs on the quiz and exam were kind of obscure. It was fine on the final, once I knew what to look for--basically anything that has a capital letter (names, legislation, organizations, etc.). All in all though, it's a superb class.",
    "Great history class! Professor Freeman is a great lecturer and tells a lot of jokes and funny historical anecdotes. The workload is totally manageable (two papers and a midterm) although some weeks I felt like only someone with superhuman powers of comprehension would be able to get through all the reading. Luckily, doing every page of the reading isn't really necessary to do well in the course. Overall, I really enjoyed the class. Professor Freeman is truly passionate about the subject, and it shows.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Prof. Freeman is by far one of the best lecturers at Yale, and even if you think you know everything about the Revolution, you will learn quickly that you were wrong. This course is essentially a case study, which is honestly much more enjoyable than a survey history course, as you go in depth into the people, ideologies, and events behind the Revolution. Granted, some lectures get redundant because of this, but because Prof. Freeman made the material so enjoyable to learn, it only cemented themes more, rather than make them unbearable. A caveat: readings can be quite inconsistent from week to week, ranging from light workloads (30-60 pages) to entire books and additional articles. Hopefully this will be worked out in the future. I loved this class.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend, particularly for those interested in the subject matter.",
    "This class was an in depth look at the American Revolution, from the time when the American colonies were established to the time the Constitution was created. I would recommend this class to any student because the way Professor Freeman teaches the class makes it very informative, but at the same time made the American Revolution engaging and fun to learn about.",
    "If you've ever wanted to know more about the American Revolution, at all, take this course. Professor Freeman is fantastic, the readings are manageable if you are selective, and the course material is extremely engaging. It isn't a traditional history ofthe American Revolution however, in that it focuses on the social aspects much more than the concrete details. You really get into the feel of the era and explore the lives of individuals during the time period.",
    "This is a very excellent lecture class - exactly what I expected. This year, the TAs were also excellent, which helped a lot with the class. I highly recommend it.",
    "MUST TAKE CLASS!!! Open Yale this course if you want to experience Professor Freeman's amazing teaching style.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Its not a bad class, but i was a little disappointed after all the hype surrounding it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it was great. Professor Freeman is really interesting.",
    "definitely take it",
    "Very good class, definitely take it. It's graded pretty easy, and is very enjoyable, so it's a win-win.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course if you are interested in American history!",
    "Yes it is a great way to learn about some different perspectives of the American Revolution",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Great course. Take it.",
    "YES--great lecture, good readings. Plus I obviously love Amurricaaaa",
    "Take it, it will make you like America even more.",
    "Great interesting lecture!",
    "Yes, it's a subject you've probably learned about. It's the American Revolution, after all. If you've gone through the American school system, then you've heard all about the Stamp Act and the Boston Tea Party and Bunker Hill and all that.But let me tell you whyyou shouldn't disregard this course:- Joanne Freeman. She's hands down the best lecturer I've had in my four semesters so far at Yale. She's nice, understanding, helpful, and incredibly enthusiastic about her work. She just oozes with her love for early American history and that makes her lectures fun to listen to. Not once did I fall asleep in a lecture and I can't say that for too many other classes. She has a way of weaving in her extensive historical research into her lectures in the form of interesting and memorable anecdotes that you won't hear from anywhere else.. because she just looked them up earlier that morning in some previously untouched historical archives. If anybody asks a question that she feels she can't answer to her satisfaction, she'll be back the next lecture having done tons of research on the question.- Fresh ways of understanding the Revolution. The fact that the majority of the students have already heard the facts of the topic gives Joanne the freedom to go into depth on her favorite topics. Whether it's a whole lecture on how New Haven residents and Yale students responded to the coming of the Revolution to a lecture on everything there is to possibly know about Benedict Arnold and his co-conspirators, there's always an interesting, more in-depth story to be told in history. That's what makes the subject so fascinating. So it's actually great that we come in knowing the general story - Joanne knows details about people and events that few other people in the world probably know and she can give you fresh ways of looking at the themes of the Revolution.- Well-structured course. Look, it's not a gut. You can't get by on what you remember from APUSH and you'll have to show up to lecture. But the course requirements are very reasonable: two papers (the first is a fun 3-5 pager on \"pretend to be a colonist in 1766 writing a letter to the Duke of Grafton\" and the second is a standard 7-9 page paper) plus a midterm and a final. The midterm and final aren't scary at all because both the essays and the IDs are really straightforward. Joanne doesn't throw curveballs so the tests are really fair and as long as you study a bit, you're guaranteed to do well on it.",
    "yes i would. its a great summary of the revolutionary period. doesnt just focus on the war though.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course! It's great and Freeman is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely...I was interested in the period, but even if you're not it's valuable and provides a valuable background for America today.",
    "This class was a great course on the American Revolution. Professor Freeman is an amazing lecturer, and her lectures were always fun and engaging. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about the American Revolution and gain new perspectives on this period in American history.",
    "Yes",
    "Fantastic class. Truly a must-take at Yale so long as Prof. Freeman continues to teach it.",
    "This is\u3000an\u3000excellent\u3000class.\u3000The\u3000American\u3000Revolutionary\u3000era\u3000is\u3000my\u3000favorite\u3000historical\u3000time\u3000period,\u3000and\u3000this class\u3000digs\u3000deeper\u3000than\u3000your\u3000average\u3000AP\u3000U.S.\u3000History\u3000class\u3000in\u3000trying\u3000to\u3000determine\u3000what\u3000the\u3000American\u3000Revolution actually meant, both then and now. The revolution was so much more than just the war, and this class really lets you see that. Plus Joanne Freeman's lectures are really great! The workload isn't that bad--just a midterm, two papers (a letter sent to a British government official as if we were a colonist, and a longer historical analysis paper based on the lectures and readings), and a final. You can skim or skip a lot of the readings and still do completely fine, mostly because of Professor Freeman's clear lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in American Studies or history in general. The course does not simply cover the war, but rather a variety of topics before and during the war, and its implications in the late 18th century and beyond. The American Revolution is so multi-faceted, and this course inspired me to want to learn more about it. I highly recommend this course",
    "this class was orgasmic. i didn't coming in expecting to like it but professor Freeman made the topic really fun and i looked forward to going to class.",
    "This is a great course. Take it just to go to the lectures (though they'll be up on OpenYale soon). Professor Freeman is fantastic and very friendly. There's a fair amount of reading, but not too much other work, and it's all interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a little difficult to participate in section when I hadn't done the reading, but the midterm, papers, and final were not too bad at all. It wasn't much more difficult than AP American History in high school, and Freeman is worth listening to.",
    "1 short essay, 1 long essay, midterm and a final... really not labor intensive though. the papers are easy and the exams are just id's and essays.",
    "take it",
    "Really good intro history class. If you are at all interested in the beginnings of our nation,definitely take this class. you wont be disappointed",
    "Great way to look at the American Revolution, a must take as a history major.",
    "This class covers the entire \"revolutionary\" period, from the 1760's to the early 1800's. You draw from multiple sources, including the professor's stories when writing papers, but the readings are interesting so it doesn't feel as much like work as other classes.Definitely recommend. This was an important period in America's History and understanding it goes a long way to understanding this country as a whole.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's fun, not too difficult, and you still learn something!"
