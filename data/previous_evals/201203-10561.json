   "comments": [
    "Surveys an increasingly obscure art form and applies general theories of art history and film theory to them in meaningful ways. The material is not the most exciting, but with professors and readings this good, even a slight interest is sufficient to recommend the course.",
    "This course provides an overview of the traditional painted panoramas and also traces the conceit of panoramic vision and related tropes through art in various media from that time (late 17th century) into contemporary modalities of art, film, and visual culture.I would recommend this course to other students, particularly if they are interested in a more thematic exploration in a variety of media.",
    "The course examined not just the history of the panorama but also those works that take up the same concepts set by the first format, such as the uninterrupted vista and ownership over a view.I would highly recommend the course to another student, for the professors and since the panorama (in some form) may be observed in such a wide array of media.",
    "The course gives literally a \"panoramic\" perspective of the panorama. I would recommend it for anyone who wants an exhaustive overview of the medium or is interested nineteenth century visual culture in general."

   "comments": [
    "This course made me reconsider the panoramic format, which I had known about but never explored. I could see myself applying the same ideas about the format to other projects in the future, which I find extremely valuable.",
    "The course was useful for my research because it delved into the modern, cinematic analogs of the panorama. The readings and discussions brought new insights to my interests in film exhibition\/apparatus theory."
