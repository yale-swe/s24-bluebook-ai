   "comments": [
    "A prerequisite for many science and engineering majors. A good course for those interested in learning techniques of integration.",
    "It's worth taking. Just stay on top of the homework and learn the material as you go, not all right before the midterms or final. Be sure to take it with a good TA. Shop!",
    "If unsure about your math skills (or it's been several years since AP calc), I'd start in MATH 112. I had rough time starting out in 115 as a senior. However, it's very doable. Make sure you get a good TA (Conor Frailey is awesome!) as some don't speak English well and others are mixture of abrasive and incompetent.",
    "If you're not a fan of Calculus or Math in general I would recommend finding another way to fulfill your QR. But if you have to take this class, take it with Conor Frailey.",
    "Only if they have to take it or if they are very interested in math.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "The class is more difficult than 112 by nature of the material, but if you shop around carefully for the section that best fits your learning style, you can be sucessful.",
    "This course is interesting, as someone who passably enjoyed AB Calc in high school. I'm not a science major, but math does come prettily easily to me, and this course was challenging but very manageable. Interestingly, I had a lot of trouble with the format of the econ lecture in the fall (Econ 115) but I really enjoyed the format of these classes, with around 20 in a class, so that you can ask questions and the teacher can tell when the class is not following. Overall, really glad I took it. Watch out for the final; it's a lot harder than the two midterms. If you can, take it with Conor Frailey! He was an amazing teacher! He really cared about us, was cheery early in the morning, supported us, and made himself very available to help us. Periodically during class he would ask us to raise our hands if we understood what was going on, and if we seemed unsure, he would make sure to coax us into asking questions and telling him what confused them so that the whole class could understand better. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this class to someone who was on good terms with math as a subject.",
    "The midterms and final are hard but the work is not so bad.",
    "Despite having done well on the B\/C AP exam in high school, I found this course challenging and interesting throughout. I had seen most of the concepts before, but didn't fully understand them in high school. I feel like I now have a much more solid grasp of integral calculus of a single variable. I would definitely recommend this course if you, like I did, feel shaky on things like integration by parts, calculating volumes, arc lengths, and surface areas, improper integrals, infinite series, taylor series, etc.",
    "115 is said to be one of the harder intro math classes, and I dare say it's true. Nevertheless, it's manageable if you are diligent enough and do enough problems. It's very important to have a good TA, so shop carefully. I recommend taking the class with Conor Frailey!! He's a good teacher, he makes sure everybody is fine with a new concept before moving on and I never felt embarrassed to speak up and ask a question no matter how dumb the question may seem to be. Also, his review sessions were the best and he would even stay with us as late as we need him to. Not many TAs would agree to do so."
