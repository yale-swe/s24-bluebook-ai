    "Good.",
    "The instructor made the course interesting",
    "interesting",
    "This course was exactly what it needed to be. It was concise and provided us with the necessary information that we need to know the limitations and boundaries of research ethics.",
    "It was annoying that we had to attend this course for two nights, but it was not nearly as bad as it could have been.",
    "Dr. Bruce did a very nice job",
    "Good introduction into ethics - an important topic everyone should be aware of",
    "I thought this was a good lecture series for our first year at YSPH to introduce a lot of topics that will be useful and necessary as we go forward in our public health careers. Not a lot of the material was new, but it was good to make sure everyone was on the same page.",
    "Strength: no work outside class, and informative",
    "Seriously, we have to review this course?? I thought this was a pointless annoying waste of a few hours invented for purely beaurocratic purposes.",
    "good overview of ethics and proper research conduct",
    "The seminar was helpful but I have also gone through the material many times previously.",
    "GREAT speakers this semester.",
    "This two-day seminar on ethics was a waste of time. There seemed to be a lack of seriousness from the beginning of the lecture. It felt like we were essentially just fulfilling a requirement. I thought it was disappointing that this opportunity was not used to stress the importance of ethics. There is such a cavalier attitude among students and academics that their work is ethical and that they would never do anything that would be \"unethical.\" Perhaps my perspective is biased since I have taken classes in bioethics, however I felt like this seminar was not taken seriously.",
    "The instructor was excellent given the very boring, but necessary, subject matter. The structure of the course only meeting a couple of time at the beginning of the semester seemed to work for everyone.",
    "Dr. Bruce did a great job of making the required lecture series both informative and entertaining.",
    "Poorly delivered...just another checked-box",
    "very interesting!",
    "Its a great introduction to research ethics. However, i think the second night was repetitive and unnecessary.",
    "entertaining and interesting",
    "The course was taught in seminar format. Perhaps we can break down into smaller groups to discuss ethical issues? I feel that would give the students more chance to participate.",
    "Good",
    "Didn't learn anything about ethics. This \"course\" was a joke.",
    "This was a poorly run course. Disorganized, professor sped through the material at a pace that student was unable to keep up any of the material.",
    "N\/A",
    "The course did not teach about research ethics. Rather, it was a two day seminar on what the instructor believed to be ethical and unethical.",
    "The guy did a nice job getting through the material while being as engaging as possible. It might be nice to offer the course twice, in different timeslots (Sat morning, maybe?) I had to miss a weekly seminar that only met twice to go to this workshop.",
    "It was an interesting approach to research ethics.It could have been more interactive- perhaps with small group discussion.",
    "fine",
    "very well done.",
    "This course seemed to me to be just a check box for the School of Public health, to show that all students have some ethics courses. I don't beleive anyone can learn anything from such a course.",
    "The course was good- it raised questions about ethical issues and provided me with insight on how to go about dealing with those issues.",
    "good",
    "This really was the same-old set of material we get in other bio-ethics courses. I'm just really thankful that it was only two lectures in length, but it really could be shortened down to just a single lecture.",
    "GREAT!",
    "This course should be a full semester class, not an awkwardly long lecture in the middle of dinner. I liked the topics covered, and think we *should* be learning about bioethics, but this isn't the best way to do it. Make it a requirement for a full semester, and cut a semester of epi.",
    "All right, required course that had to be taken.",
    "The two sessions were interesting, but I got the feeling that if we are really interested, it is up to us to pursue further information.",
    "This short course is on a very important topic, yet there is only 2 short periods worth dedicated for it. You cannot expect for anyone to walk away from such short durations of time and actually learn anything meaningful.If one MUST limit this subject to such a short period of time, then I would stick with the idea of getting an outside speaker who specializes in public health ethics. Outside speakers tend to be more enthusiastic speakers and refreshing for the audience. While this is my recommendation, my review of the instructor for this course (below) reveals that it is not necessarily the recipe for success.",
    "I think some sort of evaluation post-completion would be useful to incentivize better participation from the student body."

He was good at holding the attention of everyone in the auditorium while still conveying the necessary material.",

    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0great instructor. very interactive with the audience.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He was a good presenter. He encouraged participation from the students and answered our questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Although the instructor tried to use humor, I thought it came across as indifference. I don't think his type of humor and casual attitude is appropriate in this context. I think ethics is a serious topic.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0The instructor made inappropriate jokes about women, republicans, and religion. this is an ethics course after all. he should have exercised better judgement. i was very offended and almost walked out of the room. he has very biting humor that crossed the line, and i'm not the only person who felt offended.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0The instructor is extremely personable and related to the students well. I thiought some of the examples he gave were relevant. Also, his slides were well-done.",

    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He approached somewhat boring subject with his own humor and wit, and consequently, it made the course much more interesting. He also effectively promoted students' participation during the course, which I liked.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He was funny. It made a boring subject bearable with his humor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Disrespectful, made inappropriate comments, appeared to care less about the course and appeared to rush through the material for his own benefit.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Extremely unprofessional! At the end of the seminar, I understood Dr. Bruce's standing on ethics, but did not gain an understanding of the larger picture of the topic. Rather, Dr. Bruce spent two sessions giving students his opinion about black women on welfare, republicans and Texans. He did more to offend than teach, and I recommend that he keep his opinions to himself next year.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0The guy did a nice job getting through the material while being as engaging as possible.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Dr. Bruce provides good information, however in an attempt to energize his audience he tends to become slightly combative in his questioning.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Dr. Bruce was very engaging and intelligent.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0good",

    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He's great!",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Dr. Bruce was a great instructor- he gave insightful examples for me to think of how ethical dilemmas could actually play out in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0amazing",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He knew his material, but I felt condescended to, and was bored by his lecture style.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0He tried to spruce up the course that he knew was required but it is a pretty dry subject.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Entertaining",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0Dr Bruce is very entertaining and takes ethics seriously. I thought he was the perfect person to present these two sessions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0The instructor clearly was trying very hard to cater to the crowd, but in the end tried too hard and crossed too many lines (e.g. risky joking led to offensive jokes). While I appreciate his eagerness to please, his personality ended up being more memorable than the course material, and not in a positive manner.",
    "Instructor: Robert Douglas Bruce \u00a0While I appreciated the humor of the instructor and his desire to keep us engaged, I do think it detracted from the importance of the training. It might be better to try a different method of keeping the audience engaged."

Some content regarding ethics would have been nice. Also, I believe students need that, even a simple overview. We can' take for granted that each of us truly knows what is ethical, what is not, and how to assess a given situation.",

    "A pretty good illustration of the little emphasis that YSPH places on anything that cannot be quantitatively measured.",
