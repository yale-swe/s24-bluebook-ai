   "comments": [
    "A great seminar that you will enjoy going to! Professor Cameron is one of the nicest professors I have had at Yale!",
    "Yes, but be sure to do supplementary reading",
    "This is a great way to learn international political theory related to the European Union and to study particular facets of the EU in great depth.",
    "A survey of the European Union's history, development, and current issues. Well designed course with quality readings. Very effectively moderated by Professor Cameron.",
    "The subject of this seminar is fascinating--the EU is becoming one of the most important political systems in the world, and yet a lot of people here in the U.S. know next to nothing about how it works. We went through most of the main elements of the EU, starting with the history of European integration and moving on to the current institutions of the EU, the question of whether there's a \"democratic deficit\" in the EU, economic and monetary policy, immigration and citizenship, and defense policy. The reading was at a pretty normal level for a Poli Sci seminar (80-120 pages a week), except for the occasional week when we had to read an entire book. In-classdiscussions weren't always the most engaging, and I think a lot of us found ourselves zoning out on our laptops from time to time, Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable and the discussions (and of course the material itself) were really valuable.",
    "It is a great way to feel fluent in EU-issues. I don't feel like I am an expert in any one area, but I feel like I get big picture issues.",
    "A unique course with an excellent mix of students and a very talented instructor. If the subject matter is interesting to you, highly recommended.",
    "The course is a wonderful overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the European Union. This is an area that is especially important to be familiar with considering the current crises. The only problem is, the class tends to rely on prior experience with the EU, so it is a bit difficult for those first learning the topic.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who shares an interest in the European Union, but never had the possibility of systematically approaching the subject-matter. The reading are sometimes somewhat dry, but perhaps it is what it is required to really fix the institutional scheme in our minds."
