   "comments": [
    "\"It'll be a lot of work, you will hate doing the tedium of many of the assignments, you may not know what's going on more often than you'd like, but at least you'll finish with the class early.\"",
    "I strongly recommend this class to other students.",
    "As mentioned before, I would recommend it for those who had a solid background in Stats (taking INRL 771 the semester before turned out to be not enough of a fundamental basis for me), or for someone in the Sociology sequence. It really is a wonderful class, but a difficult one.",
    "Coming from outside of the sociology department, I would recommend this class to students ONLY if they have taken the first class in the sequence, or had a strong stats background, or if they are prepared to spend a very significant amount of time learning the course material.",
    "Sure.",
    "Here's what I would say to a fellow student:\"Stats II with Vida is a 'parade of statistical models,' minus the part of the parade where you're drinking and having fun, unless drinking your tears counts and beating your head over STATA constitutes 'having fun.' But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. So take it. It WILL be useful. You will use it. More often than you think.\"",
    "This is a stimulating class that deepens your knowledge about quantitative methods in sociology. It is a challenging class but you will get a lot of out it.",
    "Definitely take it if you are remotely interested in the social sciences.",
    "I would recommend the course to those who are willing to go further in statistics.",
    "The course teaches you how to interpret statistical findings in the social sciences. You also learn how to do basic methods. By the end of the class, you should be able to pick up most any piece of quantitative sociology and understand it. I would recommend it. Statistics I is not enough to be able to interpret most quantitative work.",
    "Overview of statistical models used for quantitative sociological studies. It provides the foundation for selecting the right model for empirical studies depending on research question and available data. Highly recommend for students interested in conducting quantitative studies or wanting to be better consumers of the literature.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but only if they'd taken the sociology stats 1 course, with which it dovetails."

   "comments": [
    "Like I said, I know more about statistics and various methods than I did 4 and a half months ago. Whether or not I'm even vaguely competent enough to use any of the methods covered is another matter entirely. Then again, what other faculty have said is that most statistics you end up teaching yourself in the course of wanting to answer particular questions in your own research, so...maybe I'm right where I'm supposed to be?",
    "Not Applicable",
    "It did deepen my knowledge of statistics. While I was coming from outside the sociology department, there was a fairly high degree of overlap.",
    "This class has been instrumental at helping me understand papers that are based on quantitative research. It has been a really important foundational class for me.",
    "This course gave a really helpful overview of a lot of methods in sociology!",
    "As I said earlier, it enabled me to read and interpret quantitative sociology. It also opened my eyes to the kind of questions that can be approached with quantitative methods. In this sense, it really deepened my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "Extremely useful for dissertation and research because I have the statistical tools for quantitative efforts.",
    "This course will have been very useful if I undertake quantitative work."
