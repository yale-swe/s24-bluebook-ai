    "French is French. A continuation of L1. If you love it, you'll still love it, and if you don't, you won't. It gets so much harder in L2, and I took French in high school. The professors are nice and you'll do fine in the end, but it's just fine.",
    "Great class...If you want to learn a language well, take it. It requires hard work, but Prof. Ngame makes the work worth it. Take Ngame if you can! Just a fantastic class.",
    "It's a heavy course that demands a lot of time, but it is definitely effective as well.",
    "French 120 is the continuation of French 110. There are the same weekly tests that can either be a good thing (because you are forced to remember vocabulary and grammar) or a bad thing (because you do not retain what you have remembered). There is a lot of work done from the course packet during class, which are often very similar to the test. The class meets during reading week, which is okay because it is good review for the final. At the end of this class, you will definitely see improvement of your French reading, writing and speaking. If you put the work in, you will likely be able to hold a basic conversation in French, come up with your own story to write, and know a lot of French grammar."
