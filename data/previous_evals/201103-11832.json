    "Great class, take it with Marta. Highly recommended. I cannot speak any other languages and it is not that difficult.",
    "Absolutely take Portuguese! Not a lot of work but you still learn a lot. Marta is an amazing teacher and you will actually look forward to going to class every day. Definitely one of the better languages to take at Yale (and it's also very useful: 5th most spoken language in the world)."
