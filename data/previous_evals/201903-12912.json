    "Not all readings felt necessary or were discussed in class, which was fine, though it might have been better to classify some as required and others as supplemental. Otherwise, the teaching was great, in-class discussions were always lively, and deep dives from individual classmates provided a good way to engage with the material from ones own area of expertise."

    "Yes! I hope undergrads take this as a lecture in the spring. Even if Classics isnt your thing, there are a lot of parallels with more contemporary times, and you dont need as much context as with many other classical works to understand the readings here. Moreover, there are so many ways to engage with the readings from different perspectives, including philosophy, art history, and even science.",
