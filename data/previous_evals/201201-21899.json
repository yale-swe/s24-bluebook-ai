   "comments": [
    "This is a very solid, interesting lecture that provides a good grounding in some of the major modern poets. If you are an English major, I think you should absolutely take this class to round out your knowledge of the canon. If you're not an English major, take it anyway because it's a good class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The syllabus provides an excellent view into modern poetry. Chambers leads lecture in an understandable and organized fashion.",
    "great, take it if you want to learn how to read poetry--an important life skill you probably won't get anywhere but college.",
    "This is a fantastic class that deals with many great poets. Professor Chambers is a terrific lecturer. You'll like some poets more than others, and you'll sometimes wish you had more time to discuss individual poems, but overall this is a great survey course.",
    "It's a great class, with a reasonable workload, and an amazing syllabus. Take it if you like poetry, and finally want to read the great modernists!",
    "Although modern poetry itself is not easy (especially with the later poets like Moore and Stevens), the workload for this class is really manageable, and if you're an English major who's already taking an intense seminar, this class is a pretty low-stress credit. The readings don't take very long at all, and the two papers (both comparative) are fairly straightforward. The midterm was entirely based on the poems she had gone through in class, and given that each lecture only covers 3-6 works, IDs are not a problem at all (the final threw up a few obscure ones she hadn't touched on, though). I also really enjoyed Susan Chambers's teaching style. She's very organized and writes out 3-4 themes on the board before starting each lecture, then goes through them sequentially in a plain-speaking yet insightful style. Do yourself a favor and keep off Facebook during class: her analyses are detailed and precise and they help a lot in working toward the broader themes that she develops throughout the semester.",
    "In depth look at some of the most important poets from Yeats to Auden (including WWI, Harlem Renaissance, both English and American writers). Definitely a \"real\" class and not an easy one at that, but also approachable to beginning English students or non-majors. Also, EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU LIKE POETRY, YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. SHOP IT AT LEAST. It may, as it did for me, change your mind. Also--until Modern Poetry, I had never taken a class where I felt as if I was actually deepening my understanding of the material while taking the midterm and the final. This is indicative of how thought-provoking and thorough the class was in every respect: lectures, section, and the papers, as well as the tests. Now I not only feel like I can talk about each of the poets on the syllabus without sounding like a fool, but I also have gained an appreciation for modern poetry (and poetry in general) that I know will stay with me for the rest of my life.",
    "A good class, not fantastic, but solid.",
    "310 is a survey of English and American modernist (the \"-ist\" is important, and weirdly absent from the course title) poets. Worth taking, obviously, if you're interested in the subject. (A word to the wise: check out the syllabus before you take this course. It should be roughly the same as that of Langdon Hammer's version on Yale Open Classes; if you're not reading Pound, Crane, Stevens etc., you're being airdropped smack into the middle of one of academia's more ludicrous ideological wars.)",
    "Take this class if you love poetry. It's amazing. You read all the modern poems you feel like you should, and all the modern poems that you always loved but weren't sure why. A few caveats: Susan Chambers has a very distinctive style of speaking (lilting, soft, almost sing-song) that I first I found enchanting and by the end drove me crazy. If you don't like it during shopping period, you'll hate it by the end of the semester. Furthermore, this class is aimed at a pretty high level - where my other English lectures had a mix of sophomores and juniors from all majors, this one was mostly junior and senior English majors. It makes section intimidating. However, I found that most of them didn't go to class regularly, so if you go to class regularly you'll have a leg up. Finally, the TA's weren't great.",
    "Modern Poetry is an excellent overview of the major modern poets. The order of the course is vaguelychronological, but focuses primarily on the characters and poetic projects of the big name poets. The course is interested in themes such as what makes an American poet, the relationship between the poet and the political sphere, and the ways poets use language, sound, and traditional structures in their work. I would definitely recommend this class. It is engaging and thought-provoking, with a good reading selection.",
    "Take this course. As a student who entered with a limited sole of familiarity with modern poetry, the texts included on the syllabus proved accessible and enriching. Professor Chambers is fantastic as well.",
    "This class was light and the reading was good. The midterm, final and the papers do require work but overall it's an easy class. I would recommend taking a seminar though, where you can think about fewer poems more. Susan Chambers' lectures are no particularly great.. rarely do they make critical arguments. I trying to cover material, her lectures merely touch upon themes in poems, as opposed to dissecting and analyzing them in depth.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in getting to know more about these poets OR if you already love them -- you'll get a new perspective on most of them, which was the most surprising and I think best thing about the class.",
    "The reading list is great, but I felt that the lectures were often repetitive and made too many generalizations. I wished we had studied more cultural and historical context for the poems that we read. Lectures weren't all that inspiring. But I would take the class if you want a reason to read and write about a great set of poets, and are willing to do a lot of thinking on your own and engage with the material independently.",
    "Take this course. If you gain nothing else from the course, you'll read a really nice assortment of poems.",
    "Great lecture class",
    "If you think you would be interested in any of the poetry, I would recommend the class. I thought it was wonderful. Professor Chambers has interesting insights, and the poetry is great. I'm not an English major. Don't be scared of it if you aren't an English major",
    "Overall, an enjoyable introduction to most of the Modernist Poets who I've been meaning to read for years, and never got around to. The reading is the highlight of the course, without a doubt; lectures range from mediocre to genuinely illuminative.Most of the writers were great, with the exception of Auden, who felt rushed at the end of the course, and somehow less satisfying within the trajectory of the class.Professor Chambers gives enjoyable, if only occasionally breath-taking, lectures that feel more approachable and less conceited than the English Department standard. She has a more understated, approachable style which some people love and others are really put off by. Make sure you know which camp you're in before the course.",
    "Don't take it. Syllabus is amazing but everything else is pretty painful. Just read the poems on your own and listen to some of Langdon Hammer's lectures on Yale Open Courses if you're interested in modern poetry.",
    "Pretty easy lecture course with a good reading list. Take this if you are interested in modernism at all, it is a good background. Lectures could be a little dull and not very illuminating but probably still worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone hungry for an education in these poets. However, since the most satisfying aspect of this course is the discovery of their works, anyone with more than passing familiarity with these authors might not find the course so rewarding."
