    "Really time consuming if you're trying to do it right. And so pretty hard. Not at all a chill class",
    "Take it. I could not imagine a better language program. You learn the same way kids learn, so there's very little translating in your head. You learn to converse quickly.",
    "Very intense workload, but if you are passionate and driven to learn the language, it will definitely pay off. Amazed at how much we learned in one semester.",
    "If you want to learn french and are willing to put forward the work this is the way to do it.",
    "What a pleasant surprise! This course ended up being my favorite of the semester. Catherine was a wonderful professor even though it was her first time teaching, she did a very good job. She was always available to help outside of class at office hours, and was genuinely invested in every student in our class. The curriculum (which is the same for all sections of the course) is very well structured. I liked how it emphasized developing an intuitive feel for the language, instead of just building vocabulary and memorizing verb tenses. The French in Action videos are cheesy but charming and surprisingly effective. The syllabus and the French in Action textbook recommend that you watch the video(s) after viewing them in class on Tuesday, then do the audio work-up using the workbook, then do all of the assigned workbook exercises BEFORE you open up the textbook. This is the method I followed starting the first week and through week 11 or so. Then, I realized that there is a MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE way to leverage the resources of the course using the following steps: (1) Watch the video(s) Monday evening or Tuesday morning BEFORE seeing them for the first time in class; (2) Watch them again after class; (3) Listen to the audio from the video while following along with the transcription in the textbook; (4) Look at the side boxes in the textbook that present new words and phrases (they are introduced with helpful photos and drawings to help you glean their meaning, since there are no English explanations); (5) Do the audio workup, which breaks down the audio from the video, while again following along in the textbook; (6) Do the assigned homework exercises in the workbook; (7) Watch the video(s) again the night or the afternoon before the weekly exam. If you follow these steps instead, you will find your understanding of the language firm up remarkably fast. Yes, it will take longer up front watching the videos twice and doing the audio workup is a bit of a time investment (that's why I recommend watching the videos once through the night before you see them in class) but you will find yourself flying through the exercises much faster, and the audio workup will feel much more satisfying (i.e. you won't feel like most of the questions go over your head). Besides, the more you hear the language, the better your aural comprehension skills will be. One highlight of the course: after the first couple of weeks, the exams start to feature Bach's beautiful Jesu: Joy of Man's Desiring.",
    "I would say that French 110 is a very engaging and fruitful class. I would happily recommend it to another student, while reminding them that it is also very time consuming and requiring of a lot of effort in order to succeed",
    "YES! The textbook, teachers, and videos are all so helpful that it cut study time in half - doing homework was basically studying, and it was fun! The exercises break down things that seem difficult into very doable chunks, so I never felt lost. Overall a great time.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course. The pace is reasonable and it's taught in a way that will make you remember the most important concepts and the most idiomatic way of speaking (as opposed to awkward lists of rules and vocab). Things might seem tricky when you're introduced to them, but everything becomes much more comfortable because you use it all the time. This class is great.",
    "A good class if you want to learn French. There's .5-1.5 hours of homework every night but it's all easy, if a bit tedious. If you do the homework attentively you don't have to study much for the weekly tests and you basically learn the language automatically. For example I didn't have to memorize a vocabulary list a single time. I recommend taking the class with Professor Chiabaut, as she is excellent."
