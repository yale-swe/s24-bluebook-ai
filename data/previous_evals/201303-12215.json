   "comments": [
    "This class is not like any other class. It will stretch you to think out of your area of study, out of your time of study, and out of your discipline. You will get engaging lectures from professors who have a lot of experience and can talk about pretty much anything for a pretty long time. If you can stand to be in class for four hours every Thursday afternoon, this class is definitely the one for you.",
    "Invaluable.",
    "I would totally recommend it.",
    "A multi-disciplinary engagement with important (and highly interesting) issues related agrarian issues. I would certainly recommend the class to other students provided they have interest in agrarian issues.",
    "I would, with the caveat that it takes up a lot of one's time and energy. The course was very instructive on a number of topics, some of which were things I never would have learned on my own. If one is interested in agrarian history, politics, or conflict, this class is essential. If not, it may prove more work and time than you'd like.",
    "It is a great space to do creative work. Take this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a good interdisciplinary course, something that can be hard to find. The students in this course come from a variety of disciplines - anthropology, law, history, political sciences, environmental studies, etc, as well as from PhD, MA, and BA programs. It is good to learn how to speak about subjects that we study in ways that are accessible to others, and this course allows students to learn from and have discussions with others. In addition, it is useful for students who are interested in agrarian studies, peasants, food and land policies, the economic issues connected to these policies, and related topics."

   "comments": [
    "Although the material didn't directly engage my research, it forced me to think in new ways, which is never a bad thing. The broadness of the final assignment also allowed me to do work which is related to my dissertation, but from a different angle, which was very helpful. In terms of the discipline, I don't think this course helped me that much - but that's all right - one of the reasons I liked the course was that it took an explicitly discipline-bending approach to scholarship.",
    "This class deepened my knowledge of social science.",
    "The course was particularly useful in dragging me away from the some of the commonsense and conceits of my discipline in order to see how other disciplines engage with shared issues.",
    "Being in an interdisciplinary degree program at a very discipline-centric university, I found the Agrarian Societies course a helpful respite. It was nice to interact with students, read from literatures, and learn from professors from a variety of backgrounds and interests.",
    "This course allowed me to learn more about a broad range of issues related to agrarian societies. I was able to use this course to gain a broader understanding of issues that are related to my research."
