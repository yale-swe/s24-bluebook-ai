   "comments": [
    "If you can take it with Prof. Alexandrov, do it. She is phenomenal! She really cares about her students, and is exciting and fun as a teacher. Class with her was wonderful.",
    "Take this class and take it with Professor Alexandrov!! L3 is basically a review of L1 and L2 and the workload is significantly less than L2. Professor Alexandrov is absolutely wonderful and really takes the time to make sure you understand every topic. Highly recommend this class!",
    "Alexandrov is a gem of a human being and a great professor, but will also eviscerate you when grading exams and quizzes. Choose professors wisely. Lots of busy work, but you will have a good grasp of intermediate spanish after completion.",
    "This class is based heavily in conversation with peers, especially whoever's sitting next to you. I would recommend taking it with Professor Alexandrov, as she is very high energy and won't leave you bored. I remember being surprised every time class ended because it seemed to go by so quickly. You'll be introduced to great short stories, music, and films in Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. The supplementary materials and the opportunity to participate in classroom discussions in the language mean that I was able to leave the semester feeling that my Spanish was significantly improved.",
    "I would not recommend it to a student like me who struggles with languages. It is just too hard and has no patience for students like me who struggle with spelling or grammar. I would say it is a course that focuses on grammar that theoretically helps you learn Spanish, but it may discourage you so much you want to quit the language all together.",
    "See above.",
    "Only if you really want to learn the language"
