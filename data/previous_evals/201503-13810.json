    "This course is great if you are deeply interested in the subject matter.",
    "if there is anything that needs \"development assistance\", it is the syllabus for this course. at least half the academic papers are written by sketchy dudes with sketchy analyses. journalistic sources are not much better. and too many books. no one likes books. books are not legit. fortunately, the conclusions drawn from this class are reasonable, as it takes a realistic view of foreign aid (i.e. it is not very effective and usually gets wasted or goes into the pockets of Mugabe). and honestly, if you know anything about how politics works and\/or how to write a research paper thats better than the average 8th-grade essay, you will do well in this class.",
    "No",
    "Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to and you dont mind not going to a super boring class and just doing the assignments and studying on your own. Its not very hard but its exhausting to take a course that you just really are not interested at all.",
    "TAKE IT! Great class, important topic, amazing professor. Lots of readings, but 75% are very interesting. Take it!!",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes",
    "Not much work. Lectures can be dry, even though simon makes some not terrible jokes--you're gonna be on facebook 90% of the time during class. If you're taking it, it's probably because you need it as a senior, and it's not a terrible option.",
    "Not too hard of a course, interesting but Professor Simon is pretty monotone and it felt like we ran out of any real new information about halfway through the semester.",
    "The class is a lot of work: multiple chapters of reading, section readings, a midterm, final 15 page paper, 5 page book review, and an Op-ed. That being said the material is so so so interesting and if your major is cross-listed under this course TAKE THIS CLASS. Especially in today's world understanding Developmental assistance is so key and I promise you if you really commit to the class and do the readings and the assignments you will find yourself exposed to an insanely complex but fascinating network of donors, recipients, and everything in between.",
    "Politics of Development Assistance had a ton of potential, but ultimately fell short of my expectations. While, at its best, the course provided interesting readings, important insight on ODA, and strong lectures from Professor Simon, it often felt disorganized. Professor Simon deserves credit for his insight and for being available to meet with students. However, section had almost no correlation with the class, and was totally monotonous and so easy it felt patronizing. At the same time, grading was arbitrary and felt totally ridiculous giving the level of competence coming from my TA. Overall, I would stay away from this class unless some big changes are made.",
    "survey class of the history of aid giving. you definitely have to be interested in it to like it",
    "For students interested in going into global health or understanding developmental disparities, this class will elucidate on issues very pertinent to that and gives a clear picture of the flaws and potential solutions to aid."
