   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a wonderful class, whether you've done painting before or not. Everyone improved significantly. The homework load is also very manageable, some take longer than others, but Anna realized that and gives you ample time. You'll start off with only black paint, then work up to black and white, then you get limited palettes before you can use whatever you want. There's a lot of experimentation involved in mixing, but that's the best way to learn! (but also the easiest way to waste time) If you want to add a 5th class or want exposure to the art department, but don't want to take Basic Drawing, TAKE THIS! Anna is the best person ever.",
    "Only if you have a lot of time!",
    "It is not the best for beginning artists -- you'd do better finding a class elsewhere that's more focused on strict instruction. This is best for people who can already paint fairly well and would like practice in tough situations or work on developing their styles. That being said, I enjoyed the variety of assignments this semester.",
    "This is a really good class to take with Betbeze-- it's not too challenging for the beginner, but does give you a chance to paint if you want to. You will have to do the work and you will have to show up on time though to really get stuff out of it, so make sure you will commit.",
    "I would recommend this class because painting is cathartic, balances out a heavy reading\/pset schedule, and it is satisfying to see your progress over the course of a semester, starting with nothing and ending with a basic ability to render images on a canvas. Cool!",
    "Yes. Not too much of a time commitment, but you learn a lot. You'll have some great pieces you are proud of in the end.",
    "Painting Basics is an excellent course for anyone who wants to learn how to paint in acrylic better, whether they are beginning or experienced. It is a fair workload each week, but the work is painting and not unenjoyable.",
    "I think it was a wonderful opportunity to dedicate solid time to painting, but I did not feel like I learned a lot. I would recommend it if you love to paint. Also Anna is a great, cool lady.",
    "Yes I would! It was a fun class and I learned a lot. I w",
    "definitely take this class if you want to be introduced to different techniques in painting. the course is divided into three sections: still life, landscape, and portrait. we spent most time on still life and got to paint outside a few times for landscape. the final assignment is a painting that incorporates all three on a larger canvas and it's really enjoyable to do because you can personalize it. anna is great and accommodating if we feel like we need more time for an assignment. workload was about 1-3 hours, occasionally longer, each week depending on the assignment. we took a few trips to the art gallery which was fun. good way to break up a schedule full of reading-intensive courses because you can de-stress with painting homework. buying supplies is maybe $120 total a semester",
    "Absolutely take this class to compliment a load of classes that is very homogenous, or all in your major. It gets to be a lot of work toward the end of the semester tho, so be prepared for that."
