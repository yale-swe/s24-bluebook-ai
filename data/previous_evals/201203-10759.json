   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to another student because I think that the poem is important and that it serves as an anchor for beginning to work with manuscripts, Middle English, and even early modern rare books. I would suggest that anyone new to the work have some extra support in both Middle English and manuscript studies (perhaps a very basic lecture at the Beinecke early in the semester?).I would summarize the class as an exploration of Piers Plowman with attention to the circulation of this and related texts in the 14th century; the poem's narrative structure and meaning, alliterative style, use of dream vision and allegory, and production.",
    "An excellent introduction to an extremely complex poem that is fundamental to thinking about late medieval literature. I would recommend the course to anyone already interested in the field, but perhaps not as an introduction to the field (due to the nature of the poem itself)."

   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read a very difficult poem that explored the relationship between poetry and theology, and much more. I also learned that one must consider how a text came to be. I was introduced to a number of texts and writers related to Langland, the likes of which I am confident I would not have read if not in the context of the course. The course has allowed me to try out a field in which I hope to continue work, and, for example, to confirm that I do enjoy Middle English, and hope to improve my ability to read it in the future. I learned about some of the major characteristics of 14th century England society (and literary history, especially the \"plowman tradition.\" One other thing I learned from the course (and I could go on listing if I had the time) is about the types of work other students are doing, as independent research was a significant component of theclass. I also was able to continue exploring the specific topic of medieval views on usury and avarice, on which I focus in a current research project of my own.",
    "This course definitely helped me learn about medieval literary history and the role of book history in modern criticism. Piers probably won't be central to my dissertation, however!"
