   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of calculus II.",
    "Having taken AP Calc BC in high school I found this course pretty similar in terms of the material covered although this course had more topics. Additionally, in order to do well in this course, I think you need to have a strong grasp of the conceptual part of the topics, which my calc BC class didn't really prepare me for making this class rather difficult for me.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematics topics to various word problems. I learned how to connect mathematics concepts across various types of problems.",
    "I learned skills in evaluating integrals, series, polar coordinates and differential equations.",
    "I developed new ways of tackling calculus problems.",
    "Throughout the course, I learned to use many resources to develop a thorough understanding of the class material. I was forced to use office hours, peer tutors, and online resources.",
    "The only new knowledge I developed in this class is the testing of series, since I needed to take it to ensure continuity with my A level syllabus",
    "I believe that I have a better understanding of the principles of calculus, as well as their applications in the real world.",
    "From a purely mathematical point of view, I learned how to use series and test for their convergence; how to create and use power series; and how to use calculus on parametric and polar functions. Skills wise, I developed my analysis and problem solving through the challenging homework and test questions. I also improved myself my teamwork abilities through the daily group work.",
    "Practical knowledge and applicable examples of Integral Calculus.",
    "I learned how to apply reason and logic to many creative problems outside of the typical realm of math questions.",
    "I learned calculus and stuff"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I enjoy the flipped classroom model but I found the in-class component to be the strongest part of the class.",
    "Strength: Brett was a great professor. He tried to keep class engaging by using different methods of teaching, such as using clickers and encouraging interaction between students. He was also extremely patient, always staying behind after class to entertain questions. He made certain that all students were able to follow his explanations and tried different ways of explaining content when we didn't. His patience made it very comfortable for anyone to clarify or ask questions without feeling self-conscious. Weakness: I disliked the flipped classroom concept. Difficult concepts are best explained by a professor so you can immediately clarify doubts and ensure that you grasp the topic well. Once you fall behind with just one video, you start to fall behind in class as well, which is really challenging in the long run.",
    "I didn't like how the course was flipped. I didn't find the prep videos and problems that students had to complete before class very helpful. The course followed the textbook pretty well, but I would sometimes be confused whether a part of the textbook was needed for the class\/tests.",
    "The strength of this course is the videos since they are organized and clear. The weaknesses of this course include the prep-problems and the hard p-sets.",
    "I liked the reversed teaching method of the class. The abstractness of the course whereby I mean that one does not know where to apply all the strategies in real life is a weakness of this course.",
    "I did not like the flipped way of learning.",
    "Since there is so much emphasis on this class being flipped (with videos the night before), I think those videos should really teach us things that will ultimately be on the final\/ midterms.",
    "I dont like the flipped class",
    "The flipped layout of this course was not enjoyable. It also had a lot of students who had taken BC calculus, making it hard for students who had never seen the material to succeed.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of this course in sections, but I did not enjoy the flipped nature of the course which relied too heavily on student preparation.",
    "The strength of this course is that, through the challenging problem sets and exams, it forces you to really understand the math that you are doing, instead of just going through the motions. The greatest weakness that I found with the course is the lack of practice problems. We watched prep videos, did up to 5 prep problems, and then a few more in class, but other than that, there were no practice problems. When it came time for problem sets or exams, I was not comfortable tackling the challenging problems because I never practiced the easier ones. I realized this very late in the semester, and only then did I start doing more practice from the textbook. I think the course can be improved by giving students more practice problems, either as small homework assignments or in class activities. It would help with the understanding of the material as well as preparation for the exam.",
    "Some of the pre-class videos weren't very topical, might need to update a few in the future.",
    "Some topics are covered too quickly. But in general, I liked the flipped classroom model, it encouraged me to be proactive in my learning. Also, would be great to get more in-depth feedback on Math Exams.",
    "The lectures were well taught, and I liked how we were able to work through problems together, instead of just listening the whole time. However, I didn't really like the prep videos - daily homework with problems (and even a video) that went over what we learned that day would have been much more effective in helping me learn.",
    "I thought the videos before each class were useful in that they allowed me to feel prepared for the new material. However, sometimes some of the prep problems were difficult to answer before being given a complete introduction to the material. I think those questions should have been reviewed in class the following day.",
    "I don't think the flipped class is very useful. While the videos can cover basic how to dos and methods, it does not go in depth. Furthermore, instead of supplementing the basic videos with harder problems and showing us how to do problems and giving us examples, class time would often consist of another repeat of the video, which was quite useless."

   "comments": [
    "This class is really only necessary if it is a requirement or you are really passionate about learning calculus. I personally did not really enjoy the content and flipped classroom concept of the course, and would have preferred not to take it if I could've avoided it (however, this may just be because I don't really like math). At times it felt like the concepts were being rushed through, and if you didn't understand the prep videos you were supposed to do before class, questions brought up\/discussions during class time could be confusing. The only redeeming thing about this course (IMO) was my professor Brett. If you do this course be sure to do it with him if he is still around because he is extremely patient and explains concepts really well.",
    "I took this class a a requirement, but I don't think I would take it if I didn't have to. I didn't feel the material was effectively taught, probably having to do in part with the flipped structure of the class. However, I did enjoy the amount of practice tests that were available for students prior to the exams. I also loved the availability of the peer tutors in helping me with my psets and to better understand the material.",
    "Yes, because if you do the work and pay attention in class, it is feasible to understand what is going on and do well on assessments.",
    "I would recommend this course to another prospective STEM major. It is a good introduction to calculus at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student had taken Calc BC.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student who has not seen any of the material on the course because the majority of students have, which makes the course too hard for students who haven't taken BC calc or A level maths or further maths.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course due to its content.",
    "Yes; good, interesting content. No surprises.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a solid foundation for Math at Yale and teaches important and practical concepts.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this as a fun course to take if someone needs a QR. However, I would say that you end up learning a lot.",
    "no, flipped course is bad, better to self study more efficient, skip to 120"
