    "I would recommend it for a generally easy Arabic class and if you plan to go to Lebanon or Jordan. It's a overall summary of colloquial.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to gain a basic understanding of Levantine Arabic as a jumping-off point for traveling or doing an immersion to expand his\/her knowledge.",
    "Sort of. It's fun, but you won't really learn anything.",
    "I think that the class could have potential, but you should see what changes have been made in the curriculum and style of teaching between then and when you are thinking of taking it, to see if steps are being taken to increase\/better use the time spent to practice actual use of the language.",
    "Take the class if you want to begin learning some very basic differences between MSA and spoken Arabic, but only if you feel you have a solid grasp of MSA and a decent grasp of vocabulary; otherwise the videos and materials are overly difficult to understand.",
    "I would recommend the class as an antidote to the MSA sequence at Yale - you learn the Arabic people actually speak in the Levant (and hence, how to better understand Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, and Lebanese, and talk to them without being laughed at for using fusha). However, if you are going to take it instead of continuing to L5 MSA (which I did), definitely get a tutor or organize some program for the first semester so you don't lose all your Arabic in the interim."
