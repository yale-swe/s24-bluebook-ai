   "comments": [
    "It's a Shakespeare class, and anyone working on a Ph.D. in English should take it.",
    "This is a wonderful class for those who love Shakespeare and for those who are interested in becoming more familiar with his works. It also provides a good introduction to the body of criticism on the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course both as a Shakespeare survey or revision, but also as an way into the study of early modern drama from a theatrical point of view. Strong discussion of a Shakespeare play each week, with a good selection of readings. The seconary articles will probably not all be to your taste, but they cover a lot of ground between them and you will likely find that at least a couple will be good for your paper.",
    "Yes, for students interested in combining literary and performance-oriented critical approaches to drama, not limited to Shakespeare.",
    "Great course for those interested in Shakespeare OR theater history\/performance studies. An ideal way to fulfill the Early Modern requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would certainly recommend English 608 to another graduate student: the course would be an excellent survey of Shakespeare for any graduate student as well as a helpful course for students who specialize in the period."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me contextualize my prior knowledge of Shakespeare's work. It was thought-provoking, up-to-date and inspiring. I anticipate drawing on the criticism assigned for class in my dissertation.",
    "I feel I got a good taste of this side of the profession. The Renaissance is not my main area of interest, so I doubt it will have a srong bearing on my future work, but I am glad that I took this course as my Early Modern requirement.",
    "I was a TA for a undergraduate Shakespeare course this same semester, with several plays overlapping from the course reading. This course was immensely helpful in preparing my own list of discussion topics for each section meeting.",
    "This course exposed me to a variety of theoretical\/historical methodologies at the same time that it gave me a much more granular picture of the Elizabethan\/Stuart stage. This will be very helpful if I end up writing an early modern dissertation."
