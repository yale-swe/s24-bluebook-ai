    "I thought the course was a great overview of statistical topics in genetics; the class was very straightforward and informative! Good class overall!",
    "I really learned A LOT from this course since a variety of topics in genetics and bioinfo had been discussed with clear details and organized order. Also the weekly assignments are helpful, re-emphasizing the most useful essence of each leture, with both theoritical and computational practice. I can tell that the instructor and TF paid quite a mount of time and effort in this course.",
    "This is an intense course covering a lot of material. The assignments were helpful in engaging with and understanding course content, but they were time consuming. Dr. Zhao was very knowledgeable of the content and did a pretty good job presenting it.",
    "The last two homework assignments could be better - they are too simple."

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0I thought the instructor was very clear in his explanations; although the slides are hard to understand without his lecture, in addition to his lecture, all of the concepts made sense. Good instructor for this class overall!",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0The lectures are very informative in terms of contents! I mostly enjoys the lecture but sometimes the instructor speaks too fast to keep me paying attention to his words...",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0He is clearly very knowledgeable regarding the course content, but his lectures were sometimes a little difficult to follow as he would explore relevant tangents.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Great. Open a new world for me."

    "I think this course is perfect as a start of preparing someone who intend to study genetics and bioinfo. It's like a comprehensive overview for this field of study.",
    "This was a very intense class requiring a good knowledge of probability theory and R programming. This course is time consuming, but it's a very good overview of how bioinformatics techniques are designed and implemented. I would recommend it to students who are comfortable with proofs and programming, but I would not recommend it to the average MPH student (except bioinformatics students).",
    "Great. Yes."
