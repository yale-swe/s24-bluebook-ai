    "If you are interested in geochemistry and\/or stable isotopes in the ocean-atmosphere-surface rock system, then I would recommend this class. I think it was telling that we had a really wide range of interests and backgrounds in theclass, from paleontologists to various geochemists to tectonics people.",
    "We read a new paper each class and discussed it. There was a designated student who lead the discussion. It was an informal atmosphere that was very conducive to asking questions and learning from each other.",
    "Great seminary if you are interested in numerous topics in geology including paleontology, geochemistry, atmospheric chemistry etc.."

   "comments": [
    "For me, this class was extremely helpful in learning 1) about how various elements are cycled through the major environmental reservoirs and 2) to see common, recurring themes in elemental and stable isotope geochemistry.",
    "This course allowed me to think in terms of traditional elemental cycling, such as carbon, oxygen, and phosphorous, as wellas more non-traditional elemental cycling, such as lithium. After the course, I was able to get a better grasp on geochemistry in a global context.",
    "This provided a great background to the history of scientific inquiry of biogeochemistry. The simple modeling and new geochemical proxies are very important for me to understand and expand my knowledge base for brainstorming future potential projects."
