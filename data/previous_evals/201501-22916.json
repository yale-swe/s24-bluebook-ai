    "Math 480 is the senior seminar which should be taken if one is not doing an independent study option. The courses consists of giving presentations for 2-3 days per student in addition to providing commentary on others' talks. The course is fairly easy and touches on a wide variety of subjects; Frenkel is a good instructor.",
    "No choice?",
    "This course is okay. It's required for the major unless you go to the trouble to try to write a thesis. You'll get a good opportunity to practice reading and synthesizing \"real\" math papers as well as presenting\/leading a class. You don't get much feedback, though, beyond what the professor tells you after your presentation. It's also really hard to learn from the other students' presentations, so the valuable part of the class is you preparing and giving your presentation."
