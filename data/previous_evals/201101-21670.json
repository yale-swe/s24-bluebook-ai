    "Unique approach to Japanese history. I would recommend some knowledge of Japanese history before you take this class; the evolution of gender and sexuality in Japan will likely make much more sense that way. It can also be very easy to lose sight of what major events were actually happening in Japan during certain sections of the course.Overall I learned quite a bit about gender and sexuality in Japan. Professor Botsman is a superb teacher, and although I wish he \"taught\/lectured\" more rather than promoting discussion, you can really tell that he knows his stuff. Great professor and really approachable.",
    "Yes, I would really recommend this class. The material is really interesting, and the readings are organized around themes in a coherent manner.",
    "Take any class Botsman offers. He fills in a gaping hole of Japanese history not otherwise covered substantially within any of the EAST courses.At first glance it might be easy to write off this class as a wishy-washy humanities type course, but it covers a huge amount of very valuable Japanese history. Even without a background in Japanese language, culture, or history, this class serves as a valuable introduction to a broad swath of formative events throughout Japanese history, using the lens of gender and sexuality to examine specific topics at various stages of Japan's formation.Botsman is a very smart and accessible professor, who handles a good mix of playfulness and serious discussion in each lecture. His seminar exemplifies a lot of the ideals of what a discussion seminar should be, giving individual students responsibility to introduce and lead a given week's discussion, while he guides the discussion and makes students arrive at a lot of the big conclusions (or big debates). He's very good at playing devil's advocate and really challenging students to defend their views.",
    "The history department has a real lack of classes on Japanese history and Prof Botsman has designed this class to act almost as a survey of Japan's history, though it focuses through the lens of gender. I took it because I needed a rest of world and it was a very interesting one. If you're interested in gender history or east asian history or even just a fairly approachable junior seminar, take this. Professor Botsman is really wonderful and dedicated to meeting with students and helping us out.",
    "Yes-- this course was somewhat organizationally scattered, but if your'e interested in the subject, the readings were well-chosen.",
    "This course has a lot of potential, but it needs to be streamlined better than it currently is. The biggest problem with it is that discussion drags. The reading actually is pretty compelling, but for some reason we couldn't have a lively discussion to save our lives for the vast majority of our meetings. Botsman is a lovely person, and he goes out of his way to help his students, so I'm really not sure what the problem was this semester. I'm hoping it was just a fluke, because the History department is sorely lacking in interesting \"Other World\" classes.",
    "The material was incredibly interesting, and Professor Botsman is very nice and funny. However, discussions were often quite dead because many students didn't do the reading. I think that if everyone had put in the effort, this class would have been exceptional.",
    "Professor Botsman is awesome and the readings are fascinating, so I definitely would recommend taking it.I approached from a stronger understanding of Japanese history and weaker one of gender history, so it was nice to fill in the holes. One of the useful things about the class is that it spans such a wide range of interests that it's guaranteed that some of your classmates will have knowledge different enough to learn a lot from, but that also means that the class depends heavily on the people in it. Professor Botsman knows his subject backwards and forwards, too, so even when the class doesn't have much to say, he will, and it will be fascinating.Definitely a class to sign up for and go to, and if you like your classmates, absolutely take it, because the rest will be spectacular."
