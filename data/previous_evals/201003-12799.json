    "This is a course that has one (usually mathematically-based) article per week and one final paper. One person is randomly assigned to present the reading, so it does hold people accountable. While the workload isn't too great, the paper is your grade, so starting early and collaborating with Mayhew every step of the way is important. It was a great class to write my senior essay in, and, while it got a little lecture-like at times, Mayhew is very interesting to listen to and obviously knows a lot about the field. I would recommend trying to take this course.",
    "It is a great course if you are interested in elections. Mayhew runs the class as a mini-lecture, so it has less discussion than other seminars would. Despite this, though, he is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge and has interesting commentary. The week to week work is light, but the final essay is long and time consuming, so if you take the course make sure you start it early.",
    "If you are interested in US National Elections and already know a fair bit about the subject then yes.",
    "this class is an amazing gem. first, it's incredibly interesting and well-taught. mayhew has been around forever and he knows more than i would have thought possible about domestic politics--whether it's reciting the past ten mayors of new york city from memory or recalling voting returns from counties in elections that occurred forty years ago, it is very very clear that is a subject mayhew has lived and breathed for the past 337 years.second, there is virtually no work, except for a twenty-thirty page research paper due at the end of reading period. it's true that there is a chance you will have to \"explicate\" a single research paper that is assigned for each class, but really. plus, mayhew usually talks about current events\/what's on his mind for the first half hour, giving you more than enough time to peruse the article at your leisure on the off chance you'll be randomly selected to explain it.the only drawback to this course, is, like many political science seminars, many of your fellow students will be brain dead. fortunately, mayhew does almost all of the talking so you won't have to listen to much of their blather. sooo good!if you're interested in any facet of electoral politics i highly highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a nice seminar on U.S. National Elections. Relatively low intensity - effectively one article per week and then a 20-25 page term paper at the end on the topic of your choosing. Mayhew is very helpful in writing the paper and makes himself accessible. Furthermore, his teaching style is light-hearted though he does not ignore the rigor of the material and you end up doing some pretty in-depth analysis of electoral trends. Statistical\/empirical focus but do not be intimidated if you don't have a background in stats or econometrics. A good choice in the political science department.",
    "talk and read about voting",
    "Definitely take it if you're at all interested in the subject. There is minimal reading, but the discussions are often interesting. The only assignment is the final paper and Professor Mayhew is helpful as you write it.",
    "Definitely take this class; ProfessorMayhew is the authority on U.S. national elections. He leads the discussions every week, so there are no awkward silences where no one talks, nor are there periods where people talk just to get a participation credit. The readings are engaging and interesting and not too long or difficult, and you get a lot of control over the term paper. It's a fun, and timely, political science seminar."
