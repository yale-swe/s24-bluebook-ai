   "comments": [
    "This was a great class. You learn a lot about the subject, mainly through the unique assignments given (inaugural speech, party platform etc.) and it was fun, which isn't something that can be said for many political science courses.",
    "Interesting, relevant, and fun course with a relatively heavy, but balanced workload.",
    "Absolutely great in some ways, not good in others. The big positive--the assignments for this class (four short writing pieces of ~5 pages and a longer final assignment) are really fun and relevant. Writing a campaign memo, an inaugural address, creating a campaign ad, etc--much more interesting than writing an essay and a good way to apply what you've learned; I got a kick out of them. Other plusses: Professor Henderson is approachable and flexible. The big negative in this class is the discussions. They drag on--long pauses and silences are the norm--and often aren't even that relevant to the reading. A lot of that is on the students, many of whom don't read at all, but Professor Henderson's questions don't necessarily set up a very interesting discussion and often seem very general or distanced from the text. Take this if the content of the assignments interests you enough to sit through some pretty excruciating class sessions.",
    "Would never recommend.",
    "This class is pretty meh--there are better seminars in the political science department that are more worth your time."
