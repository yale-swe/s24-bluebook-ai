   "comments": [
    "This course was very well organized. Sometimes I felt that there were too many resources, but they were certainly helpful in that they accommodated different learning styles.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was how deeply it engaged with music theoretic concerns from a very, very broad time span. I feel like the class was quite excellent at getting \"inside\" theoretical debates and concerns, rather than covering them synoptically and in broad strokes. My biggest complaint with the course was the workload. I expect my classes at Yale to contain significant amounts of reading, especially in a course like this that is attempting to survey such a large amount of material. However, I was often frustrated - mostly at the lack of clarity of what we were expected to have read for the next class session. The syllabus listed more readings for each week than we were expected to know, with \"stars\" indicating the crucial readings. However, the \"starred\" readings did not always correlate with the discussions the professor wanted to have in class. I often had to infer what I should focus my energy on by following up on the sources listed in the summary materials the professor would draft for us rather than consult the syllabus directly (sidenote: these outlines are an incredible resource to be able to have for our own future reference, and I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Wason for writing and distributing them). Also, lengthy readings such as dissertations or books were left unqualified or lightly-qualified in the syllabus, another occasional source of frustration.",
    "Although a blend was achieved, this course was taught through the perspective of a small set of theorists rather than through a lineage of concepts. I was very happy with the extensive reading list.",
    "Though the syllabus was thorough, it could have focused more on what we should have focused in on in particular treatises. With certain weeks having +400 pages assigned, it's hard to know what to prioritize."

    "This course is helpful and necessary to all music theory students.",
    "Yes, certainly. It is a required course, so this answer must be taken with a certain amount of salt, but I found the class to be rather excellent at what it was trying to do.",
    "Sure! It's required for many, but I think even those who weren't required to take it found the history of theory fascinating."
