    "Oscar is great, the class is okay, and overall, I'd say I'd take this class again if I were to go back in time. The first half of the semester is a little boring, especially if you had a lot of Spanish grammar in high school, but it's relatively painless and gets you to a higher level of Spanish. Plus, the second half of the semester involves a lot more reading of short texts (in a not super intense way) which I really enjoyed.Oscar is also super great. He's so nice, and he's really passionate about what he does. He also really cares about his students, and I feel like he really tries to make connections with us and build a friendly atmosphere in the class. I've heard stories, though, about people not liking other Spanish L4 classes, so if you take this class, take it with Oscar.Overall, take this class, and take it with Oscar.",
    "This class will improve your spanish and the workload is manageable. Try to get Oscar! He is the best!",
    "Chances are that if you're taking L4 spanish, it's because you have to in order to fulfill your language requirements. It is everyday, which is a lot, but it's also fun to meet a group of Yalies who come from a really diverse cross section of academic areas, all brought together by spanish. Its not much harder than L3.",
    "The Spanish courses are all pretty cookie-cutter, so there isn't that much to say. Oscar is a wonderful, nice human being, so I'm sorry I have to say this, but I might recommend taking it with someone who's better at explaining grammar if you have the choice.",
    "Unless you need the requirement I would not take this course. It is very enjoyable but if you are quiet or are uncomfortable speaking a lot then you may not enjoy this course.",
    "worth your time. a weird blend between grammar and culture. little bit of everything",
    "Good perfecting of grammar and Spanish conversation",
    "YES - take this class. You will look forward to each and every lecture with Oscar and leave the course at the end of the semester feeling incredibly satisfied. I hope L5 is just as comprehensive and organized.",
    "I know that there are a lot of ups and downs to L4, but if you have to take it, Oscar is awesome. He doesn't focus on the busy work (you still have to do it unfortunately) and is more focused on creating a space to discuss and practice speaking. I only wish we had engaged more with the class. When we did, we walked away from the class still talking about the subject. Oscar is great.",
