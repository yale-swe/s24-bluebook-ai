    "Interesting and useful class. I avoid science like the plague, but the material--which basically focuses on how technology has developed--is really relevant to everyone. Sort of a crash course in the history and science of the technology that underpins our existence, but that most of us take for granted. Prober is a good teacher and a really nice guy. Take it.",
    "This is a solid class and easy way to get a SC credit. It is BARELY any work. You have an annoying PSet once a week but it will take 2 hours top. You will learn some cool facts about how certain technologies work (electricity, cars, planes, radio, tv, medical imaging, etc.). This class will not teach you some overall concepts or underlying thought as Dr. Prober hopes it will. That being said, Prober is super nice and easy to work with. You will doa group presentation for about 30% of your grade and it is pretty easy and a cool way to learn more. I recommend this if you need a quick SC credit."
