   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It is so interesting and Professor Guy is fantastic. The workload is extremely reasonable with interesting readings and three graded essays. The final powerpoint presentation is a great project too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other student, especially if you're interested in psychology.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're at all interested in moral intuitionism and need a writing credit. It was fun, though not hugely informative, and didn't require an unreasonable amount of work.",
    "Writing about Psychology with Professor Alfred Guy and TF Sarah Hailey was an absolutely amazing course! As someone who has had a significant introduction to psychology, this course was an amazing opportunity to really analyze what writing about psychology actually entails. This is a class where the benefits to your writing become tangibly clear, while the benefits to learning how to think are simply innumerable and immeasurable. Professor Guy is one of the most amazing professors at Yale. He has such a unique perspective on psychology, as a professor from an English Literature background analyzing psychology writing. His insights into the papers we read were profound, while his insights into the papers we wrote were incredible.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Wholeheartedly.",
    "Yes, absolutely! This was definitely one of my favorite classes this semester. Professor Guy is an outstanding teacher, and he has enough enthusiasm, energy, and quirkiness to make everything really interesting (he was also a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire-- you can't get much cooler than that!) You also learn lots of writing tips, and you will definitely see your writing improve throughout the semester. You also learn a lot of about psychology, for you psychology majors\/enthusiasts out there. The class lets you write about what you think is interesting, and explore research areas that you want to, so it doesn't really even feel like work most of the time.",
    "Great! Very insightful in class, but didn't impede on the intellectual curiosity of the students.",
    "You read some interesting psychology writing and write some yourself, and most importantly you get comments from Professor Guy, and this alone can make the class worth taking. This time around the readings were all journal articles, so it seemed as if technical writing was the focus. Perhaps in later years the class will involve more pop-sci-ish writing.",
    "English 121 is a course in academic writing. Don't expect it to be similar to English 120, despite the supposed linearity of the two courses. The writing styles in the two classes are very different, and taking 121 will mean learning how to adapt to that style.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is simply looking to improve their writing, or even anyone who has an interest in psychology.",
    "Take this course. Professor Guy is amazing, and this is not one of those English courses where you don't learn anything lasting about writing or the writing process. The readings are interesting and not too long, and you get lots of feedback on each of your essays, which is great.The course was centered around three essays. The first was a synthesis of papers in moral psychology. The second involved writing a paper from results that we were given. The third was a research proposal for new research. You also give a ten minute presentation on the third essay topic you've chosen.As you do readings relevant to the concepts you're trying to apply in your writing, you also read and do exercises from a style book that is far more useful than any I've used before.This course is fantastic, and was a real pleasure to take both for the time spent in class and also the lasting benefits I think I'll take away from it. Professor Guy is incredible."
