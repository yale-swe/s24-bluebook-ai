    "I would recommend Research Methods to another student. Research Methods is an adaptive course in that the readings seem to be carefully selected to expose its students to material they are most likely to be unaware of. For example, my classmates and I were psychologists by training and therefore the course material addressed sociological research methods. Due to this adaptive structure, by taking this class you're not only receiving a guided tour through new terrain, but your receiving it in a highly personalized way, which makes this course equally unique and valuable.",
