   "comments": [
    "This is a great course that allows you to utilize the French language in new ways, and it is great to be able to read in French or to watch a film that is in French. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn the language because it was very helpful.",
    "Essentially a review of French 110-120. It takes what you learned in intro French and applies it to French books and films. Definitely take this class.",
    "You read 3 books and watch 2 movies in French. You discuss them and do grammar. It's a lot of work and its hard. Only take it to fulfill a language requirement",
    "Take it and you definitely will not regret it, even if you're just doing it for the language requirement. Professor Ngame is an awesome professor and helps you actually increase your French ability throughout the course. There is quite a bit of work in the course packet, but it's mostly very easy tedious work that helps you learn the language well. As long as you do the assigned sections each day, it's very manageable.",
    "very time intensive, but i learnt a lot of french from it. if you are hesitant about being in L3, id suggest you think carefully about how confident you are about the basics of grammar. taking this class without a strong grasp of the basics will make you struggle unnecessarily.",
    "If you're deciding between L2 and L3, take L3. You'll read some great books, watch great movies, and learn conversational French at a nice clip. If you can get into Monsieur Ngame's section, take it because you will have an amazing semester with one of Yale's best.",
    "This is a wonderful course and I would recommend it to another student. The material that is covered is so much fun and very interesting. The teachers are great and the tests\/evaluations are very fair. They do not try to trick you.",
    "A wonderful continuation of French. Highly recommended to anyone who completed French in high school but still needs a better grasp of grammar and\/or discussion of literature and film. There is almost no written work (three one-page write-ups at the end of each unit), so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone trying to improve their written skills, but other than that, a fantastic French course."
