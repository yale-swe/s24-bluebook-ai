   "comments": [
    "We read every novel that Kundera wrote chronologically--it was the first time that I was able to read and discuss the entire set of works of an author. The class was discussion based and really fun--though I would assume this would depend on who decides who take the course as it is best when there is some disagreement which led to interesting discussions of the philosophy behind the novels. AND THE BOOKS WERE REALLY FUN TO READ--TAKE IT!",
    "Yes! Take this if you have never taken a literature class and want to.",
    "Take this class if you have want to know Kundera for real. After this class, you will.",
    "All of Kundera's novel's chronologically. Two papers. + Reading Reponses. It's a great class. Her teaching methods are a little bit different, but you're going to walk away feeling great about what you have read and the class that you were in.",
    "See above",
    "This is a GREAT class for people who know that they like Kundera's style. Being able to read all of an author's works highlights select recurring themes and helps you better understand the author's ideas and the context of the novels. KvK clearly loves the material and is a great\/hilarious prof.",
    "Comprehensive reading of Milan Kundera's novels, starting with his first book in the 60s up to the more recent ones in the 2000s. Definitely recommended, especially if you like philosophy or sociology. Very informative in understanding changing social conditions and literary devices. The class is overall great, the teacher is nice and the work fun, if this year's experience is any indicator, it will be girl-heavy (which is good or bad depending on your view) and the teacher is, as mentioned, a legend.",
    "If you're interested in Milan Kundera, definitely take this class. If you're not that interested, don't take it, because you read all his novels, and if you don't care for him, then it gets very old very quickly.",
    "I ADORED this class. easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The reading is always such a pleasurable, I enjoyed everyone of the novel. professor von Kunes is extremely entertaining and clearly knows a lot about Kundera's work. I loved this class, and will be reading Kundera for years to come.",
    "Yes. Take it! You must like reading&complex philosophical ideas, but this course may change your Yale experience and really improve your semester.At the end you get to flaunt you have read all of Kundera's novels.",
    "I recommend it because the discussions are very entertaining and philosophical.",
    "Great introduction to Kundera as an author. It's great if you want to understand his thinking and his style. This class is definitely more of an academic approach to Kundera - which, if you've read Kundera, might detract from savoring the emotional poignancy of his work. However, this class helps paint a fuller picture of what Kundera is all about."
