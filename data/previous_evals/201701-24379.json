    "Professor Humphrey introduces this as a \"language\" course on the first day of class and I didn't realize until the end how correct he is. In this course I learned an entirely new set of notation that opens up a huge amount of information in the fields of mechanics and biomechanics.",
    "I learned a decent amount about continuum mechanics and the final paper does very well to connect the topics to biomechanics",
    "I learned a lot about tensor calculus and the language required to understand continuum biomechanics.",
    "A lot of theory in biomechanics",
    "Continuum mechanics, tensor calculus, modelling nonlinear responses",
    "I may have learned more in this course than in any other I have taken at Yale. We covered a huge amount of material, especially considering that we only met two-thirds as often as was originally planned. I feel as though I have mastered the basics of a new way of thinking and language of biomechanics and am also well prepared to learn more advanced material in the future because Prof. Humphrey establishes such a strong foundation with his class."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Humphrey requested a longer time slot and the registrar didn't give it to him. I think the class would have benefitted from that extra time although we still managed to make it through all of the material despite missing 50 minutes each week.",
    "It's a good class with not too much work but is very informative.",
    "The teaching is very good and the assignments were reasonable.",
    "Super well taught. Not a whole lot of application.",
    "Professor Humphrey is amazing, very organized, and makes this a truly enjoyable class.",
    "Great class. I learned so much! Due to scheduling conflicts we didn't have as much class time as we would have liked. Small problem sets with greater frequency (1-2\/week) would have helped me keep up better.",
    "The course's greatest strength is Prof. Humphrey's phenomenal teaching. He explains conceptually difficult material clearly and lets students master concepts for themselves. Everything was laid out in a clear progression. The homeworks and exams were always reasonable and educational."

    "I thought this course was incredibly cool if you're interested in mechanics at all. Essentially this class teaches tensor notation which is useful for generalized equations of mechanics. It really felt like I was finally getting to understand and learn about the most general forms of mechanics equation (3D for a continuum) which was awesome. Humphrey is a great professor and definitely wants you to understand what he's teaching. The class had biweekly psets, a paper, a midterm, and a final. This was probably tied for my favorite class this semester.",
    "Take it if it's in your major or if you're interested in learning more about continuum mechanics and it's application to biomechanics.",
    "This is a great course; I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes. 100 percent",
    "Take literally anything that Professor Humphrey is teaching, he's amazing! Also continuum and biomechanics are fun in general.",
    "Graduate level course. It does not have a great workload but the material is very challenging! If you can be dedicated to staying on top of the material you will learn so much! Humphrey is a great lecturer!",
    "A fantastic course to learn the basics of tensor calculus and continuum biomechanics. If you enjoyed the introductory course, I highly recommend continuing with this course. As always, Prof. Humphrey was a great lecturer, and I walked away feeling as though I had mastery over the material."
