    "ITAL 130 reviews previous material from ITAL 110 and 120, and then you are introduced to the art and humanities part of Italy while learning more verb tenses and vocabulary. There are more chances for discussions and acting (for Italian plays\/theater). I would definitely recommend this class to another student. And take it with Professor Hadley. She is great at teaching and you will learn so much with not all that much work.",
    "I highly recommend the class, especially if Allison is the professor!",
    "I would recommend ITAL 130 to another student. The Italian department is full of great professors and, more generally, people that are looking out for your success and satisfaction with the class.",
    "Take this class if it is offered by Prof Hadley. I cannot speak for others, but she is by far the most engaging, fun, and caring teacher in this department. One of my favorite classes I've taken here, even though it was mandatory.",
    "L3 Italian is pretty much the same story as L1\/L2, with the odd (but maybe nice) addition that you pack most of the grammar (which is a reiteration of grammar you already know) into the first half of the semester and then have a much lighter workload for the remainder of the class.",
    "ITAL 130 is an intermediate language course which builds on L1 and L2 by summarizing both and introducing new material.",
    "Goes over the same stuff as L1 and L2, but has more classes and activities dedicated to Italian culture",
    "Definitely! Ital 130 is a nice summary of L1\/L2 at a higher intensity and with more emphasis on more complex grammatical concepts, such as verb tenses and their applications. There is also a number of great films that we watched and discussed.",
    "I would. Many would enter hoping to make it across the finish line for the language requirement, but many will see that they will end up sticking with it for another semester. I would summarize it as a course that goes over all that we learn in L1, and L2, while putting those skills you developed in L1 and L2 to use through speaking, reading, listening, and enjoying parts of Italian culture."
