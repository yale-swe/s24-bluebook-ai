    "I would summarize it as its title. I would recommend this class because it is a great class.",
    "Though you may initially disagree, Professor Nelson is ready to convince you that Byzantine art is interesting. Be ready for it though - it's a long and occasionally painful journey. There isn't very much in the way of written homework\/exams: just one paper and two tests. Still, this course is Hard; my impression is that literature on Byzantine art tends to be pretty dense, full of difficult ideas and not always well-written.The best way to approach this is probably to keep an open mind and to make sure to keep up with readings and memorizing slides.",
    "A wonderful class, definitely I learned a lot of material and new knowledge and am happy about it. The readings are sometimes very complex and theoretical but very provocative. Tests are not the easiest, but if you keep up with readings (you are expected to cite them on the tests) and lectures and sections, it would be manageable.Byzantine images are just beautiful and moving. I wish Nelson's lecture style could be a bit more captivating, but the lectures themselves are very well planned out and meaningful. You get to read great articles by famous art historians and great scholarship...A great new outlook on religious art, church decorations,Byzantium, medieval europe, architectural space, passion, human emotion...",
    "I would recommend this class. This class was an amazing class. The class requires no background in art history. It's a class that is interesting and fun and can take stress away from other classes. It doesn't require much work and the lectures are relaxing by looking at pictures all morning.",
    "Wonderfully presented course with great material. I highly recommend it for any student interested in learning more about Byzantine art or art history in general.",
    "Take it because you will learn a lot and Professor Nelson is great, but just realize it's not a walk in the park.",
    "This is a survey of Middle Byzantine art. I'd recommend it to people who are interested in medieval Christian art and Greek culture. It's a lot of memorization, so it's not for people who don't intend to take finals seriously. There's not a whole lot of work during the semester, however.",
    "Byzantine Art is seriously interesting. The material is so beautiful and different from western art. Everyone should have to study it. The class is just a midterm, final, and paper. The tests aren't difficult, but they are a lot of memorization and we didn't get a image list. The reading is VERY important."
