    "Yes--take this course! It is designed for both grads and undergrads. Shimi is an amazing professor. He's been teaching the course for a while now so he knows how to best present all the material. Also, if you've taken organic chemistry before, you will enjoy actually thinking about the behavior of chemicals you're already familiar with\/know how to synthesize. I had never taken an F&ES\/EVST class before, but I'm really glad I did.",
    "I would say take it. It's an amazing class. Be ready for a fair bit of work.",
    "Organic Pollutants is a great summary of the origins, transport, transfer, and clean-up of pollutants in the environment. I would highly recommend it; the chemistry required isn't terribly difficult, and the subject matter is fascinating and highly relevant, much more so than in other courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take this if you can, but it probably won't be offered next year so probably no one is reading this. If you are though, and it's with Shimi Anisfeld, it's a very interesting and not too difficult class. You will learn a lot about a topic everyone is underinformed about, and go on a cool field trip or two (e.g. the Housatonic in the Berkshires).",
    "Take this course. Shimi is one of the best instructors I've had at Yale, and definitely the best science instructor. His office hours (\"problem sessions\") are a practical and generous effort to help students understand and engage the material from the course. I would love to take another class with him, and hopefully take better advantage of this feature from the start. The field trips were engaging and guest speakers fit in well with the material covered in the course. Be warned: Organic Pollutants in the Environment is a fantastic class, but not for the faint of heart. The material is interesting and relevant and well taught, but moves quickly and if you miss a piece you will soon be lost and it's difficult to catch back up. The structure of the class is perfect, though, and the instructor makes every possible effort to help everyone succeed."
