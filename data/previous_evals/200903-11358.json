    "A whirlwind tour through the mathematics needed for basic undergraduate physics courses.",
    "If you feel you're not as mathematically prepared as you should be in your physics education, then this would be a good class to take if only to introduce you to a lot of necessary concepts and to practice the math. Other than that, the class was rather mediocre. The teacher was uninspiring, but was helpful in answering questions if anything was unclear. The textbook used in the class,\"Basic Training in Mathematics\" by Shankar, was wonderful. You can teach yourself everything you need to know from the book and never go to class.",
    "take it if you wanna read a basic and comprehensive math book, but you will learn everything by reading the book. the lecture is boring, psets easy, and test super hard.",
    "I have a very ambivalent relationship to this course. At times it was incredibly interesting to see how mathematical concepts were interconnected, sometimes it was puzzlingly easy, and sometimes it was just not doable. All in all, this course needs some fixing. And the book is ridiculous--it is riddled with typos that screw up the formulas and confused me beyond measure. It seemed like Shankar wrote a book out of his lectures or something. The book sucked. So all in all, you will have to make up your own mind about this.",
    "Physics 301 is a comprehensive course, touching on essential math concepts for the sciences. The textbook accompanying the course is very well written and Professor Moncrief was very helpful in clarifying and elaborating upon topics covered in the course. 301 is a great class if you want an overview of various math concepts; if you are looking for a class specifically focused on vector calculus or differential equations, take a course specifically forthat.",
    "Physics majors have to take this course, so it's no use giving them advice on yea\/nay. For other people, I would recommend the textbook, but probably not the course. Different people teach on different years, so it's worth shopping. I do not recommend taking the class with Professor Moncrief, because he in incapable of writing a test of the appropriate length and difficulty. However, he is not a bad teacher as far as science teachers go.",
    "The class is good for anyone who wants a review of calc, single and multi, and linear algebra, while also learning new stuff. It covers linear algebra in a different way that is useful for quantum mechanics, and complex analysis. Don't expect to get a full course-worth of differential equations. More like 1.5 week's worth.",
    "Physics 301 is a rapid introduction to most of the concepts you will see in physics with a focus on physics and actual applications of the material rather than obscure mathematical definitions or methods. There are proofs, but the ones you are asked to do are relatively simple to accomplish (the textbook does a very good job of outlining how to get it done so that you aren't left behind) and they are for relatively important and useful concepts that you will actually need to know, as opposed to most mathematical proofs which are just useless and boring.If you want to get your feet wet in the higher level Physics courses without taking five semesters of math courses which will not prepare you at all for what you will see in the Physics courses, then take this (after taking MV calculus).",
    "Take it with Moncrief! He teaches from the textbook very closely, which makes the class easy to follow. Our semester we had open-note exams, and they were very difficult. Don't get lulled into a false sense of security with these and study. If you're a physics major, you may be able to skip this class with other math classes you've taken...talk to the DUS. But it's a nice review of important math, so you may want to refresh your memory with this class. If you don't need it for your major, know that you will probably be with many physics people, but if you study the textbook extensively for the exams, you'll be fine.",
    "I would only recommend this class to individuals who have either had all the material beforehand, or intend to teach it to themselves during the term. It is possible for a first-timer to learn the material during the term. Just be aware that it is predominantly self taught, Moncrief does actually teach the material",
    "This class is not worth it. It tries to cover everything from single-variable calculus to complex analysis to multi-variable calculus to linear algebra to differential equations. If you have taken courses up to multi-variable calculus, then this course will bore you for the first 7 weeks. You will then struggle to learn all of linear algebra in a week and a half and then all of differential equations in a week. If you are like me, you will basically come out of this course unable to remember nothing you were supposed to have learned. I would recommend taking separate calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations courses instead of PHYS 301. Take PHYS 301 only if you absolutely don't have time to take the proper courses.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students. Much more detail could be learned in any math course, and I learned nearly as much of the math in Phys 410"
