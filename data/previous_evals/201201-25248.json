   "comments": [
    "This course is a very rigorous course. Although there is not as much new grammar that is learned, the reading and writing assignments are definitely more difficult when compared to L3. But through this course, your French will definitely improve greatly.",
    "Continuation of French from F3. Little more writing",
    "If you want to continue learning french, you should take this class.",
    "If you are already taking French, this is a fine course. It's pretty challenging, though: be prepared for lots of grammar. It feels like all of the quirkier linguistic rules that weren't addressed in French 130 are lumped into French 140. Try to find a strong professor for this level of French.",
    "French 140 is a continuation of the French sequence, but I love French and really enjoyed the class! Graciane was a great professor (sadly, I think she may be returning to France next year, but I'm not sure), and my accent and my spoken and written French improved greatly under her tutelage. Definitely take this class if you like French, and if you have to take it, make sure to shop several sections and find a professor you click with. A fair amountof daily homework and tests every other week, but if you do the homework nightly, it's very manageable.",
    "It's a decent course, but it's nearly impossible to get an A or A- unless you want to spend hours studying trivial grammar points, or you already have a good command of speaking and listening to French for the exams (because the class doesn't involve any speaking or listening that will help you for the exams). Lots of reading; you should do it but it takes a lot of time (especially Un Sac de Billes).",
    "you get tired by L4 - need more motivation.",
    "I think this is a great course to take especially if you want to keep improving your speaking and writing skills. I enjoyed the books we read as well as the films we watched."
