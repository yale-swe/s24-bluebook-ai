I think overall there was more emphasis on language than culture compared to, for example, the AP curriculum which personally was not to my liking but I know others who enjoyed that.",

   "comments": [
    "Giseli Tordin is AMAZING. Such a good teacher and so kind and supportive. I did not like the syllabus and course design.",
    "Really didnt feel like we were learning anything after we finished all the grammar. Wouldve been nice to focus more on a specific topic instead of going from thing to thing.",
    "I dont like the daily homework that over time seems menial, but i like the concept of working every day. Maybe instead of such short nightly assignments we could work on larger projects with daily checkins",
    "Professor Tordin is great. She leaves a ton of comments on our papers and the detailed feedback is quite helpful for improving your writing. She is also particularly good at explaining grammar in a way that makes sense to a non-native Spanish speaker. The class is very discussion-based which means you get to know the other students and practice your speaking skills. The only issue is that the discussion sometimes becomes too ideologically focused and the lesson feels more like \"capitalism sucks\" than \"let's learn Spanish\". The textbook\/course packet teaches grammar in a very mechanical, rote way and not really through intuition, which depending on personal preference could be a strength or a weakness.",
    "Strengths: great facilitation of speaking and listening, good review and explanations of grammar, interesting and engaging class activities Weaknesses: Some of the texts were a little boring or too lengthy for the time assigned"

    "If you have to take it, take it with Giseli Tordin. She is phenomenal and by far the best part about the class.",
    "Take it if you want to learn spanish. And take it with Professor Tordin if you can",
    "If they need a language requirement then yes",
    "I'd say it is easier\/less work than average and also more fun than average, so yes. It does a good job of focusing on all four aspects of language study (reading, writing, speaking, listening) more or less equally.",
    "Yes, definitely! Especially with Professor Tordin, she is so helpful and does a great job of encouraging improvement in speaking abilities."
