    "This was overall a great course but it must be said that the book we used was pretty annoying. Instead of giving you the chapter's vocab in a list or chart or picture, it interspersed it throughout passages and exercises, which made it a huge chore to go back and study. I ended up mostly just studying from my in-class notes. I would recommend using a different textbook in the future."
