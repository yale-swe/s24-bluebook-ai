    "Practice, practice, practice!",
    "I took away several awesome tips for communication moving forward. I ended up planning several panels shortly after taking the class, and I applied a lot of what I learned in this PSC. The lessons are super practical.",
    "I gained a better understanding of my presentation style, my speaking style, and generally how to better influence, persuade, and engage others in communicating scientific information.",
    "Public speaking, writing, negotiation",
    "This course was a great crash course in effective communication though various different mediums. It was a great opportunity to get to develop my presentation and speaking skills in an environment that was very welcoming. The videos and advisor help throughout the class were incredibly helpful.",
    "Learned about public speaking and a bit about panels, etc.",
    "Thinking more critically about how I present myself, my body language, tone, speed, etc.",
    "Good communication skills.",
    "I came away with concrete knowledge and skills, particularly related to public speaking\/presenting, negotiation, and 30-second pitches. Some of the concepts I learned in this class have already been useful to me.",
    "Public speaking and effective communication.",
    "Public speaking, panel conversations, debating, writing, facilitation",
    "Not sure. Some presenting practice or skills? Insight into developing elevator speeches?",
    "I reinforced the knowledge that I had previously acquired in the elementary course of global communication skills",
    "I learned that charisma can be learned and adopted and that it's necessary to be an engaging speaker in order for people to really listen to you, no matter how interesting your topic of presentation is. I also learned how to present on a panel, how to talk about scientific statistics, how to present a powerpoint deck, and what goes into a great personal introduction.",
    "Lots of feedback on presentation and communication skills. Great to be able to be recorded and watch back your presentation.",
    "Effective communication, elevator pitch, how to make and engaging PPT and presentation",
    "I improved my presentation and communicating skills. I became aware of my posture, voice and tone in public speaking. It gave me tactics for friendly negotiation."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "It was not as rigorous as I'd hoped. I would have liked additional requirements in terms of on-the-fly presentation practice\/speaking up practice. The prep outside of the course was fine, but I wanted more experience having to do things spontaneously. I wish the course had pushed me further and required more rigor.",
    "I didn't feel that I gained as much from the class as I was expecting; the format was tough in that the content felt too surface-level for the most part, and the timing was late at night, making it harder to concentrate. I was hoping for more individualized feedback from the professionals rather than from peers. I was also hoping for more specific strategies to tackling communications obstacles; I would have liked if we workshopped more specific examples.",
    "They exceeded my expectations. I often worry that courses like this will be full of platitudes about how to effectively interact with others, but this was very on point and well-structured.",
    "I feel like I got out of this course what I was expecting, and was glad that I had a lot of opportunities to practice presenting and speaking in different ways.",
    "They aligned very well!",
    "Pretty well. Very good teaching! I only wish it focused even a little more on just public speaking. We can learn writing, etc. in other classes.",
    "Pretty well, it followed a lot of what I broadly thought it would.",
    "Met my expectations.",
    "This class clearly outlined skills for communicating, which I really wanted out of this course. I will continue coming back to these notes in times of need in order to practice the skills and apply the concepts taught in this course.",
    "Very well.",
    "Poorly. This class was not useful, especially in contrast to similar courses offered at SOM.",
    "I found very useful that the course had real-real scenarios and situations to practice the theoretical content explained before. Although some portions of the content were repeated from the previous course (Global communications kills) I took it as refresher to improve my communication skills",
    "Exactly what I expected, and my expectations were high!",
    "Excellent! What I learned in this course far exceeded my expectations.",
    "They surpassed my expectations. IN very little time the course covered the most relevant concepts and also gave room for us to practice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The practice was great. The lectures could have been shorter. Only some of the facilitators provided valuable feedback, but the non-communication center ones were not particularly helpful.",
    "The only weakness I can think of was sticking with the same breakout group the whole time. Mixing it up and working with others would've been great.",
    "The strengths of the class are the interactive aspects, such as presenting, and the personal feedback that we received from the communications coaches. I think one major way it could be improved is by providing dinner for the students. I think it would both help with our attention spans and attendance if we were fed at the beginning, even if that was just during the first 30 minutes of class.",
    "I think the structure of the course was very good. I wonder if it could be taught at a different time.",
    "Hands on practice giving a presentation to ~5 people was super useful! More of this.",
    "The practical aspect is certainly helpful to actually make time during the class to present and receive feedback. I would have preferred that at least some weeks, we be given written scripts with a common speech or something, so we could focus more on how we were speaking rather than what we were talking about. I think the learnings about content - how to engage an audience, structure writing, etc. - is all helpful too, but I would have preferred to divorce that from the presentation skills, at least for part of the course, in order to really be able to focus on presentation, body language, and speaking independently. The lectures also felt a bit long, and a lot of moving back and forth between rooms - would have preferred to just have a short lecture part, and more time to practice. Also, I would have preferred to rotate my group more and hear from different classmates, rather than being with mostly the same group each week.",
    "The strength is practicing the concepts taught. Listening to an outline of what to do and what not to do is useful, but it's even more useful when you practice and try applying those skills. I also liked that the teaching team rotated amongst groups.",
    "The length of the course is too short. It in an incredibly helpful course though.",
    "William was pretty good, but most of the co-teachers weren't. The class tried to cover too many topics without enough meat: op-eds, running meetings, negotiations, etc. Some of these skills need to be taught with actual material, not 30 second scenarios. Again, classes at SOM could be a model. The small group format was great for getting comfortable with presenting and elevator speeches, but usefulness depended on the professor. Perhaps next time, focus on just verbal communication: presenting, negotiating, elevator pitches. That would've been more than enough.",
    "Strengths: real-life scenarios Instant feedback from experts Weaknesses: duration of the course (last year it went on for 6 weeks, instead of 4) The course offered a nice and simple way to do what is \"right\" in terms of communication style. However, it offered less clarity referring to the \"gray areas\" of communication across cultures and topics",
    "Strengths are the professor and the relaxed, open nature of this course, which allows those who are not confident in public speaking to feel more at ease. The course could be improved if the instructors provided more feedback on our video recordings alongside our own comments.",
    "Strengths: Lots of recording, staying in same group throughout for in class exercises (it's helpful to have the same people watch you week after week so they can talk about changes they see). Weaknesses: Some coaches are better than others.",
    "It has a great balance of theory, research base, and practice."

    "Work with the FES Communications Center as well - this is where the most value added for me stemmed from.",
    "DO IT -- very useful for the job hunt and I used these skills in my interviews, leading to several competitive offers.",
    "Make sure you know the course requirements going into it. Crafting a couple five-minute presentations isn't the heaviest lift in the world, but make sure you know what you're getting into.",
    "Do the prep work, such as preparing a pitch about yourself or a five minute powerpoint, well, as you will get the best feedback if you put good work in at the beginning.",
    "This course is a good way to practice speaking and presenting in public and is a valuable half semester course. I learned a lot and became more confident in my presenting skills in a relatively short period of time.",
    "Take it! Light workload and useful skills.",
    "Definitely a useful class to become more aware of your presentation skills, how you present yourself and your material and how we can work on communicating better as environmental professionals. There is a decent amount of prep work for those four weeks, but overall it feels useful, and the chance to receive direct feedback in class is helpful.",
    "It's a great class to take! Very useful.",
    "Becoming an effective communicator takes time and practice, so this course will cure your public speaking fears, for example, over night. However, it gives you tools to be conscious of and practice over time as you move forward in your career.",
    "This is a great course for those looking to improve public speaking and communication skills.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "Don't take it. Take an SOM class instead.",
    "The class is definitely worthwhile! Not a heavy workload and yet a set of tools that will be useful for your future career as an environmental professional",
    "Take it if you want to improve your public and interpersonal communication skills.",
    "Take it! Very useful to develop your communication\/presentation skills.",
    "Take this class, it is very useful. You'll learn skills that you can apply in personal and professional situations."
