   "comments": [
    "Professor Yiengpruksawan's approach to her material has made me rethink preconceived notions about my own discipline and topics.",
    "The course reminded me that asking questions that lay outside of strict art historical methodology is extremely very fruitful in the research process. This, I believe, is essential in the field, especially when developing research approaches for term papers and ultimately, the dissertation.",
    "It gave me architectural evidence to support some of my theories, which need supplementation because there isn't enough literature. It has helped me understand the craftsmanship and construction of many of the sites I have visited in Japan, and I am grateful to finally be able to appreciate them more. At least now I know where to begin to look in terms of gathering more information for analysis."
