    "This course should be for physicians only. It focused too much on specific occupational diseases and every lecture was basically the same, only focusing on another organ system. I do not feel I learnt anything useful, for a public health professional. It cannot be improved really, it just has to be removed from the public health course list and be offered only for students who are physicians or nurses, with an interest in occupational medicine. The environmental component was mostly absent - a pity since this course is offered partly to satisfy the MPH students environmental health core requirement.",
    "Usable information. Good lecturers ..different each week",
    "Strengths: application of medical knowledge, introducing and integrating occupational and environmental hazards and risk factors.",
    "I liked the variety of topics covered as well as the ability of the material to appeal to students of various backgrounds.",
    "The course covered a wide range of topics, through lectures by the primary instructors and by guest lecturers from Yale. There was quite a bit of review and overlap between some of the presenters, but overall, the lectures were very interesting. Some were more engaging than others, but in general, students in this small class were encouraged to actively participate and answer questions. Having such a diverse group of students (which included physicians, industrial hygiene specialists, a dentist, and a handful of students from other backgrounds) brought a lot to the course.",
    "nice to have guest lecturers. Info not too advanced. Great for a student new to EHS",
    "Mediocre. I didn't feel like I learned enough in this class. Most of the info was very non-specific or just common sense.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed all of the class lectures and the discussion. It was an excellent experience in both environmental and clinical occupational medicine. I absolutely loved taking a class with so many experts! This material and topics related to OccMed should be emphasized more in the general public health curriculum. It is both fascinating and essential to all students in policy, social\/behavioral sciences, etc.",
    "Class level far below what I would have expected from Yale. Looking back - I did not learn anything. Classes are poorly structured. Instructors competency insufficient. Not open to questions. NO guidance what to expect and how to prepare for the exams, despite recurrent questions from multiple students. NO feedback on Midterm and Final exam. Grading unclear. Appears as if grading is done per personal empathy rather than students competency. Very very very disappointing class and overall a waste od time! This has been a mandatory class - otherwise I would have dropped it.",
    "Overall a good course"

    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0The instructors were both nice personally. However, they need to communicate more between them and decide in advance about course-related issues. It's stressful to the students when it appears that they have not decided how to grade a midterm exam (they asked the students which things we thought were important in the grading!!!!!!!), when the final should be held (that should have been on the syllabus from the beginning), whether we should have a laptop or not - and then putting those issues almost to a public vote!!!",

    "Instructor: Ben Hur Patricio Mobo \u00a0Dr. Mobo's competency is highly insufficient. He is a nice person, but his teaching quality is poor. The classes are boring. He frequently makes wrong statements. When his mistakes were pointed out by students, he giggled instead of correcting himself.",

    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0A little cranky. Sometimes I felt like she treated us or looked at us like we were little children. Her early lecture was not so hot.",

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. As a non-MD, I found it hard to keep up with almost constant medical references. As a public health student, I saw no public health interest\/knowledge\/value to this course. It focuses solely on occupational conditions and is therefore of interest to MDs and perhaps industrial hygienists, not public health students.",
    "It sensitized me to occupational and environmental issues.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in not only occupational medicine but in environmental medicine in general because it covers a wide range of topics and discusses issues (by necessity) that span both areas.",
    "This course was a general overview of occupational medicine, with some emphasis on environmental medicine as well (many of the principles and information covered in the course can be applied to both). While some time was spent on the underlying mechanisms of various health problems that can result from workplace and environmental exposures, most of the course material related to 1) diagnoses, 2) prevention, and 3) abatement of various hazards.",
    "Great introductory course",
    "great class to get a basic understanding of occ med",
    "If you're a clinician, this class is mainly common sense. The workload is minimal, which is a strength. But the learning is minimal too.",
    "Boring. Did not learn anything. Level FAR below what I expect from YALE. Instructor's seem to grade based on personal empathy rather student's knowledge and participation. Even though requested, we did not get to see how our exams were graded! I have never seen such a \"secretiveness\" in regard to exams. No instructions were give how to prepare for the exams. Dr. Mobo would giggle whenever student's would ask and not properly answer the questions. Very unprofessional. Questions asked on the exams were Epi-based and were not contents we learned in this class! I am very disappointed! Would not recommend this class to anyone. It is a waste of time and money.",
    "Overall good and interesting course. Course is lighter than the other courses."
