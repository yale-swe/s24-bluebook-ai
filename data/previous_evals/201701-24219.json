    "I learned a lot about the Arabian Nights as a specific body of work, and about its larger influence on other culture and the art of storytelling as a whole. For example, I started the course thinking that the Arabian Nights was a book that someone had written, and was promptly disillusioned. Overall, it was a really fascinating course! It was not exactly what I had expected (I thought we would just be reading a lot of Nights tales and essays of literary criticism of the Nights, which we did, but we also covered so much more material and talked about lots of other topics!) but turned out to be even better in the end!",
    "This course went over exactly what The Arabian Nights were (not the vague idea of it) and how it has been distorted overtime. I also learned about the different ways in which The Nights are represented and about what the themes in the Nights were.",
    "I read a lot of books and learned a lot about Arabic culture (more what it was not than what it was).",
    "I obviously got a background knowledge of the Arabian Nights, which I only thought of in vague terms before. I learned to look for patterns and shared characteristics in adaptations and think about the adaptation and inspiration process.",
    "Of course I became more educated about the Nights, but really what I think I gained from this class was how literary works should be thought about and truly appreciated.",
    "I developed a much further understanding of the Arabian Nights tradition then I thought possible, while also getting to learn more about translation and literature in general."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course was the variety of the material we covered, and Professor Toorawa's engaging lecture style. It was a seminar course when I took it, so there was a really cozy, really great seminar-style informality to it, where we could talk about what we thought of the works we read and share opinions. I do wish that the course had included even more material on the reading list, or had us delve really deeply into the history of one particular work, rather than reading a wide variety of different materials related to the Nights.",
    "I really liked the diverse types of materials and representations that we read of The Nights so that it was not just re-reading the same material over and over again. The class lectures were very insightful largely due to Dr. T's vast knowledge in this subject as well as in other relevant subjects. But the biggest strength of this course was by far Dr. T himself, what with his personality, his enthusiasm, and his passion that he brought to class everyday.",
    "I think the major weakness was there wasn't anything to stop us not reading. I tried to maintain motivation to read throughout the semester but when other classes started to ramp up towards the end I totally missed two books, which I regret. That said, i've started reading them now, so it's not the biggest deal.",
    "The strengths of this course were that we got to learn about the origins and background of the Arabian Nights, how the Eastern and Western worlds view it differently, and how it has maintained a presence into modern times. Being about to read a variety of works from different times and genres definitely helped in gaining this insight. My only suggestion for improvement would be to have a little more historical background on the Nights and the culture and history of countries involved with the Nights (ie the Arabic world).",
    "This course is great for students who perhaps are majoring in English and want to expand their range to include a classic of world literature-- one that does not reflect Arabic literature per se, but has been thoroughly consumed and repurposed in the Western world. It is also great for students who might be interested in reading the Nights. There is a clear alluring quality and I don't know why more students wouldn't take it. Especially because of the professor. One of the best qualities of the course lies outside of the Nights, it is the requirement for outside lectures-- this forces students to immerse themselves in knowledge elsewhere and take advantage of all the academia swimming around the university. The weekly thought papers are very doable, one must stay on top of them however.",
    "The readings didn't always match up with the class discussions, especially at the beginning when we were reading the Nights. I remember wishing there were more opportunities to talk about the stories we had read for that day. Especially since our class was so small, I think it would have made sense to have a more seminar-like structure. Once we started reading\/watching adaptions of the Nights, there were more opportunities to talk and the discussions aligned with the homework better. Because our assignments other than the final paper weren't given a letter grade, there was some anxiety going into finals period. I wasn't sure how I was doing in the class.",
    "I think this course is very well laid out for the material, with the discussion-like classes helping to improve my understanding and thought process on the works by hearing other students' opinions."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take it if it is being offered! It was a real treat to get to read so many different works related to the Nights, and Professor Toorawa is great!",
    "Take this course if the subject matter interests you or if you are even curious about it. It is a fairly easy credit ( a great fifth credit) and Dr. T is an absolute joy to have as a professor. He certainly knows a lot about the subject and is very enthusiastic about it. He is one of the best professors I have encountered at Yale. You will leave this course knowing more about the original The Arabian Nights and all the various representations of it. That being said, you get what you put in for this course and you need to do the readings. These range from the somewhat bland original Arabian Nights texts to some papers analyzing The Nights, comic book\/graphic novel representations of the Nights, novels, and movies as well. But again, do the readings otherwise the lectures (around 12 people, very small and more discussion based than anything) will not mean anything to you. You definitely do not need to have any prior knowledge in this subject nor any deep passion about it. Take it if you need an extra credit, an english course, for the humanities distributional requirement, or if you just want to have a wonderful professor whose main priority is that you are learning.",
    "Yes",
    "Strangely no one seems interested, but i've certainly tried.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with Dr. T! Even if you do not take this class, I have heard that other classes with Dr. T are equally as phenomenal. Dr. T has an incredibly extensive knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, the act of translation, and world literature, among other subjects, and is very eager to share this with his students. Dr. T's lectures are always varied in content and presented with energy.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Its a lot of fun and lets you learn about somehing most Westerners only have a vague idea of, while still letting you be creative and read fun modern materials, especially in the second half. Professor Toorawa is very funny and I enjoyed almost everything we read.",
    "I would recommend this course solely because of the instructor (Toorawa). Do not miss the opportunity to take one of his courses and know him. This course earns its due from his care in crafting it, and the knowledge (and wit) that pours of his mouth. :)",
    "I think this course would be great if you wanted to add a fifth class to your schedule or if you wanted to explore the humanities without a lot of pressure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student mostly to experience Dr. T's unique lecturing style and ability to make most topics approachable and even relevant to students who otherwise would've never studied something like this storytelling tradition."
