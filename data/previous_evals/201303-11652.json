    "This is a class on globalization, but it's a different kind of class from any you've ever taken before. At it's core, \"Global Fictions\" is an English seminar. But Justin Neuman is a different kind of English professor: the reading list includes a lot of (really excellent) social theory and history pieces that contextualize the readings, give you theoretical lenses for interpreting them, and - above all else - make the novels you read seem so much more important to the world around you. And the class asks you to think in interdisciplinary ways. That \"interdisciplinary\" buzzword can be a dangerous one, but here's how it works in this particular course: you hone your skills of literary analysis, then you apply them to politics and history and current events and corporate management and whatever else interests you. It will give you a fascinating new way to think about research, literature, and globalization.Neuman is a young, energetic, wacky dude whose personality can be intellectually divisive at first. By the end of the term, though, I feel as though our entire class had come around to appreciating 1) the brilliant method to his madness, and 2) just how much he really cares about his students. The workload is intense: Neuman says he thinks the class should take about 10 hours of your time every week, but for me it was always more. But if you stick with it, I think this class offers a new way to do English for the English major, and a new window into English for us non-majors. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "The only EPE x English cross listed course I have come upon and confirmed to me that that mixture is absolutely worthwhile.",
    "Cool class that, at its best, makes you think about 20th century social, political, and economic problems in ways you haven't before - and at its worst feels like an inconsequential discussion about an inconsequential book. Overall, recommended as an interesting addition to a series of core English or political science\/econ classes.",
    "Highly recommend!",
    "This class reads a wide range of literature from a wide range of time periods through the lens of an energy systems analysis, which looks at the pieces read as reflections of the energy systems of their times. This might be an oversimplification or a misrepresentation; this class does so much in such a cohesive way that it is really difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation. I would highly recommend this course; this is the best class I've taken at Yale. It's exceptionally interdisciplinary, very informative, and the professor is absolutely fantastic.",
    "YES. It's fun, and really illuminating. The readings are not bad in terms of load, and Professor Neuman is clear in expecting about 10 hours of your time per week, which is really clear and just above reasonable in a nice, challenging way. The reason to take it is Professor Neuman, to be honest - thoughtful, helpful, and challenging. He was all about doing real research with humanities and social sciences, and it was pretty instructive. And certain things on the syllabus are really cool, like 2666.",
    "An engaging and wide-ranging class with somegreat moments but a high BS quotient (heard the word \"dialectical\" way to much considering that nobody knew what it meant). A class that comes up a little short of its own high ambitions but perhaps worth a shot anyways. Lots of reading and one difficult final paper.",
    "Global Fictions is an excellent junior seminar for an English major who wants to break out of the close-reading mindset of most English courses (don't worry, there's still plenty engagement with the text)! Professor Neuman is super-enthusiastic and engaging. Approaching literature from the perspective of global systems (energy regimes; supply and demand; the flow of global capital) is fascinating and important, and the course gives you an opportunity to engage with authors you might not otherwise read in the English major (Bola\u00c3\u00b1o, Duras) as well as with classic writers from a unique perspective (Forster, Kafka).",
    "This class combines literary novels with supplementary documents to analyze topics of globalization and capitalism in a way that I have never before thought about it. You gain literary insight of an English class but also learn a lot about current topics of globalization - a very interesting connection and means to analyze these events. I would absolutely recommend this class, as it appeals to many different areas of interest: English, Politics, Economics, History, Philosophy, etc.",
    "Definitely! The books for this class and the in-class discussions were both really interesting. The course is the closest I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to an interdisciplinary class at Yale, and is a cool example of how energy systems relate to literature.",
    "Yes, especially to English majors who want to expand their horizons by examining literature in the context of larger global issues. This is a fascinating course."
