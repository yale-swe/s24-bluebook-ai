    "Good overview on the methods and topics central to the social\/affective study of nonverbal communication. I would not recommend if they wanted to discuss more cognitive aspects like I did.",

The course terminates with a research proposal, which provides a good opportunity to apply the knowledge gained over the course of the semester and synthesize research interests and nonverbal methodology.",
