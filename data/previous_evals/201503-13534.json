    "I believe the class could be made much more helpful for students if it could include more personal reflection exercises such as for example personal strength and weakness assessments - discuss the results in class. Team learning exercises, simulations --> powerful exercises that are fit for a course like this and not done elsewhere in another F&ES class. But only talking about topics is time not well used. It was however interesting to get an insight into GE functioning etc. there was however a lot of repetition.",
    "I was quite surprised by the lack of structure for this course. There was a huge opportunity for the class to practice and exercise leadership fundamentals in the context of the environmental space, and it didn't happen. Often times people who become managers are promoted to such positions without really fully acquiring the skills necessary to be effective leaders. If that was not the case here, I'm disappointed we didn't get to tap into that knowledge. There is no doubt the instructor had the background, knowledge and expertise in her field, but in my opinion, wasn't able to demonstrate through hindsight and reflection that she possessed the skills necessary to be an effective leader; and therefore impart wisdom on how to become a leader. I understand that knowing how to navigate the winds of corporate America is a skill in itself, but that wasn't the title of the class.",
