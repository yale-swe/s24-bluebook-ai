    "The assignment or homework is more informative than the lectures. Instructor does not teach how to use ArcMap step by step in class.",
    "excellent",
    "learn useful methods of visualizing data",
    "This course provided a great overview of the wealth of analyses available to use In public health. The only weakness that I found in the course was the lack of a lab section. I think that would help illustrate many points and allow us to Racine the skills as a group, otherwise I really enjoyed the course!",
    "strength: the instruction for each exercise is very clear weakness: due to the instability of Arcgis, there were lots of errors cannot be explained during the whole process",
    "The strength of the class was the excellent coverage of the theory, the professor's knowledge and the wide display of examples.",
    "Great introduction to GIS and the ArcMap software. Actually loved the homework assignments and felt like I really gained a facility with how to use the software to conduct geospatial analysis and make maps. The lectures were fine, but I felt that they were at times a little too heavy on cartographic theory; I would have preferred that they focused more on methods."
