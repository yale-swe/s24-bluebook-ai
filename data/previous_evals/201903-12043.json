    "The rotations gave me a good opportunity to check out labs that I am interested in at Yale.",
    "I learned the lab atmosphere and some new techniques. Also I was exposed to presenting my research in different settings.",

   "comments": [
    "I think that the rotations could be improved if it was more clear to all faculty that we are also taking classes and have a lot going on. The first semester was honestly extremely chaotic and not very enjoyable because we were working 12-15 hours a day basically 6 days a week with rotations and classes and many of us often felt pressured to be in the lab all the time even when we had lots of coursework to do. In addition, I think being able to give constructive feedback to faculty members about rotations, similar to how they give us feedback would be very helpful!",
    "Lab rotations provide an excellent environment for getting to know the research and operations of a lab.",
    "Flash talks should be given before rotations start. Maybe start rotations earlier so we dont have to deal with finals week and the end of our rotation?",
    "The first rotation should begin sooner into the semester. The second one should end before reading week, it was hard to do lab work and study for my finals."
