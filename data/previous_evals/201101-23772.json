   "comments": [
    "Yes, 100%. If you're at all interested in social justice, criminal justice or understanding why there are great racial disparities in our society, this is the seminar for you!",
    "A class on how race and the law intersect in America and the UK. The first couple weeks are very wishy-washy, but once you get past that, it's really interesting. It even made me consider going into criminal justice when I'm older.",
    "It's ok. A bit disorganized in structure. Not riveting. Definitely has a lot of room for improvement. Professor does not really say what his expectations are making it difficult to grab ahold of assignments and approach them.",
    "This course is really interesting, very awesome, challenging, and potentially life changing. I'm a sociology major with no background in the criminal justice system, so this course really helped me see how social inequalities are linked and determined through many American institutions - education, the prison system, the political system, etc. I found it challenging at first to engage with the material because of my limited background, but as the course continued, I found the discussions extremely interesting and was fascinated by almost everything that Prof. Motto had to say. Ultimately, I would say DEFINITELY take this class. It convinced me to go into civil rights law - everyone could learn something important from this class.",
    "A great class that covered the intricacies of identity and the impacts of race and gender on criminal justice. I would absolutely recommend to another student who already has a basic interest in any of these fields.",
    "I highly recommend this course with only one reservation. The content of this course is really striking and eye-opening. Michael doesn't really seem interested in counterarguments. He has his mind set on his own agenda and what he thinks is important. He doesn't shoot down creative ideas but doesn't welcome them either. Be sure not to fall victim to simply regurgitating what he feeds you in seminar. You will have to in order to get a good grade, but use seminar discussion to share your creative ideas.",
    "A super engaging and interesting seminar on race\/class and criminal justice (not so much gender). You learn a lot about societal structures but also focus in on individual identity and interactions between individuals in relation to the big picture. Definitely take this course if you want to learn about how justice really functions in the US and UK. It made me think a lot about what I think justice is and should be.At times you feel kind of helpless because you learn about all these problems that seem impossible to fix, but the idea of justice is such an integral part of our nation's identity and in the end I still haven't lost hope in fixing it.",
    "If this seminar is offered again, I would heartily recommend it. It is an extremely topical way of learning about the academic subject of sociology, as well as an incredible discussion of large issues facing our society and their underlying theories. Race-based mass imprisonment is a huge issue confronting America today that I was barely aware of, and this course made me both conscious of it and passionate about it. Professor Motto is an excellent professor and seminar leader and I hope that he will continue to teach such classes at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. I loved the topic and found the professor to be invaluably informative and knowledgeable. I thought discussions were engaging and fun, and readings were great!",
    "Take this class if you get in! The discussions are exciting, the material is fascinating, and Professor Motto is an incredible section leader. Only positive feelings about this class.",
    "Absolutely. If you gain acceptance in this class you should take it. I think this is one of the more important classes offered because students emerge from this class with a more informed worldview.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the topic, and haven't had a lot of experience. Motto's class is especially focused on the white black divide in crime, so if you are looking for something else, you'll really only get it in outside research for your term paper. It's not necessarily a 5th class, because it does require a moderate amount of work since he is sort of a harsh grader. If you have the interest, and you want to have a chance to learn and write about topics in criminology, definitely take the class."
