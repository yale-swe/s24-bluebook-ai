   "comments": [
    "decent amount of work (but easy work). good for non-science people. you do have to study to do well on mid-terms\/final but it is manageable and a lot better than most other courses at yale",
    "Take it but be prepared to ASK a lot of QUESTIONS in order to fully understand the class.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class for a science credit, I'd say it's a toss-up, but will probably be one of the easier science credits you'll find. There are two midterms and a final, each worth 20%, and two group projects that are 10% each. There are weekly 5 question quizzes that count for a participation grade - you don't actually have to perform well on them. Section is a lot of fun because every section is devoted to working on group projects, and sections before tests are devoted to Jeopardy Review, so this is really a Group Project Section, not a Discussion Section per say, which I really enjoyed. The grading system is such that what's normally an A- is actually an A, so a 90-92% would be an A. An 88% would be an A- and so on. The tests are broad enough that you can do well, but some multiple choice questions are worth large numbers of points, which makes you lose points easily if you get one MC question wrong. Eric taught this class - he's a wonderful instructor but I think is leaving after this year since he's only here for a year. If the curriculum stays the same, I'd say start it Cr\/D, and if you get a target grade, then switch.",
    "MCDB was fine, but not a gut like expected.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. If the student is interested in science but doesn't have a strong background in it, this class really makes the material digestible without losing main concepts.",
    "An overview of how microbes impact both humans and the environment.",
    "Do not take it",
    "A good SC credit (the class is not curved though so it's not like it's an automatic A) that does not require prior background in biology.",
    "This is a solid class if you have to take a biology class for some reason. The material is beautifully balanced between the specific (particular bacteria in your teeth) and the broad (the role of microbes in the geologic and cosmological history of Earth). You learn about legumes fixing nitrogen, plants freezing, cow digestion, antibiotic resistance, and other cool topics. The tests are pretty straightforward if you have gone to class. And the material will probably stick with you for longer than for a lot of sciences, because it really pertains to how you view and what you know about the world around you."
