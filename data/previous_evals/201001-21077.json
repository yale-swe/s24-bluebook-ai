   "comments": [
    "Its a grant requirement course. Yes its interesting, but having to attend, sign in and if you miss write an essay is a little overboard. whats wrong with a little faith\/trust and understanding?",
    "No. Didn't learn anything.",
    "Have to take it, but it is at a rather awkward time of the week.",
    "more enjoyable and relevant than you may expect",
    "No. Horrible course. Learn nothing if you have common sense.",
    "MB&B 676 is an ethics course that introduces the student to a lot of information involving ethics in research with topics ranging from sexual harassment to authorship on papers to dealing with conflicts in the laboratory. I would recommend this course to another student because I think it is important for all students to have a strong understanding of the ethics that should be involved in research and also how to handle sticky situations that they will inevitably experience in a lab setting.",
    "It is mandatory. So its existence has its own reason. You might not discover the value by now. But in the future, you will find it helpful.",
    "I would recommend it, though since it's required that wouldn't matter much.",
    "This required course brings up some interesting and important ideas for discussion related to research. The more effort you put into the course, the more you will benefit from taking it.",
    "It's required but easy to pass.",
    "If you're looking at this, you probably have to take this class regardless of what I say. There's no reason to take this other than to fulfill a bureaucratic requirement.",
    "Dear fellow student, if you are like me, taking Molecular Biohphysics and Biochem 676 is not a matter of choice, but is a requirement. I advise that you cancel all of your fun Friday afternoon activities. Do not go to the lab; do not go enjoy the good weather outside; do not go to any interesting and actually relevant scientific talks;do not spend time with your friends, and please spend an hour in a very uncomfortable chair listening to a boring talk on common sense and topics that any capable adult would have figured out long ago. I would also advise having a strong drink afterwards (and maybe before).",
    "A poor presentation of obvious concepts. Certainly not recommended.",
    "a necessary evil.",
    "I would highly recommend Molecular Biophysics&Biochem 676 01 to fellow graduate students.",
    "Yes, I recommend it to other students",
    "Its a course that helps you understand the basic ethical questions that arise in the sciences, both from a professional point of view and interactions within the lab. I would because like I mentioned earlier, this is our only opportunity to address some of these issues in a formal\/informal discussion with a large volume of your colleagues and PIs.",
    "its required, I guess that is a recommendation."

   "comments": [
    "It did not.",
    "Can't say it changed\/added really anything to my current knowledge. It's a common sense course.",
    "no!",
    "The course helped make me aware of some of the ethical issues in the scientific community.",
    "It did not necessarily deepen knowledge of my particular specialty, but I think it was an important class in that it imparted knowledge that will be applicable to the entire scientific field. It also provides a sense of how to handle different conflict situations and ethical issues that would be applicable throughout graduate school and into any career path that is related to science.",
    "The course highlighted some areas I was not aware of and I am sure will prevent some mis-steps in the future.",
    "This course helped reinforce good ethics in conducting research and provided information on how to approach a variety of potential developments during one's graduate career.",
    "I learned useful things, such as:Do not steal reagents from your PI after you leave the lab.Do not take credit for someone else's work.Do not invent or manipulate your data.Useful ways of avoiding the sexual advances of my coworkers, such as ignoring or pretending not to understand them, asking them to awkwardly explain exactly what it is that they mean, and pointing out that they are sexually harassing me.The components of a scientific paper.I swear that I new none of this before taking this course.",
    "All the concepts were already obvious and few subjects were presented well.",
    "It did.",
    "Great preparation for any ethical and professional challenges that may come up in the course of my career.",
    "It broadened my overall feel what ethical questions are involved with being a scientist. It greatly prepared me for performing my dissertation research in an ethical manner.",
    "Direct contribution to dissertation\/research is rather low , but the focus was on career and graduate school topics instead."
