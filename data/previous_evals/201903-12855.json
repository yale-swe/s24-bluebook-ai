    "It was mainly a methodology course, so I learned a lot of different tools that could be used to shed light on a sonic phenomenon (voice) that exists, in some fashion, in almost every musical encounter. Voice Studies is also a fairly new field so it was great to learn about very contemporary research, including some work that has not even been published yet. I was drawn primarily to the more philosophical texts and I took away a lot to use in my own interests.",
