   "comments": [
    "Decent. Nothing remarkable. The tests are really nit-picky, so be prepared. The papers are great, allowing you to actually apply what you've learned to a Facebook profile and to an advertising campaign.",
    "Social psych is so cool and interesting but I stopped going to class after spring break. Too much time to invest when you can learn everything you need from the slides and from doing the readings",
    "Pretty easy, pretty boring. The exams are hard if you don't do the reading, but the reading is stunningly boring. Professor LaFrance is cool and kind of funny, but the material really all feels like common sense. I read all the evals that told me this course would be boring and ignored them don't",
    "take it",
    "Social Psych is a decent class. If you have only taken intro psych before it might be worth taking, though if you have taken other psych classes then it might have a lot of overlap. It's probably a good fifth class because it's not too much work, pretty straightforward all the way through, and the material is pretty interesting most of the time.",
    "Yes! Take Social Psych! I would recommend taking it as a 5th class since the workload is very manageable.",
    "It is a pretty basic introductory class with lecture slides and papers (which are on interesting topics) then 2 exams. If you take it, you'll be exposed to many studies in different areas because the syllabus is very broad.",
    "If you are looking for a good Intro to Psych course, I would take 110 over this class, but if you need a social core for the Psych major, this is far from a bad option.",
    "Good solid psych class overall. You learn a lot of interesting psych concepts. Great to have MC tests and 2 short papers that are auto-A's as long as you meet all the requirements. Final did kind of catch you off guard because it centers heavily on the readings.",
    "Lots of useful information to be found in this course by the way in which it was presented made the class extremely boring. Skimming the chapters and looking over the reviews at the end of the chapters is more than sufficient to learn the material. If you are taking this Credit\/D you do not need to give any effort whatsoever as a 52% is a C+ and the grading is fairly easy.",
    "I would recommend this to a student with any interest in social psychology. It gives a good overview of the entire subject area.",
    "Interesting enough. Definitely can fall to your back burner though. Proceed with caution if you're looking for a gut.",
    "Interesting, and definitely one of the easiest courses I have taken at Yale. Two super short papers and 2 multiple choice exams. I took the class credit d and it seemed like the course was passable on just general knowledge.",
    "This is a good fifth class--two papers, two exams. Straightforward and interesting. The subject matter overlaps a fair amount with Intro Psych, but overall I enjoyed it.",
    "Social psychology is really interesting and Professor Lafrance is the cutest professor. She is relaly funny in lectures and the slides are really helpful and clear. The grading is really straightforward - 2 5 page papers, 2 75 minute all-multiple choice exams. There are no sections and the tAs are really nice.",
    "I believe this was one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale (although -- or because -- I am a mechanical engineering major). I really learned a lot in the classes for they shed some light on things that had never gone through my mind and was really helpful towards my future!",
    "Very boring, very basic course. Should go into much more rigorous analysis, experiments, etc. Right now it is very superficial.",
    "I liked the class and the material was interesting and LaFrance is great. The test are surprisingly reading heavy so keep that in mind.",
    "A lot of repetition with intro psych",
    "This is an alright course. The subject is interesting and the class gives a good overview of social psychology subjects and experiments, but the way the professor makes the exams is way too focused on the individual experiments and the experimentor's names. To me that kind of picky exam really misses the point of the class and the subject.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Social Psych overlaps a lot with Intro Psych, and everything else you learn is basically common sense. So, you might be thinking to yourself, what's wrong with that?? Sounds like an easy one!! Well, no. The actual workload is light, yes. Just two 4-page papers on nonsense topics, plus a midterm and a final with 75 multiple-choice questions. But let me tell you, THE MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTS ARE COMPLETE SHIT. Marianne LaFrance is an extremely boring lecturer AND her tests are incredibly unfair. They don't test the material well at all. It's basically \"how good are you at figuring out trick questions.\" I swear I knew the material INCREDIBLY WELL, and yet I got tons of questions wrong. This class is just a total waste of a Yale course credit. Pick something else.",
    "Social Psychology is a good class, especially for Psychology majors who have to meet the core requirement. This class provides you with very basic, informative, and useful information about human socialization. The coursework is very manageable -- there were only 2 essays and 2 exams. Professor Lafrance is great. She's a great lecturer and she really cares about her students. I have no complaints.",
    "take this course if you are interested in the topics at hands or if you're looking for a relatively easy lecture course (or both)",
    "I really enjoyed this class - fun reading and lecture content. I always felt like it was a gut and that I was just confirming common knowledge or learning the experiments that proved things you just assume... But when it came to the midterms it was never really as easy as expected so don't be fooled. Fun class, not the hardest, but not the easiest either.",
    "This was a classic psych survey course. It was not life changing or very enlightening. However, it did teach good concepts in social psych that are useful, especially if you are interested in the field. I think this is one of the better survey courses, especially with Professor LaFrance. You have two essays and two exams, all of which are assessed fairly and not too stressful. Make sure to read the book, as many of the studies that you are tested on are not covered in lecture. I would recommend this course if you have to take a survey course for the psych major. If you are just looking for a psych class to take for fun, I would shop around a bit.",
    "AMAZING! This course answered a lot of the random questions I had about why people behave the way they do. Wonderful overview of social psych. Probably my favorite class this semester. I also found Prof LaFrance entertaining. pretty chill, too - just 2 papers and 2 exams. just make sure to keep up with the readings.",
    "Social Psych was a good course. I would recommend it, especially for potential psych majors.",
    "I would recommend this course! The material is very interesting, and it is taught in a straightforward manner. Although, for advanced psych majors the material may overlap quite a bit with your other psych courses. Also keep in mind the lecture material is often quite similar to what is presented in the textbook",
    "Yes, I would recommend",
    "Social Psychology is a very good class if you are curious about the forces that drive people to act in certain ways. If you are at all interested in psychology, I would highly recommend it. The material is interesting, and you are able to gain insights about human behavior that can otherwise be confounding.",
    "Psyc 150 is just a introduction to social psychology. The class can be summarized by the presentation of a lot of different researches and their results.",
    "Great Cr\/D class with interesting and useful material. Very little work involved if you go to lecture and skim the textbook.",
    "PSYC 150 is a great course that introduces students to the many different facets of Social Psychology. Definitely take it! The class will change your perspective on social interaction and help you to understand the conversations you have on a daily basis. The class builds upon some information from PSYC 110, but you do not need to have taken PSYC 110 to understand and enjoy the material presented in this course.",
    "If you liked IntroPsych, you are going to love this class: the content is fascinating, the professor great, and the examinations--2 papers and 2 midterms--very fair. Definitely take this class if you have only the slightest affinity to psychology and people.",
    "This is a solid introductory course think intro psych which a different focus. likewise this is an intro course so the workload is benign. The teacher is engaging but not stellar. all and all a good course. nothing special."
