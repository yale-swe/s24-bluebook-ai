   "comments": [
    "Museum& Nation was a great course for students specializing in contemporary or Middle Eastern art, but also for anyone interested in institutional history. The course made me question museum practice in the US and Europe.",
    "The trip aside, I would recommend this course to other students. It's exciting to be studying material that is so new, and to feel that our dialogue surrounding the issues at stake might actually contribute in some way to broader discussions going on right now. Professor Rizvi did a good job of integrating historical and theoretical texts to ground the discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student."

   "comments": [
    "In my dissertation, I hope to incorporate museum institutional history--this course was a valuable opportunity to study institutions as they form, which has become a great lens for my own research.",
    "This course broadened my perspective on not only museums but on all aspects of traveling for research by exposing me to a new region that I had never studied before. I feel that I learned more on the two week trip than I had in the entirety of last year. I can now speak intelligently and critically about multiple aspects and problems in the Persian Gulf. I now have well crafted opinions and arguments about the issues in the region as well--and can importantly back them up with on the ground experience.",
    "This course allowed me to conduct field research in Qatar and Dubai and to meet with a group of academics, museum professionals, and architects working in the Middle East. This experience will play a critical role in my research."
