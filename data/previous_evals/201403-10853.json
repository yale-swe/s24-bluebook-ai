    "Very well taught class. Highly recommended for new imaging students",
    "Good class but be prepared to be doing psets constantly. If this class had half the work load, its usefulness would increase exponentially as students would have time to actually understand material at a reasonable pace.",
    "This course covers all the biosensing methods available. Biosenors and imaging modalities are considered in significant detail. I would recommend this course to BME's who intend to design biosensors or who have a focus in imaging. I do not think the current design of the class is all that relevant to all the BME students."
