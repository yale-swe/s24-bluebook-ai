    "I found English 120 to be a generally interesting and rewarding course that helped me to improve my writing. The readings are fairly varied and often quite enjoyable, and helped illustrate the techniques that 120 students are encouraged to develop. The grading is tough but fair, and the workload is manageable although the deadlines are somewhat crammed together at the start of the semester. I would definitely recommend taking English 120 with Professor Shirkhani!",
    "I would summarize ENGL 120 as a class where you read a lot of great essays by great authors (although perhaps too heavy on David Foster Wallace and racial issue pieces) and really become more aware of your tendencies as a writer. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 120 10 for a fellow student. It was my favorite course of the semester. The course is about \"reading and writing the modern essay,\" so the students study and emulate creative non-fiction personal essays. The readings are so enjoyable-- some of the great authors we studied were David Foster Wallace, David Sedaris, and Joan Didion. There are 5 units, and each has a theme for which students have corresponding readings and try to emulate in their own essay. The themes\/units are Personal Experience, Place, Portraying a Person, Cultural Critique, and Satire. For each unit there is a Writer's Workshop: a few students give copies of their essays to everyone in the class, and the other students evaluate the essays, make commentary, and give constructive criticism. These workshops are really helpful, and it's great to be able to read the work of your peers.",
    "ENGL 120 is a must-take at Yale. Having debated between ENGL 114 and 120 for a long time before settling on 120, I am so glad I decided to take The Modern Essay, especially with the gem that is Professor Shirkhani. I have never considered myself a creative person, or a good writer, so writing creatively seemed beyond the realm of possibility. But this class is accessible to everyone. Each essay had a great amount of flexibility in terms of topic, so you can really explore anything you want while working on your writing (what a deal!). Most of the readings for every theme (personal experience, place, person, cultural critique, satire) are absolutely fantastic, and I enjoyed our class discussions immensely (even for a 9 AM class). Prof. Shirkhani is a wonderful facilitator. I really appreciate and am so inspired by Prof. Shirkhanis dedication to the class and her students. She sets aside so much out-of-class time to work with each and every one of her students! Her draft comments are extensive and thoughtful. I can confidently say that this class and Professor Shirkhani gave me the motivation to continue writing, to keep honing the skills I picked up in this class, as well as the self-esteem to look at my own writing not only with a critical eye but also a positive perspective. Writing is a skill that everyone should have, and it is a skill that can always be improved. Even though I spent countless hours on each essay, and while the grading can be rough sometimes, I am proud of the work I produced because its just on a whole new level from what I produced in high school. This is a class where you get out what you put in (and I dont necessarily mean a shiny A on your transcript when I say what you get out grades arent everything). While ENGL 114 has its merits, I think it perpetuates a rigid and uncreative mode of thinking that weve been taught all our lives. If you have hesitations about 120 because you dont think its for you, dont take a risk, step outside of your comfort zone (were at Yale, after all!) and enjoy the ride. You wont regret it.",
    "If you take this class, you will become better at reading essays critically, and your own writing will improve. You will receive lots of feedback for your work as well. However, be prepared to work for your grade. Dr. Shirkhani can be harsh, but in the end you will benefit.",
    "Five soul-sucking but very fun essays, and lots of interesting reading. If you really want to write better - that is, write better sentences, read essays better - you have to take this class.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like - you read essays and then write essays. I would recommend it if you enjoy reading the kind of stuff that's published in the New Yorker and want your writing to be of a higher caliber, and aren't willing to have your work torn down and built back up again.",
    "Great class, most akin to application essay writing or journalism. However, I'm involved in neither and still produced pieces I'm proud of, which are more relevant and accessible than most academic essays. The method of emulating the techniques of other writers is a great one. Prof Shirkhani met with each of us after we turned in our drafts, which was SUPER helpful for the revision process and producing a polished final piece. Overall would recommend, I find myself analyzing language more now.",
    "We read highly-esteemed authors' essays, then attempted to create our own by following their examples. I would definitely recommend the course to another student who was interested in becoming a better writer and\/or reading really good writing. The course taught me to be a closer reader and a more mindful writer, and was also a lot of fun."
