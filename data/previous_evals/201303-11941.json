   "comments": [
    "Portuguese is a fun language to learn and Brazilian culture is very interesting. I would recommend this class to anyone with any interest in traveling to Brazil or other Portuguese speaking countries.",
    "Great class for those looking for a new language. Knowledge of Spanish is helpful in reading although your pronunciation will be off. The professor probably makes this class and Vanessa was a star!",
    "Don't take an L1 class for fun, which is what I did after having already completed the language requirement. First, although it is not that much hard work, it meets everyday. Second, you are forced to take L2 directly after if you want to receive the credit for L1. Overall, although the class was interesting, if I could go back, I would take some other class that 1) doesn't meet everyday, 2) fulfills some requirement that I haven't done yet, and 3) doesn't require me to take a second part the following semester to receive credit for the first semester.",
    "Pretty good class. Workload is a bit much, but take this class if you want to learn the language fully. In order to get a good grade you must be very diligent.",
    "For sure! It's a fun language to pick up, but also make sure it's something you want to use some day - if you don't plan on going to Brazil (especially) or Portugal, maybe take something based more on your interest levels. Background in another Romance language (ESPECIALLY SPANISH) is super super helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with a background in Spanish who hopes to learn a new language that is not too difficult.",
    "A class that teaches you basic, conversational Portuguese. I would recommend the class, it was fun and I learned a lot."
