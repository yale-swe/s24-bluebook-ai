    "I would recommend it to both Japan specialists and those with a general interest in film. I would caution undergrads that the class was half graduate students and sometimes the conversation seemed pitched at the grads, based on supplementary readings they had in Japanese, which left most of the undergrads out. It's therefore helpful to have some Japanese background to get the most out of this class."

   "comments": [
    "Since I come from a literary studies background, there was a lot of valuable foundational information. I felt like I became comfortable with the basic conversations about Japanese film (at least before 1960), and I'm also glad for the perspectives I gained on ways to think about mass culture and cultural discourse."
