    "Overview of main topics in the study of international security, e.g. theory of war, international relations theories (realism, liberalism, and constructivism), nuclear proliferation, terrorism, civil conflict, unipolar vs. multipolar worlds, etc. How to critique readings of prominent IR scholars. Importance of methodology in the discipline.",
    "A broad analysis on many different aspects of international security around the world that will help me in my development of learning different diplomatic elements, such as U.S. national security interests, but also from the point of view on non-state actors, etc.",
    "Very basic understanding of international security. That's about it.",
    "This course was very effective in forcing me to think critically of readings. Prior to this class, I took almost everything that I read in papers as facts. This class, however pushed me to challenge everything. Which is a skill that I think will serve me well in life.",
    "I learned about several theories of International relations and the progression in warfare since the 1800s. I also learned about several contemporary areas of study in security. I developed skills in critiquing academic literature.",
    "We learned fundamental concepts in international security.",
    "A deeper understanding of IR theories an ways to critique them.",
    "I learned about different security theories, and how to think critically about DC establishment views",
    "Learned a lot about IR theories, types and causes of war, roots of global instability, nuclear proliferation, etc.",
    "Survey course on major topics of international security, including great power politics, grand strategy. terrorism and insurgency, nuclear politics, etc.",
    "This was a fascinating course that truly did teach me the broader topics of international security theory. I think that it was a great overview class that covered necessary topics.",
    "This course discussed a basic overview of international security",
    "international security theories",
    "Through this course, we learned about the present threats to human security and the use of violence across different contexts, both by state and non-state actors. I learned much about the different underlying concepts and theories that frame the study of the use of violence and how security may or may not be preserved. In addition, the course touches upon research methods employed in the study of international security and actively encourages us to engage with, and critique, the material at hand.",
    "Great overview of the security dilemma and various political theories and grand strategies of nations vis-a-vis other nations, particularly among the superpowers. Syllabus is pretty clear",
    "Learned a good deal about various theoretical and methodological approaches to International Security. This course doesn't really cover current topics in IS or anything like that, mostly just theory.",
    "How to critically analyze readings, what the effects of nuclear weapons or the causes of war etc. actually are as opposed to public perception",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the professor and the readings! Weaknesses are mainly about the structure of the class - with no midterm or final, and discussion sections that were more about general topics in International Security than about specific readings, there was little or no reason to do the readings or go to class, and it showed: Professor Monteiro would frequently ask why no-one was showing up to his lectures and why no-one was talking about the readings in section :(",
    "This is an amazing course! I have no negative things to say about it!",
    "Strengths: Professor Monteiro is a very skilled lecturer and discussion leader. He captivates the audience's attention with his deep insights, broad knowledge, and his witty jokes. Weaknesses: More guidance could be provided on writing reading response papers. Reading load could be more consistent between the weeks.",
    "Strengths: Professor Monteiro Weaknesses: Very research focused, less theoretical, policy approaches.",
    "This is likely the most anti-intellectual course I have taken at Yale and involved regular anti-Semitic comments from students. In our discussion sections (led by the professor), we would never actually address the readings. Section was a performative Q&A with the professor and the questions were rarely related to the readings. Without fail, every section included a wildly off-base debate on the Israel\/Palestine conflict without any evidence to back up stances and endless name-calling without explanation. Students would make abhorrent accusations and seemed to confuse Jewish students for the State of Israel and for Netanyahu. Jewish students were automatically linked to the State of Israel without any reason. The professor condoned this behavior and on occasion contributed to it. In one lecture that had nothing to do with Israel, he brought up the \"Israel lobby\" and clarified \"not the Jewish lobby.\" In one section, he interrupted a Jewish student talking about the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead and injured 7 and said \"mosque\" instead of synagogue. Whether that he misspoke or meant it, I do not know, but the effect was chilling. He then closed the last lecture with a wildly inappropriate complaint about how his work has been used by the \"Israel lobby\" against his will. This course has rightfully become known among Jewish students at Yale for its anti-Semitic discussions (and yes, a student compared Israel to Nazi Germany, labeled Israel supporters as white-supremacists, and much more). Both of these student comments constitute anti-Semitism according to the United States State Department's definition (readily available online). Even beyond the anti-Semitic discussions, the course material had nothing to do with the assignments. There were three reading responses and one final paper, but on the topic of your choosing. Thus, lecture attendance was unsurprisingly low. To improve this course, either Professor Monteiro needs to learn how to control his classroom or the Jackson Institute should find someone else to teach this course. This course was an affront to Yale's mission to pursue intellectual inquiry and to discover light and truth. I hope that the Yale administration can stop this course's blatant prejudice.",
    "Professor Monteiro's lecturing style is excellent--classes were always very interesting and engaging. I was not necessarily expecting to be very excited by the course material, but he did a good job of making the subject matter relevant by connecting theory to current events and adding in funny jokes or stories throughout class. He also just knows so much about international relations. The course reading list provided a broad overview of the field of security studies, but realistically it was difficult to complete every single one. A more focused selection might be better so that everyone has the chance to complete all the readings, and we can cover each piece in section. I would not say that section was particularly necessary--it seemed more like a Q&A than a discussion, and it is unclear how participation was graded. Switching to longer lectures with no section or optional\/TA-led section would make sense to me.",
    "This should be a writing credit, we had to write way too much for this not be a writing credit.",
    "Great lectures. Perhaps there could be one or two response papers and then something different to encourage engaging with texts in a different less formulaic way.",
    "Strengths: -Professor Monteiro is great lecturer -Section taught by professor -Engaging lecture structure + reading material Weaknesses: -Expectations in section should be outlined more clearly and consistent -Section could be better facilitated to encourage student discussion and debate -Would be helpful to go over expectations and more specific rubric for responses and paper earlier in the semester",
    "Section is not run well- it's basically a Q&A session with professor. Instead, try to have students engage with material. Also section was too big. Because the papers are on any article assigned, there's really no incentive to come to class",
    "Great professor, although sections are pretty dry and feel like Q&As with the professor. Topic is really interesting. TAs are standard.",
    "Lectures were interesting. The course could be improved by providing more guidance for writing the response papers, and shortening or changing the assigned readings so that they are less redundant.",
    "Good introduction to international security but I wished the theoretical lectures would have been complemented with more examples\/case studies\/discussion",
    "Strengths: Professor Monteiro is very passionate about the subject and very organized with his slides. Weaknesses: This also means that he can tend to read from the slides and become repetitive after a while. It may be useful to implement a quiz system to try to make the class more engaging. Otherwise, it is very difficult to get everyone to participate.",
    "It is absolutely amazing that Nuno teaches his own sections. Wow!",
    "I think that the class would have been more beneficial as a basic 101. By Junior year as a GA major, I had already covered most of the topics in the course.",
    "great course; would really love to see more female scholars in the syllabus",
    "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The readings were interesting and well-structured to present differing viewpoints on the topic; often, Professor Monteiro would introduce two or more scholars in the conversation with different, nuanced opinions. I also thought the course was great as sort of a hybrid lecture and seminar series. I have never attended a discussion section for a lecture course that is led by my professor, and I found it incredibly enriching to expound further on my professor's thoughts; I also thought it added to the quality of discussion as well. Lectures were interesting and provided a great summary of the readings and the concepts at hand.",
    "EXTREMELY theoretical which gets pretty redundant after a while, particularly if you are more of an applied science kind of person. You will learn that every theory you could ever pose to govern behavior (i.e. respond to a security threat) is immediately irrelevant the second that this theory is stated publicly or a strategy becomes known. That being said, the lectures are pretty incredible; Professor Monteiro has incredible insight into the realm of international security and his lecture slides are very well done, although he does cover a lot of information very quickly in lectures. Section for me was pretty well dominated by a select couple of students who felt the need to control the conversation (you all know the type), but this is pretty typical of political science and global affairs seminars (which the section, taught by Monteiro, attempted to embody).",
    "Nuno is good lecturer, course material is interesting, the slides are by far the best slides I have ever seen in any class at Yale in terms of summarizing information (even if I tries to take notes without writing down what was on the slides, I just ended up writing down what was on the slides). Major weakness is just that because there are no exams or really anything that requires you to attend lecture, there ends up being no reason to go. I went to only a handful of lectures the whole semester as a result (especially since it's all the way in Watson).",
    "Nuno is a phenomenal lecturer and can transform the dense readings into concise yet powerful and informative lectures. Just be prepared for the readings and papers, especially if you're not as confident in writing or in the topic, since the response papers will actually require you be to critical of the readings as opposed to just agreeing with the author and enhancing their arguments.",
    "Strengths: Nuno is a great lecturer. Weaknesses: I wish Nuno didn't teach the sections, it's a lot more helpful in a discussion section in my opinion to review content from lecture with a TF who is able to put the concepts in more digestible terms to students. Nuno was sometimes a little unapproachable in section."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - Global majors have to take it, and the material is very interesting!",
    "Yes!",
    "If you are a global affairs major, you must take this class. But others can also benefit from this course if they wish to learn more about international security.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as it really gives you the necessary background on international security topics for anyone pursuing a career in global affairs.",
    "Absolutely not! I am almost done with the Global Affairs major, and throughout the first part of the semester, I even considered dropping the entire major because of this course. If you care about intellectual inquiry, this course is not for you. Moreover, if you are a Jewish student, this course is not for you. I never thought that I would write those words about a Yale course, but here we are. Throughout the semester, all my friends knew to be on call Wednesday after section. This course made Jewish students feel unwelcome and rightly became known on campus for its anti-Semitic discussions. And to make it absolutely clear, discussing the Israel\/Palestine conflict is rightfully important, but it must be done responsibly and without name calling. However, when another student called Israel supporters white supremacists and permitters of genocide, I think the intellectual conversation ended.",
    "Yes yes",
    "This class is a requirement for the Global major, but it is actually very enjoyable. I'm glad I had the chance to explore some of the class's themes with an instructor as knowledgeable and entertaining as Professor Monteiro.",
    "Yes, take it if you like writing. Lecture is super interesting.",
    "The core problem of the class and its students' low attendance is that its instructor appears to have been in a nuclear bunker since bin Laden's first attacks in the 1990s. In the three decades since, the curriculum's underlying assumption aged to antiquation: sovereignty has become endogenous to conflict (to state, in the fecklessly theoretical terms the course requires, the reality of modern asymmetric insurgents, enjoying int'l support). This course requires the oversight of an expert in current shadow\/proxy conflict or one in countering violent extremism. Instead, the course and its instructor regrettably cling to a crumbling Ivory Tower of Cold War nuclear theory which, while necessary for any decent history department, is so masturbatory that it neglects to discuss how unconventional weapons could transfer to insurgents, P\/VE by proxy, or any question (or 'approach') of international security debated among 'Great Powers.' The authors of the course fail to recognize that many of its students next year were born in 2000, and will live an entire life after the 9\/11 attacks, none of the many evolutions (in security theory) of which are discussed or even recognized by the course, with its single clumped 'CT' class discussed as if we just finished the Carter administration's hostage (and thus simply viewed it as a minor unitary issue, for the kinetic action and not for Yale academics). To his credit, Nuno Monteiro readily admits the cases where his assumptions are undermined by modernity, when prodded, and is a wonderful lector. As a Global Affairs core, however, the course should not be countenanced without redesign. And Yale will need scholars like Lyall to do it, whose rejection from tenure will remain a scourge on this institution for the remainder of his career. Clinging to useless theory is derelict in Yale's task of arming the next generation of public servants for the security challenges of the 21st century.",
    "Yes if they want to go into international security, but not a great class to take away material from",
    "Mandatory Global class, but actually quite good. Nuno is wonderful",
    "Yes!!!",
    "Yes, take it if you have to for global.",
    "If required for Global",
    "I would recommend this class for a wide overview of theory. I think that the structure of the class made it difficult to make sure that everyone got similar levels of knowledge. The readings were long and arduous making it hard to do all of them. Also, the assignments were all very specific to the individual.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Listening to Nuno speak is one of the most interesting things you could do. Hes an incredible professor.",
    "Only if the student hasn't done other international security related courses such as Game Theory in IR or Nuclear Politics",
    "yes fantastic course extremely engaging",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While it is a required course for the Global Affairs major, I would recommend this class to anyone who has the slightest interest in international security, war, or just the transformation of the way we wage war or use political violence over time. This is a fantastic course where the lectures are interesting and engaging, and you have significantly more exposure to the professor to discuss ideas further. I found myself motivated and enthused to keep up with the readings, as well as to attend lecture. Going in, I was apprehensive about my interest in the subject, but this course has truly broadened my perspective on the topics discussed.",
    "Honestly you have to be passionate about this stuff and it would be best if you had a strong background in studies of the superpowers, as they will dominate the conversation of the course.",
    "(If you're not Global): If you want to learn a lot about theories of international relations, take it. Otherwise, don't. Also it's almost identical to Intro to International relations, which Nuno also sometimes teaches.",
    "Yes, especially if you're new to IS, this is a good introduction that covers a broad range of topics, and you couldn't take it with a better professor.",
    "It's required, so I guess I would recommend it, but I wish they would let the TFs lead discussion sections instead of Nuno (or at least have more section options - a Nuno section option and a TF-led option)"
