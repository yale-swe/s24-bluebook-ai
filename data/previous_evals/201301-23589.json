    "As a student interested in wildlife management I frequently feel like FES doesn't have enough classes\/events\/speakers tied to my interests. This class went a long way towards making me feel better. Amy and Bill are great people, extremely engaged and friendly. They also helped me get a summer internship when my original project fell through in March. The level of mentorship I received through this class is greater than any other FES connection I've had, including advisors.",
    "This course was particularly valuable given that it is the only course in the curriculum actually covering the application of ecology, anthropology, and policy to wildlife conservation. I would have preferred a 3 hour course session to allow for deeper discussion into each topic, but on the whole I was immensely pleased with the course.",
    "This course was great in that it brought together people who are interested in international wildlife conservation. But the concepts were lightly introduced and barely covered. I think more than anything this course tried to do too much in too little time. I think it would have been better if the course had picked out 6-8 key issues of conservation to talk about. Or spent less time involved in the theory. Or focused solely on the theory. But to touch on the theory and concepts and then move into surface examples of how those are used and then to ask the class to discuss it was a clustered mess."

    "Professors! they were great. I really enjoyed the guest speakers as well",
    "That I had a forum in which to discuss important concepts with other students who are interested in wildlife conservation, and particularly, with Amy and Bill. Their decades of experience were incredibly valuable for discussions, because they provided insights that are unavailable through any other forum here at FES. My only disappointment is that they are not here permanently. I also enjoyed that the participants came from varied backgrounds and perspectives, because it allowed for very rich discussion and debate.",
    "Exposure to a practitioner with years of experience in developing countries.The guided discussion format enabled the instructors to contribute but also gave room for students to share perspectives from their experiencesThe series of invited speakers and practitioners added a richness and depth to the topics covered",
    "Discussion. Learning from the perspectives of conservation practitioners.",
    "Student-led discussions and presentations, guest lectures; really enjoyed the \"speed-dating\" student presentations at the end of the semester",
    "The best aspects of this course were when we had guest speakers or Bill or Amy talked. Hearing their experiences was invaluable.",
    "Amy Vedder and Bill Weber (the instructors) were by far the best aspects of this course. We NEED more people like them at FES. They are practitioners with decades of real-world experience, and both did an excellent job sharing their knowledge and experiences with us. They could advise us on many of the practical elements of conservation, in a way that many of my more theoretical classes have not been able to.",
    "The teachers. They have so much experience and are so passionate about what they do. I would have preferred to hear more from them.",

   "comments": [
    "Maybe add a 1 hour discussion section once a week? It seemed like we never had enough time to talk about stuff.",
    "The pacing of the course was at times challenging - 1.5 hour sessions meant that discussions were often cut short. However, having 3 hour sessions would cut down on the number of topics that could be covered.",
    "The classes were too short and often",
    "I would like to see how the academic people think about the work of conservation practitioners.",
    "maybe more foundation literature\/literature reviews for the key concepts discussed, in addition to the case studiesWould have liked guest lecturers to explain more about what it's like working at a large conservation NGO and what to expect when having a career in such an organization (this came up a little bit more at dinners which were very helpful)",
    "While student teaching is a nice idea, sometimes it doesn't work out very well -- especially when we're taking the course to hear from the teacher, not our fellow students. Also, I think that this course tried to cover a lot of material which didn't allow us to learn in-depth about any of the topics.",
    "I would have liked to see more lectures and presentations from Amy and Bill, and less focus on student input. All the students were engaged and had important points of view--but at the same time, my main interest in the class was being able to learn from Amy and Bill. I felt that after a certain point in the semester, the students (myself included) were just repeating ourselves.",
    "A much more clear idea of where the course is going and what students are supposed to take out of it. Not the we'll see what ideas you (the students) come up with, that it was."

    "It is something not otherwise offered at Yale. It's been wonderful to have a conversation about practical issues relating to conservationat the Forestry School, for goodness sake.",
    "This course is fundamental to my program. As a wildlife conservationist, I desperately needed and wanted a course of this nature to bring together the disparate concepts, theories, and disciplines that I must integrate as a conservation professional. My undergraduate training was in ecology, and my coursework was limited to more fundamental ecological theory. I had never had the opportunity to integrate ecology with other fields. This is the type of course I came back to graduate school to take.",
    "The course provided a great overview of conservation from a practitioners perspective.Provided a good forum to tackle some of the knotty issues in conservationBoth of which will be beneficial for my interactions with communities in conservation areas and with other conservation practitioners.Was also a good 'introductory' course should I decide to take on conservation at a larger scale",
    "Great. It is one of the few courses for wildlife conservation people.",
    "I am interested in conservation biology and applicable conservation science so this course was incredibly helpful. We need more conservation-oriented courses at FES! The first day of class over 40 people showed up for a class slotted at 15 people - shows that there is high demand for these courses in conservation science and not enough to meet the demand",
    "I'm interested in wildlife conservation and a career in the nonprofit sector. This class is one of theonlycourses at FES that provides that perspective. There is an enormous lack of wildlife centric classes at FES--Susan Clark teaches some of these classes, but her classes skew significantly toward the theoretical. I can't stress this enough--we NEED more wildlife and conservation centricclasses at FES!",
    "This could be a great course if its purpose is clarified and more effort is spent in trainingprofessionals-to-be and less effort is spent in treating us like children who have no idea what conservation entails.",
