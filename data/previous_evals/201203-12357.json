    "I would HIGHLY recommend this for any English major to get rid of one of their pre 1800 requirements. Kastan is hilarious, the TFs are engaging, and the subject is amazing. Overall definitely a course not to be missed.",
    "Definitely take this class. Will be one of my best memories of Yale. Shakespeare is everything, and it's good to get a solid foundation on his works.",
    "I thought the course was fantastic. It had a great overview of the histories and tragedies of the Shakespeare plays, and Professor Kastan was a wonderful lecturer. I felt like I learned a lot about Shakespeare and the time period, along with his works themselves. I would recommend this class to anyone. TAKE IT!",
    "Yeah, you'll get smarter, as Kastan will tell you. You'll get smarter in a very specific way--reading Shakespeare, which takes some getting used to but can be a lot of fun--and maybe in some general ways as well. Somewhat more work than one might expect, but maybe not more than one would want. The assignments are well written, and I'd assume grading varies by TA. Section is as always hit and\/or miss. Oh, but the big thing is that lectures are really fun.",
    "English 201 is a survey of Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies. I am glad that I have now read these plays; those that I had read before, like Hamlet and Macbeth, I gained a whole new perspective on, and those that I hadn't read, such as Coriolanus and Titus Andronicus, I am happy to now add to my repertoire. The lectures are GREAT. I was never bored and always left feeling like it was worthwhile that I had read the play and attended the lecture. The course is a LOT of reading, though. It got overwhelming sometimes. Also, I think that depending on the TA, the standards for the papers can be very high (though perhaps this is as it should be!).",
    "This is a must-take English lecture, and you can really take it at any stage during your Yale career. You'll get something different out of it each time. Kastan's brilliant, as you probably know. I don't think his brilliance was always visible during lecture; sometimes he just rambled without a lot of structure, and he has a propensity toward tangents. But when he was on, he was ON. I teared up during his King Lear lecture, and he starts and ends the class with a bang on Titus Andronicus and Antony& Cleopatra, two plays I'd never really care about without him. The reading list is obviously great, and the assignments are FUN. Seriously, FUN. It's a great breather class -- not because it's necessarily easy (though it's not terribly hard) but because all of a sudden, Kastan, unlike most of your profs, is trying to get you to think about reading in a new way. This course teaches reading in a way that even 125 and 126 can't get close to -- and I'm a senior English major. Kastan is such a scholar and he's so ready to share that brilliance, too; he's really accessible and issues a standing coffee date with anyone in the course who just wants to get to know him a bit. Bucket list Yale class: take it.",
    "YES! take this class! Kastan is hilarious and the lectures are SO interesting. You'll love it, and you won't be afraid of Shakespeare anymore, if you are now. I absolutely loved this. Best class I took this semester.",
    "I would recommend this wholeheartedly -TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "This is a class that everyone at Yale should not graduate without taking. It is really a fabulous course. All the writing you do really helps you to learn a lot and to get to know the plays incredibly well. I feel so enriched.",
    "yes I would recommend it but really only if you're willing\/eager to read the plays",
    "Yea. Take it. It's a good course and gets you reading Shakespeare . Some of it can be a little dry but I really enjoyed it in the end. The take home is time consuming not impossible and actually a really great summation of the class but maybe look at your finals schedule to see if you can spend a bunch of days working on it.",
    "ENGL 201 is an overview and exploration of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. I would recommend it to students who are interested in reading and analyzing Shakespeare's works, and most of all, gaining skills for analysis. The skill set we learned for analyzing the plays was probably the most important takeaway from this class for me.",
    "Shakespeare with Professor Kastan is a good class. The workload is manageable, and I think Professor Kastan's lectures and the writing assignments add a lot to one's understanding.",
    "Great for the plays, not great for the lectures.",
    "Wonderful class, especially if you love Shakespeare. Kastan is an engaging and fascinating lecturer, plus he takes every student who wants to out to coffee. If he's still a TF, TAKE IT WITH AARON, he was absolutely fantastic. The paper topics are unusual but actually turn out very interesting, and Aaron really helped clarify Kastan's often vague instructions. Overall, I would highly recommend it.",
    "If you wanna get into shakespeare this class is great. Be wary of the final exam though, VERY time consuming.",
    "Shakespeare Histories and Tragedies is a great course to take if you are interesting in learning about Shakespeare, especially with Professor Kastan! But you would need to be sure to keep up with the readings... (~1 play per week).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I knew little about Shakespeare beforehand, but throughout the semester I came to really love reading his work. Plus, I think an introduction to Shakespeare is a very important part of a liberal arts education, no matter your major.",
    "This is a wonderful way to read most of Shakespeare's classics. Professor Kastan makes Shakespeare relevant in a way that few of my teachers ever have. Lecture is actually a lot of fun to go to - I never wanted to skip it. The plays are interesting, although, I will admit that I definitely did not have time to read them all.",
    "Solidly good class. Lectures were good, Kastan is a good lecturer and pretty humorous. The take-home final is do-able; took me 15-20 hours total. Do not underestimate the reading; some of the plays are rather long (esp if you read closely). I learned a lot from this class, especially in terms of close reading and just how to read Shakespeare. Some of the plays I LOVED (Othello), some not so much, but I really appreciated the class overall. Very glad I took it. Over the course of this class, I actually learned(?) to love Shakespeare.",
    "Three easy and short papers, lecture twice a week, one killer take-home final with six essays. Amazing class. This is the only real Yale class I feel every student should take before graduation (yes, I've taken Intro Psych). It was so remarkable accessing these works, and Professor Kastan is wonderful. During shopping period, honestly, I was a little turned off by his sense of humor, and he is the only lecturer who insists you don't open your laptop and will single you out if enter late or leave early. I found his insistence on these formalities made lecture much more enjoyable as the semester went on, and I actually think every lecturer should insist students to afford this kind of respect. I think the reading list is very manageable, and actually, sometimes I felt I spent way too much time rereading the plays than I actually had time for. So, just take this class, regardless of if you're an English major, because you won't regret it. I hope the plays will stay with me forever, and if not, I know I will encounter Shakespeare later in life, and revisiting these plays will invite back all the memories of Yale intellect this class embodied.",
    "I definitely recommend if you are interested in expanding your knowledge of a classic playwright.",
    "A fine intro to Shakespeare. Kastan is a brilliant man. But he didn't really excite my imagination in any way, which was very disappointing.",
    "This course is WONDERFUL. It is a great introduction to the histories (which many, I think, have not read- I certainly hadn't!) and a fresh look at well-known (and obscure- cough cough Coriolanus) tragedies. Professor Kastan is WONDERFUL his lectures are completely engaging, and you will find yourself laughing, almost crying, and thinking about works like Hamlet and Macbeth in a totally new way. Lectures are not always successful, but THIS ONE IS! Professor Kastan pays great attention to details of Shakespeare's language (in the greater context of the play) and sees things that we would NEVER see (and shares them with us! oh boy!) The assignments are very rewarding, somewhat time-consuming, and definitely worth it. For a lot of them, you have a choice of essays, so you can select a play that you understand best.Amazingly, section is also really fun! Andrew Kau was my TA, and he was great; the success of section probably depends on the TA, but I heard from friends in the course that theirs were fun too.Definitely take it!",
    "Kastan is phenomenal. He is quite full of himself but rightly so. You will walk away from every class feeling like you've learned more than you ever could from a high school English class. You read about a play a week but its' not necessary to do all the reading. You write 3 essays and have one take home test and the emphasis is on close reading-basically as close as you can get. You will greatly enjoy this course if you want to actually know Shakespeare beyond the kitsch hero-worship that surrounds him today. You will explore why he made the choices he did and in doing so realize his brilliance in a way you couldn't from just seeing a production on your own. Take it!",
    "This English class is one of the top courses at Yale and a must-take before you graduate. Be prepared though, it is a lot of work (I took it credit d) but that said the work is interesting and enjoyable. The exam is also extremely long...perhaps too long which would be my only complaint about the course. Otherwise, though, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This is a whirlwind introduction to two genres of Shakespeare's plays. Kastan has fascinating, sometimes controversial things to say about each play, and a fairly brilliant way of looking at the course material as a whole. He thinks the way Shakespeare relates to genre is in acknowledging its conventions, but pushing them as far as they can go (sometimes farther). \"Coriolanus\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" in his view, represent two rival endpoints of tragedy. The reading is one play a week (very occasionally two) and the intermittent assignments included both essays and an idiosyncratic exercise called \"manic glossing.\" If you take the course, definitely take Kastan up on his offers of meeting for coffee with interested students. He's very personable and always scintillating in conversation.",
    "BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE! If you like Shakespeare, definitely take this class! Kastan is amazing: he's incredibly insightful and passionate about the plays and he's also really funny. Workload is not that bad: a short assignment, two papers and a take-home final, all of which really prompt you to think about the plays and engage with them.",
    "Decent course on some of Shakespeare's lesser known histories and great tragedies. A decent overview but not really compelling. Having a good TA is important here. Take it if you want to fulfill a req easily, have\/read all of Shakespeare's work, and hear some opinions on Shakespeare. Keeping up with the readings (especially if you've already read some) is not really necessary to do well\/decent in the course& keep up in section but it's necessary for the final if you don't want to spend forever on it.An OK course overall.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I would recommend that absolutely everybody take it. The essays seemed a bit overwhelming at times (this is mainly directed at the take-home final), but were the type that actually did make me feel accomplished upon their completion and helped me understand the plays I selected much better.",
    "Seriously, please take this course. It was by far my favorite course of the semester. I'm not an English major, but I didn't let that stop me. I Cr\/D-ed the course becuase I knew that I'm not as good at writing essays as the other English majors, so there are ways around it. Kastan is the best lecturer, and he really makes you think about the plays in a different light. For all of you who have even a fleeting interest in Shakespeare, this is the best class there could possibly be, since you get to read just about all his tragedies and histories. Even the essay assignments are brilliantly designed so that you can't really BS your way through them, but the process of writing them will help you understand the material on a whole new level and gain a better appreciation of Shakespeare's genius.",
    "i would not recommend this course. workload is too high. especially for final exam",
    "Absolutely. Everyone should study Shakespeare in college, and there is no better professor to do it with than Professor Kastan.",
    "Shakespeare can be scary, and this course familiarized me with his work so that I understand much more. The assignments are actually quite helpful for developing reading skills. It was always tempting to skip the reading, but if you do the work, you will benefit from it greatly."
