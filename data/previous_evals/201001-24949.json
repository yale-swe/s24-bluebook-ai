    "O Biophysics.Basically: take this if you have to, if you don't have to, then don't take it.It's a survey of the physics behind methods used to study biology, with a little Pchem\/molecular motors thrown in this year b\/c of Professor DeLaCruzProfessor Yorgo Modis was on the whole not the most engaging lecturer I've ever seen, nor the most boring. His lectures were impeccable in their organization andclarity, and he was very willing to answer any questions. I came away from lectures knowing a LOT more than I went in with. Great person, good teacher.Professor Enrique De La Cruz was quite the opposite. Very very dynamic lecturer, except for the fact that at the end of class, you sorta wouldn't know what had happened: if you had to summarize the key points of the lecture, none would come to mind--and this is because there weren't any obvious key points most of the time. The lectures, while very dynamic, were disorganized, repetitive, and incomprehensible at times because of EDLC's style. I wasn't really taught much, but I was expected to know a lot.Furthermore, I was upset at the fact that after EDLC wrote a couple of particularly hard midterm questions and didn't prepare us for them at all, we all bombed. He then spent 10 minutes at the beginning of class telling us that it was our fault for overthinking the questions. He tried to shift the blame away from himself when any normal professor would have just accepted that they didn't prepare us well, and tried to improve their teaching. I felt insulted on some level.That said, EDLC is definitely not outright mean like some teachers I've had in the past.Basically, take it if you have to. If not, then something else might be more fun...",
    "MB&B 302 was an okay class. While it is easier than the biochemistry sequence, the exams are graded on a really weird system where your grade is in relation to the highest grade. Additionally, the class is not as well organized as biochemistry. Professors are working really hard to improve this course and I think in the future, it will be better. TAs are phenomenal, though the problem set grading is really arbitrary.",
    "Great way to learn biophysical techniques and the science behind it.",
    "It's required for MB&B. The major is after all Molecular BIOPHYSICS and biochemistry. You can't get around it, so just deal with it. In the end the material is actually interesting, challenging and you will learn something.",
    "This is a pretty bad course (difficult + negative learning). But you probably have to take it, so suck it up.Yorgo is okay as a professor\/lecturer. He often asks us unreasonable questions on quizzes (e.g. \"recreate the 5x5 matrix of reaction mechanisms from this paper\" really, Yorgo?) He should also modify the curriculum to include topics that students can actually grasp and appreciate. Nobody knows what's going on with X-ray crystallography...Enrique De La Cruz, however, is easily the single worst professor at Yale I have had the misfortune to know. I could write 50 pages on my dissatisfaction with Dr. De La Cruz. But let me summarize:1. He wastes time. He will talk about absolutely nothing (rambling on and on and on...) for the first 25 minutes of class. This is NOT an exaggeration. He finally makes it to the second slide of his presentation about 1\/3-1\/2 of the way through the class period! Then, when he's unable to finish his slides, he can't seem to understand why...(Oh, and when he does finally get to his presentation, he continues to talk about nothing.)2. He hasn't a clue how to teach. He uses colloquial language and esoteric metaphors that only serve to cloud the \"points\" he tries to get across. By the end of his lectures, I end up having learned less compared to having not even sat in the class in the first place! He needs to stop talking at his students and start teaching them. If I could get my money back for this course, I would certainly push for it. I would feel even better if it was he who paid the difference.3. He writes incoherent test questions. Nobody understands what he's trying to ask, and almost everyone gets his questions wrong.For example on the final exam: \"create an x-y plot that shows the particle's motion as a function of time...\" and then he goes on to say \"pick a single timepoint for your graphs.\" How does one graph a FUNCTION of time with only ONE TIME POINT? When we asked him to clarify, he only confused us further. I'm under the impression he wanted a parametric curve, but he would NOT TELL US.4. He is condescending. Instead of taking responsibility for his terrible test questions and his manifest inability to teach, he resorts to the accusation that we \"didn't get it.\" Yeah right, Enrique. A group of 30 Yale students \"didn't get it?\" I don't think YOU get it.\/end bitter rant.",
    "Only take if you have to. Not interesting. Difficult. Frustrating. Not recommended. They still don't have their act together.",
    "I came away from this class really liking Biophysics as a subject but the class wasn't the best. They're always changing the course so give it a shot! You probably have to take it anyway. Take it Junior year while you are still engaged in classes.",
    "This class is a mix of basic physical chemistry concepts and current methods in modern Bioscience. The class was reasonable in its instruction, but I would not describe it as my most enjoyable or engaging of the semester. I would not recommend this class except to satisfy the requirements of the MB&B major.",
    "I would not take this class until they actually have a tested syllabus. It seems that the curriculum is not very well structured and the there is no real focus. The book was useless and the psets were quantitative while the tests were qualitative. Overall not particularly good, but good potentially be a very interesting class.",
    "The class is pretty challenging in that some things are only taught superficially, while other things are really dug in depth. It's very difficult to gauge what it is you need to focus on. However, I would recommend the class--it's definitely easier than Chem333.",
    "This course covers some interesting, even fascinating material in biophysics. I think the course has a lot of potential, and as they are re-working it every year, I believe that it could be a very interesting course that is tailored to the interests of MB&B majors. However, it is currently one of the most poorly organized courses I have taken at Yale. Each lecture seems to stand alone, and there is not much of an overarching theme to the course. We also focus on some extremely difficultsubjects without the background to understand them properly, and so we attempt to learn them in a simplistic manner, which can almost be more difficult at times. If you take this course, try to grasp the overarching themes whenever possible, and definitely ask questions when you're confused. I felt like I was teaching much of the course to myself while studying, until I asked very specific questions to the professors and TAs and was able to get the exact answers I needed to truly understand the material.",
    "I would tend not to recommend it unless you have to take it, but I was not particularly interested in the material. I found the biochem half of MBB much more interesting, and therefore the class was not my favorite. That being said, I did learn a lot, but was at times frustrated by the strange curve and the style of the course (very much based on research techniques).",
    "The course is improving, don't be scared of past years.",
    "Very interesting class, would definitely recommend.",
    "If you are an MB&B major and have to take this class, then you should. But if not, I don't really recommend it because I didn't feel like I really gained any new knowledge and the material wasn't particularly interesting.",
    "It's not as bad as you think. It's not math heavy, but some of the concepts can be hard to understand.",
    "A straightforward course with some real practical worth, but generally uninspired and uninspiring. Manageable workload, but the curve's a little rough. Prof Modis's lectures are clear and educational. Prof De La Cruz is a fun guy, but you will learn NOTHING from him."
