    "Surprisingly easy class given the amount of complaints I heard about it last year. Don't take it if you're thinking that it will help you get that business internship in Beijing or anything: no amount of studying Chinese with that attitude will get you anywhere. To become acceptable at tough languages like Chinese requires you to be truly passionate about the subject. The people who complain about this class's difficulty are usually the ones taking it just for the language credit, or some other mediocre reasons.",
    "A well-taught class that will get massive amounts of Chinese into your head, if you let it. The workload is huge, but the teachers are awesome, and the textbook can be engaging sometimes (at least better than my high school foreign language textbooks.)",
    "It's an intensive course no doubt, but everything you put in will pay off. If you can devote the time needed, it's DEFINITELY an opportunity you should take. The daily quizzes and homework assignments may feel a little frenetic at first, but you get used to them, and they really help you keep pace. All of the professors are excellent as well."
