    "A great course that will deepen your understanding of climate change and the mechanisms causing global warming. Don't be scared by the title \"climate physics\", there are no psets and it's definitely not your stereotypical physics class. You read a series of academic papers that date back to the 1800's that try to model climate dynamics. If you understand all the physics, that's great! If you don't, Professor Storelvmo will have no problem explaining it to you. She's awesome.",
    "YES YES take this course if you want an awesome science credit. The name sounds intimidating but it's actually not that technically difficult once you get some basic concepts down (which aren't that bad at all). Amazing professor with a seminar-style science class. I honestly had no experience in this field coming in, but I was perfectly fine in class. It teaches you a lot of the physical mechanisms underlying climate change, which is actually extremely useful because you can parse out what is actually true on the media, and what is just politicized bull. Since climate change is such a huge issue nowadays and will probably be an even bigger on in the years to come, the stuff you will learn in this class is very very important.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It gives you an in-depth, scientific look at one of the most relevant issues of our time, Global Warming. I really enjoyed taking a course centered on one topic and learning all aspects of this complicated issue, rather than glossing over it as the media does. Professor Storelvmo is wonderful: she is so knowledgeable and kind, and her lectures are very helpful. The workload was very reasonable and all the work was purposeful and relevant. Great course."
