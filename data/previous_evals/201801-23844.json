   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: wonderful professor and TF weaknesses: none.",
    "A great course with the best instructor.",
    "Very informative on epidemiological methods. Problem sets are very useful in applying concepts learned in class. Really liked how discussion sessions were set up to review information learned that week and go over practice problems that are similar to homework problems",
    "I really enjoyed the class. I think it connected with epidemiology 1 very well, which gave us a good transition and foundation of the deeper concepts. However, I don't really see the point of discussion session since it was repeating the class materials and the TF sometimes were not able to give good answers to questions we had.",
    "Strengths: I learned A TON in this class. Way more than in Epi I and I really feel like I have a good foundation of Epi. The teacher and TA's prepare you well and it's easy to do well in the class if you're willing to put in the work. Limitations: Work load is a lot, but it's a graduate level class so that is expected.",
    "This course did an excellent job at reviewing content in Epi I while adding to it and providing more context. However, much of the material covered in this course was already covered in Epi I. The material could have been expanded upon more and covered more advanced epi topics.",
    "Epi is not my cup of tea, and the lecture format of the course was often dry, but the discussion sections were very helpful and the assignments and exams were always fair. Overall it was a great course and I learned a lot.",
    "It wasn't my favorite course. Honestly, I stopped going to class maybe a month into the semester because I could teach myself the material at home and get the same results on tests and quizes. Again, I wish the lectures weren't just read to us off a powerpoint. There must be a stronger way of conveying material.",
    "I think the course was overall very good. I felt that the beginning was a bit too much of a review from last semester because everyone who is in EPI 2 had to have taken EPI 1 so there wasn't really a need for review. I would have liked to have dived more into the depths of the new material earlier on in the course. I also have heard from previous students that their EPI2 course focused much more on reading and interpreting papers. While I thought the problem sets we had were great review of the material, I would have also liked some practical application as well (I know we had one assignment where we read a paper and interpreted but others would have been good practice too). I also liked that the problem sets were graded....they were good practice and they took a little pressure off of the exams.",
    "Great. A lot of work but very useful to learn basic epidemiological techniques. Strengths: students gain a thorough working knowledge of study design, analytical methods and applicability. Weakness: 1) Homeworks have too strict grading scheme and do not allow for much flexibility. Students spend too much time trying to get the correct answer rather than understanding the material fully. This class is so important especially to PHD students taking qualifying exams. 2) The lectures should be recorded and available to students out of class because students use them to review and study for class exams as well as qualifying exams. 3) Discussion sessions should also be recorded or perhaps conducted as an online course via Zoom, allowing students the flexibility to participate when out of town. Specially because PhD students are constantly attending conferences or conducting field work and having flexibility on Fridays allows for multi-tasking while still fulfilling course requirements.",
    "Didn't gain much from the lectures. Slides were confusing and often it was hard to follow along. Homework assignments were difficult but great preparation for the exams. Discussion sections were extremely helpful.",
    "This course is definitely one of the more challenging ones I've taken. However, as much as I struggled, it was clear that the course was extremely well organized, thorough, and helpful. The lectures were well and clearly organized, the readings posted well in advance, and the objectives and expectations made clear. I think that grading the homework was a good decision and definitely meant I put much more thought and work into it than I did in Epi 1. The workload was heavy, with several exams, but the material is complex and quantitative so I think that was probably important.",
    "strength: very clear instruction",
    "the strengths of the course is how structured the lectures were delivered and the content was clear. the homework were also helpful in solidifying the concepts taught from the course.",
    "Could have focused on more of a nuanced understanding - it was a little redundant with Epi I, course instructors should confer to prevent overlap.",
    "The material was typical epi work. I appreciated that the homework assignments were actually graded and were weighted heavier (compared to Epi I last semester). Since they were graded I spent much more time on them and I feel like I learned so much more because of that. I liked the TA sections every Friday because they actually pertained to the homework and included examples that really helped me understand the material.",
    "Epi really doesn't come naturally to me, which might skew my perception. Professor Ma was nice and a good lecturer, but the weekly problem sets were tough for me and I didn't find the lectures to be very clear.",
    "This should not be a required course for SBS concentration.",
    "The course is difficult, but if you put the necessary work in outside of class and pay attention in lecture, it is completely manageable. I came away from the course with a much deeper understanding of epidemiology concepts than I got during the first semester.",
    "Some dull material but overall not bad. Usually presented in a good way and included real world examples, which was helpful. Problem sets were long and took a substantial amount of time but were really helpful in prepping for exams. Exams are extremely fair and straightforward, so if you know your stuff you'll do well, which is how it should be.",
    "Given the subject matter, I thought this was a great class. It expanded upon concepts introduced in Epi I and delved more into the theories and assumptions behind epidemiological principles. Can't think of any way to improve upon what is already an excellent class.",
    "After having taken Epi 1 with Harvey, I thought that there was no way epidemiology could possibly have been taught in a worse way. I, however, was proven wrong. The lectures were worthless because the slides never had clear information and I can't think of a single time a relevant, clear example was used. Going to class and reading the slides honestly only confused me more. If I thought I understood a concept, I was confused about it by the end of going over the slides. After two semesters of epidemiology, I cannot claim to honestly know anything about epidemiology. This class was incredibly disappointing.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class despite it being one of the more challenging that I have taken. The course material was presented well - clearly and always within the context of how the concepts could be applied to real research. Both lectures and sections provided great opportunities for learning. Homework assignments clearly related to lectures while providing opportunities to further explore topics. All of the exams were very fair and reflective of what we had learned.",
    "Lectures aren't as streamlined as the discussion sections. I felt like I'm learning more in a discussion section I'm half the time, but that might very well be how it was intended to be in the first place.",
    "It wasn't a bad course, just seemed like epi 1, just more complicated and more work. Weaknesses were definitely the lectures. They weren't engaging and the slides weren't even close to being easy to understand. I really feel this needs to change. And its not just epi. This place needs better TEACHERS. People that actually teach, not just read slides. I feel like I am getting ripped off because I am going into thousands of dollars of debt to get a subpar education. Please fix this going forward.",
    "My one complaint is how CDE focused the course is. I do understand that the course is in the CDE department, but it is the only Epi II option. Many EMD students also take the course; both CDE and EMD make up the school's epidemiology programs. I find it very disappointing that there is not either an EMD Epi II course or more balance between CDE and EMD in the course. The majority of the examples were chronic disease related, which does not align with the interests of all students. It led to me finding the class to be less interesting and feel less useful as I could only see these methods applying to chronic diseases. There was also focus on long term epi research methods and no acute epi methods, such as what would be utilized in an outbreak setting. It is true that Epi II is optional for EMD students, but in reality, many of us want to pursue epi carers that require additional coursework in epidemiology that we cannot get from strictly taking EMD electives that are not strictly epidemiology foundations focused. I think the class would benefit from more microbial disease examples and methods to appeal to more students. Dr. Ma has asked for opinions on graded homework. I did not mind graded homework, as it did lead me to put more time into it. However, instead of a grade out of 100%, perhaps H, HP, P, or F grades could be followed. This would still encourage students to work hard to earn H grades on homework and thus gain an understanding of the material, but it would take away the stress of a few numeric points. I believe that, while completing homework, students are still learning. If a student clearly worked hard on the assignment and did well on the majority of the assignment, an H grade is deserved. Students do stress about the difference between number grades, and loosing a handful of points while still learning can be discouraging. I believe moving to an H HP P F grading system rather than numeric would be helpful. Also, it would be helpful to receive an answer key to assignments. There would be times where I would be studying for an exam, see that I lost a few points on a homework assignment, but not really understand why. It would be very helpful to see suggested answers. Overall this class was tough, but Dr. Ma made it very fair. Exams were a consistent with what student's should have expected for the most part, and the homework, discussion session practice problems, and lecture notes did adequately prepare students.",
    "I LEARNED SO MUCH THIS COURSE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE A GOOD EPIDEMIOLOGIST WITH INTEGRITY AND GRIT THE MATERIAL IS LIKE EPI I BUT NUANCED AND ACTUALLY USEFUL AND MEANINGFUL",
    "Epi II with Professor Ma was a wonderful experience! She teaches well and truly cares about her students. Although the problem sets were graded (unlike Epi I), they were all extremely fair and the weekly discussion sections prepared students very well. The exams were similar to the homework assignments so there were no nasty surprises. Overall, I learned a lot and feel more confident conducting my own epidemiology research in the future.",
    "Strengths: - applied basic information from Epidemiology I to take it a step further - Used real world examples - Challenging - Professor Ma is amazing!! - TF's are extremely helpful Weaknesses: - some discrepancies between the TF's communication to students",
    "great",
    "recommend",
    "I found the grading of homework to be very helpful. It facilitated more attention and absorption of material.",
    "Dr. Ma DESERVES A RAISE!!! One of my favorite instructors at YSPH. She's clear, concise, and thorough when she explains concepts in class.",
    "Really liked the course. It's a lot of work but worth it.",
    "Strengths - weekly, graded homework assignments; compassionate and articulate professor who focuses on main concepts. Weaknesses - PowerPoint lecture slide organization - sometimes difficult to follow and make sense of, especially when reviewing for homework and exams.",
    "More detailed explanations of epidemiological study design. Very practical.",
    "This course helped to solidify important epidemiological concepts and reinforced concepts taught in other classes. That said, I often felt like I had to work extra-hard to actually figure out which concepts we were supposed to be learning. Often, it felt that instructor and the TFs avoided giving us information in favor of having us figure things out on our own. This could have been effective, except that we also rarely got sufficient feedback on assignments, leaving me in the dark frequently about why I was marked incorrectly on problems and never really learning the material as well as I could have if instruction had focused more on student learning than preventing plagiarism. While I think the class was well-structured overall, I do think there were some lectures that felt like unnecessary additions (e.g., health systems research) as well as some that felt like advertisements of other courses (e.g., qualitative methods, meta-analysis). I might have appreciated these more if I hadn't felt like some of the other lectures had been rushed and some concepts not explained as fully as they should have been.",
    "The lecture slides weren't always intuitive, but discussion sections were most critical for learning the material. Maybe it's because it was the 2nd or 3rd time I was engaging with the material, but I definitely felt supported curriculum-wise throughout the semester.",
    "The course has provided much useful knowledge for students to understand the principles of Epidemiology, the discussion section and the homework all help you to better understand the knowledge from the class.",
    "I think the principles were there, but it would have been more helpful to teach the materials through more relevant examples that are more applicable\/interesting\/engaging for the students. Not every student is a interested in going into epi research, and it would be helpful and much appreciated if some of the lessons incorporated health policy\/social behavioral sciences\/environmental health- this would create more engaging lectures but also illustrate how epi is broadly applicable to many public health fields.",
    "I loved discussion. It was a great way to synthesize the information in lecture.",
    "A strength was the clarity of the oral presentation of material. The homeworks were somewhat helpful in learning as well. Weaknesses include redundancy with Epi I, undetailed and sometimes unclear slides , and monotonous tone overall that triggered complete disinterest in the material for me.",
    "Excellent. One of the best classes I have taken so far at the school of public health.",
    "strengths are the instructor- she was wonderful. I think the textbook may be a weakness just because we didn't use it frequently and sometimes things were explained differently in the book than in class, and Dr. Ma would tell us to ignore the book explanation. There is really no need to invest in the textbook- you can learn everything through lectures or online.",
    "Strengths: -Homework really shows the applicability of topics from lecture -Wide range of epi topics covered Weakness: -While it draws on Epi I, there were some disagreements in opinion between the two semesters",
    "The course is really useful and fully arranged.",
    "Very organized and systemic.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course! I strongly believe that I learned and retained more in this course compared to Epi 1.",
    "the current way is good",
    "This course was really well- taught, and provided the necessary follow up to Epi I -- It was challenging but Dr. Ma knows what she's doing and the TF's were a fantastic team. I learned so much!",
    "lots of content but clarified in regards to Epi I",
    "I have really good feedback to give for this course, because the professor and TF's were super great and knowledgeable. They truly cared about students. A strength of this course is compared to Epi I, students knew what to expect on tests. Tests were fair. Also, problems sets were after discussion sections and were graded which made students learn better. A weakness of this course is just that the material is dry to begin with and some classes were pretty dry.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Ma!!! Also, the supplemental instruction from the TFs was phenomenal. I loved that the homework assignments were individually graded instead of graded for participation. Also the course never reinforced racial or other sociodemographic stereotypes. Examples in class were appropriate and sensitive.",
    "Material was presented well and in an organized manner. You learn a lot, despite there being a ton of material.",
    "The instructor was very clear and helpful, however I would have loved some more practical application of what we learned in class beyond problem sets. Reading articles to identify some of the principles or designing our own studies would have been helpful",
    "I learned a lot and even though the problem sets took time they were extremely helpful for learning the material",
    "Overall, this class was very challenging for me as I felt very shaky of my knowledge of epidemiology after last semester. However, I learned a great deal of information and really was able to understand it this semester. The strengths of the course lie in the breadth of topics covered and in Dr. Ma's teaching style, which I very much enjoyed. A weakness in my experience was the Friday discussion sections. I did not learn much from my TF and spent much time at office hours with other TFs getting my head around the material.",
    "The course was very similar to Fall 2017 Epi I, which was both helpful and redundant. Epi I was particularly confusing with it being Professor Harvey's first time instructing. So having the opportunity to re-learn similar concepts from a new perspective was helpful in solidifying the material. Assignments and exams were fair, and it really made sense after this semester.",
    "Strengths- I thought the course did a good job expanding on topics that we learned about in Epi 1. The homework sets were extremely helpful when preparing for the exams. Exams were challenging, but very fair. Weaknesses- I thought some of the lectures (particularly those on methodology and health outcomes) were not useful as we were not tested on them and we did not cover them in our discussion section.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this course. I thought it was well-taught and organized. I appreciated feedback on homework and the teaching fellows.",
    "I love how the topics are inter-related to each other and to what was learned in Epi1. improvements: the slides could have had white background instead of dark-colored background.",
    "Dr. Ma is fantastic -- very available for help. I think the lecture slides were confusing, but clarified in discussion slides. For exams, I mainly studied discussion slides. Lecture wasn't too helpful for me. The TF's were very available and that really helped. I also liked how the HW was graded -- made me look more diligently at the slides and learn as I go.",
    "A deep dive into epidemiology, which I really appreciated. Left the course feeling like I truly understood the material. A weakness might be the material being very close to what was taught in Epi I. I think these two courses might be able to be combined, or changed slightly to make them more different.",
    "Its ridiculous that no solutions to the assignments and exams are given just because the professor wants to reuse them next year. The TF feedback is usually not enough. The solutions should definitely be posted for at least the assignments for us to actually LEARN. She should understand that were no longer in college- we have work and other duties we must attend to outside of school and dont have time to go to office hours or meet TFs outside of the given time.",
    "The course itself was great, and I feel like I learned much more than I did in epi I. The material could be difficult at times, but the instructor and TA's helped to clear confusion most of the time. The only thing I wish was available to us was answers to the problem sets after we received grades. It was difficult to study for exams when we did not know what the correct method to answering questions we got wrong in the problem sets was.",
    "Strengths - Professor Ma knows her stuff and her lectures are very interesting! The teaching staff is great! The course really focuses on the \"why\" of epidemiology and not just on the \"what.\" Weaknesses - This is super trivial, but the layout of the slides was really painful to look at. A light colored background and cleaner font would be nice.",
    "extremely difficult, lectures very dull",
    "Since this is a methods heavy class, I would have like to have more examples using social and behavioral contexts. The first two months of the semester were review from Epi 1. Although the repetition was helpful, I wished we learned more Epi 2 concepts at the beginning of the semester. Overall, I feel very confident in my understanding of Epidemiology and feel like I could provide a positive contribution to any research team.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought that Dr. Ma did a great job of making things to-the-point, providing clear examples, and constructing assignments and exams that were reflective of the material we covered. I am happy, as a second year, that I took Epi-2 this year as opposed to the year before.",
    "Lots of work, but rewarding. The problem sets are long, but they more than adequately prepare us for the exams. The fact that there were weekly assignments meant that I could correct\/clarify any issues I had with the material in a timely manner. Also, I felt that doing the quantitative aspects of epidemiology gave me a greater understanding and appreciation of the concepts",
    "Strengths: -discussions were very helpful, useful to go over homework during discussion and get grade the next week -exams reflected homework, both were very useful in reflecting on important concepts -lecture slides were informative and lectures provided added information, which made going to lecture more effective -professor was very helpful and encouraged discussion outside the classroom Weaknesses: -Sometimes lectures could be dull (or people drift off because it's the morning) Maybe this can be improved by encouraging some discussion, such as having small groups of students discuss a question or concept, and hopefully that might spur people to ask or answer questions.",
    "This course did a great job of both reviewing concepts covered in Epi I, which many of us struggled with, as well as adding onto these base epidemiological concepts with a higher level of analysis and thinking. The lectures were easy to understand and refer to after class and while completing the homework assignments. The homework assignments were sometimes challenging in the amount and application of the information we learned in class, but office hours and review of the lectures made the assignments more approachable. It would have been preferable for the lectures to be recorded, but them not being recorded did not substantially affect my understanding of the material or study techniques."

You can tell that she's passionate about her subject and truly wants to make the process of learning epidemiology as painless and interesting as possible for students. Her dry humor always took me by surprise and left me giggling for the rest of the class. She maintains a perfect balance of covering what's on the slide and adding supplemental information as she goes through the lecture. This class was hard, and many people struggled, and she recognized that and didn't try and pretend like we should all love it and be super excited about epi, but that she was there to help regardless. I think this subject would have been much much more difficult if we had had a professor that was less empathetic, knowledgable, and accessible as Dr. Ma.",

    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is an absolute gem--literally the nicest, kindest, most well-meaning professor at Yale.

She's low-key really funny and will break up the lectures with a joke or two, and she acknowledges that some of the material is dry but important to know. She's endlessly accommodating of whatever you need and works really hard to build trust with the students over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is amazing! I love her sense of humor and the way she approaches teaching a rather dry subject matter. This class could have been awful in the wrong hands but not only did Professor Ma make me not dread coming in to Epi II, she actually made me enjoy it and enjoy learning about assumptions and principles.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0After having taken Epi 1 with Harvey, I thought that there was no way epidemiology could possibly have been taught in a worse way. I, however, was proven wrong. Dr. Ma's lecture slides were very unclear and the examples often only lead to more confusion rather than clarity of the concept. Going to lecture not only did not have value, they were a detriment to my learning. I don't think I ever understood any of the concepts, I simply memorized things enough to spit them back out on the exam.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is one of my favorite instructors that I have had. She did a great job of presenting even the complex epi topics clearly and methodically. In addition, she brought great real world experience and examples to enrich our discussions, as well as humor and necessary levity to some of the more dense aspects of the field.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0The thing I liked the most about Prof. Ma was the content on tests and exams. Nothing flimsy or tricky, just straight forward and knowledge testing questions.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Ma was nice. She was nice and flexible and worked with students and our difficult schedules. Just wish she was engaged more. Maybe writing on the board or do calculations like that instead of just mumbling through power point slides.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0I have never had another professor that I felt cared about students as much as Dr. Ma does. This is even more impressive in a class of more than 100 people; I felt cared about even in a proud. She is very passionate about her students. She regularly sent kind, encouraging emails to the class and always started her classes checking in. If a student asked her a good question in office hours, she would address the topic for the entire class at our following class meeting. She brought in little chocolates on Valentine's Day and put her own personal (but relevant) thoughts into her lectures. She moved her office hours to accommodate more students, and was very understanding towards student needs. Dr. Ma is a compassionate instructor with a passion for epidemiology and a good sense of humor. Her assignments and exams were consistently tough but fair, and she always worked to fully prepare us. I highly recommend taking a course with her! I truly believe she is one of the best professors at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0XIAOMEI IS A TRUE HERO OF MINE SHE INFUSES HER LECTURES WITH HUMOR AND GOOD EXAMPLES AND EXCELLENT EXPLANATIONS SHE HAS REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE AND ALSO SHE CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS AND WANTS THEM TO LEARN AND BE GOOD LITTLE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is an amazing professor who is not only very knowledgable about her field of study but also extremely generous with her time. She is always looking out for her students' best interests and never fails to give us encouragement. Her valuable mentorship is heart-warming and I am very fortunate to have had her as my epidemiology professor. After taking her course, I feel more confident about conducting my own epidemiology research in the future. Thank you Professor Ma for a great semester!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is incredibly witty and relatable, down to earth, and hilarious. I think we all really respected her, and for whatever reason, none of us could bring ourselves to call her by her first name, even though we do so with almost every other professor. I think it's because she has such a high level of professionalism, and almost seems like she's our mother. Her lectures are vital to success of the class. There are questions she has in her slides that she only answers in person. Epi II is a difficult class, and so if you zone out for even one minute, it's hard to keep up all the time. Overall, she will be missed, and I think she did an incredible job listening to students' needs and teaching such a difficult course.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0super great lecturer, detail oriented, sensitive to students' needs overall recommend her",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was a great professor. She made epidemiology as interesting as possible, and she explained every topic very well.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0As mentioned above, Dr. Ma deserves a raise and is an incredible instructor.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Very nice.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She is everything you could want in a professor - kind, articulate, generous, and respectful. She truly taught me fundamental concepts of Epi, which were greatly lacking after 2017 Epi 1 instruction. Kudos to Professor Ma, she is truly a gem.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0The flow of lecture content is not very fluent. There are concepts mentioned here and there, even some have been explain in Epi I.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0The instructor was very responsive to student e-mails and always willing to meet to discuss questions or concerns. I appreciate how the instructor made an effort to address student feedback transparently. I also felt that the instructor did a good job of trying to make a large lecture engaging by asking questions and peppering in stories from her experience. This personalized the lectures and made them feel like more than just a professor reading slides. I do feel like the instructor could have done a better job of being more explicit in what we were supposed to be learning. At times, it felt like learning wasn't the point, but instead we were supposed to regurgitate information from the slides verbatim. This was reinforced by how the TFs graded, marking points off for slight deviations in how responses were phrased. Ultimately, this meant that I spent less time trying to understand the concepts and more time trying to remember which words were acceptable and which ones weren't. I think that the focus on preventing plagiarism detracted from student learning, which is a shame because this course could be so much better if students actually were provided with the tools to learn. Detailed feedback in the form of TF notes or an answer key would have made such an enormous difference in facilitating learning. Additionally, I did not feel like the textbook was useful in any way and should be omitted from future iterations of the course. What a waste of money!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Slides were often text heavy, but they conveyed the material that we needed to know. I'm glad that she made problem sets mandatory, because they were good preparation for the exam.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is really excellent in explaining the contents of the class, and she really cares about the students.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She was very responsive to students and always willing to help and accommodate student needs- thank you!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She's great.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Presents material clearly, though could benefit immensely from a more colorful and dynamic presentation style. Monotone presentations were very hard to follow along with.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Amazing. Very helpful and gives real life examples. Although the coursework is rigorous, Dr. Ma is extremely fair. She has the gift of teaching for sure. She should teach epi II all the time.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She was wonderful! Thank you, Dr. Ma",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Strengths: -Very easy to talk to and open to communicating with students -Meeting with her is very helpful and encouraging",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is a very good teacher. She cares about students and knows what they might need. It is very helpful. But the PPT might sometimes too simple with less explanations.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She really cares about her students. She knows what the hard part is and she always knows want we want to learn.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She is so thoughtful and kind to her students. She genuinely cares about our education and wants the best for her students. THANK YOU Dr. Ma for an amazing semester!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0N\/A",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She was great, and responded to feedback very well -- she cares about her students and wants them to understand.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0clear and precise, able to give plenty of examples and helpful at office hours or whenever needed",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was an excellent Epi II professor. She is brilliant and knows Epi so well. She was also very available to students and added jokes in lectures to make class not as dry. Because Epi is a dry subject, Dr. Ma should keep the jokes coming!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is incredibly knowledgeable and is also very receptive to student feedback and sensitive to our workloads. She conveys ideas clearly and her homework assignments and exams are very fair.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Ma was incredibly funny and made the course bearable over the semester. Her passion for the subject and availability for one-on-one meetings and consultations truly revived my interest in epidemiology, which was weakened my first semester here. Weaknesses: sometimes, Dr. Ma's wording on certain topics was unclear.Concepts were clarified in Friday sections.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She is the most approachable professor I have encountered at YSPH and I really appreciate that she explicitly states that we can talk to her about Epi2 or about anything else, and that we can reach out to her after the course ends. Not a lot of faculty do that to be honest, and they come off as indifferent but not Dr. Ma. She also presents the material in an organized way and is very knowledgeable when she speaks. She is also the BEST when keeping within the class time to teach. I definitely recommend the constant use of a microphone though because she does speak low.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Brilliant, fair, great teacher",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma's lectures were always very clear and organized, and she made EPI a lot less painful!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She is amazing! She explains things very clearly and would emphasis on important aspects.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was one of the best instructors I've had during my time at YSPH. I was very hesitant to take this course because I felt that I was terrible at epidemiology and may not ever understand it. However, Dr. Ma was very well-spoken and engaging - and clearly wanted students to learn from her course. She also seemed to really understand what happened in epi 1 and how some students were very fearful of having to take epi 2. I think for some students with more advanced knowledge of the subject, it could have been frustrating because there was some review involved - but for me I really needed that review and appreciated it.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was very personable and funny. She made the material more enjoyable. Some of the lectures were long and redundant, but overall she delivered the concepts well.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is one of my favorite professors at Yale. She was extremely kind and funny, which made the a course that was very intimidating more bearable. She answered questions very well and was constantly reminding us that we were more than capable of doing well in the course. I found her exams to be fair as she provided numerous examples in lecture and in the homework problems.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma was excellent. She was very willing to meet with students and work with them. She truly cared about students' well-being. She was very clear in lecture and had a great sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma did an excellent job in teaching everything clearly and easily understandable. In addition, she also was kind and helpful in answering question outside of the class.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0She was so encouraging and helpful in office hours and over email. She personally reached out to me when I failed the first exam and was emotionally present for me to succeed. I ended up doing better on her second exam because of the support.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was an amazing instructor. Even when the material was slightly dry, Dr. Ma was able to keep our attentions with her slides and humor. Very insightful and helpful instructor. Willing to go above and beyond to help her students succeed.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Shes okay.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma was a great lecturer and genuinely cared for her students. Lectures were easy to follow and Prof. Ma would always clarify any ideas that seemed confusing.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Xiaomei is wonderful and cares a lot about us as students and as people. She is humorous, tries to make lectures interactive, and is very articulate.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is super cool and super knowledgable in epi! Really loved her as a professor!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma truly cares about her students. Although there were a lot of students in the class, she was always receptive towards feedback and questions. She even brought us all chocolates on Valentines Day. She has a huge heart!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent lecturer, nice and helpful mentor",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is very approachable and one of the best professors I have had during my time at YSPH. She is not only extremely knowledgeable, she is also very understanding and caring. I couldn't have asked for a better Epi II professor.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is an effective and caring instructor. She was always prepared and readily available for students. She was a clear communicator and provided good examples for the topics we covered. I thought her teaching style was direct, and to the point which is to my liking. It was obvious that she cared about the students, although it was large in size, by giving us career encouragement in her lectures - which felt so timely and supportive.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Xiaomei is a very kind person and encourages students to seek her out outside of class. She has a somewhat dry sense of humor, which adds some levity to class. I feel that she is very fair in her grading, and explains concepts (with examples) in an easily digestible manner. Her powerpoint slides are also quite comprehensive.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0I generally enjoyed having Dr. Ma as an instructor. She was generally effective in conveying concepts and explaining the material, and corrected herself if necessary. She also injected some humor into the lectures, which was nice for a morning class. She was also very open and encouraged students to speak with her after class. Overall, good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma was very clear in lecture; her connection of the concepts to anecdotes of application relevant to the topics being discussed made the concepts much easier to understanding and made lectures very worthwhile to attend."

    "great course, would recommend",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course! No matter what you do with your MPH, understanding the science of public health research will help you when you apply it in the real world through policy and interventions",
    "I definitely would recommend this course if it is taught by Dr. Ma.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it since a strong grasp of Epi is essential to public health.",
    "Great course that builds upon material in Epi I. If you really want to understand epidemiology, you need to take this course.",
    "I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the course to anyone that needs it as a requirement or who is interested in epidemiology.",
    "If you are in EMD I would take transmission dynamics instead. I feel like that could would be significantly more useful to someone perusing an EMD degree.",
    "Highly recommend to any students interested in conducting epidemiological studies.",
    "This is definitely a challenging, quantitative course with a workload on the heavier side. However, under Dr. Ma it is very well organized and thorough, and if you're relatively good at staying kept up then you'll be able to succeed. Ask a lot of questions and take advantage of the multitude of office hours, and don't wait until the last minute to start the homework! A lot of this material tied very well in the AAME curriculum that many of us were taking at the same time.",
    "definitely take! very helpful with learning more in depth epidemiological methods and history",
    "this is a required course but the professors and TFs put in a lot of effort in making the course very rewarding",
    "Will provide you a better understanding of public health research, you should take it",
    "Surprisingly possibly the best class I took this semester, mostly because of Professor Ma. Definitely recommend (and also a requirement for a lot of folks).",
    "Great course if you are looking to learn more about epidemiology.",
    "I would not recommend this class to my worst enemy. It was a lot of work and I learned nothing. It was completely useless. If you want to learn epidemiology I would suggest you go to a different school since it is clear that Yale cannot produce a worthwhile epidemiology course.",
    "This course expands on the basic epidemiology topics from the first semester. It includes many of the same topics but they are covered in greater depth and complexity, with a bigger focus on understanding the assumptions and situations in which different methods can be used and are preferred. I found this course to be more conceptual, with many of the mathematical methods carrying over from the fall. I highly recommend it - I learned a lot and it was an enjoyable course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Don't take this class if you're planning to go go a PhD program without checking to see if it will transfer credit. Class was alright, would not take if not required.",
    "Extension of Epi I. Go back and learn about various topics in greater detail while learning new topics as well. Much of the information felt relevant to the field.",
    "If you were disappointed by the limited scope of Epi I , definitely take this course! If you liked Epi I at all, take this course! If you didn't like Epi 1 but you think it could be redeemed by a better professor than Harvey Risch, take this course!",
    "Epi II with Professor Ma was a wonderful experience! She teaches well and truly cares about her students. Although the problem sets were graded (unlike Epi I), they were all extremely fair and the weekly discussion sections prepared students very well. The exams were similar to the homework assignments so there were no nasty surprises. Overall, I learned a lot and feel more confident conducting my own epidemiology research in the future.",
    "Epi II is challenging, no matter who teaches it. Do the problem sets yourself and utilize office hours to guarantee success and a great learning experience. I'm not sure if I would recommend it because it's required and Epi is not my field of interest, but I do not regret putting so much time and effort into learning the material.",
    "recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Dr. Ma did a great job teaching the important basics of epidemiology.",
    "Definitely take it! Especially if you're taking AAME during the same semester. These courses complement each other very effectively.",
    "Good, but hard.",
    "A must attend for CDE student and a good choice for those want to work on epidemiology in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any student who wasn't required to take it. It was a lot of work and effort that resulted in not as much learning as it should have. I also feel like the grading was arbitrary and am suspicious of how anyone managed to get perfect scores given how eager TFs were to subtract points from the problem sets without any clear rubric or guidelines. Ultimately, if someone is looking to learn epidemiology basics, I think that more applied epidemiology courses would be preferable for any student as they would be more relevant to their interests and more focused. Even Applied Analytic Methods in Epidemiology provided clearer instruction on concepts. In short, too much work, too little focus on teaching.",
    "Takes Epi I to a more meaningful place - not everything is black and white. I did like how it coincided with AAME for the modeling section. That was really, really useful.",
    "This course is very excellent and essential for future work relating to Epidemiology, you will gain deeper understanding of the principles of this subject after all the classes, homework and discussion section for this course.",
    "This course was a repeat of Epi I with a slightly higher difficulty and higher level concepts, however the main ideas were exactly the same. The lectures were NOT engaging and I learned the most out of TA sessions and office hours. If you have to take this course, you have to take this course... But if you do not have to take this course I would consider learning about this material online yourself (BU has a great public health free online modules site), and then spending your time taking another course that may be more relevant and useful to you.",
    "It's a requirement, but it's not too bad.",
    "A partial repeat of Epi I with a few add-ones. The amount of new material does not nearly merit an entire semester-long course. Would not recommend.",
    "Very educational and helpful. It is extremely applicable to real life epidemiology and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dr. Ma is an exceptional professor.",
    "Recommended - just don't invest in the text book its not necessary",
    "epi 2 is worth taking for a deeper understanding and application of epidemiology.",
    "N\/A",
    "Highly recommend for anyone completing an MPH, the way to truly build an Epi foundation.",
    "challenging but worthwhile",
    "Epi II is not for everyone. It is a difficult course that requires you to push yourself in order to understand its concepts. However, students who push themselves are rewarded by gaining critical thinking skills and the ability to understand research concepts. The professor and TF's are fantastic.",
    "Highly recommend! Epi 2 came more naturally to me than Epi 1 because we were challenged to recognize the flaws in epi study designs instead of taking them as truth.",
    "Expansion of epidemiology I. I would recommend this course because I found it helpful when it reinforced Epi1 learning.",
    "Yes I would, because the concepts covered in this course are important to understand as a future public health professional, and the structure of this course will help you accomplish that.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course. Despite it being required for me, I am very glad I was made to take it because I learned so much this semester. It is very challenging and will require a lot of hard work but it is ultimately worth it.",
    "Overall it was a good course, but depending on how the curriculum is broken up next year, it may be redundant to what is taught in Epi I -- it really depends on your interests.",
    "I would recommend this course because I feel as though the topics learned in Epi 2 will make me better prepared for a career in the public health field. This course forces you to think critically, and allows you to explore different approaches to answering the same question.",
    "This course was essential in improving my skill as an epidemiologist and learned a great deal in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to the students, because I think the concepts taught in this class is essential for epidemiology study.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. I think students needed to spend a lot of outside class time absorbing the plethora of material. Overall, the info was well organized in the discussion slides and that's how I learned the material. Dr. Ma is a queen -- so kind and available to all students and really wants us to succeed. Very important class for all future public health professionals.",
    "I wouldnt necessarily recommend it- at least with Dr. Ma but what can you do - its required",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Challenging, but in a good way.",
    "Epi II (at least when taught by Dr. Ma) was actually a great reinforcer of the material from Epi I and on to of that, it focused a lot on the reasoning behind different methods and baseline assumptions. I would definitely recommend it if you want to strengthen your understanding of epi!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The materials provide a solid foundation of epi and Dr. Ma is a wonderful instructor.",
    "Would recommend Epi-2 taught by Dr. Ma.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in the work",
    "This course covered the main principles in epidemiology that will be useful for a career in public health and epidemiology. The material delved further into concepts introduced in the first semester of principles of epidemiology. I would recommend this course to students who do not have a background in public health and\/or epidemiology or need to brush up on important concepts, especially if taught by Dr. Ma because she does well to explain the concepts in an understandable way.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student who is looking to understand and be able to apply common epidemiological concepts in research and practice realms. The course gives a broad overview of many concepts while also being able to discuss them specifically in their relation to others. I have already and will continue to refer to the lecture slides and notes from this class when discussing and applying the concepts covered."
