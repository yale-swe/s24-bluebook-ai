    "I would definitely recommend this course to all undergraduates at Yale. This class consisted of mostly non-art majors and I think that it's an amazing way to get familiar with the world of sculpture. There is a lot of experimentation and abstraction in this course, but I think it asks you to think harder about what you're creating for the class. It definitely pushed me. You get to weld metal and use the wood shop! You learn a lot of new technical skills that can be useful for the future. If you're not into building things it can be a little difficult, especially because the class asks you to create large objects for pieces. The teacher is very into experimenting and gives you plenty of freedom to try out whatever you're passionate about. Take it!",
    "10\/10 would recommend. A really lovely course focused on making, and, equally as intensively, thinking about making. Sculpture basics is as much about conceptual development as physical development, which is so important. Michelle will push you in the right direction, and my TA Sam was super candid when saying what's effective and what isn't. They'll tell you like it is, and it's definitely not easy, but Michelle is totally there to help you. It's a hotly contested class, but because of that, if you get in, you get to work with a wonderful group of people from all different academic and artistic backgrounds.",
    "Conceptually-geared sculpture course. Allows for a lot of freedom in terms of individual projects. The course is a great intro to both the metal and wood shops.",
    "Yes, this class is a good introduction to learning about sculpture and art in a modern context.",
    "This is a wonderful course that I would recommend to any of my peers.",
    "No background in art or sculpture is necessary. Sculpture Basics is mostly about using different materials and strengthening your ability to discern and communicate messages in art. With Michelle, there are only a few assignments that can be very elaborate or straightforward. It's really what you make of it. Just be sure to document all of your work!"
