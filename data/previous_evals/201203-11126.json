   "comments": [
    "I would recommend other students take this course, and emphasize that the amount they get out of it will be proportional to the frequency with which they attend lecture, which is not always true in math\/science classes. The course will help you appreciate the connections between different subfields of mathematical physics.",
    "If you're taking this course it's probably because you have to. I think it probably varies greatly depending on who's teaching it.",
    "Take the class if you have a strong math background; this is a review class - not the one that teaches topics in depth.",
    "Extremely useful class. As difficult as some of the concepts may be, you will come to appreciate what you learn. And it is much more worth it to spend copious amounts of time in this course, especially if you have never taken math methods before.",
    "Physics 506 is amazing. You've got to take it.",
    "This is a perfect course in graduate level mathematical physics. The topics discussed in this class are multifarious, so the student should make sure to dig up the literature recommended by Prof. Read to supplement the information provided in class.",
    "This course is vital, though sometimes difficult to follow; it required dedication but the work pays very well. I would absolutely recommend this course, but would caution that preparation and hard work are important.",
    "I have taken many math classes in undergrad, up to the graduate level, however many were somewhat useless in bridging the gap to theoretical physics. This class bridges a big part of that gap.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it to students who have strong inclination to do theoretical research in the future."

   "comments": [
    "I finally understand linear algebra after \"learning\" it many times over as an undergrad, and both asymptotic analysis and complex analysis will no doubt come in handy. I doubt it will make the slightest difference to my research that I now understand the subtlety of self-adjointness in Hilbert space, but it was interesting.",
    "I haven't seen the direct effect of math methods yet, but I am sure it would serve me well in the years to come.",
    "This course was useful in helping understand the mathematics of the other courses we are taking in the first year.",
    "Same as above."
