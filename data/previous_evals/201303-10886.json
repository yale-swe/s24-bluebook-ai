    "Yes!",
    "I hope you took calculus like, the semester before you take this b\/c you're gonna need all those calculus tricks.",
    "Harvard's Stat 110 class covers the exact same material as this one, except that professor is so much better at lecturing than Harry. All the lectures from Harvard's class are available online; I would recommend watching those instead of going to Harry's classes.As for homework: all the solutions are \"hidden\" on Harry's website; just find and copy them. Except, for some reason, points still get marked off for having a verbatim copy of the solutions. Grading seemed a bit arbitrary in this class.",
    "After taking AP Statistics in high school, I was familiar with most of the basic principles of probability and statistics and could apply them with confidence. While AP Statistics is often criticized for being too focused on applications and plugging numbers into formulas while glossing over the \"why\" aspect, Stat 241 was at the other extreme. This course was almost entirely proof-based, focusing entirely on theory and barely discussing how the principles we prove could be using to solve real-world problems.Although Professor Zhou is an entertaining and engaging lecturer, I would not recommend this course to anyone except someone looking for a rigorous proof-based approach to probability.",
    "If you like working with complicated formulas and calculus definitely try this out, it is a great experience, but the final was very hard, the course requires more hours than a normal class, and you have to go to office hours.",
    "Take it. It's interesting, well taught, and not too much work.",
    "Stat 241 is a very good class. You get a general introduction to statistical theory and learn some really cool things. Harry is fantastic, very clear, enthusiastic, and funny. I highly recommend the class to anyone interested in basic statistics. The workload is fairly light, one problem set per week (roughly 2 hours) plus one midterm and one final. There are also several hour-long TA help sessions for the homework the day before they're due and I HIGHLY recommend you go. Most homework problems involve a tricky step to solve and you will have a very hard time figuring it out on your own and it's often easiest to just go to the help session and have a TA walk you through it.",
    "Good class, love love love probability theory. Harry teaches it from a very math, proof based sort of way. Not like a probability statistics class but really much a math class. I loved it, it makes solving problems make much more sense. The only downside to this is that I didn't really get a good sense of intuition for real-world probability, like I would if it was taught from a statistics point of view.Good class. Homeworks are pretty hard because the questions in the textbook are of such different style than how he teaches in class. The tests are hard, but do able. He always throws in tricks and you really have to know the theory to understand. The test questions are nothing like homework problems, they are proofy and math based, but he uses tricks from homework in problems, so you havve to do it. GO TO TA REVIEW SESSIONS. They are amazing and you can finish whole p set if you go to 2. So only 3 hours a week of homework- easy. They go over all the problems you want and explain them really well. That;s how you will get better at this class.",
    "A good overview of probability theory and great statistics class to take to supplement the math major",
    "Yes. It's fun and challenging.",
    "This class will expose you to useful combinatorics and probability theory. Take it early in your Yale career. If you have any desire to intern or work for a trading firm or really do anything mathematical, this class will provide you with a nice foundation for your mathematical intuition. Bayesian probability, expectation, etc.If you've already taken math 244, a lot of the combinatorics that you see here will be relatively trivial.Overall, this is a straightforward class with a fairly light homework load (though one or two psets will be slightly more challenging).",
    "A lot of the theory is covered, but even then it is done in such an unorganized manner that it ends up lacking a lot of rigor. The Harvard Stats 110 course would be a great substitute for this course.",
    "Yes, everyone should take this class, it is pivotal to learn this subject",
    "If you take this class, DO NOT GO TO LECTURES.Instead, watch lectures for Stat 110 at Harvard and do the psets and practice exams (there are detailed solutions to all of them). The lectures are much, much, more informative and easier to follow. Harry isn't a bad lecturer but the Harvard guy is one of the best teachers I've had.The homework sessions basically walk you through the Yale homework, go to them if you have any trouble.Again, if you take this class, spend 4 or 5 hours a week with the Harvard Stat 110 program online. It's a shame I have to say this.",
    "Only take this class if you're interested in probability theory or if you have to take it for your major. It requires a lot of time outside of class to understand material, and the exams are relatively difficult.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn some of the basics of statistics, this is the perfect class for you.",
    "The midterm was fine, problem sets were fine too (I used to go to problem sessions and get the answers), but the final exam was disproportionately hard! They gave us practice exams from 2012, but their final exam and the practice problems were way easier than the actual exam. I was in the A range before taking the final, now who knows... The worst part is that the final exam is 50% of the final grade and in 2013 it mostly covered material from the last 2 weeks...",
    "This class is a relatively low workload, straightforward class in probability. Assuming no prior knowledge of probability, this class covers a good amount of material without feeling rushed. I highly recommend to anyone interested in probability with at least a basic calculus background to take this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course if you need to take probability, but I was slightly disappointed with it -- the course was not as exciting or interesting as I thought prob theory could be.",
    "Good class, it gets more difficult after the midterm. Manageable workload.",
    "Not as challenging as some other math courses that count for a major requirement, but don't let the material build up and then take you by surprise. Make sure you know exactly what was covered at the end of each week and you're very comfortable with it, because the course is really cumulative and you're dead in the water if you try to cover more material on shaky or spotty understanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The professor was obviously passionate about the subject. He was incredibly nice and sincerely cared about us students. He knew our names and kept track of our progress and our interests in a lecture class. He was generous in the amount of office hours he gave and was very helpful during them. The material was also interesting--ranging from simple to some pretty difficult concepts. Be wary of the homework problem solving sessions. The TAs are helpful, but I think that students often go to them and get the answers from them without really thinking about the homework themselves except to perhaps flesh out the answers when they rewrite it. Some don't even rewrite it. This is a bad way to learn, because you do not really learn. Although there were some weeks that I was definitely pressed for time and went to the sessions unprepared, I think it hurt my understanding of the material from those weeks. Also, I wish that one or two of the TA sessions could be designated as Problem Solving sessions and that the other ones would be normal office hoursthat were not just the TA giving answers. Professor Zhou's office hours were good--he would answer questions about concepts, but most of the TA sessions should also be like this, because Professor Zhou's are earlier in the week and also only happen at one time, so not everyone can come. I also think that the textbook was often unclear and focused on many things that were unnecessary. I think that even if he continues to use this book, you should ask him if he could let you know which parts of the books we should be reading to keep up with class. It would also be really helpful if practice exam solutions were posted earlier. Also, though I thought that the ways that the professor and the TA used heuristics to integrate was often interesting and informative, it would be nice if he kept in mind that calculus is a prerequisite to this course. Sometimes the heuristics are not very enlightening, and normal integration techniques would take far less time during class. Overall though, this class was definitely well worth taking.",
    "Very solid introductory course, challenging but fair. Recommended!",
    "Probability is generally a good course. Sometimes the topics and homework problems are stupidly easy, and other times they are quite challenging, though in general the workload is reasonable. The TAs were all very helpful and gave good explanations to some of the trickier homework problems. Harry Zhou is an entertaining lecturer, though sometimes it's hard to tell where the lecture is going. It's a good introduction to probability and provides some mathematical basis for some very important ideas in statistics",
    "Math 241 is a pretty straightforward introduction to probability theory. It gives you a solid foundation for understanding more complex stat courses, introduces you to some interesting problems (like random walks), and definitely requires a substantial amount of work, but is not overly difficult.",
