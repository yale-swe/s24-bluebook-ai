   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze financial crises, including their causes, effects, and how ultimately we can better our system to avoid similar crises in the future.",
    "I learned about the evolution of the financial crisis, how and why it occurred, and the regulatory response. With additional historical context, I was able to understand how this financial crisis differed from others and what regulators and supervisors should look for in the future to prevent another crisis.",
    "I did not know basically anything about the GFC before this course. I really liked it",
    "Comprehensive overview of the global financial system and the events of the 2008 Crisis.",
    "I have gained a solid understanding of the causes, responses, and aftermath of the 2007\/2008 Financial Crisis. I have also gained key insights on the key causes and indicators of general financial crises. I now feel that I understand what happened and am better equipped to combat financial crises in the future.",
    "We got a very comprehensive overview of the causes, events, and policy responses of the most recent global financial crisis, as well as some additional insight into the Great Depression and Eurozone issues. Having had very little knowledge about the financial system beforehand, I learned a lot about the major financial institutions and their relationships with each other as well as with government agencies. I feel that I gained some technical knowledge about finance that I didn't expect.",
    "Gained more insight into the global financial crisis, events that transpired, efficacy of policy responses.",
    "I thought it was a useful course that helped me to better understand what happened in the Global Financial Crisis and the issues that revolve around financial regulation, banking, and finance today.",
    "Learning about the financial crisis taught me so much about other fields, including monetary and fiscal policy, the EU, regulation, etc.. This broad learning experience is what I loved most.",
    "My knowledge of the global financial crisis went from near-nothing to pretty in-depth. I'm now able to evaluate many more of the op-eds and books written about the crisis\/financial regulation\/the banking system from a more objective, evidence-backed point of view. I've also learned so much more about how debt and liquidity operates in our financial system, as well as the function of various financial giants\/about shadow banking and layers to our financial intermediation system that I did not know before. Would highly recommend to anyone curious about why 2007 happened and what we did in the aftermath.",
    "An overview of the financial crisis, skills in writing about economics, understanding components of financial system",
    "Learnt a lot about the Crisis and how it has been interpreted and studied by most.",
    "Fantastic course - I have reviewed in the grad evaluation",
    "A fantastic way to learn about the crisis.",
    "I learned a lot about the financial crisis, risk-sharing, systemic risk, and the decisions that regulators make when handling market breakdowns. We covered a surprising amount of material, given that the class has almost no math prereqs. We got to interact with people who were directly involved with government interventions, especially former Treasury Secretary (and head of the NY Fed) Timothy Geithner.",
    "In this course, I learned about the nuances of the Global Financial Crisis, including the fall of major institutions, the general loss in liquidity of the system, bank runs, impacts on Europe, and more. It was information I never would have learned otherwise, and was incredibly interesting!",
    "Really learned a lot about the crisis in detail: the financial instruments involved, the firms involved, the government's response. The presentation of the information in the video lectures is extremely well organized.",
    "Interesting and relevant material regarding the 2008 financial crisis",
    "Learned a lot about the financial crisis and crises in general.",
    "Good for acquiring a general understanding of the causes of the crisis, how it unfolded, its consequences, and the regulatory aftermath."

   "comments": [
    "A definite strength is Metrick's teaching. He has fantastic command of the room and makes class time enjoyable. I think sometimes it would be productive to cover more new material in class, rather than just rehash the slides",
    "Strenghts: Professors are extremely prepared abs have the best available resources. Weakness: the work load is too much.",
    "I like that it is flipped classroom; it is nice to already know the topics before coming to class. Metrick is an incredible lecturer (possibly the best I've had) and brings in incredible guest lecturers that are experts on their respective topics. Tim Geithner is very interesting to listen to but he only give 3.5 lectures so he isn't REALLY a Co-Lecturer.",
    "Professor Metrick is very skilled at giving an in-depth explanation about complex aspects of the financial system that could have otherwise been very dry. I think the class was well-designed to encourage as much critical thinking and discussion as possible. It did sometimes feel as though we were jumping around chronologically on the timeline of the crisis, but that might've just been the nature of how everything was interrelated.",
    "The course format of video lectures, online discussions, and in-depth discussions in class was very well-suited to the material.",
    "The teachers of this course were great. I wish we had more small group interaction. The variety of assignments was at times a hassle.",
    "Strengths: Metrick Geithner course material \"flipped classroom\" some guest lecturers Weaknesses: some guest lecturers too many long writing assignments",
    "Course touches in a multitude of economic factors, not only being limited to an analysis of the crisis.",
    "This class should honestly either be a writing credit or 1.5 credits. Professor Metrick is AMAZING though, honestly probably my favorite professor I've ever had. The material is taught in a way that makes really difficult concepts much easier to digest. Seriously, great class.",
    "strengths: metrick was a great lecturer, I liked the series of memos - they really solidified my understanding of certain conceps - I also thought the outside-of-class coursera lectures were helpful to my understanding and enjoyed the \"flipped classroom\" format weaknesses: I thought that sometimes, the Q&A got tiring and did not seem to have a particular direction even if it revolved around a theme. the large classroom format also did not mesh well with any true \"discussion\" - I would suggest maybe more classes that are breakout sessions in the future (the ones which we did do I really enjoyed) to encourage each individual student to speak and engage more as the professor rotates between the classrooms? or maybe having one large prompt for discussion that everyone can jump in on during class",
    "Strengths: Most of class worked overall, lecture\/discussion format was good Weaknesses: Maybe if there were more background readings provided on some basic finance (i.e. ABCP, stocks, funds, etc.) that would be helpful",
    "Strengths include professor Metrick, in-class discussions, many assignments\/opportunities to do well. Weaknesses include low incentive to go to class and sometimes half empty lecture hall can take away from the potential to have realy interesting in class discussions.",
    "Fantastic course - I have reviewed in the grad evaluation",
    "Absolutely fantastically taught. Awesome structure and great to have the guest lecturers.",
    "The flipped-classroom style can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, as quizzes and community contributions are due at 12 AM the night before class, but the in-class lectures driven by questions are totally worth it.",
    "Really interesting to learn. I enjoyed the structure of the course and the flexibility with assignments. I would have hoped to hear more from people with very different opinions to Professor Metrick.",
    "Great lecturer. Panels with Secretary Geithner were also very good.",
    "it was a great course but in the end felt a bit repetitive."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It was fascinating and required very little prerequisite knowledge because things were so well explained during the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning more about the financial crisis or who may consider central banking as a possible career path.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "One of the best offerings at Yale for those interested in finance. A must take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much about financial crises and be finally be able to tell when coverage of the crisis is false. Seriously, this is a once in a life time chance to learn about about a very important, constantly recurring topic.",
    "As an Econ student who was not that interested in finance, I found myself really enjoying the class and appreciating that I could learn about the financial system in an engaging way. I would definitely recommend it to anyone regardless of whether they are specifically interested in the financial system - the lessons we learned about policymaking and thinking about risk will probably be useful in any other area of work.",
    "Highly recommend. Very interesting course, engaging lectures, good material.",
    "100%. Extremely relevant course material and the opportunity to hear from such influential and knowledgeable figures on the topic is unrivaled in other courses offered at Yale.",
    "Yes, very interesting professors and an engaging topic.",
    "The best economics class I have taken at Yale so far, and I am a junior Econ major! This class is NOT A GUT- there is a lot of writing for it- but you will learn a lot! Metrick is a great lecturer, and it is super cool having Tim Geithner come and speak! Some guest lecturers (e.g. Robert Shiller) were not very good, whereas others (Gary Gorton) were great. I learned A LOT about finance and about the Global Financial Crisis. I think that the inverted classroom actually works pretty well. Most classes are just Metrick answering questions submitted the night before, but I do wish that he would answer more of those questions, as we tended to get sidetracked and waste 30 minutes on one question. I obviously don't know my grades yet, but I think it should be graded fairly easily. This is my ideal Yale class- do a lot of work, and get an A I preferred the memos from the first half of the semester to the longer papers of the second half, because frequent memos forced me to have an understanding of the topics, while these longer papers just forced me to understand a handful of topics.",
    "YES. Absolutely crucial class to understand where the global economy is today.",
    "This class is probably my favorite class I've taken since coming to Yale. Professor Metrick is seriously AMAZING, just a wonderful person and a wonderful lecturer. I feel like I've learned so much through this class--I came in with literally no knowledge of how our financial system worked. More than just understanding the crisis, this class is a really great primer for understanding the financial system. It's seriously a phenomenal class, and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the economy or just having a basic knowledge of how the economy works. Be warned though: even though I loved this class, it is SO MUCH WORK. Everyone I talked to has shared this sentiment. As someone who has next to zero econ-related knowledge, I think the amount of work was justified and really enriched my understanding of the material, but if you don't like writing, don't take this class. Not only is it flipped, you have a bunch of papers to write throughout the semester that require you to do a bunch of extra reading on pretty complicated subjects. I know this would never happen, but the workload warrants either a writing credit or the class being 1.5 credits. Overall, amazing class, HIGHLY recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to get a better understanding of what happened during the global financial crisis and what consequences that later had for the eurozone and our financial system (as well as political impacts) today. despite the amount of times the phrase \"break up the big banks\" has been heard, most people probably have not seen the data\/research into the crisis (I know I didn't before this class) which is really helpful for getting an objective basis for opinion. Additionally, Metrick is an AMAZING lecturer - he really takes time to make sure that everyone understands what's happening and conveys information very clearly.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed it",
    "Prof. Metrick is a great dude, school of management students can be super interesting bring a tonne of ~wisdom~ to the discussions. Beware, it's not a \"hard\" course but there is a LOT of work. Good for anyone vaguely interested in finance, history, law and policy to take. Awesome guest lectures and super interesting material. Wish there was more focus on effects of the crisis on people, specifically minorities who were disproportionately affected by it.",
    "Fantastic course - I have reviewed in the grad evaluation",
    "One of the best courses I have taken. Amazingly taught and very worthwhile. Its a lot of work, but you actually learn something.",
    "I think every Yale student who's interested in finance, whether academically or professionally, should take this course. Metrick and the TAs spend so much time giving individual feedback and making sure that everyone can keep up. If you're hoping to work on Wall Street or in government, this class might help you prevent the next crisis!",
    "Definitely, it was intellectually stimulating and so cool to understand the crisis that affected our lives so acutely in such detail.",
    "The video lectures contain most of the content of the course (and they are available on Coursera), so Prof. Metrick dedicated most of the 90-minute classes to Q&A sessions. This really took away the incentive to show up to class since that's a long time to listen to answers to other people's questions. The lectures are presented logically and are extremely interesting, but again they're available on Coursera. Take it if you'd like, but you're basically enrolling in an online class.",
    "This class was awesome!!",
    "If you're interested in the financial crisis, this is a good place to start.",
    "I would recommend this for anyone that's interested in learning about financial crisis. A background in finance is not necessary. There are many guest speakers which keeps it different and allows you to hear from people who were directly involved in the regulatory and corporate side of the crisis.",
    "Would recommend to anyone interested in the financial crisis or just finance in general.",
    "Absolutely and unambiguously."
