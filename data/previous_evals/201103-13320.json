   "comments": [
    "The course did discuss what it stated it would, but it went off track a lot of the time so we ended up spending a lot of time discussing topics i wasn't prepared to talk about. I personally would not take this course again because I didn't find the material to be interesting, but if you are interested in Marxism or communism and poverty, then it is a perfect fit.",
    "Professor Salton-Cox is insightful and a greatoverall instructor. He has an open mind about the opinion's of others, while still participating as an expert in the discussions. He lets everyone speaks, and doesn't pressure anyone to do so when they dont want to. Seminars became a space to bounce off ideas abotu the texts off of him, and he created an envoriment for dialogue to occur among students.The course materila was unlike any I had been exposed to before, and its focus on specific social groups whom I knew littl ebaout before the class were themes and subjects I learne dmuch about throughout the semester Overall, he really knows the course material well, and is excited by it, which makes the class interesting and exciting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, but only if you're willing to take the time and do the readings. The readings are a bit difficult and time-consuming, but they are absolutely worth it, and so is this course!",
    "Yes, it was not excessively difficult, and it was interesting.",
    "I would. Very interesting topic and combination of reading materials to touch on the topic. Excellent professor, extremely approachable. You definitely need to put effort into the class and it's not that easy to get an A, but if you do, the results are huge."
