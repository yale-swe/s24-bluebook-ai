   "comments": [
    "There is a relatively large amount of work, but it is relatively manageable. The essays can become a pain, but if you're interested in the material they shouldn't be that hard to write. This class'squality is really dependent on the quality of the professor. if they do not grade constructively you will not be motivated to write the almost weekly essays. Beyond essays there is no work outside of class and there is no midterm. There may be supplemental reading assigned depending on the teacher but it's nothing too heavy. There is a lot of reading but that should be expected. The class is structured as seminar so most of the time it's discussion. Depending upon how obnoxious the other students in your class are this could be a good thing or a bad thing.",
    "This class was basically a series of discussions of poetry by Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. I wouldn't recommend it to most students, because most of the people who take it are doing it to fill the requirement of the English major, and English majors are more likely to enjoy the class than most other people.",
    "I shopped a bunch of sections of this course and Professor Butterfield's was my favorite by far. She knows a ton about the texts (particularly Chaucer) and she's very good at transmitting that information and facilitating discussion among the students. I had no background with anything from this time period, and Professor Butterfield was very understanding and very approachable.",
    "If you are an English Major, yes. But try to take it with someone else.",
    "English 125 is a wonderful introduction to the English major. It is a course that I would recommend to anyone interested in English or poetry.",
    "I would not recommend it to another studnet because I felt it was less organized than the other sections and Prof. Butterfield was terrific on Chaucer but had less appreciation for the other poets which was very clear.",
    "This is an awesome class! A great opportunity to read literature you would maybe not explore on your own. Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Donne are all amazing poets, and while Spenser can be a little monotonous at times, he is worth the read for a fascinating look into the romance tradition. A great way to learn how to analyze and understand poetry on a whole new level and so worth taking if you have any interest in poetry or literature.",
    "Prospective English majors, here it is. Don't believe anything you hear about this course - make sure you experience it for yourself. Yes, there's a lot of poetry, and there's a lot of dead white men. But it'll be more fun if you accept that and enjoy the ride.",
    "Take it. If you're an english major, you pretty much have to, and if you're not, it is still a pretty great experience. Prof. Butterfield is probably the most qualified person out there to talk about Chaucer's work, and she knows more about texts from this era than you could imagine. Great professor, great class, not much else to say."
