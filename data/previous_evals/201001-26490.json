    "Childcare&Public Policy a wonderful seminar, exploring all aspects of child care from providers to children to funding to developmentally appropriate practice. Janna and Jessica are a great team of teachers - they are super knowledgeable and competent, but they're also incredibly nice, helpful and fun. The course was great because they were very responsive to what we wanted to learn about and how we wanted seminars to be structured. I knew very little about childcare before this class, and now I feel like it's a crucially important area that needs way more attention than it gets. We were graded on participation, two short papers (one of them about a daycare visit! fun!), and one longer paper that was a policy proposal on improving childcare in some way. There's a fair amount of reading, but it's interesting and not that dense.",
    "wonderful course. not a lot of work, only three papers, the instructors were extremely fair and cared about the topic and the students.",
    "I loved this course. Its subject is vital and its treatment was caring and excellent.",
    "This class is pretty good but poorly organized. However, they will hopefully improve the organization if they do the course again.",
    "If you have any interest at all in children or education, take this class! I remember thinking at the beginning of the semester that it sounded like a LOT of child care, and can there really be that much to talk about? Answer: yes, there is. This class covers everything from the economics and workforce development of the child care industry, to the policy and politics surrounding welfare reform and education, to our expectations and assumptions about motherhood and the responsibilities of parents. Jessica and Janna are great teachers who made the class a very relaxed and fun environment while also keeping everything grounded in the real world (thanks to their experience at All Our Kin). The class is incredibly rewarding and valuable.",
    "Yes! Really interesting material. Great and inspiring teachers.",
    "Yes I would. Especially someone involve din education, who cannot find many classes geared towards their interest.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend \"Child Care, Society and Public Policy\" to any student interested in aspects of policy or child care. The course readings are excellent and well-chosen, and Janna and Jessica are both really great. They are incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and interested in their students. I found the class to be an extremely valuable one.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student- especially if he\/she is interested in early childcare or policy work.",
    "If you are at all interested in early childhood education, you should take this course. If you are at all interested in higher education, you should definitely take this course and see how everything connects--and how it does not, but should. If you are interested in children\/education\/parenting, you should take this course. It will challenge your assumptions about caring for young children and help unearth the deep-seated assumptions in all of us.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The workload is very manageable and the topics covered are incredibly important. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and was greatly inspired by it."
