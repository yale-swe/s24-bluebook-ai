   "comments": [
    "Really helpful course that built on the foundation of HPM 510 and 514. I feel much more comfortable writing policy memos and talking about the US health care system now. Strengths? Interesting content Weakness? This class needs to be pulled out of winslow. It should be a discussion class and that just didn't have in the auditorium.",
    "I think I learned some important factors of health economics such as adverse selection and moral hazard, but I think one or two lectures overlapped a little too much. I think the professor is knowledgeable, approachable, and presents the information well. I think this was a useful course.",
    "Greatest strength: great intro to economics-oriented thinking and how that drives health care decision making. This is one of those subjects where I actually do think lecture-style teaching is optimal because it's quite theoretical, so I was happy with the structure of the class. Also the policy memo-writing skills was a great bonus and not only did it expose us to having to write in a very different style than anything else, but it also forced us to critically think about the topics we were about to learn before we learned them. The struggle with that was real. But the struggle was necessary and we are better for it. Improvements: More discussion! We were going over many normative questions and while there was a healthy amount of class discussion towards the end, I think it should have been there throughout because hearing people's opinions was just as useful as learning the subject matter. The last class were had regarding economics of bad was a perfect model for what I would have liked the entire semester to look like. Lecture for an hour, but then the second hour should just be heavy discussion. I like the pressure of knowing I might get cold called on (previous professor used a random name generator) because it forces me to prioritize reading before class over assignments for other, possibly less useful classes. I think I needed to feel more of that here.",
    "I generally liked the course, and found it interesting. One recommendation is to clarify the prompts for the policy analyses (i.e. 'double down' is not a phrase students necessarily understand).",
    "The topics are timely and interesting to learn, class discussions are fun.",
    "The course is decent in presenting economics and health policy information. It was a bit confusing though from what aspect the course was coming from: policy or economics, because the two don't easily overlap. Some lectures were really informative, and some were just so-so. The policy memos were mediocre. I understand the concepts behind them, but it really felt like a chore by the fourth memo. There was not a lot of information about how to address them, how to go about doing them, and how they would be graded.",
    "Good. Very narrow focus and not very approachable for students who are not interested in insurance. Was hoping for broader conversations of domestic health policy and econ.",
    "Very informative.",
    "Well organized and a good class size.",
    "The course has great content already, and the policy memos provided a great opportunity to apply what we learn into practice, but I feel as if I could have learned more about health economics from the course. I feel as if the case studies during class were not that beneficial to learning as well, and although relevant, the time taken to go over time can be shortened.",
    "Good introductory course. Excellent lecturer. Great idea of implementing policy memos.",
    "It is a great course and you can learn a lot from this course.",
    "Made the most out of it, but overall the course was disappointing, mainly due to the instructor. More details below.",
    "Great course.",
    "This course would benefit from cutting the 15 minutes of each class during which Dr. Cooper communicates how important and well connected he is.",
    "All good except for the high workload I'm not good at policy so I spend a huge amount of time on writing memos",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale",
    "Excellent course. Really fluid and comprehensive curriculum, and extremely topical.",
    "makes you engage with the material, I learned a lot!",
    "The course is very interactive.",
    "The policy memos were a great way to have us explore and engage with the class material.",
    "excellent class for understanding health econ and the US health system. the class covers a lot of important and interesting topics and the memos help to push your own understanding and ideas.",
    "It was an okay class",
    "Memo writing can be taxing but it definitely is a great skill to have!",
    "Really great class & especially timely in helping students understand the ACA its potential future. Also an excellent crash course in writing policy memos.",
    "It was an interesting class. The policy memos were difficult and time consuming. But, it was useful to learn to write a policy memo (maybe we didn't need to write THAT many). Zack is engaging and attractive and thus he makes it fun to attend class. The case studies were useful but the instructions weren't clear and we shouldn't have to purchase anything after paying for the actual class.",
    "Interesting course, but very redundant w\/ other course material. Good practice learning to write policy memos. Case studies were interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It provided a solid introduction into the economics of the American health care system. Classroom conversations were productive. The memos were a great way to learn more about the material and see how it plays out in the real world.",
    "This class was really helpful and the structure was great. The policy memos really helped us research each topic thoroughly and form our own opinions about certain health policies. The take home final exam was format we were all used to since it as just policy memos and having the choice of when to do the exam was really helpful.",
    "The course was well taught and structured. The layout fit the current political events in health care well which helped me personally understand how health care services work and how complex the system is. I thought it was a great health economics introduction, though it would have helped if I had some background in economics and health care. I would have liked it more if the course involved more group projects or more group interactions. The readings can be dense which were difficult to complete and sometimes to understand but Zack goes over the topics well in class.",
    "Readings were generally interesting, related to class material and class was engaging and not overly technical.",
    "A really great intro to health econ. I really liked the level of depth applied to each topic. The course was not overly-focused on the mechanics of econ, but was also specific enough that I would feel comfortable using an economic lens in an argument\/paper\/policy-proposal. The memos were a little frustrating. I wish we were provided with better\/more-relevant examples of memos at the beginning of the course. I also wish the prompts were more specific. I felt like I would sometimes misinterpret the prompt then be penalized for it. However, I do feel like I gained an important skill.",
    "Strengths -Above all, this class is super interesting, and it gave me an excellent basis for reading health care related news with a critical eye. I have used the knowledge gained from this class in many conversations to successfully argue in favor (or against) certain policy actions or health care economics-related questions. -Classes were engaging and interactive, which is hard for a big lecture class. Even though I am quiet and am usually intimidated to raise my hand, I really gained a lot from other people asking questions. -Used an interesting mix of material to prepare for class (journals, blogs, case studies, etc.). Weaknesses -Policy memos were a huge part of this class. The thing is, I don't think this class really taught me how to write a policy memo much better than I could have by myself (i.e. without this class). This class was partially marketed (on the first day) as a class that will teach you how to write a policy memo, and I just don't feel confident that I can produce a product that I would be super proud of. -I don't think the teaching staff have an accurate idea of how long it takes some people to engage with the materials and do the assignments.",
    "Good professor that breaks down the information in very palatable format. Easy to understand and engaging lecture. Great practice with policy briefs."

    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Interesting classes, incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0For the first half of the semester, it seemed that this class was at the bottom of a long to do list for Zach. He made interesting slides, but dedicated 10 minutes after class to office hours and just didn't seem really present. About half way through the semester, he got more engaged in the class and seemed to try to connect with students more-- which we really appreciated. He's brilliant and has done fascinating research and is a great lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0A strength of the professor is his knowledge of the information and his ability to present information in a clear and precise manner.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper clearly has the intelligence and credibility necessary to teach a class like this. I was very impressed by his ability to remain unbiased and to allow us to form our own opinions about everything we learned. I imagine that must be difficult as a health care professor especially now. I know that was important for Dr. Cooper and he should know I think he did a great job with that. As I mentioned above, it would be beneficial to allow more time for discussion. I know he intended to structure the class as mainly discussion-based (I agree with those intentions wholeheartedly), but for one reason or another it ended up being more lecture-based. Otherwise the class was awesome and made me care about policy even though I'm not a policy student.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is effective at teaching the material, though sometimes a little hard to approach.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Very interesting topics and the instructor is very enthusiastic about teaching.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zack was a good professor. It was obvious though that his first priority was not teaching, nor the course. The TAs did everything in the class, his ppts usually had multiple grammatical mistakes or errors, and again, it was obvious that he did his mandatory 2 hours of lecture a week and that was it. It was a blast also to keep track of the amount of times he would refer to his own work or what he has done in his career throughout each lecture.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Entertaining, personable and professional. I found the breaks in class instruction to be disruptive and too time-consuming.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Explains thing quite clearly",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He was absolutely amazing and was a great lecturer. Very well organized and made clear slides.",

    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great lecturer, very knowledgeable in the field.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is a good instructor and he is also good at organized instructor.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He...cares so minimally about his students, it's appalling. He's clearly more engaged with his research, which isn't entirely surprising (most professors are), but he makes it incredibly obvious that teaching takes a backdrop to all his other professional obligations. He's explicitly said that he'd rather not teach. His final exam was lazily written. Showed very little effort into crafting meaningful questions. Especially Memo #1: what kind of prompt is that? The cases (BCBS, Cleveland Clinic) are completely unrelated to topics of healthcare policy and economics. Other courses focus on the managerial side of healthcare. Time and resources would be better directed to the topic of his expertise: health policy & econ. The one saving grace of his class are the policy memos. And that's mainly because he delegates the job of grading to this TA's. The extensive feedback received on each memo was actually nice. Maybe some goodwill can be directed back to him? Not sure.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Great professor, engaging and passionate about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper scheduled his office hours to directly conflict with the class that half of his students went to immediately after his class. This class is a lot like a dumbed-down version of the health econ class that Dr. Forman teaches at SOM. I would be hard pressed to name a professor at YSPH who cared less about teaching or students than Dr. Cooper.",

    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zach was a great professor, extremely engaging, clearly well-informed and experienced, and committed to answering any and all questions we had.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zach was always engaging and the classes were interesting and interactive. He gave everyone a chance to express their views and discuss the matters at hand. I do think office hours should have been better organized, not just at the end of class when many of the students have other classes to attend.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Strength- Knowledgeable about some subjects Weakness- Unbearably arrogant",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I loved Prof. Cooper. He's really engaging and obviously knowledgeable about this material given his background.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He was very knowledgeable but class didn't seem to be his top priority (which is ok). Overall, very good",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Very personable, good communicator. Good at engaging class interest. Course material was redundant, both from class to class and with other required courses.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0The professor was very responsive to requests from students and incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. He expected students to participate and made it easy to do so.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is a fantastic lecturer and made a complicated topic like health care policy easy to understand. He thoroughly explained all the concepts and challenged us to think about policy implications. If you are doing any work in public health or healthcare, these are important concepts to know and Professor Cooper covered all the basics you need to know.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Zack is a great professor. He explains concepts as simply as possible while keeping it relative to the topic. His analogies help make it easier to understand concepts, which I found extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I have an intellectual-crush on Dr Cooper, you should talk more about your work and I loved getting to weigh in on current events with your feedback. Also, the classes were well engaged and thoughtful. However, if you don't want people to eat in class go ahead and tell them at the beginning rather than call me out every time I ate an apple and peanut butter. I eventually learned haha",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Fantastic lecturer. I got the sense that Dr. Cooper wasn't that invested in students\/teaching, but he did an amazing job keeping our attention and explaining complex material.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Strengths -Teaching style was very engaging, and I always looked forward to coming to class. -Lots of interesting anecdotes about doing health economics research and trying to bridge that research with policy decisions. I really appreciated the \"real world\" perspective. Weaknesses -VERY unrealistic (or may uninformed?) expectations of how long assignments (especially the final) would take. The take-home final was supposed to take 4 hours to complete. It took me between 17-20 hours of intense concentration (over several days) to complete it.",

    "I would recommend this class. The policy memos were useful.",

We're going to run into \"the system\" in one way or another during our careers as professionals or academics. So I would definitely recommend others to take the course. Also I would recommend for people to do the readings before class because the lectures are easier to follow that way.",

    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to know more about the U.S. health system and how it is structured.",
    "The course is an amalgamation of policy and economics pertaining to health. I would recommend it to students who want a broader background to health policy and economic material, especially if you take Micro (it's an excellent follow up course to micro). I think with some changes, the course could be optimized for most (if not all) students at YSPH to take.",
    "I would recommend it for students with interest in the specific course topics. It is important to review syllabus before enrolling. This class was necessary for my degree and was informational but not broadly applicable to my focus.",
    "This course looks at major sections of US health system and explains its distinctions from health systems in other countries.",
    "Great course for HPM concentration. Excellent for practicing policy memo writing. All lectures are rich in content.",
    "I recommend this course if you want to study both the economics and policy.",
    "Manage your expectations. You can learn a fair bit through self-study, and his articles are actually pretty informative. But his teaching? Don't expect much. He's apathetic -- exactly the kind of professor that should be prohibited from teaching and engaging with students.",
    "Take Dr. Forman's health econ class. If you're in the HPM track, try to wave out of this class. The grading is annoyingly subjective, but that's not really the problem here. The bigger issue is that Dr. Cooper strongly dislikes spending time engaging with students and clearly has better things to do than teaching. You'll learn more and deal with a lot less self-aggrandizing in other health econ classes at Yale.",
    "All good but for those who're new to econ, it's a bit hard. Too many readings!!!!",
    "If you want to know health policy and the economics of insurance, take this course! You'll come away with a solid understanding and grasp!",
    "Great introduction to healthcare economics- practical",
    "This is course is very interactive, and is excellent ion understanding the economics in health policy.",
    "This course is a survey of health economics and its applications to health policy. You have to do 6 policy memos. These memos are pretty difficult, but the resources provided are really helpful (so was the feedback provided on them). I would recommend this class to anyone it might interest!",
    "I would definitely recommend HPM 560 to a fellow student. Zach is an amazing professor he was always honest and open about any biases that he brought into discussion but provided students with a balanced view of all perspectives. The material itself is extremely relevant to the current political climate, and the policy memos are an excellent way for students to reenforce and deepen their knowledge on specific topics. Overall, the class was super interesting and a pleasure to take.",
    "Definitely take if you have any interest in health policy\/econ.",
    "Decent class",
    "The workload is very heavy because of the policy memos, but you get a lot out from this class.",
    "I'd recommend this to any student who wants more experience writing professionally & who wants to learn more about health care reform now and to come.",
    "Micro Econ + health insurance\/ health system nitty gritty. I would recommend it. It is good to know but some lectures are too content specific and thus not relevant to a lot of people in the room",
    "Interesting course, but very redundant w\/ other course material. Good practice learning to write policy memos. Case studies were interesting. Professor Cooper is an engaging professor and makes the material interesting. A good summary course that doesn't go as in depth as other purely economics or purely health policy courses.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is very important material to understand when working in public health and the class is enjoyable.",
    "Yes! Great for anyone interested in health policy and the healthcare system.",
    "I would recommend this course if you do not know health economics very well. It would be helpful if you have a background or general knowledge of healthy care systems. There was a lot of terminology I had never heard of so I found this course dense but interesting.",
    "Interesting.",
    "The course content is incredibly interesting and important. You will also gain a really important\/relevant skill and fine-tune your writing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "If you're a health policy, health care management or MBA student, this class is for you. It's taught in a way that plays on the strengths and knowledge base of these students. I do not fall into this category, and found this class frustrating and challenging, though interesting. I think at the end of the day, to be successful in this class, you just need to know a lot about health care policy and economics already, and I did not have that background. So, I would recommend this class to those who have that background. Or, I would recommend to the instructors to change the prerequisites so that you come into the class with that background. Although I sought help from multiple sources, this class frequently made me feel overwhelmed, and if I had the chance again, I don't think I would take it (or may just audit it, but not take it for credit).",
    "Awesome course to introduce students to econ and our health system."
