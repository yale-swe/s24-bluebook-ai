    "You should take this class. Two professors make the class twice as good.",
    "The course is a really awesome way to think about theory and apply it to practical case studies. The class is open to questioning theory. It also is self-reflecting in looking back at our role in studying the pilgrims, which is interesting. It is extremely interdisciplinary both in terms of different religions studying but also in drawing on theory, anthropology, sociology, pictures, film, and even a field trip, all of which were awesome. The workload is totally manageable as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking to study religions from a theoretical and anthropological perspective.",
    "This was definitely an interesting class. Take it if you are interested in religious studies. The professors had a great chemistry, which made the class fun and engaging. I think a lot of the experience of being in this class was our entire class dynamic, so having a good group made the experience enjoyable for me. You will learn a lot and question your thoughts onpilgrimage. Overall a good class!",
    "If you need a comparative religions rec, then yeah. Give it time and this class will improve leaps and bounds by the next time it's taught (if it is taught again)",
    "Yes",
    "I think the class may be restructured in the future, but basically we did a different religion\/region a week, focusing on their perspective towards pilgrimages--though some weeks were more specific, and some were more general. We had to do five reading responses over the semester, had a paper in the first few weeks, and a reflection on a class trip to ground Zero that seems to have been ungraded, and a final paper of ten pages or the option to do something creative.I loved this class, and I think it is particularly worthwhile for Religious Studies majors, for whom pilgrimage as a comparative lense is really interesting. Davis and Quintman are absolutely wonderful religious studies professors, and we had a great group of students, so shop the class, look at the syllabus, and see how excited you are. I gave up a really difficult-to-get-into creative writing class for this seminar, and don't regret it at all.",
    "Would definitely recommend, especially if you're a RLST major and need a comparative religion course to graduate.",
    "Focuses on theory way too much. You learn about 3 or 4 pilgrimage theories, but hardly any discussion is devoted to discussing actual practice. You are basically forced to do a fall break field trip which kind of sucks.",
    "Overall I would recommend this class. The readings for the first week are all about the theoretical fundamentals of pilgrimage, and each subsequent week focuses on pilgrimage in different religions. Most of the class time is spent discussion how the pilgrimage of each religion defends or refutes the definitions of pilgrimage set by the authors you read the first week, although as the semester goes on it becomes clear that there just isn't a single definition for pilgrimage, no matter how much time you spend in class discussing it. Although there is a substantial amount of reading each week, the rest of the work is very manageable: one 5-page paper about the Wizard of Oz, one 2-page response paper to a class trip to the 9\/11 Memorial in New York (this trip alone is reason to take the class), and one final project. The project can be as straightforward as a 10-page paper about pilgrimage in another religion (or secular pilgrimage, which I wound up finding more interesting), or it can be more of a creative undertaking involving poetry, photography, video, or anything youcome up with. Professor Davis and Professor Quintman are both very flexible and committed to making sure you're excited about your project, so it can become a really cool experience. They are also a lot of fun in the classroom, keeping things entertaining (although sometimes the discussion becomes more of a time for everyone to share their personal opinions or anecdotes rather than talking about the readings, which can get tedious). This was their first year teaching the course, so I think certain kinks will be ironed out when they teach it again. It's a good way to learn about a wide variety of important world religions, although be aware that the readings really do focus on pilgrimage in each of the religions and you don't necessarily learn about the religion as a whole."
