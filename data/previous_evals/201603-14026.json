    "This class exposed me to an extensive amount of vocabulary, concepts, and more that have caused me to look at the world in an entirely new way. Islam has changed to me; cultural studies have changed to me. Thank you Zareena.",
    "I learned how to look beyond the seemingly impenetrable wall of modern media to tease out the narratives we are being fed, and to separate them from what might actually be going on. A great course in dissecting media accounts of the so-called Muslimworld.\"",
    "I learned so much in this class--from historical facts left out of high school textbooks to different methods of perceiving content that I consume every day.",
    "I developed a more thoughtful, compassionate, and critical lens through which to view the lens of our current workd.",
    "In this course I learned about the different ways in which Islam, the Middle East, and \"the Muslim world\" has been viewed throughout the past century in the US media, popular culture, and in US polic",
    "I learned about the intimate relationship between policy and culture, and the way that cultural trends within the U.S. (created through art and media) can have real impact on American foreign policy.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Islam--both its presence, representations and implications--in America. This course also helped complicate my understanding of the United States' relationship with Islam and the Middle East."

   "comments": [
    "This course is based on really strong, interesting, complex readings, which are definitely the strength of it. Unfortunately, we didnt get that much time to discuss the readings in class, partly because each meeting was so short (1 hr and 15 mins, twice a week), but mostly because class was devoted to Prof Grewal either explaining the readings to us (very helpful!) or telling us stories about her fascinating, crazy life (which helped make what we were learning more tangible, but also ate up a lot of time). This course could have benefitted from reading questions to guide the readings on our own time, so that when we arrived in class wed have more of an idea of what we should be looking for\/discussing.",
    "The strength of this class is Zareena's ability to make the syllabus flexible and her engagement with current events that really made the class dynamic and made us all feel like a community engaged with one another.",
    "Class discussions were always incredibly engaging and exciting.",
    "I loved the course readings, and appreciated that our reading schedule was flexible and sometimes altered to better compliment current events. I also really liked the amount of agency we were given to choose our paper topics and topic of our final project. It allowed me to become as engaged as possible with the course because I was writing and thinking about things that feel deeply personal. If anything could be changed, maybe I would include a group or partner project as one of the assignments.",
    "The course did a really good job of connecting all of the large themes with one another and building up from one theme to another. It also relied on an incredible reading list."

    "YES. Prof Grewal is amazing, and you will learn so much about the history of American perceptions of Islam. This class is a must-take for anyone even remotely interested in contemporary global politics, concerned about ISIS, or curious how National Geographic made America so obsessed with the green eyes of that one Afghan girl.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--it is so interesting and Zareena is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. I was so excited to come to seminar every time, and the readings are long but well picked and so relevant.",
    "Take it! It's a fun, incredibly interesting class, and you will come away with some new ways of thinking about and processing the world around you.",
    "Yes! So long as you are prepared to do the work and put aside any previous assumptions and biases.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. Sometimes I feel like ER&M courses feel redundant or echo chamber-y, but in this course we talked about topics and thought in ways that were totally new to me.",
    "Yes! Do take this course with Professor Grewal--you learn so much and it isn't a stressful course to take during any semester."
