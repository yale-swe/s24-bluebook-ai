   "comments": [
    "VERY PRACTICAL.",
    "The course provided knowledge ands kills I believe will be useful post- YSPH. The instructor and TA are very approachable and willing to accommodate students' needs. I also like the fact that there was only one in-class exam- the midterm. The rest of the grade was made up of the course project and a critique of a published evaluation.While the course may be improved by requiring students to carry out an actual evaluation, I see how that may be difficult to achieve. On the whole, I would recommend the course.",
    "it was common sense. Spent a lot of time learning material that is intuitive. Would be better if you could do an applicative rather than theoretical learning.",
    "I like the applicability of it, but class time could be enhanced by having more workshops\/activities vs. being lecture focused.",
    "Skills learned from the course will be helpful and applicable once in the field but in the classroom it can be difficult to practice the learned concepts.",
    "strengths: very practical skills, will definitely be useful laterweaknesses: boring lectures, midterm exam was a drag",
    "no comments please",
    "I expected to come out with more concrete skills, but I suppose that is the nature of program evaluation - it all depends on the context. I have a good understanding of the process now. Students should be told about the expectation to work with an outside org. prior to the first day of class if possible to begin talks with possible collaborators.",
    "Strengths: professor's expertise.Weakness: not enough actual skill learning in class for studentscourse feels a little too didactic at times",
    "Strengths: good overview, good distribution of grades, great final project, the critique assignment was greatWeaknesses: lectures were a little dry, there was a lot of overlap of methodology from other MPH classesI was looking forward to this course to give me practical experience. I liked the final project, but perhaps it could be structured in a way for it to be due earlier in the semester, have it graded and comments made, and then we revise it. This way, we can learn from out mistakes and understand what would be realistic in the real world.More case studies would be helpful. We did read a couple and talked about strengths\/weaknesses but this could be expanded",
    "I think that this course is generally ok, but some of the material feels redundant when taking other courses into account (e.g., quantitative methods). It might be helpful to have more exposure to evaluations that have been performed, perhaps integrating more critiques--I think this would help solidify some of the topics discussed and give students more practice in critically thinking about evaluation design, which would ultimately strengthen their own projects. Also, building in feedback about our own evaluations earlier in the semester might help. 2 weeks before they are due does not give time to make substantial changes, and the organizations as well as students might benefit from more formal feedback earlier.",
    "Excellent course, enjoyed it thoroughly.",
    "It is a very useful course combining both theory and practical experience. The content of the lectures is organized very well to match learning with practical design of evaluation plans.",
    "The course gives a great overview of program evaluation. I would recommend this course to someone who already has a program in mind that they want to evaluate. Considering the fact that most of the students are in their second year, it would be helpful if the lectures could cover more material and go into more detail.",
    "I personally liked the course very much and felt that it was very practical in terms of real-world experience. I got to interact with people from organisations outside of school, and it gave me insight into what consulting for an organisation would be like.",
    "Evaluation is a great skill to learn -- the content overlaps some with epidemiology and research methods courses. Actually writing an evaluation plan was a great project and it was a lot of fun to work with a local organization.I would like to see less didactic material -- less lectures on content and more practical exercises, discussion.I enjoyed the evaluation critique -- more in class exercises like that could be helpful",
    "The initial lectures were dry because we sat in class while the professor talked to us. This improved once we had sessions were we interacted with each other with group sessions in which we put what we were learning into practice. This was the best part of the course.",
    "The course overall was good and helped develop some practical skills.",
    "Very useful and practical material and skill development. Reading at times of that long, and not always clear what was required\/expected.",
    "It's a good course. Some of the lectures seem kind of repetitive from other courses though."

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0A very good instructor - i did not find any weaknesses",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise means well and has a very nuanced understanding of program evaluation, but she has to update her slide decks. I found the bright backgrounds and aggressive clip art very distracting. Kathleen was very helpful in critiquing our evaluation plan over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Great professor who cares about her students and is very open to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Strengths: very approachable and friendly; willing to help students; knowledgeable and gave good adviceYou tried this with certain exercises in class but in the future maybe try a more interactive teaching style",

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Great Professor, very good at teaching and made the course fun.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructor provided a lot of help along the way to make sure the practical part of this course went smoothly. The instructor is experienced and very competent in teaching this course.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise was great; she cared a lot about her students, and she used a lot of her own experience in relaying the material to the class, which I thought was really helpful. However, I enjoyed the interactive portion of the class more so than the didactic portion. I found that interactive sessions for this sort of class was more helpful than lecture notes, although the lecture notes were useful, too, of course.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Good professor -- knows the course content very well. Could provide more interactive portions to class to make lecture more engaging. Also did not always provide detailed feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0She seemed very knowledgeable about the materials that she taught. She had some helpful examples to provide to us of what and how she did what she did, and how everything tied into the current lecture. The problem was that there were many lectures where she did not provide useful examples of how what we were learning could have been applicable to the real world. Another strength was how the class and course work were organized so that everything flowed well. The time she had our critique due made sense given when we learned some of the skills needed to perform a critique.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise is a fantastic instructor and sensitive to student needs.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Very helpful. Well experience in the field. Able to answer practical questions regarding specific situations.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I like her, but, as we talked about in class, the layout of the class probably needs a makeover. The powerpoints are kind of boring and most people weren't that engaged.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Excellent"

    "I would recommend the class to another student if they are interested in gaining some practical skills and learning more about how to evaluate health programs.",
