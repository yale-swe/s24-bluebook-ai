    "The course covered ample material, with concentrations in specific geographic areas. I feel prepared to write and research in the material and archaeological culture of Dura-Europos, Egypt more broadly, and Rome. I am now aware of important conversations being held in archaeological and early Christian studies: public\/private, defining domestic space, archaeological phases as they relate to social history, and the use\/abuse of texts in relationship with art\/objects. This course changed my approach to secondary literature, as well. It seems no longer helpful to read scholarly works that make no mention of non-textual sources. Or worse, secondary literature that subjugates material culture to texts.",
    "I gained a great deal of insight into Archaeological methods on the whole. Overall, it was very informative.",
    "More of a nuanced understanding regarding how space is interacted with"

    "The atmosphere was welcoming to students with little or no background in material culture, but without appearing too vague or surface-level. These might be my own idiosyncrasies, but I was disappointed that a few weeks did not substantially delve into the primary readings assigned on the syllabusmost notable Kim Bowe's \"Private Worship.\" This text was by far one of the more interesting monographs I have read in five years, but time in class was devoured by presentations on reference works. In the future, I would like to see a more strict adherence to the 10-15 min limit for presentation. (Although, I admit, my own presentation went very long.... my apologies). This would allow the class to commit to discussing the primary readings, with the presentations acting as \"breaks\" from the primary material. I fear that the lack of attention to the primary readings sometimes permitted more than a few students to not read the material. Perhaps this is why on some weeks the \"open forum\" prompt of questions\/concerns\/etc. about the readings was met with silence.",
    "I would have liked Dr. Davis and Dr. Harley McGowan to teach more, e.g. to really delve into the case studies and present on them. The theoretical works sometimes got to abstract and I was unable to connect them to materiality.",
    "This class was very strongly focused on archaeology, which was very helpful, but I also expected more discussion of visual culture that could help me in future research."
