    "Generally a required course, and it shows. This isn't a class to take for fun, the labs are long and can be very tedious, followed by lab reports that can also be time consuming. However, this isn't a bad class, and I did find myself enjoying it at times, so don't worry if you're required to take it for your major.",
    "I would not recommend it, but then again, I wouldn't recommend anything related to physics to anyone. So if you have to take a physics lab, this one is not bad at all, if a little boring.",
    "It was a fun but difficult lab and as such I would only recommend it if you have to take it.",
    "Component to Intro Physics: a necessary evil.",
    "Half a credit but twice the work. But that applies to all lab classes anyways.",
    "PHYS 165L is a basic physics lab course designed to make students familiar with physical phenomena. The course is pretty dry, but you will learn something.",
    "Painless and straightforward, you won't learn anything hugely new but it will reinforce some of the more complicated concepts from class. The instructors are really nice, as was my TA, and the lab notes and 1 page summaries every week are completely painless. Nothing to stress about!",
    "Yes, but only if you need to take physics lab. It's not too complex, but it wouldn't make a good \"fun class\"",
    "If you have to take it, take it. It could be much worse. Pretty short lab reports each week and a very manageable practical. Grading depends on your TA.",
    "PHSY165L is a relatively simple, straight-forward introductory physics lab.",
    "I would recommend this lab to any student looking to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Compared to chemistry labs, this class is fairly laid back. Many of the experiments are short, so it's not uncommon to be able to leave lab early. The lab reports (lab notes plus a one page summary) are not too time-consuming. I spent about four hours per week on work for this class (lab report plus preparing for the next lab). The final exam is a practical, which I was nervous about. However, the class prepares you well for the final, and I found it quite manageable. You get to use all the materials from class on the final, so no need study (though I do recommend attending one of the final practice sessions, where you get to work through a problem from a previous exam).",
    "General physics lab covering mostly Newtonian physics. I actually really enjoyed it probably as much as anyone could enjoy an intro physics lab. The experiments are pretty straightforward, and I had a good experience with the professors and my TA this semester. I think probably the TA makes a big difference, but I got very lucky with Estella!",
    "This is a fairly benign lab course; not too much work but not too interesting",
    "Its a class you take because you have to. No one wants to take it but its not hard, just a few hours one day a week",
    "I would recommend it. If you are thinking of taking this class, you are probably pre-med, and you probably have to. It will probably be the easiest lab you take here.",
    "Phys 165L is a chill way to fill the physics lab requirement. You do a lab a week, and write up a 1 page report for the next week. There's very little out of class commitment necessary, although the practical is sort of hard (you can't really study for it though). This is probably your best bet if you're in 170 or 180, although I hear that 205L is similar in format, just more work (ie longer lab reports, harder experiments).",
    "Necessary lab, but not painful. If you have a good TA then it should be enjoyable at times and Professor Baker and Professor Cahn help you out if you get stuck. I wasn't a huge fan of switching partners each week, however that's just a personal preference.",
    "Physics 165 Lab was a comprehensive lab, and was probably my favorite lab that I have taken at Yale. The lab reports are not difficult, and the time spent in lab is less than in other science labs. Also, Professor DeMille is an awesome guy that loves his job and the students.",
    "you're probably taking it because you have to. be assured, it's one of the better intro science labs. not as much work as gen chem or even orgo. weekly quizzes and a one-page write-up after each lab. they do expect you to think critically about experiments, though, and not just regurgitate procedure. so it takes brain-work. generally a good lab.",
    "take it if you have to",
    "labs typically take 2.5-3 hours, be sure to write a lot for your lab notes and print out all the graphs, and also that your results match what is expected for you to obtain (or explain why). insight points are not graded by a consistent standard so expect lab report grades to vary by +\/- 2 points. you will feel crunched for time during the final but there's not really a way to study or prepare for it. very little regular workload since the one-page lab addendums shouldn't take you over an hour",
    "Phys 165L is an excruciatingly painful lab course. You just want to punch a wall when you spend 3+ hours measuring how a ball falls. Pretty much all the experiments are really boring. My TF would take points off for just about anything in my lab reports. The final practical exam was 3 hour of stress that I didn't think accurately tested my lab abilities. Only take this lab if you have to.",
    "This lab is probably a requirement. It can be pretty tedious, since it's an intro level lab. Most of the experiments are pretty standard, but the labs usually take up most of the lab period mainly because you have to write down every detail of what you are doing, what you are observing, etc., which can get pretty tedious. The write-ups aren't that bad because they are limited to one page. The practical exam at the end also isn't that bad as long as you know what you are doing. But, the software can be annoying to use at times, and figuring out what's malfunctioning can sometimes take a while (which is especially bad if it's during the practical). The lab is probably worth a full credit of effort, since there are a lot of one credit classes that have less class time\/coursework. Also, Estella is an awesome TA.",
    "It's fine, kinda tedious but not that hard. Take it because you have to",
    "I recommend it cause we have to take it but still it's quite good cause you learn a lot of cool physical phenomenon!",
    "Great lab if you have to take it or if your interested in learning about the introductory concepts of physics. I would even suggest it if your just looking for an interesting physics lab course, however the insight points they ask you to include in your lab reports are ridiculous. There is honestly no such thing as insight points, and full insight points are more illusive than a double rainbow. The final is also a little bit stressful because you don't have much time for each section but overall this is a pretty good lab course. Some of the labs are extremely long though, and the majority of the time I ended up getting out around 3:30pm which was definitely frustrating.",
    "Do not under any circumstances take this course unless you are required to. If you are premed this is one of your necessary evils but do not take it with any other lab courses.",
    "I hated this lab class, but it really depends on your TA.",
    "i would recommend NEVER EVER taking this horrible course. its a waste of time. you learn almost nothing and it gives you a final at the very end that is ridiculously high pressure. its not even a fair class because not everyone works well in practicals (there should be a written option) and it tests you on concepts that WERE NOT EVEN COVERED IN PHYSICS CLASS. so you go into lab and do things that are unrelated to the class. its horrible. dont take it. all thing good about it are the TAs",
    "This was a good lab! Not too hard and a lot of the labs are really enjoyable! It really helps to teach you physics concepts that are introduced in introductory physics classes.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to or are really, really interested in four hours of physics in one afternoon",
    "For what it is -- a basic, introductory physics lab course -- PHYS 165 is well done. It is by far the lowest stress lab course that I have taken at Yale (pre med labs). The labs typically last fewer than the max 3 hours, no protective gear needed (v. chem labs), and the lab writeups are only 1 page and require little critical thinking. The lab helps reinforce basic concepts from lecture, and it follows more closely the PHYS 180 than PHYS 170 curriculum (I don't know how you would make a PHYS 170 lab...). In sum, PHYS 165 is probably not a course you take because you want to , but rather because you have to. Luckily, it's a fairly painless experience.",
    "It is a typical physics lab. I would recomend this lab it was very fun and the experiments were fun to do.",
    "A really great lab course. The lab write-ups are only the notes which you take in class (usually it'd take me like 1 or 2 hours to finish up outside of class because I only made rough notes during class), and then a one page summary of what you did\/what the errors were in the experiment. I had a great lab TA which definitely helped make the class more enjoyable, but the practical final really isn't so hard, so long as you can figure out how to use Logger Pro during labs. As long as you do the work, this lab is excellent, even for pre-meds like me. Professor Cahn is the man!",
    "While there isn't a lot of actual work, some of the labs are very stressful to finish (depends on how good your TA is) and most are extremely boring. Take it if you have to (pre-med or engineers).",
    "Not a great lab. Tedious lab work that doesn't really further your understanding of basic concepts introduced in the beginning pre-lab lectures. Grading is pretty rough, as rubrics tend to focus on details like \"uncertainties\" rather than overall grasping of the lab's main message.",
    "This is a very good class for a premed student.",
    "Take this course only if you need it for your major or for pre-med requirements. There are definitely much higher quality lab courses offered by Yale that are more worthy of your time. The experiments were interesting, but most were very tedious and using LoggerPro for everything was a pain. The workload wasn't too bad (weekly lab notes, weekly lab report, weekly pre-lab quizzes, and final exam practical). The grading felt a bit arbitrary (especially when my TA would take off points for 'insight' without being able explain how I could actually improve my lab report). Professor Cahn was very friendly and knowledgeable, but I had a terrible experience with my TA (who didn't seem to understand what was going on half the time). The curriculum follows that of PHYS 180, so if you're in PHYS 170 you will need to teach yourself a few concepts about rotational motion. However, the lab instructions packets were very clear so this really shouldn't be a problem.",
    "Overall only take this if you need to take a lab requirement in physics. The expectations are pretty straightforward, but the lab is long ~4 hours. The 1-page reports are pretty easy compared to other labs. The final is TOUGH.",
    "Physics 165 lab was surprisingly interesting. Though the labs could be long, I find myself coming out of the course with just generally good feelings overall. The lab definitely enhanced my understanding of the material covered in lecture (though it definitely seemed to correspond to Physics 180 more than Physics 170). The lab reports are graded pretty harshly, but the final practical was actually pretty ok. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would summarize this course as a relaxed lab. It is more relaxed because of the post-lab write-ups. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "PHYS 165L is probably the most painless lab I have ever taken here. The lab reports are only one page and it's a pretty good complement to the course. You probably wouldn't take it unless you're premed or a physics major, but it's still a solid lab and you get cupcakes during the final.",
    "The labs are a bit long and tedious but otherwise straightforward and not difficult. Take it if you must. Otherwise, I wouldn't.",
    "Not a very exciting lab, but I did learn some physics; particularly liked the fluids lab and rotation lab. Basically, the lab consists of writing a one page writeup each week that takes ~an hour or so as well as studying for weekly quizzes, which takes an hour or so before class. If you have to take it then it's not bad, but would not recommend it otherwise.",
    "I would recommend Physics 165L if you need to take a Physics Lab Course.",
    "Overall this was one of the more difficult classes I've taken this semester. The labs were very long and it was difficult to concentrate for the full 3 (or more) hours. It's not too bad but sometimes trying to complete everything in the lab well was tough, especially if you didn't read up on the course packet and understand the concepts before hand. I feel it is definitely more difficult for PHYS170 students because it hardly paralleled with what we were leaning. Regardless, I liked how there were weekly quizzes because it encouraged us to read up on the lab before hand. Some labs were very interesting and I learned a lot during those sessions. What made this course difficult was the final practical. I'm not really sure it's fair to have different people do different labs. Some labs are much harder than others. I understand that everybody gets an easy, medium and then a hard one for the practical, but because some people get to start off with the easy I feel that it is slightly unfair to those who started off with the really hard one. It happened to me and, having never taken a practical before, I was thrown off. Which brings me to the next point that the practice sessions in the lab in the week before the final could have definitely been more useful. I had no idea how to best use my time during those sessions, so I definitely advise future students to use that time well. Take a practice exam within the time limit and see how you do. Also there's such a difference between TA grading...every students' worst nightmare. But they do have a way of countering that so hopefully it's not bad.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 165L to another student, even if they don't have to take it.",
    "Great course - it's a consistent amount of work each week, but it's definitely doable. Although the practical exam is pretty variable for each student, I'd say it comprehensively reviews concepts you've learned throughout the semester in a creative way. Definitely wouldn't take it unless you're taking PHYS 170\/80 or have taken AP Physics C.",
    "This lab was not the most exciting course of my semester, but it also wasn't an unreasonable amount of work and helped me better understand some physics concepts. If one finishes all the in-lab work and writing during the time, the work outside of class is minimal, with a one-page report.",
    "Aardvark. For all intents and purposes, this is a good supplement to PHYS 170 or 180. The labs are well written and the objectives are clear. Each lab will take 2-3 hours. Grading is fair and not difficult. I enjoyed having the supplements to the regular physics course. Probably would not take it if it weren't a major\/pre-professional requirement, but it was generally a good experience.",
    "This class is a lot more work than you think for a once a week class. Be prepared to study and really no your labs before you take them, because that definitely makes it easier. Also hope you have a good TF, that makes the class easier.",
    "Not as fun as orgo lab but... it's fine.",
    "Not a difficult lab, but very tedious, especially when pertaining to things like significant figures. you lab experience also depends heavily on who your TA is too. There are quizzes at the beginning of each lab, which aren't hard but often test you on whether you read the lab handout before hand. The lab write ups (1 page) are also not tedious either. The labs themselves just take a long time.",
    "If you need it, take it. If you don't need it, don't take it.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Yucky but necessary if you're a physics major or pre-med. Don't take it if you're not. The course is not that much work but the work that is there is super annoying. The one page writeups each week take longer than you'd think - you have to incorporate insightful points to get \"insight points\". I'm still not sure what those are. There are quizzes based on the lab handout each week in the beginning of class. These are easy but read the handout before class. Writing out the lab notes to give in also takes a while. Try to do this during the lab so you'll save time later. I never did because I did not want to stay in the lab longer than I absolutely had to. The labs themselves are somewhat confusing and lengthy, requiring you to make many repeats and account for uncertainties. How I hate uncertainties. The final exam was also strange and pretty difficult, as many will agree. It's also more than 30% of your grade. No way to really prepare for it outside of understanding the procedures of all the labs we did and understanding the formulas. I prepared for it by reading through the handouts and trying to come up with the procedures by myself. From what I heard this course is much more tailored to 180 than 170. I took 170 so maybe if you took 180 your experience would be different. Eh.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this class on its own, but I highly recommend it to anyone taking Physics 170 at the same time. I took the class a year before, and I realized several times over that lab would have helped my understanding of the class.",
    "It's probably required; if not, there are more interesting Bio labs out there.",
    "Well, you probably have to take it. For me, it was a deeply unpleasant experience because of my TA, who seemed to be an exception to the rule once I'd talked to others. So my only advice is get a good TA - if you have a bad one, try your best to switch to a different section. Beyond that, just do your best. You'll survive.",
    "If you need the Physics Lab credit than take the class. Otherwise, it's not worth it. You'll learn some things but a lot of the class (like most labs) is just busywork.",
    "This was a great lab course! The lab really isnt that much work if you write up your notes during lab, because then all you need to do is write up a one page lab write-up. For the insight points, they are mostly looking for errors that occurred or different applications what you learned in lab. Ask your TA after the first lab report gets handed back on how to get all the points and you should be fine.",
    "Gotta do what you gotta do. Not too bad overall but a bit of a time crunch at times in the labs",
    "If not a requirement, avoid it. If a requirement, it's not terrible. At first everything is super nit picky but after awhile you get the hang of what's expected.",
    "Be aware of the lab reports, and what your TA expects from them.",
    "This is a low workload class during most of the semester and you will likely learn some new things even though the material is usually intuitive. Occasionally, a lab will require extra time\/effort. In terms of learning, if you want to actually delve into physical measurement, work through problems on your own without having a largely explicit procedure than this might not be the course for you. However, if you want to have a decent understanding of physics lab techniques than this course is sufficient.",
    "Your experience will vary depending on the TA! I recommend shopping around the sections if possible, as my TA for the majority of the semester was very unhelpful. Perhaps due to my TA, we did rarely left lab on time and did not gain a conceptual understanding of the material.",
    "A class you probably have to take but it isn't that terrible. Of course, a lot of this hinges on your TA, which is something largely outside of your control. Just pray that you don't get the ridiculously hard set-up for the lab practical (for my first experiment I had a rotating table attached to two springs and had to be run through a pendulum timer; I am not optimistic). It takes less than a couple of hours to write the lab write ups and make sure your notes are in order. You usually get out early (~1 hour).",
    "It was fine, boring and easy.",
    "You're probably taking this class because you have to, but it can actually be very helpful and a good introduction to labs. The lab reports aren't that bad, though it can be very dependent on which TA you get.",
    "I think it really helped that I had a great TA. Eustace went above and beyond to make sure that all his students were on track and understanding things. He was an angel compared to previous physics TAs I have had. He also didn't mind staying later to answer questions and created a very encouraging, non-stressful environment. I would recommend this class as long as you get a good TA, but you probably have to take it for your major or for pre-med. Def better than 166L!",
    "A fair physics lab course. Lab procedures are somewhat tedious but not overly stressful or challenging. Lab reports are limited to one page each week summarizing your key findings. Reports can usually be completed in an hour or lesshowever, something like 5 points will be withheld from every report for \"insight\" unless you go and tie in some interesting external observations, facts, or analyses (grading is very hit-or-miss).",
    "PHYS 165L is pretty easy. The labs take about 2.5 hours each and you spend about 1hr doing write-ups and preparing each week, so overall it's not too much work. The instructors were very helpful both in the lab and via email. Compared to 205, it'll be much easier when you're in lab but more work outside the lab (write-ups), so pick your poison.",
    "This was a good class for studying the applications of physics that is learned in the classroom, although as a phys200 student, I felt more prepared than my 180 counterparts",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, it was basically a wag to visualize and work hands on with the concepts learned in the associated physics lectures.",
    "I felt like the class was very tedious, but did teach the basic principles of the laboratory. I would definitely only take the class if it was required or if you love taking labs, though.",
    "You will get what you put into this course. The final is also worth a ton, so make sure you are prepared for that.",
    "It is definitely one of the least painful lab courses Ive taken tus far at Yale, but it was also not very interesting. The course was structured and organized and really wasn't too bad. If you have to take it, you will definitely survive.",
    "It was an average lab. The labs were not that long and only a one page write-up. But you need to get a good TA, otherwise it will be a lot harder.",
    "Pretty interesting and enjoyable lab, unlike the Chemistry labs I've taken at Yale. Lab reports are one page long and lab notes can be written in a regular notebook. Decent class, but stressful Final exam.",
    "Pretty fun. Supplements course.",
    "A very boring class that was not particularly well taught. Take it if you have to. It will be okay",
    "I would recommend this lab for learning physics.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed Phys 165L. It was not a great amount of work and the labs were always really fun. Just make sure you really read through the labs ahead of time and you'll be fine. I also lucked out and got a really awesome TA, Savannah.",
    "It's a mandatory course, you're gonna have to take it if you're premed or taking any Physics at all. For a lab, it's not so bad, and the lab reports are pretty awesome. It's not a difficult course, but be very prepared for loss of points due to \"insight\", which no one can really define for you. Good luck!",
    "As a lab class, PHYS 165L was not bad. It can be tedious at times, but overall, the concepts were covered pretty comprehensively. The workload is decent too. Be sure to talk with your TA about the grading rubric for lab reports. Grading can be strict.",
    "This lab is hard. I would recommend it ONLY if you HAVE TO TAKE IT. Otherwise, don't touch with a ten foot pole.",
    "It's required so you have to take it for premed.",
    "You should take this along with PHYS 170.",
    "Phys 165L is a stressful, hard lab that you probably have to take if you are reading this. The work load is a lot by any standards. It is just difficult and confusing and PHYSICS. I don't recommend it, but if I went back in time, I would still take this course because I have to.",
    "Yes. Helped introduce important lab techniques.",
    "Physics 165L is a standard introductory physics lab that covers topics in data and error analysis, mechanics, radioactivity, and gases. Most of the labs require 20 to 30 minutes of reading beforehand, 2 to 3 hours at the bench, and several hours of post-lab writing. I would recommend this course to you only if you have to take it. It is not a particularly pleasant class, and doing well on lab reports can require inordinate attention to detail. If youre comfortable solving physics problems, using the LoggerPro software, and conducting experiments by yourself, you shouldnt find the practical exam too difficult. In terms of when you should take this course, Id suggest taking it the year after you complete the introductory physics sequence unless you have a strong background in physics from high school. If you have sufficient background knowledge, you should be fine taking it concurrently with an introductory mechanics course.",
    "Avoid.",
    "I think this is a great lab to take if you are Pre-med. While there are classes that go through experiments at a bit of a higher lever, I think it is worth taking this lab if you have not had a strong background in Physics and want to get the basics down. Plus, the demos are cool and the TAs\/profs are great (well, my TA wasn't the best but apparently that is an anomaly).",
    "Straightforward, basic intro physics lab. Relatively enjoyable as far as labs go, if you don't mind occasional boredom.",
    "If you need to take it for a requirement, take it. It's really basic and pretty simple.",
    "If you have to take it, take it, if not, don't. Seriously, this was, without exception, the worst 3 hours of my week.",
    "Physics lab is a prereq for a lot of different courses of study (specifically premed) so you're probably deciding between Phys 165 and the 200 level. I thought this lab was manageable and fairly enjoyable so I would recommend it.",
    "A necessary course for premeds"
