   "comments": [
    "Some of the reading assignments take a good bit of time to finish, but other than that this is a fantastic class and you will learn so much about a field so few know anything about!",
    "If you are looking for a science class where not a lot of math is done then take this class. I wouldn't necessarily say it is easier than one of the beginner chem classes, but it involves little to no math. I would recommend it because you really learn a lot about a topic not many people know about.",
    "It is an interesting class, but I wouldnot have any recommendation opinions. this is because the class is fun and informative, but I feel like I have just touched the surface of everything and not received indepth knowledge, which is slightly unnerving.",
    "It is a mind blowing class, yes I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "Astronomy 030 01 is an intriguing, discussion-based freshman seminar that touches on all domains of science related to life, its constituents and its environment on Earth and hypothetically in the Universe. I would highly recommend it to another student because it probes into a multitude of fundamental areas of science and explores the history and future of life in the universe.",
    "The work wasnt hard but there is a lot of reading and the problem sets do take time. He is a nice grader though so if you put in the effort you will do well.I absolutely loved this class. One of the best I have ever taken. Take it if you were that dreamer who stared into space and wanted to be there when you grew up but then realised physics and maths were a bitch and you gave up :)",
    "This class is a good and very brief overview of a lot of scientific disciplines. You are not expected to know anything coming into the course. Also, the search for extraterrestrial life obviously has a lot of philosophical implications, so those are interesting to discuss as well. I do indeed recommend this course to another student. It's always an interesting class, and everyone in the class generally came out laughing about the crazy and far-fetched ideas that we discussed.",
    "This course offers an interesting introduction to astrobiology, and it takes a very scientific approach to this field and to SETI research. It was definitely the most interesting class I took this semester. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend it... If you're interested in biology or astronomy, this is a really interesting class and you'll learn a lot and think about a lot of new concepts you might never have questioned before. Take it!",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. BEST CLASS EVER. BEST CLASS EVER. You'll regret it if you don't take this class. The name makes it sound like a gut course but it's not; you learn so much about the requirements for life, the universe, etc. Overall, the class is a combination of biology, astronomy, and philosophy. The material was super interesting and I literally left almost every class with my mouth gaping open because I was so in awe of the discussion we had just had. Professor Faison's enthusiasm is contagious too. I hear he's not that great in a lecture setting, but he was born to teach a seminar. There is quite a bit of reading, but a.) it's easy to read, b.) it's interesting, and c.) a lot of it is repetitive so you can skim through quite a bit of it. Overall this was the best class I've ever taken. I actually wished we would meet during reading week just so that I could listen to more of what Professor Faison had to say."
