    "if you're serious about becoming a better writer, then this is the class for you",
    "The only problems with this course are the problems with any creative writing workshop: other students skim a story right before class, and so their feedback is not entirely useful\/thoughtful. But again: this isn't Susan Choi's fault at all. She's really smart and articulate and engaging! The other students were mostly excellent writers!",
    "Pretty standard advanced fiction workshop -- very little reading aside from your peers' work, lots of feedback from Professor Choi (who's wonderful!) and your peers. Definitely worth it if you're serious about producing\/cleaning up your short stories and practicing the traditional \"workshop\" experience.",
    "This was a fantastic course. I loved the feedback I was able to get on my writing and it was great to participate in a workshop environment with some really talented people. I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in honing their fiction writing skills.",
    "DefinitelyI always looked forward to going to this class.",
    "You write two stories and then revise one, in addition to keeping a daily notebook of 100 words (unread, but Professor Choi checks that you send it in). You're graded on the feedback you give others and on participation, not on the success of your stories, so it's a great class to take if you want to experiment. That said, you can also take it if you have more finished work you'd like to polish. Make sure you have a good class. Ours was mixed in the quality of writers and in how committed everyone was. As for Professor Choi, she is brilliant, encouraging, and a smart critic. I do wish she were a little more critical at times, but overall, she was really wonderful."
