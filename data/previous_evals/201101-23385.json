   "comments": [
    "A basic ecology class could have been made a prerequisite. Landscape ecology was not adequate.",
    "This course taught me more than any other single course that I have taken at FES. Yes, it is fast-paced. Yes, it is hard. But this is a master's program; more classes should be this challenging.",
    "This was a very intense, fast-paced course, but I learned an immense amount and the instructor was great.",
    "The course structure could have been used in a way to better facilitate learning. The homework assignments were good, but the lab sections were not used effectively. It would have been helpful to have weekly lab exercises that were done during the lab sessions. This could have done a lot for improving R coding skills and exposing students to different models\/techniques\/etc. There could have also been a couple of lab sessions that were exclusively dedicated to building foundational math skills, such as basics of linear algebra and differential equations.",
    "1)R book helpful, Schmitz book helpful, Loreau less so. What the course needed was an even more basic ecology text to promote modelling. I ended up consulting gotelli's intro to ecology text which I had used for a previous course quite a lot on the basics which are difficult to trace from lectures.9)The take home labs were really helpful. The lab time was a bit more awkward. Maybe so more working through basics together or allowing us to start work of the lab and then ask questions as they arose would have made it more helpful. Often Dr. Schmitz seemed frustrated that we didn't have more questions, but they were more likely to come after we started work on the problem set. The modelling project workshop days were helpful more when Dr. Schmitz allowed individual students to approach with questions rather then want students to inquire in front of the entire class.",
    "Why are they rating questions? Why cannot I just enter text, properly explaining my complex feelings regarding the course?",
    "a tendency for a \"come'on guys, this isn't rocket science\" attitude, even though many concepts were very advanced for those in the class.difficult to reconcile the complexity of the math at times with expectations of only a bit of experience with calculus",
    "This class touched on most of the areas that I felt I was deficient in ecology. Every lecture was intriguing and the assignments were challenging. For me, this was the most useful class I could have hoped to take in graduate school."

   "comments": [
    "I learned entirely new material at a level of mastery that I can be proud of. I now have a much greater understanding of scientific literature and I can understand significantly more of the published research.",
    "The instructor was great and I found the material very interesting.",
    "The material was fantastic. It was a rigorous and accessible introduction to ecological modeling, which I have been looking for. The topics covered in the course were also cutting edge.",
    "It presented a new way of viewing and analyzing the ecosystems we look at",
    "The final project",
    "-The modeling applications that Os discussed to apply the concepts to reality-The labwork",
    "Applicable to real life understanding of system function through combination of theoretcal concepts and emperical examples",
    "The material",
    "Readings, lectures, and assignments. The best part of the class was the overall understanding of food web dynamics you walk away with.",
    "It really challenged me to seek out my own answers and be a better student. I feel that I learned a lot, even though there was a lot of material that was completely over my head.",
    "Really learning to grapple with equations and population ecology concepts. I finally understand how modeling works. Final project was a great way to apply things.",
    "This course helped me feeling comfortable looking at equations in scientific papers, which is something that has been a real challenge. It was great to have a serious ecology course that challenged a lot of my assumptions.",
    "Extremely useful for learning history, theory, and math.",
    "Historical focus really got me to understand the origins of the field. That was fascinating. Also being able to look at theoretical papers and have some idea of what was going one was very rewarding.",
    "Dr Schmitz\u0092s availability, willingness to help, and dedication to the topic. The emphasis on theoretical understanding and critical analysis of the theory rather than just memorization.Any given explanation of a concept was well detailed and easily comprehensible.The weekly problem sets and the final modeling project were extremely helpful and appropriate tests of knowledge.",
    "the subject materialan inspired teacher",
    "The focus on critical reading of scientific literature. Also, the fact that I am now able to understand how dynamic systems models are constructed is a huge plus.",
    "The professor was very candid, and so presented the material in an interesting way. We learned hands on how to do some of the programming, so the course went beyond just learning the theory. This was very helpful."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Having three big assignments at the end of the class (final, take-home final and HUGE modeling project) was a bit rough. Spacing them out a bit might be better.",
    "Better use of lab time.",
    "the distance between theory and application was too great. I was unable to take the lesons and directly apply them to something I can see in nature. This may be because there were far more conversations about calculations that actual ecosystems",
    "Trying to understand stability analyses",
    "-The point of the course at which we develop our own modeling skills and apply and synthesize the modeling techniques we've learned. I still don't feel that I understand the full range of modeling techniques, nor do I grasp how they build on one another. The lecture that was supposed to show us how to think through building our own model was too conceptual - would have been more constructive to work through several scenarios together and brainstorm what terms to put together to form a model for the system.-The section on metapopulations didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the class, which focused on predator-prey dynamics. Better integration necessary, or skip it.-Would be helpful to wait another week or two before introducing the final project, since it wasn't yet clear what kind of a question or system we could build a model for.-Move Lab Assignment #6 earlier in the semester. I learned the most from this lab because it forced me to look for what was wrong in given equations and also build my own model. Would have been more helpful 1-2 weeks earlier to help me understand how to start on my own final project model.",
    "I believe a TA would be helpful in this course. Additional either lab or special sessions to work through R syntax would be helpful- escpcially for people who have had no computer programming experience.",
    "The amount of work and expectations for this course were unreasonable.More explicit emphasis on conservation implications.Handouts with the formulas would be helpful - having a foundational resource would allow us to engage more in the discussion and less on trying to discern and write down all the parameters on the board.More in-class group activities and case-study examples (the ones we had were great).",
    "Lectures could be better organized or outlined to provide better coherence. A key concepts handout\/reading at the beginning of the class would help get the class up to speed earlier in the course.",
    "The pace and the clarity of information provided. Often the professor contradicted himself and that made things confusing. I would have especially liked a greater amount of work with defining parts of the equations at the beginning of the semester. A simple workshop or even a printed worksheet would have saved me a lot of struggling with the concepts and freed my mind to focus on larger applications and concepts. Also, I feel that at least one lab period should have been spent doing a group walk through of the R software and language. If we had all sat down and been given a tutorial with our lap tops in front of us, I might have gained a quicker insight to R that again would have saved me headaches and allowed me to focus on learning other things.",
    "Problem sets are too time intensive for a 3-credit course. Made it so we didn't have much time to do the reading. More thoughts about how wildlife managers can actually apply knowledge that is already available-- rather than just discussions of how hard things are and what the limitations are-- would be nice. (If any constructive advice actually exists.)",
    "More written materials that clearly and simply explain the fundamental concepts. There is often confusion among variables (P could be plant, prey, predator) so that would be a really helpful supplement to the notes. I think an early quiz that would force students to memorize some of the basics of the equations would be good.",
    "Could have used a higher volume of practice problems.",
    "Dr. Schmitiz is great one on one and really encouraging. In front of a class, however, he seems a little less sure of himself and perhaps as a result gets what appears to be frustrated (long sighs etc.) at student's questions. This perpetuates an atmosphere where many do not feel comfortable asking questions, which then frustrates Dr. Schmitz because he wants people to ask questions particulary during the lab time. Bad cycle.Otherwise course was great. Lots of work, but I think it was worth it.",
    "Less reading or perhaps fewer assignments so as to be able to really learn those we choose to focus on. Better integration of outside class work with lecture material.Lab time could have been used more efficiently than just reviewing past problem sets and fielding individual questions. Running model simulations or learning specific R script throughout the term would have been better.The papers seemed too formulaic to be truly educational and the knowledge I gained from them would probably have been better accessed via testing.Because discussion so frequently oscillated between present theory and historical development it was hard to place things in context. Because so few of the issues have been satisfyingly resolved it was easy to grow confused over whether the debate and associated concerns over a specific issue dated to 30 years ago or were contemporary. Either a completely temporally driven syllabus or a completely topic based one, rather than an oscillation between the two, would have been helpful.",
    "I'm not sure how this would be possible, but I didn't feel like I had all the tools to even conceive of a final project idea until after we had done all of the assignments. The last one in particular helped me put everything together in my head. I don't think that we could have sped up the pace of the course, but the lab days that we had to work on our final projects might have been more useful to me later in the semester.",
    "It would be very helpful to have better supporting material ie power point slides from lectures that could be made available to the students for study. The course started out a bit too fast, it would have been helpful to have a bit more explanation of the opening mathematical concepts."

I know the he is a busy man but we are also busy students and could use all the help we can get especially with the challenging homework material that he assigns!Perhaps the homeworks could have been made during the lecture after a class period so that lecture time could be used more efficiently to ask questions about homeworks that we have had time to work on rather than turning assignments in and then being assigned a new homework and then having time to ask questions all in the same lab period.",
