    "Yes take this for your elective! No psets or exams, just weekly discussion sections and a final presentation and paper, so pretty chill. It helped me a lot with reading papers, and I definitely learned a lot. I now feel much more confident reading scientific papers. The timing on Thursday nights is not great, but we did get ice cream and pizza for our last class.",
    "YES! Amazing class. Best I've taken in MB&B by far. We basically were responsible for reading 2 biochemistry papers (went through all the classical ones, like Meselson & Stahl) each week. On Tuesday nights, we met as a class (without professors) to discuss the papers, and on Thursday nights, the professors were present. The Tuesday sections were pretty informal, but the Thursday sections could get intense sometimes-- so it's definitely in your best interest to come prepared, and read the papers thoroughly. It's almost like getting orally quizzed at first, but you really do get used to it-- and later in the semester, it becomes more of a discussion (provided you adequately participate). 50% participation, 25% project presentation, 25% final project paper. The final project wasn't too bad; it involved a 10 minute presentation and an 8-page (double-spaced) paper outlining one of your proposed follow-up experiments to one of the papers we had read during the semester (you get to choose, so you have a lot of flexibility). It was an extremely rewarding class, as learning how to *really* read an academic paper, and especially difficult biochemistry papers, is not a trivial skill. It also gave me an appreciation for the history biochemistry, as we read papers as old as the ~1930s. In short... definitely take it! Extremely chill and definitely the best upper-level MB&B elective option.",
    "Worthwhile in ways. Not much work largely bc it's two papers a week and personal motivation to read them wanes. Valuable experience to discuss important papers with senior scientists.",
    "Take this class as a decent 4.5th credit. Fourth credit if you're a junior and have gotten in, and 5th credit if you're a senior. The research report will nip you in the bud if you don't start early enough, so start early!",
    "Yes; provides the chance to understand how research styled thinking works, as well as the practical limitations of certain molecular biology techniques.",
    "It's a good upper level MBB seminar especially if you're looking to learn to how read scientific papers. The papers are mostly old papers that are the foundation of modern biochemistry, though I wish the class covered modern papers since the field has changed greatly since the 60's. Workload isn't intense with 2 papers to read per week. The final paper is interesting since you get to propose a follow-up experiment to one of the papers."
