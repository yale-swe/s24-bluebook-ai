    "This class is an enlightening course on drugs and the brain. Just take this class regardless of if you need a science credit or not!!!! I am not a science person and I found this class amazing and would totally take it if I hadn't needed a science credit. Professor Kober is amazing, best science professor at Yale I can say without a doubt and her class will change the way you look at drugs, society, and people who take drugs. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!! YOUR GOING TO LOVE ITT!!!!!!!!",
    "I probably would only recommend this course to someone who is interested in the science-y aspects of psychology. I would not recommend it to someone who is just interested in learning about drugs, because the majority of the work and the tests are actually about neurons, chemical interactions, etc. It's an interesting class, but it is in no way easy.",
    "Excellent class. Loved the material, loved the professor. Absolutely take this class if you can. Hedy Kober is awesome--great lecturer. Very fair grading--two midterms, final, paper, in class reading quizzes. One of my favorite classes at Yale and one of my favorite professors.",
    "This class is HARD and AWESOME. The readings are easy, but there is an INSANE amount of content covered in each lecture. If you are not good at memorizing then this is not the course for you. Exams were very challenging even though I studied for them for over 12 hours each. If you have a science background you may find the course easier than I did.Still, it's a great course to take. Professor Kober is super young and cool, and you learn so much from her course. If you want to know more about what exactly drugs do to your body, and what the health and socio-political implications of drugs are, then this course is great for you. It combines science with psychology with health with cultural studies with politics, and the outcome is extremely rewarding. I feel like I'm a drug expert, and I have a deep understanding of the problems this country faces with respect to the war on drugs and current government drug policies.",
    "Would have been better to more systematically cover the topics; guest lecturers made this difficult. I felt we spent too much time on political and social topics and would have preferred to spend more time on the science.Still, a science class for non-science majors. I preferred Intro to Human Neuroscience with Thomas Brown--maybe more dry but more straightforward in terms of presenting the material and then testing you on it.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "This class is very neuroscience heavy. You mostly focus on how drugs pharmacologically work, and don't really get into the social issues very much. The class is pretty disorganized, but the lectures are interesting. Professor Kober is entertaining and helpful. The tests are pretty difficult because she expects you to know the names of specific enzymes and how certain drugs affect action potentials, etc. Don't take it if you aren't a science person. That being said, it is an interesting, not totally useless science credit.",
    "Interesting subject and interesting class. Can be overly sciencey\/technical at times but it is a Sc credit. If you can, I would take it Cr\/D as you'll probably enjoy it more and you won't have to memorize every detail as the tests can be nitpicky.I did learn a lot of cool stuff and Dr. Kober knows a ton about the material and cares about teaching (as do the TAs).Definitely a solid class if you're interested in drugs and not a bad way to pick up a science credit if you need one.",
    "This course teaches you about all the drugs you consume, have thought about consuming, or have heard about others consuming. It should be a required course for all students of Yale College. Dr. Kober is a fantastic lecturer with a great sense of humor and an engaging style, and her lectures are some of the most interesting and relevant I have encountered. I would absolutely recommend this course to any person. Whether your experience with drugs is limited to coffee and alcohol or encompasses more experimentation with drugs, this course will teach you about the important psychological and physiological effects that drugs can exert on you and will make you a more informed and self-aware person with the power to make choices based on this important body of knowledge.",
    "Yes! Great class definitely take it if you're interested in learning the truth about lots of drugs - what they actually do to your brain\/body, their benefits, their risks, etc. I loved going to lecture. The neuroscience is in depth enough to feel like you understand what's going on but not so much that it would be incomprehensible to a non-neuo\/psych person.",
    "This course was really great. The neuroscience was challenging, but Professor Kober organized the material in a logical and straightforward manner. Professor Kober did not ignore the fact that drugs are an interesting and popular topic and did not hesitate to show enjoyable video clips to the class that helped the students remember the information. Honestly, the hallmark of a good class is one that can balance difficult material with enjoyable moments like the video clips.",
    "Great class. The tests only covered the mechanisms of action, and completely ignored most of the material, so just study that for the tests.",
    "Best class. Take it. The material is relevant to anyone's life and is important to get an unbiased take on.",
    "good class, take it.",
    "Take it.",
    "Its a great class to get introduced to drugs and drug action. After taking Neuroscience, it was also nice to go over relevant structures and mechanisms in the brain.",
    "Psychology 161 is a very interesting class on how drugs affect the brain -- you dive in depth into how action potentials and neurotransmitters work. As a psychology major, I highly recommend this class.",
    "An interesting class covering a wide range of drugs. If you haven't taken neuroscience, this will be a little bit tougher for you to pick up. Workload is average though, and testing is pretty fair. You could do a lot worse with a Science credit.",
    "Pretty good class. I learned a lot, and for a science credit it was almost enjoyable. Three tests and a short paper, but aside from that not too much work, and I found the tests to all be pretty fair. I would definitely recommend it, both to psych majors and others who are interested in neuroscience and psychopharmacology, and to those who are looking for an interesting and not too difficult science class.",
    "YES I would, it's a great class, good science credit. Not exactly easy (there are three tests that you really have to study for), but the material is enjoyable enough.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "Yes, I recommend it if you actually want to learn about drugs and how they affect the body. there is a lot of reading that you will be tested on. Would have been difficult if I did not put in the time needed to truly learn the material in depth.",
    "take this class! you learn so much about things that are relevant",
    "I wouldnt recommend it if you re not a Psych major. For non-science majors, it is simply too difficult and there was too much material to learn in such a short period of time. You fall behind very quickly and the tests are mainly multiple choice, but very tricky.",
    "Much more science-y than I expected and definitely not an easy Sc credit. Tests were pretty tough but the paper at the end is easy. Dreaded going to class often but learned some interesting things about different drugs. Pf Kober uses some funny videos and is really excited about the material if you're into science and drugs.",
    "YES YESYYESYEYSYEYESYESYSEYSY. Unless you hate classes with little work and interesting material and an awesome professor.",
    "Take it! So interesting.",
    "Take it, as a college student, it's a lot of stuff you'll want to know.",
    "I would say it's a lot of basic stuff that everyone shoudl know about drugs and how our body works with drugs. loved it.",
    "I would recommend this class for an interesting yet tough science credit. You have to remember alot of details. Three tests and a short paper. The random pop quizzes were a bit annoying. Prof was great though.",
    "Take it. It's a good way to get a science credit that's actually a good class, and the material is relevant\/interesting to pretty much anyone.",
    "Awesome class. 2 mid-terms. 1 final. 1 really chill paper. A couple quizzes. It was really fair and really enjoyable and I learned a lot. I would absolutely recommend this.",
    "Interesting course material, as it really opens up your eyes to the reality and science of drugs. Tests were very nit-picky on minute details that appeared in one corner of one slide, so that was frustrating and unreasonable. But that was because she was trying to arbitrarily make the tests harder.",
    "It's a cool class that covers how drugs work. If that sounds interesting to you at all, I recommend you take the course. Even if it doesn't, I think it's important for people to understand (so you should take the course anyway).",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 161 to other students. The class is interesting, and gives you a solid background in what drugs actually do to your body. The lectures are engaging and the workload isn't too difficult. As a biology major, it was a bit basic at times, but the coolness factor made up for that.",
    "Yes! Take this course, if you need a science credit or ifyou want to take a cool interesting course. A nice introduction to neuroscience if you're thinking about it.",
    "PSYC 161 takes a comprehensive look at the history and neuroscience of psychoactive drugs - everything from caffeine to heroin - offering students an academic grounding in both the scientific and legal stances on the subject. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student, science or non-science major, although I would emphasize that this course is not to be taken in a semester with an otherwise overly heavy course load, because the \"intended for non-science majors\" disclaimer belies the large amount of work involved.",
    "Absolutely excellent. One of the best classes I have taken in my three years at Yale. (I am not a science or psych major.) Well-organized lectures, material was thorough, learned so much about all kinds of legal and illegal drugs. Every individual in America should take a class like this!!",
    "Great class to learn about drugs and a solid science credit. The science is basic cell biology.",
    "Good class for non-science majors as there are many different assignments, therefore many different opportunities to do relatively well in the class. Also, interesting material for people our age.",
    "Yes, if you have a background with psych science. Otherwise, get ready for information to be thrown at you in a barely manageable pace.",
    "It's a good overview of many legal and illegal drugs and how they cause effects on the body. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "The class teaches you about how drugs work and the legal aspects surrounding it. You learn a lot about how stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens and other drugs affect the brain and how they influence behavior.",
    "Like I said above, everyone should take this class.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you're a psych major who is at all interested in neuroscience. For those not interested in neuroscience, be warned - the class can get pretty technical at times, though at other times it's a lot less so. It's extremely relevant, interesting information for anyone and I came away feeling like I had learned a TON and now feel a lot safer and more informed when consuming any type of drug. Hedy Kober is great - she's really excited about this topic and her enthusiasm is contagious. Lectures move fast and the exams are really hard so make sure you keep up and study in advance.",
    "Remember, this class is a science credit. I felt a lot of students thought they would just be learning fluff material about drugs. In this class you will learn about how drugs affect the brain and body as well as how the body affects the drug. Therefore, there was a significant amount of neuroscience involved in the class. I would highly recommend the class if that is the kind of information you wish to learn.",
    "The course blurs the distinction between pharmaceutical drugs and street drugs, by emphasizing how these have similar effects (i.e. harm and benefits) on the human body. You learn to unlearn prejudices about social norms. There's a focus on the role of policymaking as well.",
    "Take it.",
    "An overview of various types of drugs, and the biological and psychological effects they have. I would recommend this class to students interested in the subject.",
    "Great overview of legal and illegal drugs, and how they affect the brain. The information is really practical and I now find that I can intelligently read a lot of articles in the news about drugs and addiction. A lot of the information, especially regarding caffeine and alcohol, is really relatable to college students. The science was challenging but worthwhile, and it makes a lot of sense once you put in the effort to understand it. The course overall was pretty liberal in terms of drugs but I think it presented a far more balanced view that what you'd get from the media or from high school. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in this subject.",
    "Great class, interesting",
    "I would recommend it if you are willing to teach yourself most of the material. Because of the format and speed of the lecture, I doubt any student would be able to glean enough from just the lectures and doing the readings without outlining or taking reading notes to get an A.",
    "Absolutely, was a great and interesting course.",
    "Take it!",
    "This was an interesting class with lots of material that is applicable to everyday life. I know some people who were hesitant to take it because they expected a \"DRUGS ARE BAD\" sort of agenda, but I was impressed by the even-handed approach and honest exploration of the problems and benefits of drugs. Professor Kober is an enthusiastic lecturer, and on the whole, I enjoyed the course. That said, even with some neuroscience background, the exams were hard to study for and surprisingly tricky, and the scheduling of the exams and assignments was just bizarre (a midterm two weeks before the final?). But my impression was that this was the first time the course had been offered, so hopefully some of those kinks will be worked out by the time it gets taught again.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, this class is an interesting and useful place to start. Stick with it throughout the first few sessions if you really want to get in--don't give up! Most people end up not getting in simply because they stop showing up. Know that it's NOT a gut class though. Having some background in neuro-bio is helpful, especially in the first half of the class, but it levels out somewhere around the middle. Hedy is a great lecturer, but the speed takes a little while to get used to. Don't try to take notes on everything, since the big things are on the slides anyway. Most of all, have fun! Who wouldn't wanna learn about alcohol and weed in one class for a science credit?",
    "Yes. This is a great lecture course. You'll learn interesting and practical things about drugs.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "YES! If you've taken a neuro class before this class will be a breeze. If not, still take it! Learn neuro! and Drugs!",
    "DB&B is a really interesting class for non-science majors. The lectures can be a bit long at times but the material is really great and you actually feel like you learned something useful.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. Hedy is a great lecturer who clearly knows a lot about the subject, and the material is interesting and generally pretty relevant to the life of a college student.",
    "On the whole, this class was really interesting and I would recommend it. I think it's really valuable to understand the science behind how different drugs affect the body, and Professor Kober is an engaging lecturer who keeps things interesting. Be warned that she talks extremely fast, but luckily nearly all the information you need is in her powerpoints, so I didn't take notes in class and just listened and reviewed the powerpoints later for tests. The first half of the class is also drastically different from the second half. The first half focuses entirely on how cells work, and the information comes so quickly that it's really overwhelming if you're like me and haven't had AP Bio or some other kind of science background. The second half is all about individual drugs. Since this was the first year of the class I hope this will be ironed out for next year, but the majority of the class did so well on the first exam that Professor Kober made the second exam MUCH harder, so much so that the average score dropped from an 88 to a 78. There is very little work for the class during the semester besides some reading and a few small quizzes, but the tests are very hard and require a lot of time studying for them and memorizing small discrepancies in how drugs affect the brain and body. The final paper was easy, a 3-5 page letter to a senator about why a particular drug should be legalized or delegalized. If the TAs are the same, know that Emily is really nice and gives great review sessions, Rob is pretty chill, but Amber is not friendly at all. Amber and Rob bicker constantly when they give review sessions together. However, the TAs don't take part in class very much beyond each giving a lecture, having office hours, and hosting review sessions, so it doesn't matter very much.",
    "This class is an interesting, low-stress way to learn about drugs and how they affect the body and society. Prof. Kober was great and the exams, while comprehensive, were very fair. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in the neurological mechanisms of drug action explained in a way that anyone can understand."
