    "I would describe the class as a journey through the various pieces of art that came out of the period between 1961 and 1971 that is commonly known as the Black Arts Movement. And I would absolutely recommend the class to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course. The professor is excellent and the reading material is interesting.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. Professor Avilez is incredibly kind and highly approachable. The workload is fairly light, and the material is so interesting that it really doesn't feel like work at all. I Definitely take it! Hands-down favorite.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Professor Avilez was my favorite teacher this semester. He is energetic, excited, young, smart, engaging, willing to listen but discuss with you on a peer level, great at providing feedback and helping you grow, and generally has absolutely everything you could ever possibly hope for in a professor. He selects great readings, and at least this semester we had a great group of students that really clicked. Take it. Do it. Now.",
    "This class will open your eyes to a side of American history that you didn't learn in high school. Is there work? Yes, but you should find it interesting and therefore fun to get through the three essays, a creative project, and a final paper. By far my favorite class of first semester. If you're interested at all, take the class. You'll be surprised how much fun you'll have.",
    "This class is really great in establishing a history in Black arts and Black culture. BAM explained a lot to me about the arts industry in Black culture today. I learned a lot about the reasons why Black artistic expression and Black identity and Black culture developed the way it has today. I learned more about myself in relation to Black culture and why society, especially Black society, views Blacks in certain ways. Overall I was able to learn about much more than the Black Arts Movement, I also learned about the Black community and culture as a whole. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially one who is unfamiliar with Af Am studies or Black arts. Everyone should take this class because we talk honestly and openly about cultural issues and modes of artistic expression in Black society. We talk about things I haven't talked about with anyone else outside the classroom, and we learn the background and history to talk about it intelligently and respectfully. This is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, so I would recommend it to everyone."
