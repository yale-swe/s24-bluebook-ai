    "Q: 7, 8& 9: The Harvard trip was a bit of a let down. It was too far to mainly just look at the dioramas. I would rather have taken a trip locally and viewed\/identified stand development. The other field trips were excellent.",
    "The lectures and readings only covered a limited range of knowledge about the subject material. Although we repeatedly acknowledged that several of the concepts were antiquated, we continued to base the course upon them. Readings were too general.",
    "The field trips were great except for the Harvard forest one. It was more focused on taxonomy and it was a long drive for very little field interaction and very little learning.I think the content of the course was really important. I felt like a had a good handle on it by the end due to strong instruction and a solid TA. However, making more of a connection betweenthe reading and the lecture is really important. Some of the reading was a bit denseit would have beengood to get more ofa guide through it in addition to discussion time. Also, I think that certain parts of the OliverLarson could be required justto have more material tosupport slides.Was sorry to miss the student presentations.Other than that Anne is a delight!",
    "Q11: Ann responds to student questions, but at time is very derisive of student questions\/comments, I think without realizing it. This undercuts rapport with students, and shuts down some students' willingness to participate in class, for fear of being wrong and vehemently told so.Q12: Test questions and test post-mortem process are quite problematic; mid-term should be as diverse as the final in question type (mult. choice, T\/F, matching, fill-in-blank), and questions shouldn't be designed to trick students but rather straightforwardly test material and concepts to be mastered. Develop new questions so students can learn from the kind of complicated questions Ann poses, in studying for the final. In other classes professors hand back the printout exams with the questions right there, and seem to have no concerns with cheating; on the contrary, this helps students feel much more confident for subsequent exams and suggests that the professor is not trying to trick them."

    "The field trip to the Harvard Forest was quite a letdown and I don't think it should be renewed next year; it just takes too much time for too small an amount of added educational value.On a more constructive note, I would love to see some homework added to the class. Small, applied weekly problem sets would be very helpful.",
    "Ann struggled to explain things sometimes. She couldn't re-word in order to try to get her point across--we were expected to get inside her brain which is not practical. She had expectations for us that were not expressed until taking the midterm.",
    "I would have liked to do a bit more in the field looking at stands and attempting to discern what was happening. Maybe like a quiz or no points quiz or something where we all write down what we think is happening and try to identify different strata, and dominant\/codominant\/intermediate\/suppressed trees and say what is most likely outcompeting what. Also would be nice to look at this along different site gradients too.",

    "connecting reading to lecture",

    "I found the readings very useful but I feel like more structured discussions would have reinforced the content. Perhaps a short intro section (~10min) to give historical and academic context to the assigned readings would have been a useful way to start and frame the discussions.",
    "Principally, the candor of the class environment: avoiding derisive responses to student comments so that students continue to feel comfortable participating.Mechanisms to encourage discussion participation even from quiet students (such as splitting class into small-group discussions, in-class small-group problem sets based on contents of readings, student-leader assignment for discussions, etc.)Fairer test questions and scoring: exhorts brief answers to test questions, but knocks points off a good answer for forgetting obscure details."

    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Marlyse was a great contributor to the course due to the relevance of her research to some of the topics and her existing supplementary knowledge of understory plants. She was very good at noticing students' sticking points and offering clarifications in class or in review sessions. A minor point of constructive feedback is that during the understory plant lecture she seemed to stick a little too much to the slides and could have perhaps engaged with the class a bit more.",
    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Marlyse contributed a lot to class, helping clarify many points and bringing her own expertise. She was organized and helpful, but sometimes didn't know herself what Ann was looking for in, for example, review questions, test questions, etc. This does not suggest a lack of knowledge or professionalism on Marlyse's part, but rather indicates a need for better TA-prof communication and collaboration."
