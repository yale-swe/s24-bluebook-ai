    "Wonderful. A true gem of the Yale Art History department. Zeidler is an incredible lecturer - he will make you see paintings in an entirely new light. As a senior art history major, I absolutely cannot recommend this course enough! Just take it - you will not regret it.",
    "Definitely recommend it! One of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale and very different from the other disciplines I've engaged with. Prof Zeidler is engaging and reveals amazing features of paintings in each lecture, and there isn't too much work. Gallery visits are also fun.",
    "YES. you don't even need to have taken a history of art before. one of my favorite classes at Yale. mind fuck every class.",
    "Picasso and Matisse is a wonderful course if you're looking to spend a lot of time with two artists (really oneMatisse only gets covered in a few lectures at the end of the semester). Zeidler is a fantastic lecturer, and his unique readings of the works we studied couldn't have been learned from a textbook. Highly recommend.",
    "This is an amazing class, regardless of whether you are an art history major or if you've never taken an art history class before. A bit of knowledge of art history in general would be helpful but not really necessary. It's not too much work since the class is only midterm, final, 10 pg paper, and in order to do well, you just need to show up to lecture and pay attention. The paper was extremely rewarding!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in Picasso or Matisse. It was an in depth look at both of their works.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS.",
    "Don't take it unless you're sure you like Zeidler's particular brand of art history (very formal, focusing on specific artworks to the point of exhaustion, etc.) and lecturing. Especially non-majors! He definitely knows his stuff, and it's interesting even if you don't like Picasso or Matisse personally.",
    "Yes take it, it is fun and cool. You always hear about Picasso and Matisse but don't really know and after this class, you'll really know.",
    "A fascinating course, I couldn't recommend it enough. Very Picasso heavy, but if you like Picasso and Matisse, take it! Take it even if you haven't done history of art before!",
    "This is an intermediate level art history class that would be a little challenging for people with no previous experience in art",
    "Extremely interesting, very manageable workload",
    "I would highly recommend, it is a great class for non art history majors like myself who want an easy yet incredibly interesting and rewarding class",
    "Would recommend",
    "I would very much recommend HSAR 329 to another student. Regardless of year, major, or previous background in the subject, HSAR 329 is one of few classes at Yale that everyone can enjoy, or at least learn something from. It is chock filled with interesting information, paintings, and humor (courtesy of Professor Zeidler). The class is a gem at Yale and is one that I will recommend to future Yalies for years to come.",
    "I would say HSAR 329 01 is a great class to take if you want a more focused lesson in art history. The class was great.",
    "Really great introduction to two prominent artists that also goes enough in depth to feel really satisfying. I feel like I learned a lot but it wasn't too much work either.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "This is an amazing class- I would COMPLETELY recommend it. Though most in the class were upperclassmen, I took it as a freshman and absolutely loved it. It's a little scary that it's only based on a midterm, paper and final, but everything was completely reasonable. You have total freedom with the paper-- as long as it's on some aspect of Picasso's art-- and the midterm and final were generally completely as expected, and not designed to trick students. Each lecture was fascinating, and quite meta. It's very out there and a bit untraditional. Much more Picasso than Matisse, but what little is discussed of Matisse's art is extremely interesting.",
    "I was just looking for a Humanities credit that wouldn't be too much work or writing, since the rest of my classes combined made for a really heavy workload. I got an amazing class that made me like a subject I knew almost nothing about. If you're looking for that credit, please do yourself a favor and take this class. Zeidler is an amazing professor, though a bit unhelpful if you email him directly (ask your TA instead), and class was like 50 mins of story time two times a week. Section is not bad at all considering there isn't much class time required, and besides two exams and a final paper there is no work aside from readings that you could very well skim. I am nowhere near being a humanities major, and this was one of my favorite classes this semester and probably ever.",
    "Take it!",
    "Amazing class!!!! You learn about Picasso and Matisse, but you also learn about the language of art history and the context and history of the art works. Incredible lecture class.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Great course for students majoring in art history and also those who have never taken an art history course before. It is a fascinating experience and different than most courses out there.",
    "This is a good art history class, and accessible for non majors.",
    "Really fantastic course. Zeidler's lectures are really incisive and pretty hilarious at times. Absolutely no pre-requisites necessary. (This was my first HSAR course.) The course focuses pretty heavily on \"formal\" description of the works -- i.e. granual analysis of the actual paintings and how they work, aesthetically. Course does a great job of teaching you how to \"read\" a painting like you would read a book. Not too much work, also. Readings are interesting but not really required. There's a midterm, a final paper, and a final exam. Midterm and final exam = slide IDs and short interpretations, and a few essays. 10 pg final paper is whatever you want it to be -- it can be a lot of fun! I absolutely recommend the course. Shop it and you'll get a sense of Zeidler's style. He's very likable!",
    "yes, just did",
    "TAKE IT!! You will learn so much about viewing art. This class gives you a different perspective.",
    "Really incredible class worth taking. The material is fascinating and Prof. Zeidler's lectures are never boring. You'll learn a lot about two of the most important 20th century painters as well as art history in general. The work is also very manageable as well as enjoyable.",
    "Great credit\/d",
    "Absolutely. Again, be aware that it is at 4:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays; but if you just remind yourself each time how cool the stuff you're going to look at and talk about is, you'll enjoy.",
    "You learn how to analyze a visual language.",
    "Absolutely. The lectures were amazing, the works beautiful, and the class accessible and challenging.",
    "While I was a little weary at first because this was only my second art history course and the focus was so specific on just two artists, my worries quickly disappeared. Professor Zeidler says this in the syllabus and holds true to his word a larger history of modern art very much does come into focus through this course. Yes, you walk away with amazing knowledge of two of the most prominent artists of the twentieth century but, more than that, this forces you to think about modern art in a totally new and critical way.",
    "When I took Timothy Barringer's intro survey course, I loved the old masters but disliked everything after the turn of the 20th century. I didn't think I would ever enjoy a class called \"Picasso and Matisse\". I decided to shop the class on a whim though, and Prof. Ziedler impressed me with his sharp analysis, engaging teaching, and dry sense of humor straight off the bat. He hooked me around the third lecture, when he looked at old masters like Vermeer and Velazquez, and somehow connected elements of their paintings to Picasso many centuries later. The workload for this class is also really manageable - just a midterm, a final, and a 10-page paper on anything Picasso-related. The hardest thing about this course was its 4:30-5:20pm timeslot! I accidentally dozed off a couple of times, not out of lack of interest (Prof. Ziedler and his lectures are FANTASTIC!) but simply out of the slumber-inducing qualities of the post-lunch, pre-dinner, mid-afternoon period. One thing I do wish was for sections to include more YUAG gallery visits. We only had one visit the entire semester, and I would have loved to engage more with the substantial collection in there.",
    "This is a great art history course for learning about Matisse and Picasso. Lectures are full of close-analysis, as we talk about paintings in great depth. Professor Zeidler has very interesting insights and observations, which you may not always agree with, but will surely get you thinking about how to read an artwork. Close-analysis can seem a bit dry and sometimes too disconnected from social-political realities of the time, and we do not really discuss feminist or racial critiques of these artworks. It's a great course to credit\/d\/fail, as it's just a midterm, final, and 10 page paper, and there is not a lot of assigned reading. The exams are quite straightforward. They involve some memorization, and are very doable if you pay attention during lecture.",
    "I definitely recommend Picasso and Matisse! Professor Zeidler is engaging, passionate, and clever and the lecture pack a lot of interesting insights into their short fifty minute time. In section we went to the art gallery and studied works of art by Picasso and Matisse in person. The exams were actually my favorite part. They went by quickly, I learned a lot while taking them, and actually enjoyed myself during them. I took the class credit\/d and found it to be a great choice.",
    "Vast, sweeping classes that promise to tell you everything you need to know about the history of art are great, but overrated, and often leave you with nothing but vague knowledge of the names and dates you memorized on your notecards. Picasso & Matisse is the opposite of those classes--deep and exploratory. Prof. Zeidler, who is brilliant and full of insights into these artists' works, has time to linger on individual paintings. (Sometimes a lecture is devoted to just one or two paintings, which feels such a luxury!) Taking such a close look at individual works naturally enables much deeper discourse, which means big ideas often branch out from single paintings, so you'll suddenly be comparing a Matisse to a piece of Renaissance art, or figuring out where a Picasso painting fits into a certain political moment. In other words, don't worry that you'll be boxed in or limited or bored by the relatively small (but not actually small at all) scope of the course. Thsi is really the art history class you should take, even if you're new to the field. Because you get so deep into individual works, there are more opportunities to make interesting connections and discover avenues for writing, research, etc., which isn't really possible in a class that glosses over hundreds of years. Also, Picasso and Matisse are both fascinating figures with incredibly diverse bodies of work, and you'll be glad to come away knowing about more than just Guernica! (No shade to survey courses, just TAKE THIS CLASS TOO.)"
