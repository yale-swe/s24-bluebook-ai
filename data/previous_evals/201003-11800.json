    "The trials we study are extremely interesting and always pose some kind of interpretive problem for the reader, so if you like learning about trials\/judges\/lawyers\/juries\/witnesses and have a real interest in exploring the different factors that influence a trial's outcome, this is the class for you. It's a wonderful course, lots of class discussion, great professor, so I would recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in literature, law, the human condition (ha), then yes, this is a good seminar.",
    "Definitely recommend. Professor Kaplan is a wonderful teacher. The literature that we covered was incredibly interesting and well-chosen, and the class had an interactive feel: we dug through archives in the library and went on a field trip to New York to attend a symposium on justice in the courtroom. You also get to do some outside research, and to see how the supposedly distinct disciplines of law and literature intersect!",
    "Really awesome class. I'd totally recommend it. It's lots of reading but not too overwhelming and everything was so interesting. I wasn't bored at all with the class or the readings at any point.",
    "yes.",
    "yes.",
    "I really enjoyed Professor Kaplan's seminar and would highly recommend it to anyone interested not only in humanities and literature but also in history, english, american studies, french, and most of all, law. The syllabus features a mix of fictional and historic trials which makes the course more interesting and dynamic than studying only one or the other. Not only is Professor Kaplan extremely well versed in the material (her father was an attorney who worked under Robert Jackson at Nuremberg) she is also extremely affable and outgoing. She also lets students pick their own topic for their research paper at the end of the semester."
