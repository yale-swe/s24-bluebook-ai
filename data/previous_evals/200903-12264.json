   "comments": [
    "It's a study of the Golden Age of Spain, looking at political movements, theater, literature, and the Inquisition. For the most party, it's a series of microhistories which are carefully contextualized when necessary; this keeps it informative and engaging.",
    "Great class, very interesting, not overwhelming.",
    "I would reccomend it.",
    "I took this class as a senior history major with no background in medieval\/early modern history; I specialize in 20th century American history. Nevertheless, I found the material fascinating, and the topics are relevant to anyone who has any interest in cultural history. The class would be better titled \"Topics in the cultural history of Golden Age Spain,\" since each week focuses on a theme: censorship, women and chastity, religious minorities. Given the thematic structure, it's actually a confusing class if you have very little knowledge of Spanish history, since we jumped around a lot in terms of dates. Class discussions therefore were less about events and causes, but more about general trends throughout the baroque era and whether or not they were illustrated or disproven by our readings. I didn't leave with a very good sense of Spanish chronology by any means, but I had a very good sense of cultural trends at the time and where they came from.For general history majors, the class is a bit challenging because primary sources from this time period, especially for a non-Spanish speaking student, are difficult to find and obtain, but Prof. Jordan can help you find sources.Professor Jordan is a wonderful teacher, and cares a lot about making sure you are comfortable with your topics. She also understands the challenges of researching in Spanish for non-speakers, and the paper is only 10 pages long to reflect that. She could sense when we were tired and let us out early, but she also tried to make sure that we got the most out of our readings by giving us questions.",
    "Good class! Prof. Jordan is extremely, extremely chill. I wish there had been a little more political history or something; i was left a little unsatisfied.",
    "This was an excellent consideration of the historiography of Golden Age Spain. Professor Jordan is an engaging, energetic discussion leader and the course always flowed naturally and well over a variety of sources, viewpoints, and topics. I enjoyed the structure of the course -- Professor Jordan made sure to interact with students in depth regarding the reading responses and presentations, and I thought that this had the effect of making in-class presentations rigorous and thought-provoking for students while invitingpresenters to gain a solid grounding in and appreciation of their topics (many presentations formed the basis for subsequent reading responses and research papers in which students were free to explore the topic in more depth). This was a great group of students exploring an excellent selection of texts, and discussion was often heated and lively -- navigating the clashes in opinion was much more rewarding than in other seminars. The only possible weakness of the course was its Monday 3.30-5.20 scheduling -- I thought that it might have worked better as an earlier seminar later in the week. Otherwise, I was lucky to take such a great class with such a great professor and group of peers, and I would recommend the class to others enthusiastically."
