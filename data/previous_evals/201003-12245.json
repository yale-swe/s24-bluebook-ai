    "Yes I would recommend this class to a friend.",

    "yes, i think it is a great language and awesome if you want to try something new...",
    "Take it! you will NOT regret it. Work load is incredibly manageable. Small class sizes make it easier to understand the language.",
    "A very interesting course that I would recommend taking.",
    "Indonesian 110 is a fantastic course. Pak Indriyo takes learning a language -- something that can be quite daunting experience -- and turns it into something that is genuinely fun. I really enjoyed the class, and learned a lot of material.Pak Indriyo is one of the most genuinely kind-hearted professors I've had at Yale. He takes time to make the learning experience enjoyable and painless as possible. You can tell he cares -- and that means a lot.",
    "yup take it",
    "Great way to get your language requirement.",
    "I would recommend Indonesian I for anyone who wants to learn basic language skills in an easy language. There are practically no tenses and grammar rules are almost non-existent.",
    "I would recommend Indonesain 110 to a fellow student. A lot of one on one interaction and it is interesting to learn about the tropics of Indonesia.",
    "If you would like to learn an Asian language, this is a safer bet than Arabic or Chinese - however, it does move slowly at times. A big reason to recommend this class would be that it involves so much exciting Indonesian culture - you don't just learn about the language, but also about the nation."
