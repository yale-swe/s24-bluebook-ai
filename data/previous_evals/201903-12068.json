    "Strengths: - Gives a qualitative and practical understanding of the Renormalization Group - Integrates computational techniques to understand how what is learned is implemented in modern research Weaknesses: - Mostly due to the instructors first time teaching this course, assignments often required revisions to be completed - After we finished using Goldenfeld, many students felt that there was little structure to go on. More homework assignments were needed here or a rigorous text needs to be utilized. This is characteristic of advanced physics courses, however, where literature is sparse and is often not tailored to the course needs.",
    "strengths: it covers many interesting and important topic in advanced statistical physics, like scaling laws and renormalization group. to improve: it might be better if we can be more rigorous on derivation and explain things in more details, sometimes I could follow the lecture",
    "I would have preferred more regular homework (e.g. one or two problems every week instead of larger, but sporadic, homework assignments)."

    "Yes, this class is essential for any theoretical physicist. It tackles fundamentals that are essential for a variety of fields.",
    "I would recommend it to those who know little about topics covered in this course. This course may be an introduction to these topics.",
    "Yes I would. I attempted this course previously, and it was much better the second time around. I think this course depends a lot on the professor who teaches it, and I think Prof. Machta's version is much more approachable."
