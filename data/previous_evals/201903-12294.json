    "Extremely interesting material and interesting conversations. Perhaps a bit less time could have been spent on the first topic. Also perhaps the readings could be a bit shorter so they can be done in more depth.",
    "Strength: material choice. Weakness: the hand outs felt disorganized at times",
    "The strength of the course is really Irina Dolgova's teaching. She is wonderful at leading discussions and was really able to tailor the class to the students needs, diverting to grammar topics as necessary. The biggest weakness was just how disorganized it felt at times. I wish there had been any sort of syllabus so I knew what to expect and so that the course felt more structured."

    "Yes! Great course and not a stressful way to learn more about Russian history and relevant topics.",
    "Yes. It is a great curriculum and Irina Andreevna is an enthusiastic professor.",
    "Take this course just for Irina Dolgova. She's a truly wonderful professor. She is so approachable and kind with any sort of question. The topics covered where generally really interesting and the workload is not bad because Irina is so flexible about what you actually do. There is kind of a lot of reading at times, and if you want to get the most out of the course you should definitely read everything, but if you can't finish some things you'll probably be fine."
