   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I expected an in-depth, architecture heavy studio and for the most part received it. I was expecting and hoping for more construction and code related requirements given the amount of time to design the house.The 1\/2 scale models were incredible.",
    "My expectations were exceeded in this studio. I had heard from friends that Professor Beeby was a fantastic critic. I was interested in working on a small scale project in great detail. I was interested in transforming traditional architecture. Professor Beeby helped me do all of these things and taught me about the history of American architecture along the way.",
    "My expectation, as stated in the syllabus, was to comprehensively define a small useful structure in its entirety. This goal was achieved effectively, through the weekly exercises that forced the consideration of issues that have an impact on design - structure, dimensioning -- they way in which systems intersect. The studio is important because the lessons on how buildings are made has a bearing on realistic and independent practice and issues at the scale of the detail. This should have a place in an advanced architectural studio.This studio's trip to Chicago was particularly memorable because, for those of us who had never been to Chicago, and even for those that had been, we could examine architectural artifacts that are of great historical importance, but also see the history of the city of Chicago and its impact on urbanism in the United States. This is very important in an architecture school.",
    "TO develop my design technique and philosophy in new ways.",
    "The studio was exactly what I thought it would be. Tom was very up-front and stayed true to his word.",
    "exceeded myexpectations. I learned a lot from a very simple but interesting project.",
    "This studio made me gain confidence about being a designer which was perfect leading up to graduation. Also, our studio trip to Chicago was very informative. If I had gone to Chicago on my own, I would not have been able to see half of the things we saw with Tom.",
    "The house as a subject matter for a studio has a lot of potential, but the way in which it was framed made it more of an exercise in comprehensive design than as an investigatory\/analytical project. It was probably more suited to a 1st or 2nd year studio than an advanced studio. This issue was clear at both midterm and final reviews, where there were many questions raised about personal aesthetics and at times personal feelings of like or dislike of a project.The resulting projects were comprehensive in terms of being believable\/build-able projects, but there was hardly any conceptual work to ground the projects."

   "comments": [
    "His experience and keen vision (architecturally speaking) were the most beneficial aspects.The disconnect between the apparent building program - lower income housing and the design agenda he allowed us to pursue (more custom design) created tensions in the review that could have been avoided.",
    "Desk crits were the best part of studio. It was great to have a Professor actually draw on the trace with you. I think too few do that these days. Additionally, though, I should mention that Professor Beeby sat next to the student, facing the jurors, during the final review. I may be reading into it, but I saw this as a way for him to tell the student that he was on the student's side. I found it to be a subtle, yet very profound move on his part.Both juries (mid term and final) were amazing, as well. We talked about architecture solely based upon quality and NOT based on ideology. I think that other studios could benefit from these kinds of juries.I would recommend Professor Beeby without reservation to any student regardless of their background.",
    "Mr. Beeby\u0092s desk-crits are by far the most valuable aspect of this studio, because there is always something to talk about, whether architectural or not. He does not leave you feeling confused, stuck, or baffled \u0096 but more empowered to progress. For this studio, it might have been beneficial to have one last class pin-up after mid-term, but before the final review. This was important to theinitial development of the projects, and it would have been interesting to see everyone's advanced development.The least valuable aspect of any studio at Yale, not exclusively this one, is the midterm and final jury. The minimal value of it, in my opinion, stems from the large number of invited guests. While I understand the importance placed on the student\u0092s ability to present to and manage a crowded room while generating a conversation, the juries are simply too large. With so many critics, it is difficult to hear each panelist\u0092s opinion in the time allotted, and it is clear that some stronger personalities tend to dominate the conversation, to the exclusion of what valuable feedback or arguments other, more modest voices, might offer. How much value do we place here on the number of critics, versus the quality of criticism and debate?There has to be a better way to approach this in architectural education. My suggestion is that this school would benefit from smaller, more focused juries. People might be more likely to listen to each other and to engage in more focused and respectful, productive debate. Students might be more likely to accept that guests and dignitaries, more often than not, actually do pose valuable questions and criticism, rather than dismissing it after the dust settles.That institutional critique having been leveled, Mr. Beeby did carefully compose these juries in an attempt to deter character assassination and to generate the most productive commentary possible under the circumstances. It should be noted that of the invited critics, Greg Lynn, Deborah Berke and Judith DiMaio offered the most provocative and conceptual avenues of departure, moving forward.",
    "Tom Beeby was one of the best teachers I have ever had. The schedule was perfect and the way the studio was run was really flawless.",
    "Desk crits were most valuable - pin ups were useful but become quite long.",
    "I always found the desk crits the most helpful, and I think the scheduling of the course (tuesday\/wednesday) ended up proving to be very productive.",
    "Most valuable - Desk Crits. Desk crits with Tom were informational and went far beyond the singular project. While my project shows a great deal of what I learned, I also take along with me a great deal of new knowledge to each project I will do in the future. From environmental systems to construction techniques, the desk crits were very valuable.Least valuable - NA. There wasn't a single portion of the class that I would consider to be not valuable.",
    "I really enjoyed the Tuesday-Wednesday meeting schedule. At the beginning of the semester, it was nice to have a pin-up with my classmates on Tuesdays and meet with Tom individually on Wednesdays. Towards the end of the semester, half the class would meet with Tom individually on Tuesdays and the other half would meet with him individually on Wednesdays. Meeting with a studio critic once a week at the end of the semester is much more helpful than meeting with him\/her twice a week. Students can get more accomplished and not feel like they are constantly producing busy-work.",
    "the schedule for the semester was restrictive, ie one week landscape, the next structural frame, the next MEP, etc. It didn't leave much time to analytical work.making the models was valuable but extremely time consuming because of the detail. Perhaps a smaller final scale would have been adequate enough to convey the information without being to time restrictive, leaving time for concept development."
