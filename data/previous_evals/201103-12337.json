    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in pursuing photography more deeply than an intro class lets you. I feel much more confident in both my skills and my ideas as a photographer, thanks to this class. Intermediate Digital Photo gave me an opportunity to pursue a single artistic idea\/project for a whole semester, which was a serious learning experience and which ultimately led to my producing a body of work of which I am quite proud!",
    "Yes definitely. If you want to keep shooting digital this is the best way to do it!",
    "Yes, definitely take the class if you're passionate about photography. You'll get really helpful feedback about your work and sharpen the skills necessary in creating effective work. The class also gets pretty close by the end of the semester, so it's just a great experience overall. Take it!",
    "In Intermediate Digital, you take the lessons you learned from Intro Photography and apply them to one project. At times, you'll get really tired of the thing you're shooting and wonder if you're making any progress. Overall, I was pretty happy with the results, difficult as it was to reach them. Joe's not an easy grader--might be a good candidate for Cr\/D."
