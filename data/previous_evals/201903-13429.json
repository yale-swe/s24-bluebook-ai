   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the class lectures could be strengthened by using more applied examples; much of the material was high-level and very theoretical in nature, and it only started \"clicking\" once I was able to see the concept \"in action.\" I do think that the historical materials were extremely helpful in that they provided good practice for in-class exams.",
    "The take-home midterm was significantly more difficult than anything I've ever done in the class and others. Otherwise, I am much more comfortable with stats principles and r coding than before.",
    "My suggestions for this course would be the following: 1) It would be extremely valuable to receive answer keys to the problem sets and to receive them no later than maybe a week after receiving the corrections. Even if you get full credit, the answer keys that were provided for the first couple of problem sets were extremely productive to look at: they allow you to see other ways that you could have thought about the problems or solved them. Answer keys for a couple of problem sets were not provided, and solutions for some problem sets were provided only one or two days before the exams, when they are not so useful anymore if you have tried to study in a constant manner (as opposed to cramming for the exam only the day before it takes place). 2) In my view, it would be very valuable to devote maybe a full lecture or section to go over answers to the in-class and take home midterms. Especially for the take-home exam, where students spend about a week thinking about it and completing it, it would be very valuable to go over and discuss how problems could be solved. I believe this to be true even if you got good grades for individual problems: discussing alternative ways to solve them would also be a valuable exercise. This is obviously something that can only be done after the midterm (since classes end after the final exam), so if this was implemented only one class would be devoted to this, which does not seem unreasonable considering that each week has two lectures and one section. 3) I believe that for this course, covering a big of coding during math camp, or having more than one introductory coding section would be very valuable. Very few students are proficient in R and R markdown at the beginning of the course, so it can be quite hard to try to fully understand the topics covered each week while at the same time catching up on programming in R. I understand that learning a new programming language takes a lot of individual work, but having some help can also avoid spending a lot of time on things that are relatively easy (Angele made this much easier by helping students stuck with their code on her own and even outside her office hours). 4) While it was nice to get a first introduction to a lot of topics in this course, sometimes it felt like students could have benefitted more from a different time allocation between topics. For people who seek to engage in applied work, topics like confidence intervals, p values and reading regression tables are crucial, but sometimes we went over these topics quite fast and ending up spending the same amount of time on these topics as on relatively unimportant ones. We devoted less than a third of a class to topics like LASSO, Ridge, Sieve estimation, among others. Since that amount of time is hardly enough to learn properly about a topic that is new for students, maybe it would be better to allocate that time to more important topics -such as fully understanding what a p value and a confidence interval is- and not to a very preliminary introduction to topics that are not covered again in this class and that maybe are not so urgent for first year students. 5) It would be great if more examples were included in lectures, this makes topics much clearer for students and is not too time consuming.",
    "The course may be somewhat inaccessible for students who don't see themselves as primarily quant methods users. Particularly for students who are in the qualitative methods sequence, the material can be a bit daunting. For everyone else, it's rigorous and allows quant sequence students to hit the ground running. At times, it felt like we weren't getting enough applied material, and at others it felt as though we were expected to know or be able to figure out R code at a level above beginner. Overall, I think the course will prepare us for the remainder of the sequence.",
    "Strengths: clear explanations, good textbook Improvements: would love answers to all of the p-sets\/practice materials posted",
    "Strengths - Great teaching assistants - Useful learning materials, especially the A&M textbook Weaknesses - I thought the lectures were rather uninteresting -- we had already read the book ex ante, so rereading it in the lectures did not make much sense - At times, important information was conveyed to students selectively in office hours. Office hours should complement lectures and TA sessions, and it should not be necessary to attend office hours to understand homework. Improvements - Lectures should be made more engaging -- they should summarise the material, instead of repeating what we read in the book. - I would appreciate a longer introduction to R in the first weeks, perhaps a coding camp that is taught alongside Math Camp?"

    "If you are interested in the theoretical underpinnings of statistics and quantitative methods then, yes, I'd recommend it. However, for someone looking for a truly introductory course or an applied course for research, this is not the class I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend it to students taking the quantitative methods sequence, though for others I might suggest auditing or looking at a similar course in different social science departments. The class has gone through various iterations during recent years and seems to be in a state of evolution, which is not at all a bad thing.",
    "Yes, very useful for learning the material",
    "For me, the course was useful in developing a more profound understanding of statistical methods -- I think for someone who wants to use quantitative methods in social scientific research, this kind of knowledge is critical."
