    "Very good class for someone good at speaking\/reading but bad or with no experience in writing",
    "Yes, because I, and the rest of the students in my class, improved our chinese level a lot from taking this class.",
    "Really great course. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. I never liked taking Chinese before, but this class is great. The teachers are super engaging and you learn a lot. Be ready to spend time every day preparing for class, though.",
    "CHNS 132 is a great course. It's tough but it's very rewarding. I highly recommend it.",
    "It's a great class for heritage speakers! My Chinese has definitely improved considerably from the beginning of the semester, and while I'm certainly not fluent yet, my mom has commented that I \"speak Chinese less like an American\" now. During the course itself, it's not too much work (about 10-20 new characters per day), but admittedly when it comes time to study for the final these have summed up to several hundreds of characters. Still, a great course that you shouldn't hesitate to take, especially if Liu Laoshi is teaching (she's an awesome teacher and is almost like a second mom).",
    "I would recommend if you are really willing to learn the course. It is a lot of work, as with any language, but you will see a lot of improvement.",
    "CHNS 132 is an intensive course that greatly improves your Chinese skills by the end of the semester. Because it is a daily class, you are constantly drilled with new words and grammar, and you pick it up almost naturally. Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi are both amazing teachers that really care about you as a student, and are extremely approachable if you have any questions. CHNS 132 is definitely a course that is a lot of work, but it pays off in the end for sure. The daily quizzes help to drill the lesson, and force you to gradually learn the words. Furthermore, as the class progresses, you start to talk about more abstract and political topics, and conversations take an interesting turn as you learn how to say what you want to say, outside of the lesson. You also get tutorial sessions with Chinese grad students, and it's a 30 minute one-on-one session tailored to your needs, whatever your level may be and that has been extremely helpful. I would say that the only weakness is that the grammar drills in class can sometimes get boring, as it's the same structure repeated over and over. However, it's a necessary part of class because I find that the grammar drills allow you to remember the grammar points easily. Overall, if you are up for the work and want to improve your Chinese language level, CHNS 132 is a great class that you should definitely take.",
    "yes",
    "Overall I would summarize this class as a great way for students who speak Chinese already but are not proficient in reading or writing to immerse themselves in a more intense learning environment and really start learning their foundations and more for reading and writing. I started the class only being able to read a hundred words or so and writing a few dozen and then ended it knowing hundreds upon hundreds. I would recommend this class to absolutely anyone who can possibly take this class but also isn't taking a ridiculous course-load so they can truly dedicate their time to learning an amazing language by great professors."
