    "Russian 125 is an intensive language course. Take it if you are interested in learning Russian rapidly, or already know a little Russian. There is a lot of work involved, don't combine the course with a heavy load unless you already know some Russian.",
    "Intensive Russian is an excellent class. It's a very solid foundation in the language. We were always moving quickly, and of course it's a fair amount of work if you want to stay on top of things, but it never gets dull. Constantine is absolutely fantastic, and with a course like this, chances are you'll get an entire class of people who care a lot.",
    "If you really want to learn Russian and can commit the time to it, then intensive is manageable. There's quite a bit of work and you have to do it or you just won't be able to follow along in class\/on the weekly tests. This course moves really fast (a unit a week), so you have to be on it all the time. If you're willing to do that, you'll get a lot out of it. Be warned that you also have to go into intensive L3\/L4 next semester because of the way they align the units.",
    "If you want to learn the Russian language, there is absolutely no better way of doing it. Don't be intimidated by the fact that it's intensive; Constantine is an amazing instructor who will guide you through every step of the way, and the pace of the class is really not that bad at all (2 hours of work every evening is more than manageable). I'm not lying when I say that I looked forward to class every morning, and neither am I exaggerating when I say that the sense of satisfaction you get at the end of the semester is astounding. I had absolutely ZERO experience with Russian, and while it was slightly intimidating at the start having classmates with Slavic blood\/parents and other forms of prior exposure to the language, I quickly realized that having them along for the ride was a privilege and not a handicap. Best class of my semester, and I have little doubt that L3\/L4 will be as much, if not more of a blast.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn Russian fast. Take this class if you have the time and the willpower to stay on top of the homework and study for the weekly tests. Do not take this class if you are not great at languages and are just trying to get your language requirement out of the way... you might find yourself in over your head. Don't be scared, though, if this is the first foreign language you're learning. Constantine will help you through it!",
    "Very very effective way to learn lots of Russian quickly. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student who was dedicated and committed because in this class, if you put in a lot of work, you'll get a great payoff of knowledge."
