    "The policy sciences framework is incredibly important to large scale conservation efforts. The concepts were great.",
    "The policy science framework is super useful for students who are interested in environment policy and decision making.The case study was helpful to understand the concepts",
    "Going to Yellowstone and applying the policy sciences framework to a real\/current case was the most memorable\/helpful part of this class. This class got me to think in a new way and see large scale conservation in a totally new light. The reason I came back to graduate school was so that I could transcend my current level of thinking\/way of seeing the world, and this class definitely helped me accomplish that. This was an eye-opening, life-changing class for me. I also really enjoyed the various guest speakers who came in to speak to the class. It was very helpful to hear from professionals out in the field who are applying the policy sciences framework in their own work.",
    "This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about conservation and how I will engage in work from this point forward. It is rare to find such a course, and I am thrilled to have had the opportunity. The material is challenging and requires thought and reflection; it is possible to understand the material and process it in the classroom, but it is only in the field, working on actual problems and questions that the material really settles in and reveals itself. Taking the course for 6 credits afforded me the opportunity to travel to Yellowstone and adopt a case study to apply the material. The 8 days in Montana alone has informed my thinking more than any other course I have taken here thus far.",
    "The policy sciences provides a very useful framework for policy students.",
    "The group work as a way to discuss ideas in greater depth. The guest speakers were excellent.",
    "innovative thinking",
    "Subject matter was very interesting and helpful. This was probably one of the most useful classes I will take at Yale due to its applicability to problem-solving.",

   "comments": [
    "The organization was horrendous",
    "The course seemed disorganized. There is a difference between a flexible plan and a disorganized course. This course felt disorganized.",
    "It is better for the professor to provide more explicit guidance on case study.",
    "unorganized - the concept of a student-led class is valuable, but it still requires organization on the professor's part.",
    "The lectures were not always easy to follow\/sit through, and the Powerpoint presentations were often way too long. I would have really appreciated having more time dedicated to group discussions. I met with students outside of class to discuss the material, and it was incredibly helpful and fun. More in-class discussions would help students learn\/understand the material better. I also found it frustrating that for the Last Green Valley group work we were stuck in the same groups the entire semester. I was under the impression that we would be switching groups so that we would could learn more about social, decision, and biophysical processes. I didn't like that I had to stick with one process and one group the whole semester (I felt I was missing out on the other processes) and that this semester planwasn't made explicit early on in the semester.",
    "This course is a difficult one to teach I suspect because the material is not concrete or fixed; instead it challenges the students to re-think their approach and provides a framework for equipping students with the skills to improve their analytical approaches to conservation questions. Students approach the course from a diversity of skill-levels and experiences though and enter at different starting points. This is not a mechanistic framework, but rather requiresactive and willing participation from students. All of this presents difficulties in teaching the material.",
    "Focus. It was too much to cover two separate case studies. A focus on one or the other I think would have been more meaningful.",
    "Organization. The case study was barely organized and many things should have happened earlier in the semester.",
    "The course would benefit from the incorporation of readings into class discussions, more discussions overall, and a more open environment for challenging the material that is presented."

I have been here at FES to try to develop a broad and diverse set of knowledges and skills to apply to work the necessitates the integration of a wide range of perspectives, knowledges, and disciplines. This course has provided with a framework for thinking about how to understand and think about the conservation problems that most interest me. This course will inform all of my future academic and professional work.",

However, this course has fundamentally shifted how I think about conservation, greatly deepening my understanding of what conservation means and how I want to go about pursuing my work. This course gave me the skills and framework to articulate many of my thoughts that have been hanging out at the periphery of my thoughts; it challenged my thinking, caused my to reflect on how I approach my work and life even, and has pushed my thinking beyond what it has been to this point.",

Everyone pulled their weight\/got their work done, and had a lot of fun with each other (i.e. we still have potlucks and get-togethers even after the class ended). Some of the most amazing\/enlightening discussions I had this semester were with the members of this Yellowstone group.The Last Green Valley group was a disaster. There were some in the group who were not easy to get along with and who were very domineering\/bossy. Some people did not pull their weight\/ left it to the rest of the group to pick up the slack and didn't come to meetings\/communicate with the rest of the group. It was an extremely frustrating and negative part of the class for me.",
    "Group work is always challenging from a logistical standpoint. However, it is also a wonderful opportunity to discuss and bounce ideas back and forth. A lot of learning occurred in our group discussions as well.",
    "It is always a worthwhile challenge to work with people from differing backgrounds. It was especially useful in a course such as this where it helps (at least it helps me) to talk about the concepts out loud with others.",
    "It was a good group. People were willing to learn.",
    "My group was valuable for understanding the ideas of the policy sciences and discuss our ideas. However, there were the typical group work problems of people not pulling their weight.",

    "Advantage: consensus had to be reached and therefore a group helped to moderate and think through the ideasDisadvantage: scheduling could be a problem.",
