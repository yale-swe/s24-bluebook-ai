   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Adriane is the best part of this class. She's incredibly supportive and understanding of her students' struggles. Her team of peer tutors are also a gem. Going to office hours is crucial for success in this class.",
    "This course is very well structured, but the material could be divided better through the semester. Especially towards the end of term it was very hard to keep up with the material.",
    "All of the help available.",
    "Steinacker is an amazing professor, always available for help in office hours, and there is tons of extra help available if needed. Honestly, the way she set it up should serve as a model for how help should be accessible for classes at Yale.",
    "Great introductory course to physics--the course is really well-designed, and Professor Steinacker goes above and beyond in making sure that her students have as much support as possible. My only qualm is that the lectures themselves can be a bit dry sometimes.",
    "This was an extremely strong course. It flowed well from physics 180, and the material was well-organized and easy to follow. I actually found this semester much less confusing and more enjoyable than 180 was, as Professor Steinacker was more organized, provided stronger lecture notes, and was more clear about which topics were being covered each class. She has really stepped up as a teacher compared to last semester, and I really really appreciate it. The problem sets are long and challenging, but they are worth it, as they prepare one well for exams and are much more manageable when done in groups with friends. Honestly, I do not see how this course could be improved. Grading is very fair, the regrade policy for exams is much appreciated, and the material was well-taught.",
    "Strengths: topics are fairly interesting Weaknesses: homework seems unreasonably hard and take up so much time",
    "It's a really strong intro course relative to others, and few students seem to have any complaints. Just solid teaching, interesting p-sets, no surprises. Great resources, too, if you feel you're struggling -- plenty of TA o-hours and even a 2-hour review lecture each week which seemed helpful (but which I never attended).",
    "Lecture was great, and laid the foundations for what you do on the homework. I would have liked there to have been less homework though. At times, I felt it was too much, and some of the problems were unnecessarily long. With that said, I think the problems got better and more straightforward as the semester went by.",
    "This course has a lot of content, as is well taught. The posted online lecture notes serve as a great online resource, as well as office hours.",
    "Strengths: The number one strength of this course is the professor, Prof. Steinacker. Her passion for the subject material is extremely obvious, and it spills through in the way she teaches with the material and interacts with students. The problem sets, while challenging, pushed us students to cooperate and figure out answers in a group situation as opposed to by ourselves, independently. The tests were very challenging but also very fair. Weaknesses: Are there any?",
    "Strengths - the amount of help and support available to students in the course, like study halls, office hours, and peer tutor hours. Weaknesses - lectures are sometimes unengaging, confusing, and poorly organized. In addition, the course is a lot of (unnecessary) work.",
    "Professor is an amazing lecturer and individual who truly cares for her students and is passionate about being a professor and working with students. The problem sets are difficult and so are the tests, but there are always ways to improve your grade if you put the effort in (ie. test corrections). I could honestly not think of anything there is to improve for this class. It was definitely difficult, but Steinacker made it not impossible.",
    "The homework assignments for this course could not be completed without at least some confirmation or consultation with peer tutors, and the office hours held by Professor Steinacker and her peer tutors were both crucial and well done. Steinacker was always patient, helpful, and willing to provide the support necessary for us students to fully grasp the complex material she threw at us. The peer tutors were well-intentioned as well, and they provided valuable assistance in the completion of each homework assignment. With that being said, if a student had a particularly busy week and did not feel comfortable skirting the rules by receiving answers from friends, it was difficult to complete the assignments if one couldn't make it to office hours. Study hall late in the evening is far less helpful, and the peer tutors' individual office hours were usually held at less than convenient times. This only happened to me once, and I completely understand the responsibility of students to manage their time and complete all work, but this course could benefit from a bit more focus on provided at least a few more resources for students who cannot come to (or finish the homework within) office hours during the week.",
    "Not really an intro-level course, pace is very fast and not suitable for first time exposure to the course",
    "I think Professor Steinacker is amazing. It is rare and lovely to have a professor who is as committed to student learning as she is, and I really appreciated everything that she did to try and make the class enjoyable. That said, I really did not like this class. It had all of the long hours and hard work on psets that 180 did, but with none of the intuitive nature or vague practicality of kinetics. I generally enjoy doing psets, but it just felt like a lot of hours to put into a class that was not particularly practical or relevant to my (bio) major and which I didn't personally find particularly interesting. In the spirit of openness, I think that portions of my experience were generally unique. I did the psets on my own (I really don't like collaborating with others on work, although I did check answers with a couple friends and go to them every now and then when I got really stuck), and I never went to a single office hours. I wouldn't recommend that strategy, mostly because the people I know who enjoyed the course the most were the ones who got to know Professor Steinacker well by going to office hours and hanging out with her. Again, by all accounts she is lovely and kind, and I wish that I had found an excuse to go talk to her. I think one of my challenges was that she did a very good job of clearly explaining concepts in class and posting thorough lecture notes online, so that in my eyes there was really no excuse for me to have conceptual questions for her because everything we needed to know had already been clearly spelled out for us. Generally though, I felt that this class was like any other big science lecture. It had its moments when it was interesting, but for the most part the material felt entirely irrelevant to me and I found myself just going through the motions. Professor Steinacker was amazing, but I never went to office hours and so didn't ever get to have any particularly personal interactions with her. Given all of that, it felt like a lot of hours to have to put into something that I wasn't particularly passionate about and that I probably won't remember in about six weeks.",
    "Great course. I loved how there was a lot of help on psets.",
    "The PSETS are monsters if you work a job\/can't go to office hours or study hall. ALWYAS GO TO OFFICE HOURS OR STUDY HALL. Also though, the PSETs are the strength because they prepare you so well for the exams. Literally just understand the most basic of the PSETs and you'll be totally fine on the exams.",
    "This course is very well structured for student learning, and provides many opportunities for students who are struggling to seek aid, such as through office hours, peer tutoring, study hall, and weekly review sessions. In my opinion, the amount of resources offered to students in this course should be a model for other similar courses that lack such resources.",
    "The course went over a great range of material, drawing from many subjects. The math was intense, but I find that it was necessary to completely understand the material. I find that this course was phenomenal, and I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "strengths: helpful, interesting PSets, wonderful lectures, lots of support and friendly teachers and TFs weaknesses: some of the problems on the PSet you would never be able to figure out on your ownyou need to go to office hours.",
    "Classes weren't very helpful in terms of what we were asked to produce on PSETs and tests. The workload was extremely high and took over my entire week.",
    "Either you get it or you don't, and if you don't read the lecture notes and you'll be fine.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is Professor Steinacker. She clearly cares so much about the class and everyone in it and makes sure that help on psets is very accessible and frequent.",
    "Greatest strength is Steinacker. There is a pretty large work load, but Steinacker is amazing and puts in as much or more work than her students do. She is extremely accessible and willing to help.",
    "The opportunities for office hours are easily the greatest strength of the course. They were offered 4 times a week from 3-5 pm on Mondays and Tuesdays and 3-6 pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is aside from study hall. There is ample time offered by TAs, peer tutors, and the instructor to complete the assignments and it's on the student to take advantage of these opportunities. Office hours should be moved to a larger location if possible. No weaknesses in all honesty.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Steinacker's teaching style.",
    "Overall an amazing course with very dedicated instructors and lots of sources of help. Nothing much to be improved, keep up the great work! I benefited a lot from taking it.",
    "I think the strength of the ass is the professor. One major weakness was the take home exam where I know for a fact that people cheated. Being a person who didnt cheat I felt like I was punished for doing the right thing because the average was much higher than it should have been.",
    "Problem sets were spaced out fine but in general very long; Prof. Steinacker is very sweet, peer tutors are very helpful",
    "Problem sets require a very high amount of time and can be very frustrating to complete due to the fact that they are impossible to complete without help, i.e. it is absolutely essential that students go to office hours and it is not possible to make it through this class by yourself, no matter how smart or hard-working you are. It is fairly easy to do well in the class, as long as you are willing to put in the time. The class is well structured and the overearching concepts of the class are quite interesting.",
    "I think this course was pretty well taught and the tests and psets were pretty fair. It would be nice if the psets were a little shorter though.",
    "It is taught incredibly well. It is very challenging but the professor is generous with her grading. The support system is very extensive. I don't think it could be improved much--it does have to be difficult, at least."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as opposed to the other physics courses. You will learn best with Adriane.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in Physics. Steinacker is incredible and provides students with many resources to better understand the material.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Maybe not if its only to get a Sc credit, but if you need to take intro physics its great.",
    "Yes---it can be kind of a tough workload, but if you go to office hours the psets really aren't too terrible.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Prior to 180, I had no physics background whatsoever (not even an intro level high school course, much less AP or college level physics), yet both semesters were manageable. I feel that I learned a lot in this class, and Professor Steinacker is not only a great teacher, but an absolutely lovely human being, too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to or has to learn physics. Professor Steinacker is amazing and you come away with some really cool knowledge.",
    "If you are interested in physics, go for it. If you are just looking for a science credit, this class requires too many hours.",
    "It's a perfectly good course, and there's no need for prior knowledge of anything beyond single-variable calc. Well-taught and interesting.",
    "If you took PHYS 200 in the fall and are considering taking this, know that you will not be \"dropping down\". The homework takes much longer than PHYS 200 with Sarah, but it is a more comprehensive experience I think. Shop both and pick the one you think will be best for you.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in physics and is committed to keeping up with the workload.",
    "Definitely. Even if you do not need to take this course for a requirement, take it for your sheer love of a challenge. If you have to take this course for a requirement, it will be one of the most rewarding experiences you had.",
    "If you have to take intro physics, you have to take intro physics. If you're reading the reviews for this course, you probably took PHYS 180, so you might as well take PHYS 181. However, 200\/201 is taught better and less work, but it would probably be difficult to go from 180 --> 201.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student who needs to take an introductory physics course and would genuinely want to understand and learn concepts rather than just memorize equations. Steinacker teaches the course incredibly well and the content is understandable as long as you put in the effort to ask questions and attend office hours to work on problem sets. In fact, anyone who wants to take physics even just for fun should take this course as well!",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have at least some interest in exploring physics and are comfortable with a course taught in a rigorous manner which requires a significant time commitment. For those with only a cursory interest or whose passions lie elsewhere, this course may prove tedious and frustrating.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in pursuing further study in physics, and obviously if it is a requirement you don't have a choice, but if you were only thinking of taking it as an interesting survey of physics I would recommend something more practical. One of the cool things about lots of physics, like kinetics is that it can be seen in daily life, but knowledge of basic E&M doesn't really translate into interesting application until you get to much more engineering-like scenarios.",
    "Definitely take the course. It is worthwhile.",
    "Yes. This course offers a detailed and math-based instruction on a select set of topics from electrodynamics and electromagnetism.",
    "Yeah, much better than 161 for the pre-meds.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although the workload and intellectual challenge can be quite high, it is a course that rewards hard work and is led by a phenomenal instructor.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Not only was Professor Steinacker one of the best professors that I have every had, but she made physics and math truly beautiful to understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The support available and the greatness of the professor greatly outweigh concerns about the workload.",
    "No, never. Why would you put yourself through so much pain if you don't have to?",
    "The professor is great",
    "Absolutely. The class is a lot of work but you get a lot out of it and establish a good foundation in e&m.",
    "Yes. You will get a lot out of it if you do the work.",
    "If the professor is Adriane Steinacker, TAKE IT. She is extremely dedicated and fun to be around. Amazing instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides beneficial general knowledge.",
    "This class is disorganized and a waste of time. I regret not taking 170\/171 or 200\/201. 201.",
    "Yes, even if you are PreMed and just looking for the most painless way to get your physics requirement out of the way, learning E&M from Professor Steinacker is such a pleasure and she will make sure you know the material like the back of your own hand.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you are engineering, yes (also you have to); if you are not a STEM major\/pre-med, this is fine as well, but doesn't cover some things that may be on the MCAT but Prof. Steinacker is sweet and the office hours are good",
    "Yes, the support for this class was incredible",
    "Take PHYS 180-181 if you need introductory physics and you are willing to put in a lot of time to get a good grade and save yourself some stress during examinations. If you are solid in math and dont want to spend ~10hrs a week on 1 pset, strongly consider taking PHYS 200-201.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Even though it is quite a lot of work, it was a fun class to take.",
    "Yes, even if not a physics or science major. The difficulty is worth it. It is a significant time commitment, though."
