    "Readings are completely skippable. Lectures are too.",
    "For students familiar with philosophy, this class is easy but pretty interesting. The readings are short and there aren't many of them. It's also definitely manageable for others interested more in science, but with less of a background in philosophy. Just remember to ask questions to clarify the jargon as the class progresses.",
    "Great 5th class that makes you consider the way science is conducted and viewed by society in a completely new way. Not very science-based (hence no Sc credit), but more about the ideas and reasoning behind why we have science. You get the questions on the midterm and final before both tests, so you have adequate time to prepare and know exactly what to expect. Lectures cover all the material in the reading, which is really only about 10 pages on average per night. Professor North and the TA, Sungil Han, were both extremely helpful and approachable.",
    "It was a pretty interesting class. I enjoyed it but I found the readings tough to understand. Professor North did a good job of explaining them in lecture, though. There also was not that much day to day work, but preparing for the midterm and final took a lot of time.",
    "Really great class that isn't too much work. A must for a science major.",
    "Yes, it is a very good introduction to philosophy of science.",
    "Its a good class for science majors to take to think more about the philosophy behind the science you do in lab. Its a really easy class for those that haven't taken philosophy before. I would reccommend it.",
    "This was a very easy class. There was very little work, only a little bit of reading. The professor is very laid back.",
    "Overall, I thought this was an ok class. In relation to a science class, I'm not so sure that I got that much out of it. As someone who is majoring in the sciences and doing research, I thought it was very up in the air and didn't really do much for me in thinking about \"how\" I do science. In relation to a philosophy class, I thought it was a good intro course for someone who has never taken a phil class before. It's nice because you don't have to write actual essays and instead write short answer essays for the mideterm and final (one each). It's still really up in the air and sometimes I didn't really know or understand what we were talking about very well. If you're looking for a gut, I'm not sure if you would be able to call it that. Though there is very little work, the couple of days before the final and the midterm, you basically devote your life to memorizing all you have to know. So the from the first lecture it goes like this: read, read, read, read, study like crazy for midterm, read read read, study like an insane madperson for the final. If that's what you want, this is the class for you. Oh and the reading isn't that bad. About 20 pages per night from the same book (although it was dense sometimes).",
    "This is a gut humanities class, so don't expect much work, nor much learning from it. The exams are a series of 2-4 paragraph questions, which will be a proper subset of a 'study sheet' that will be handed handed out in class.",
    "Good course, little work during the semester but make sure you write notes and keep up with the readings so you don't die when the time for the exam comes. Would recommend this as a fifth credit and a great humanities requirement.",
    "A good philosophy class with a light workload. For undergrads the only grades are the midterm, the final, and section attendance\/participation. The readings are interesting and cover topics related to science but not limited to it, like induction and probability. Take it if you want a nice introduction to philosophical topics or have an interest in philosophy and want one with a light workload.",
    "It's a good class. I would recommend it.",
    "Some people tend to think that Phil269 is a gut, but it is actually more work than you are probably bargaining for. The amount of reading is minimal, but you will have to spend a lot of time preparing for exams. She gives the questions that are going to be on the exam, but each question requires about 4 paragraphs and she gives you way more questions than are going to be on the exam. If you keep up with the reading and attend lecture (and presumably pay attention), you will be fine. If you don't...studying for the exams will be a major pain\/time committment.",
    "I would recommend this course. However, I would say that the prospective student should be prepared to do all the readings; these are the foundation of the course and the lectures and sections don't necessarily add much to this foundation. The readings, therefore, are the most important resource for having a meaningful experience in the course.",
    "This is a good course for science majors.",
    "Professor North is extremely nice. Reading assignments are very short. Tests are very hard to prepare for and very strictly graded.",
    "I have mixed emotions about this course. Some of the material was quite interesting, but some of it was also quite mind-numbing. I would recommend this course for philosophy students, but I don't science students will enjoy it as much as they might expect. For a science student looking for and easy humanities credit, there are easier (and generally more interesting) courses available. The workload for this course was very light, but the exams can be a bit tough. The fact that we had the questions in advance meant that we expected to give extremely detailed (and long) responses. If you take this course, do yourself a favor and do the weekly readings (usually less than 50 pgs\/week). You will thank yourself come exam time.",
    "Excellent, wonderful course. Lectures were the highlight of my week for the semester. If you're at all interested in the material - philosophy isn't for everyone, some people just find it utterly pointless - but if you're at all interested, TAKE IT, or at least shop it if you're not sure.Workload was very reasonable - some reading, not too much, each week. Two exams. You get a list of questions from which the exams will be drawn beforehand so you can prepare. It makes studying a fair amount of work, but it's really quite reassuring and helpful, and helps guide your studying.The content of the course was very interesting - it's always fun thinking about how we know anything about the world. And the material isjust challenging enough to always be fun without ever being incomprehensible. And Prof North presents it extremely clearly and logically. Oftentimes I'd go into class having done, but not understood, the reading, and I'd come away feeling confident that I had understood the topic. Prof North is very dynamic, always willing to engage students on questions or challenges. She's also helpful outside of class. The fact that she's also kinda cute and funny, and always cheerful (if also always a little unwell), is a nice bonus.The only reason anyone would be unhappy with this class would be if they're not at all interested in the material. If you think asking these questions is pointless, then the class isn't for you. Also, don't come in expecting a lot of answers - philosophy of science (the subject, not the course) is very much a work in progress, and often the material will leave you with more questions than answers (though not for lack of understanding).",
    "Kind of a boring class, really. You don't really find out the point of anything you learn - it feels like you're just getting random theories and arguments tossed at you about what science is or should be, without any purpose to it all. I wouldn't take it."
