    "Q10: Every single person should have to take a writing class. Even though this was geared towards a very specific kind of writing, the things I learned can be applied to every piece of writing I do for the rest of my life. Amazing.",
    "I wish the TA would have participated in class discussion.",
    "7. Fred is totally excellent but should be aware that he seems to have favorite students and it's painfully obvious to other students in the class.",
    "I would give this class all the flying colors I could for its goals, assignments and readings. But I haven't quite given it all that in my ratings above because a major missed opportunity is quality discussion in class.Fred Strebeigh is a fabulous person overall, and an extremely astute and thorough editor. It is a joy to work with him one-on-one, and it feels like an honor to have his insight. But his micromanagement of class discussion is so frustrating that he's obnoxious, not to mention it means a major missed opportunity. He does well to stack the class with thoughtful participants: it's a tragedy that they never get to speak together because the well-meaning professor is too excited not to control every aspect of the conversation."

   "comments": [
    "The structure is tried and true. I loved the incremental way Fred led us through writing our pieces, a section at a time. Then getting to closely workshop with just a few students was so valuable to me. I made major breakthroughs with my ideas and piece that I would never have arrived at alone.Also, Fred Strebeigh himself is worth the class. He's FANTASTIC.",
    "The professor's energy and enthusiasm carried the class. The class is extremely well-structured as well, and allows for input, feedback and suggestions from all participants to add to and benefit the work of the student",
    "Being able to produce a polished piece of writing and getting personal feedback (and extensive comments) on progress each week.",
    "The feedback on my writing was very constructive.The workshop groups were excellent.Fred is outstanding. Meeting with him one on one was very helpful.",
    "Professor Strebeigh is incredibly talented. He is sincerely devoted to improving his student's writing. You will become a better writer by taking this course.",
    "The focus on producing something that is actually publishable was the best and most useful aspect of this course.",
    "As I said, Fred is a truly gifted editor, in both insight and devotion. And he picked our class participants very well for both breadth of topical interests and depth in expertise.Sarah was also an exceptional editor as TA.",
    "The best thing about this course was the professor. Fred was unbelievably dedicated to this class and its students. He spent so much time on my writing each week and his comments and suggestions were so valuable. Having a professional writer edit your work is such a great opportunity.",
    "The instructor is very enthusiastic; classes are participation-based and fast-paced and stimulating. It's good to refine a single piece of writing over a whole semester, focusing on one topic and perfecting it. Writing about a professionally or scientifically relevant topic for a general audience will be useful in all stages of my career.",

   "comments": [
    "Not a damn thing.",
    "Letting students direct the discussion a bit more, rather than trying to extract a certain answer from them or interrupting them.",
    "Fred can sometimes be more controlling than he needs to be. For example, in the dinner with Roger Cohn I was afraid to ask questions for fear that Fred would deem them to be insulting.",
    "Though the small number of students implies that the class is a seminar, it can feel at times like a socratic dialogue. Quite frankly, it can be stressful. I feel that the environment, discourages students from speaking with their own voice. Instead, students struggle to figure out what Professor Strebeigh wants us to say. That becomes \"the game.\"The class would improve if open feedback and active listening was encouraged.The question and answer with Roger Cohn could be improved by allowing students to ask their own questions. The process of having to submit questions to Professor Strebeigh in an exacting format, before we could engage Roger Cohn was not only humiliating but made Roger's visit feel awkward and impinged on us freely establishing a rapport with him.",
    "Let students talk! Fred's style of leading a \"discussion\" is incredibly frustrating. He has good insight, but so do we. The class would benefit enormously if students were allowed to speak to each other without Fred interjecting between every sentence.Fred also has tremendous experience in writing craft, but much of the class \"discussion\" was to take apart other articles without any directions for the following week's assignment. It would be great to have his insight not only on the professional work we're reading but also on the upcoming assignment we'll need to create."

    "They were both extremely helpful. Professor Strebeigh was even willing to take a phone call on a Saturday to discuss my work.",
    "Amazing. Fred was always available to chat about our papers. Since the class was so small and he read our work every week, we was extremely familiar with all of the students and our articles. This way, he was able to give really good, solid advice on how to structure and write the pieces.",

    "This class was about more creative writing than the typical academic paper. This style fits more with the kind of writing I would like to continue to pursue. It even made me consider going into environmental journalism, briefly.",
    "This course represented a large shift from what I have traditionally studied. However, it is an interest that I have always held and was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore it further. Importantly, no matter what line of work I pursue, writing effectively and communicating in a compelling matter will be critical skills. As my interests are in land conservation, I see it as part of my responsibility to be able to communicate clearly and forcefully why I feel the way I do about our natural landscapes; land conservation is built on a conservation ethic, and as a conservationist I hope to be able to spread and kindle that ethic in others. Writing may be a primary tool for doing so.",
    "It has been invaluable in improving my writing ability.",
    "I want to be able to communicate with wide audiences the importance of the work I do. This was an important and vital skill to sharpen while at FES.",
    "I love writing, and hope to make it a big part of my career. I'm also grateful to have worked with Fred in class so that I'll know how to approach him for an independent project later.",
    "This class helped me turn my summer internship work into a 12 page, well-written article for wide audiences to understand. It was a fantastic opportunity that forced me to sit down and spend the semester reviewing my research and turning it into a nice article. This course also helped me to interview professionals in the field and extend my network. It provided a great reason to call people up and get to know their line of work. This class was also a great refresher on grammar!",
    "I do not plan a strictly academic career, but rather that of an architectural sustainability practitioner. Writing for a general audience is important for communicating ideas, for instance in opinion articles. Already I am collaborating on an article about energy consumption that will be submitted for publication."

    "The group editing sessions were really beneficial. It was hard to stay focused and on task in the evenings after a long day but the having multiple people reading the piece only strengthened it. The group work is a wonderful and valuable component of the class.",

    "team editing - FABULOUS idea. Really scary, and incredibly valuable.",
    "The workshop groups (a small group of students you worked with to review each other's work each week) were so valuable! Having other students weigh in on your writing was really helpful. I enjoyed reading others' work, too.",
    "Editing in a work group of four people allowed me to receive insights from several contributors who tracked my paper's development over time. It was very valuable and there was no downside.",

    "Definitely take it. Its a class that requires a lot of work. I got invested into my project and was working on it continually over the course of the semester, but it was a labor of love - I was enjoying the challenges (and frustrations) of trying to get the piece right. It will be a lot of work, but it is well worth it. And the three-credit option is wonderful - the added time for focused editing and reviewing is well worth it.",
    "Get your research done prior to beginning the course. It's a lot to handle if you haven't done the research, though it's still manageable.",
    "Buckle up!",
    "If you take it, take it for 3 credits to really get what you need out of it, not just 1 credit.",
    "Brace yourself to write often and well.",
    "This class helps you learn how to write for common publications like National Geographic, Audubon, etc. Fred teaches you all the elements that you must use in your writing and gives you great feedback on your writing, topic, style, and so on. I would highly recommend this course if you have some research or internship experience or even course work that you'd like to write up into an article for wide audiences. Fred gives you tons of feedback on your writing and helps you craft a great article. It's a great opportunity to do more interviews and reach out to people too (network-buidling!). The class is front-loaded with work, so if you get through the first 6 weeks (1 credit) keep going for the full 3 credits -- it's worth it to come out with a great article\/writing sample\/summary of your work!",
    "Great course, definitely worth taking no matter what your writing aspirations are. Choose a topic you are passionate about in order to fuel inspired writing all through the semester--the course will pace you to develop a great piece!",
    "Have fun."
