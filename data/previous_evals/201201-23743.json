    "I would highly recommend the class, especially to nature lovers.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are interested in becoming an English major. There are plenty of other courses that specialized in the authors covered here, so this will give you a broad view of poetry without delving too much into the specifics of any one author.",
    "Eating your vegetables. In the end, it was a good experience and I can see why it is a prereq for the major -- the works I read in this class helped me in my other English classes. You'll understand references to texts and have a solid foundation for analyzing literature in general. A lot of close reading, not all of which was exciting, but on the whole, not bad at all. I really enjoyed Milton and Yeats, will definitely be rereading some of these texts in the future. George Fayen is very kind and incredibly knowledgeable (quotes Paradise Lost by the LINE NUMBER... crazy). He also has specific preferences for essays (no distinct thesis...) so be sure to talk to him beforehand. He is defintely the most knowledgeable professor teaching this course; you will learn a lot from him. His style of talking can be hard to follow (lots of figurative language, large words), but don't be afraid to ask him to clarify. Very nice guy, very understanding.",
    "Take it if you need to take the English major pre-req. If not, there are other English classes with more interesting readings.",
    "Only if you are an english major.",
    "Required English course, but I loved it. Fayen was also great. I think he's one of the best teachers I've had at Yale\u0097if you can get past his slightly lofty way of speaking to open class (just start asking him what words mean, if you don't know) then he's great. He clearly cares about students learning more than about deadlines or any kind of external success, which is a really nice thing, especially at Yale."
