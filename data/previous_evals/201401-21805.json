    "Overall, an excellent upper level astronomy course. I'm definitely biased because I think that exoplanets is one of the coolest topics in astronomy, but I can't imagine that others wouldn't find the material interesting. Prof. Fischer is brilliant and very enthusiastic-- a great instructor. I wasn't really happy with the structure of the final project at the end; because this is a cross-listed course, graduate students also take it, and ended up completing most of the final project themselves. But Prof. Fischer will likely change that next year."
