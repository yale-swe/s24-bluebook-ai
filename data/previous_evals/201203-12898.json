   "comments": [
    "If you have some background in this area, definitely - I think you would get a great deal out of this course. If you don't have any previous knowledge (which was the case for me), you'll be occasionally confused, but still learn a lot about the effects of France's colonial past. The syllabus has an excellent mix of films and literature to balance the occasionally dry theoretical readings. This is an important area, because the problems stemming from colonialism continue to make a difference in both Africa\/the Caribbean and in France itself.In terms of workload, we had 6 written responses, an in-class presentation, and a longer research paper, none of which felt too overwhelming.",
    "Fascinating course on a subject that doesn't get much attention elsewhere in the department; good class discussion, and Professor Tamalet is wonderful.",
    "A mixed chronological and thematic introduction to postcolonial thought in Francophone Africa and the Caribbean. The course starts with some foundational reading (C\u00c3\u00a9saire's \"Discours sur le colonialisme\", excerpts from Fanon's PEAU NOIR, MASQUE BLANCHE, Memmi's PORTRAITS), then proceeds with a mix of theory (readings from N\u00c3\u00a9gritude and the Cr\u00c3\u00a9olistes, Derrida) and novels by Francophone authors (Djebar, Chamoiseau, Danticat, and others). It's a lot of reading, but it's worth it. Our discussions struggled a bit for the first couple of weeks, but once we found our footing and got a better grasp of the theoretical concepts, they went much better.",
    "This course is really great. It provides the student with an extremely necessary set of perspectives on topics like modernity and language. This is an absolutely necessary class for anyone who has read the western cannon, or who is majoring in subjects related to it. It shows the effects of European thought throughout the world. And confronting these on the terms of those affected is absolutely necessary. This also means the texts are accessible, if not always in language, certainly in content.",
    "yes. take it. lots of information about the mentality and literature of newly liberated francophone regions; specific topic has surprisingly a lot to say about the nature of the human mind as it related to various modes of oppression, self-expression, then creation. if you feel ever affected by racial power dynamics, or perhaps even just slightly curious, this class has some interesting answers. to properly decide take a good look at the syllabus and pull up some of the works online to get a sense (personal recommendation: franz fanon)",
    "Yes! Interesting texts, important theorists, and a very encouraging professor. Although the quality of the class depends on how engaged each person is and how well they can contribute, Dr Tamalet always has something astute to say to encourage more reflection."
