   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class as long as the teacher is tolerable. I think I lucked out with my professor because different sections have very different perspectives on the class.",
    "I took math 115 after having taken AP Calc AB in high school. It was a good match for me placement-wise. The weekly problem sets in this class can be challenging, but there are many resources to get help with them. It's a pretty standard math class, but I enjoyed it.",
    "I think that most students take Math 115 out of necessity, but I would still recommend it. Coming out of AP Calculus AB in high school, I found that the first half of the course was a review of integration and the second half was new material on series. For anyone who is concerned about not having had BC Calculus, I would say that it should not be an issue, especially if you are strong in math.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It is challenging, but satisfying when you can master the material. Make sure you know the material well enough to apply it in new ways on the exams (very... creative exam styles). Looking over practice problems and old exams is extremely helpful. Also, check over your problem sets with a friend or two, always.",
    "Mathematics 115 01 is a great course. It teaches you a lot about single variable calculus. There are weekly problem sets. The course moves quickly so it helps to attend class and seek extra help.",
    "Mathematics is a great course on single-variable calculus that requires a lot of work to do well but is definitely manageable.",
    "For me, Math 115 was challenging, as are most Math classes, but I really appreciated going through it with Dr. Auel. He explained not only how things are done, but why, which made it difficult to forget. He is also pretty cheerful and approachable, which made it really easy to ask questions in class and during office hours.",
    "I was initially unsure whether I was ready for Math115, but I definitely don't regret taking it. Dr.Auel is approachable and explains concepts well. The problem sets aren't too bad; there's lots of help available pretty much every day of the week if you're stuck. The exams are kind of tough, but they're graded leniently. The review sessions before the exams are super helpful.",
    "I would recommend the class to another Yale student, but would warn him or her of the difficulty level of the class. I advise that any student attend the teaching fellow problem sessions.",
    "Easy problem sets, but the exams were beyond incredibly difficult.",
    "Math 115 is a good stepping stone between Calc AB and Math 120. If you have taken Calc AB in high school and want to explore math a little bit, I would definitely recommend Math 115.",
    "Standard math course, some interesting material in the final 2 lectures re relativity. Review sessions for exams were helpful.",
    "Mathematics 115 01 is a math course for calculus II. I would recommend it this class to another students, because it effectively teaches the material. At times, further explanation could be useful and problem sets do not correlate well to exams, but with effort, the course is worth it.",
    "It's a hard course, but definitely \"do-able.\" You have to be able to dedicate time every week to math, but if you do that consistently, then you should be fine.",
    "If they are good at math, and are going into STEM its worthwhile.",
    "The class can be clearly summarized with its title. I would recommend it to anyone looking to create a foundational understanding of calculus before continuing in math or other sciences."
