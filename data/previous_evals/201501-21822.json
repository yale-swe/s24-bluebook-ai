    "CHNS 155 is a solid class for those looking to maintain their Chinese and practice some of the official writing style. The chapter topics in this half of the textbook are interesting and informative - I learned a lot of history and information as well as the language that each lesson focused on. Discussion was given more of a priority than in 154, which helped us gain control of the material.",
    "Chinese 155 is mandatory if you want to take the upper level Chinese classes. It can be tedious at times, but it is a good way to make sure you are prepared for the upper level classes.",
    "Just a continuation of the chinese langauge track. Heavily recommended if you like chinese.",
    "Yes, if you want to keep you with your Chinese and get ready to the next level!",
    "Yes, recommend. You need it before taking the specialized Chinese classes anyway."
