    "Semmel is the nicest person you will ever meet. He is very smart - a VERY slow grader (unreasonably so) and the class is a little dry.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a great foundation for all other History courses.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, but I find it extremely hard to summarize it as anything but a history meets politics meets philosophy meets religion meets a whole host of other subjects class.",
    "DS History\/Politics is a survey of some of the most important works of Western political theory and history. I would recommend it.",
    "DS H\/P was probably my least favorite section mostly because the texts were so scattered and uncohesive. The narrative histories, to me, were boring to read, and then didn't mesh well with the political thought texts, especially the medieval ones. Lectures were not particularly helpful at illuminating what we were supposed to be getting out of the books either. I loved Professor Semmel as a person, he was really very funny and an interesting person to talk to, and I feel like if I had taken his modern history class it would have been a different experience, but his teaching of DS was a little unsatisfying. Sometimes he seemed to not know anymore than we did about the texts, which could make class discussion feel a little stilted and like I wasn't getting much out of it. His feedback on papers also could have used more specificity. He is also very slow to return papers so beware!",
    "I am a big DS fan in general and would completely recommend it! I love being part of a community of invested professors and students with similar interests and shared experiences. I don't mind the pace of depth with which we read, but I understand that it can be frustrating to other people. I think though that DS provides a structure and support to read so many great books that would be hard to manufacture elsewhere. I really love it!"
