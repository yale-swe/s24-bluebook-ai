   "comments": [
    "An understanding of complex biological processes and how they are measured. The course improved my udnerstanding and liking of Matlab.",
    "I learned some neat skills in MATLAB. The course reinforced physiology (BENG 350).",
    "The course offers a good introduction to thinking about how to conduct biomedical engineering experiments. The sampling theory we go over at the beginning of class is especially useful.",
    "Learned more about MATLAB, data acquisition, signal processing, etc.",
    "Terrific course! Learned a lot about how we measure physiological processes in lab. Labs were pretty fun although the reports took a long time.",
    "I didn't learn too much new material (a lot of the theory behind this class comes from physiology or is covered in other BME classes). However, I still feel like I gained knowledge about how Matlab can be used in a practical, data analysis role. It was cool to collect your own data to use in Matlab and to see the issues that might come from having to deal with raw data off of a biological signal.",
    "I learned how to apply MatLab programming in the analysis of real-life physiological data and cemented my knowledge of physiological systems by observing them and how they respond to different stimuli in real life.",
    "I really liked how this course allowed me to see the many practical uses of my knowledge and classes as a biomedical engineer.",
    "I gained a fundamental understanding of how analog signals are transferred to digital signals using specific experimental equipment.",
    "I learned about the basics of biomedical data acquisition and how various physiological parameters can be measured. The learning was a good mix between data acquisition and signals and physiology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was the first lab I've taken that actually felt like it should only be worth 0.5 credits. I learned a lot, but there was minimal busy work.",
    "Great course, well taught, great schedule and well organized.",
    "I would keep the course the same.",
    "The course is not too difficult, and the lab reports are straightforward. I wouldn't mind going into greater depth on some of the topics we covered in the lab (like bone biomechanics and ECGs) but there's only so much you can do in an undergraduate lab with a limited amount of time.",
    "The only improvement I can think of is releasing 'solutions' to the labs after everyone has turned them in. This would make studying for the final easier. Overall, a great course!",
    "I really liked the format of the course (labs every 2 weeks and final written exam). It was a lot of work, but manageable.",
    "I think this is a great course and if Rong is still teaching it, it should remain exactly as it is.",
    "I thought the measurements, calculations, and data analysis all interrelated very well to allow students a chance to apply their knowledge of physiological systems and learn more MatLab skills. I found the labs very engaging, especially because it was interesting to see how data from measurements we performed on ourselves compared to typical data. I was not a big fan of MatLab programming before this course, but this class made it more accessible by showing me how it could be applied in not-too-complicated ways in the real life. The only weakness I would suggest working on is the clarification of some of the pre-lab preparation and procedure manuals, especially for the biomechanics lab. When completing the lab reports, it was sometimes confusing what type of answers the questions were looking for, and the lab manuals were not always the best help. In particular, the biomechanics lab prep manual felt superfluous, complex, and almost like it was meant for a different class\/lab. In addition, it would have been nice to have more specific feedback on our lab reports. I did well, but I had hardly any idea what I got wrong whenever I got points off.",
    "Professor Rong Fan is excellent, the labs are interesting, and the workload is very light",
    "The strength of this course was that it showcases the many real world applications of biomedical engineering knowledge and opened my eyes to a variety of applications. Some of the data analysis was tedious however and the bone mechanics lab equations were hard to understand from the lab procedure",
    "The course is reasonable in its workload. Some of the lab reports seemed unnecessarily tedious and would have benefited from more questions that required research outside of the lab instead of extensive data processing with Matlab.",
    "Overall the organization was excellent. I learned a lot and felt that my time was always well spent as opposed to some lab courses in which the reports feel like busy work. I was not quite sure what to expect on the final exam and found it to be more difficult than I had anticipated. Perhaps providing a practice exam would be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Prof Fan is great, lab is a lot of fun, and the lab write-ups are not too time consuming.",
    "Definitely, its a cool class.",
    "Take it if you're a BME major.",
    "It's essential and useful for biomedical engineering majors, and it's rather fun. But I don't think it would have any appeal to people who aren't majoring in BME.",
    "Required course :)",
    "Would recommend to other students (although you probably have to take it if you're BME). Lab reports take a lot of time, but you have two weeks! The labs are pretty fun, too.",
    "Great course with Rong Fan! Not too much work and pretty fun",
    "Really fun labs. Best lab course I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you're looking at this course, you're probably a BME. However, if you're not, don't be scared away by the fact that everyone who takes this seems to be a BME. If you need a half a Sc credit, I think this is a great and really accessible lab. It says there's programming in Matlab, but really there isn't. You mostly just copy and paste the same 10 lines of code all semester. If you don't know Matlab, just come clean to your partners and the beginning and I'm sure people would be happy to show you the small amount of ropes you would need for this class. Other than that, the labs are just fun if you have any interest in physiology. You get to use electrode to stimulate your partner's nerves so as to induce their thumb to twitch at a specific frequency. There are also only 5 labs for the whole semester, so you'll get to take some days off. The lab reports are also not unreasonable nor too terribly long.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought the measurements, calculations, and data analysis all interrelated very well to allow students a chance to apply their knowledge of physiological systems and learn more MatLab skills. I found the labs very engaging, especially because it was interesting to see how data from measurements we performed on ourselves compared to typical data. I was not a big fan of MatLab programming before this course, but this class increased my appreciation by showing me how it could be applied in the real life in an accessible way.",
    "As a requirement for BME, this is enjoyable and easy",
    "Any biomedical engineering student",
    "Yes!",
    "If you're BME, you have to take it. I don't know think they let non-BME majors take it, so I don't know what you're doing looking at the evaluations. Regardless, this was one of the more interesting lab courses I've taken, as well as one of the lowest workloads. Professor Fan is fantastic and deeply invested in his students' learning.",
    "I would recommend this course. There were a total of five labs with reports, the last three of which met on a rotation schedule during which students had two weeks to complete a given lab (they never even took a single full lab period to complete). The professor and TFs give a lot of help and the lab reports are not full reports, but rather just answering some questions about the material the professor gives you. That being said, they take a lot of time, about 10 hours each, but you usually have two weeks to write them. Because of the rotation schedule, the lab basically just meets once in the second half of the semester. This lab is required for BME majors, but also a great way to complete a pre-med biology lab. Having some matlab experience is helpful but not necessary. All of the necessary matlab code is given to students. The final exam was a bit more difficult than expected. Going over the lab reports more would have been very helpful in studying."
