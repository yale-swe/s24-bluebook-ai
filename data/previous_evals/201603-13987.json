    "Grounding in political philosophy and the different ideas that were in conversation with one another throughout history",
    "This class was an in-depth study of the philosophical, historical, political, and legal development of the idea of rights and representation ranging from the Ancient Greeks to present day. It required a ton of weekly reading which gave us a holistic view from primary and secondary critical sources. I developed an ability to cull through these different kinds of readings and analyze patterns and broad trends, as well as minute yet critical details about our weekly themes. Definitely one of the most challenging and engaging classes I've taken at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of reading--it could be lessened so that I could have spent more time with each one and understood them better. I liked the presentations at the beginning of class.",
    "The course's main strengths are the excellent course readings and the large amount of knowledge Professor Somos has about the topic. I felt that every reading was very relevant to the course's goals; nothing was shoehorned on or overworked. There are a good amount of readings, but they are very rewarding.",
    "The strength of this course definitely lay in the readings, which pulled from various primary and secondary sources and were extremely interesting and challenging. And although I loved the small size of the class (we had 5 total this semester) I found myself wishing for more people who could add to the discussions we were having. That being said, Prof. Somos did a wonderful job of developing our conversations despite this."
