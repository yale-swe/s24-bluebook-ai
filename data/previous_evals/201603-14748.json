    "AMAZING COURSE. DEF TAKE IT. You are honored to be in the same room as her- take this class!!",
    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes, if you want to develop a more nuanced understanding of current and recent issues in the Middle East then this is an incredible course. Do not take it if you simply want a survey of political history in the Middle East - that is more background to the current events."
