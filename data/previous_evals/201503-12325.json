    "If Ryan Bennett is teaching it, take it! You might find phonology boring now, but once you take this class you'll completely change your mind. The class is really systematic and fair, and you learn so much that you get to actually apply to real data sets of languages (some really obscure, some really common ones, the mix is great!) Enjoy!",
    "'Twas an excellent course! Ryan is very entertaining but also present the material very clearly and effectively. You will laugh at his jokes and frequently find yourself thinking, \"Wow, I can't believe there's actually a language that does that!\" The problem sets could be kind of tedious to write up, but they were usually interesting so it made the extra time more worth it.",
    "I would probably not recommend it unless someone had a pretty serious interest in linguistics and was considering a second major (Ling majors have to take it so the question doesn't really apply there, though I would express generally positive sentiments to people who were required to take it). Although I really liked it, linguistics isn't something that everyone is into (unfortunately) so I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone who was just looking to dabble in the field a bit."
