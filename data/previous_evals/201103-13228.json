    "Great course, I learned a lot.",
    "good.",
    "This was an excellent course. I think Dr. Mayne took an incredible amount of material and distilled it down to the most important points and key concepts. I was challenged in this course with having to synthesize the key concepts from each lecture in order to prepare for the exams. This was challenging, but extremely helpful. I also appreciated the homework assignments as they helped to bring the materials we learned in class to life.",
    "The course was well-organized, well-designed, and well-taught.",
    "The course is very intuitive.",
    "very good course",
    "Structured teaching was very helpful and organized in such a way to develop from basics to the real-life application.I recommend this course to my colleagues",

    "I think this is a fantastic course!",
    "This course covered all of the big chronic diseases and related it very well to nutrition--in other words, it taught exactly what its title said it would teach. We didn't learn any \"useless\" material; everything was pretty relevant to the course, which is very much appreciated.",
    "We covered a lot of material in this course, and it left me with a broad, though introductory, understanding of the role of nutrition in preventing and treating disease. Dr. Mayne does a great job of of teaching the material and it is clear that she really cares about us understanding the subject.",
    "Excellent. The course was strong in the amount and depth of material it covered. It was weak in that sometimes the lectures got monotonous without very much student interaction. However, the sections gave students time to interact with the material, largely making up for this lack of interaction during lecture. The course was very thorough and I got even more out of it than I anticipated.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Really good course, the instructors overall knowledge is the greatest strength.",
    "Great course, the Prof is an expert in the field and it was a honor to take the course with her. While the material is primarily focused on vitamins and nutrients, it was eye opening.",
    "strict",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I learned a lot about vitamins and health and how the food industry markets products to consumers. I learned a lot of useful information for your everyday life."
