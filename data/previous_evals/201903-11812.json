    "Developed basic skills of reading, writing, and listening in Spanish. You will be able to hold very simple conversations with other speakers.",
    "Yo hablo espanol pequeno.",
    "Reinforced previously acquired skills with grammar and vastly expanded vocabulary.",
    "Foundational Spanish skills; the class was a very good balance of challenging our understanding of Spanish while at the same time making it approachable",
    "I learned how to manage my time for this class, since it required the most work.",
    "Ability to speak, read, and write basic level Spanish.",
    "An understanding of the basic concepts of the language",
    "I laughed and had fun each class. I learned through Seora Vazquez that having a positive attitude (especially at 9am) can be the difference between a productive and unproductive class.",
    "I didn't know a lick of Spanish before beginning this class and now I'm listening to songs, reading every sign I can, and excited about the language.",
    "I learned basic Spanish vocabulary and grammar, and how to write, speak and listen to the language."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very fast-paced and it is easy to fall behind if you do not keep up with studying. The daily online homework allows you to remain engaged but it can be a real pain in the ass (there were several nights that my roommate and I forgot about the homework and only remembered at 3 AM). It also meets every day, which, depending on your view of it, could be good or bad (I absolutely hated getting up at 9 AM every morning for this class). That said, if you are willing to engage yourself, participate, and learn, you will gain a valuable understanding of the Spanish language.",
    "The textbook and online access codes are much too expensive. And I think the resources we used in class (like powerpoints) weren't necessarily posted online.",
    "The flipped classroom setting can leave one feeling adrift when working on homework, but after reinforcement through excellent in class teaching the concepts stick very effectively.",
    "Strengths: structure of the class (timing of exams, final exam content, ie) was very straightforward Weaknesses: online homework was not always the best way to practice what was learned in class; most people did not complete the homework as it was such a small part of the overall grade which meant that when we would go over in class with partners, it was an inefficient use of time",
    "I feel like it bypassed some really important topics in class, but they were highlighted on the test.",
    "The course is thorough and well-rounded in term of teaching style. However, the class is extremely fast pace, which is not so conducive to learning a new language.",
    "Consistent work allows for easy learning. Timing of homework didnt allow for concepts to be remembered",
    "I think we could spend less time each class period doing worksheets and more time practicing speaking.",
    "I think it would have been helpful to speak a little more spanish than we did. While there was still a substantial amount, the bursts of english interrupted the train and allowed us to think in english and then translate, a method our professor warned against.",
    "We should have practiced more listening activities in class."

   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for an easy, no-effort language, take one of the notoriously easy ones and stay away from Spanish. If you actually want to learn the language like I did, then take it! It's a great introduction to a new culture and language, and it will ease your transition into new communities\/meeting new people if you have a major language under your belt.",
    "Si. Espanol es una lengua muy bien.",
    "This class is ideal for people of all skill levels with language learning, provided they have no experience with Spanish. For those who do but placed in, 125 might be better suited to their skill set.",
    "Yes; compared to the intensity of other language classes (ie French), this class was not as intense and the instructor was phenomenal",
    "Yes, I thought the course was very beneficial even for a beginner!",
    "Yes. If they want to learn Spanish this is a good course to do so",
    "Yes! I think it is a great introduction to the Spanish language.",
    "Absolutely. I went in feeling indifferent about the Spanish and now I cannot wait for next semester to begin."
