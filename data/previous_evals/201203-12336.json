   "comments": [
    "The course seemed disorganized at times. I felt like we were jumping back and forth between topics without a clear direction or idea of where we were going. It gave a good overview of a lot of different topics, but Professor Zinn's lectures were hard to follow most of the time, and the problem sets got a little ridiculous toward the end.",
    "Lots and lots of memorization. It's sort of like the organic chemistry of astronomy. The material is overall pretty interesting though, and if you want to make it less stressful there's always the Cr\/D option.",
    "I don't want to sound mean, but this is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Zinn is a good person, always patient and friendly, but he did nothing to make this class's already extraordinarily boring material more bearable. As a science class, ASTR 310 is exceptionally conceptual. Most of the questions on the midterm and final were essay questions, sometimes going into trivial details that we only glossed over in class (and it doesn't help that class mostly consists of all five of us resisting the temptation to fall asleep and counting the number of minutes left until the end of class). I wanted to cry every time I got stuck studying for the exams because I didn't catch Zinn's explanation in class and I couldn't find any resources to help me understand the stuff. The psets got up to 10 pages long once, and some of those questions required us to measure some fuzzy pictures with a ruler or plot graphs by hand. None of these appeared on the exams or made us feel slightly more enlightened. Can I just ask... why?",
    "Covers a lot of material. Lectures are not always that interesting, but the material is interesting. Problem sets usually are not too bad, and Professor Zinn is very helpful, even if sometimes he expects a lot from students. If you're an astro major, you already like this stuff -- otherwise, this course might send you to sleep."
