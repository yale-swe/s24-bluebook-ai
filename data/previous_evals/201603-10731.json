   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write more effectively and create more interest in my work.",
    "This course introduced me to the modern essay, and greatly improved my self-presentational writing skills. In this course, I learned to view my life as a source of inspiration in my writing as opposed to being irrelevant to it. I was also introduced to some exciting new authors while being grounded in classic essayists such as Jonathan Swift and E.B. White.",
    "A better understanding of myself as a writer and as a person, exposure to some truly wonderful essays, both by fellow students and by acclaimed writers.",
    "I became better at thinking about my own writing.",
    "This is an amazing course. In which I learned how to write essays that were interesting and continued important public points. I gained skills that made my writing more complex and enjoyable. I found a love for writing and was introduced to a new potential career. I really enjoyed all the class readings from the New Yorker, The Rolling Stones, and more. They all taught me new skills and introduced me to so many new thoughts and experiences.",
    "I was exposed to creative nonfiction, much like what you would see in the New Yorker; good writing techniques to effectively communicate to the modern day reader",
    "I felt that through this course, I became a much better writer. I learned to think about my writing both stylistically and holistically, and I was better able to create and emphasize a core message in my essays. Furthermore, I became better at revising and editing my essays for final drafts. Additionally, I improved my close-reading abilities and became a better reader of essays.",
    "learnt more about myself as a writer since the writings were largely personal-centric. I also appreciated many of the readings this class entailed, for they were all insightful and amazing pieces of work.",
    "I LEARNED HOW TO WRITE! This course approaches writing in a very manageable way (5 short essays, each on a different topic\/unit, 1200-1500 words each). Coming into this course, I had no clue I even had a writing style and was very skeptical about my own abilities...coming out, writing is no longer scary to me, it is even comforting. Through office hours with Professor Stuart, I have learned my strengths and weaknesses as a writer and am so much more confident and comfortable going forward. You also become a careful reader in this course, and a lot of the material is, in my opinion, pretty enjoyable to read.",
    "Through this course, I was able to learn concrete writing that I can apply to various forms of writing in the future, from other English essays to lab reports."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength is definitely the structure. Five essays, ten weeks, a first draft one week and a final draft the next. Another strength was the mountain of resources provided to us by our professor; I never felt like i didn't know where to look if I had a question or an idea. One weakness is that each student only gets to be workshopped once during the semester. I personally found the class' comments very enlightening and helpful during my revision, and I wish we could somehow increase the frequency of the workshops themselves.",
    "The course provides a good overview of essay-writing styles. It could be improved, however, by spending more time examining how these styles could be used to improve one's own writing.",
    "The strengths of this course include that it is taught in a seminar style which allows you to engage in the discussions and also makes it more enjoyable since it does not feel like a regular class. I also enjoy the way the class is structured in terms of getting feedback with the conferences with the professor and the workshops in class where you receive peer suggestions.",
    "This course does a fantastic job of exposing us to many different kinds of writing and a diverse set of authors. It also allows us to improve both our writing and reading skills. I really liked that the first draft is always ungraded, as I felt this allowed for more experimentation with the first draft and a better final essay. I do not have any comments for improvement.",
    "A strength would definitely be its readings as well as how this course is discussion based and hence exposes students to various outlooks on different issues. One weakness is that I sometimes found what we discussed in class a little repetitive and redundant as these were things that had already been discussed in the blog posts every student had to write.",
    "This course is absolutely wonderful. It helps every student tap into his\/her creativity, the class blog ensures that everyone is participating, and the workshop aspect brings the class together and allows for friendships to form with one's peers. I can't even think of any weaknesses.",
    "The strengths of this course is that because of the small class size, there is room for lots of individual attention for each student. Therefore, student growth is amplified. A weakness of the course was that for each teacher, not all of the syllabi are lined up so it is difficult to collaborate\/edit other students as an extra resource who are taking other sections because they have not covered parts of the unit yet.",
    "The course is, for the most part, taught by very enthusiastic and respected professors. Every class has around the same assignments, so if you have friends in a different section as you, you can still talk out the papers with each other."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys writing, particularly about their own thoughts and emotions. If you only like to write lab reports and research papers, this course may not be the one for you.",
    "Shop it if you feel even slightly interested in it! The writing is enjoyable, the pieces you read are great, and the class is low stress, generally.",
    "If you're looking to read interesting essays and write some of your own, this is a pretty straightforward class. Lots of reading and writing\/revising, so if that interests you, take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend thus course to another student, especially with Professor Stuart. It is one of those classes where the homework does not even feel like work, it is fun, and you look for3ward to going to class because you can not wait to discuss what you have read. The best class I took this semester, hands down. It is a perfect class whether you are a STEM major or a humanities major. You will see yourself progressively getting better.",
    "I would definitely recommend any Yale student who wants to break out of traditionally academic writing into something equally as challenging. The A won't come easily, but you definitely become a better writer and clearly see your progress; fascinating class, and the readings are great. Professor Stuart is helpful and honest about how she views your writing style and will always give credit where credit is due. It's about an average workload if you want to do well, you're going to have to work hard!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student who wants to become a better writer and reader. I learned a lot and enjoyed the course material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I felt like I learnt more about myself as well as of America and other prominent issues throughout the course.",
    "Absolutely. Whether you are someone who thinks of writing as scary or someone who is a potential English major, I believe this course will help you a lot. Besides improving your abilities, it is so much FUN to analyze all of these essays and discuss themes, techniques, and symbolism with your classmates. Several essays that we read in class had a profound impact on me, and I will not forget them.",
    "I have already recommended this course to other students because it is fundamental to various writing skills that can be applied to many fields, whether in the humanities or the sciences.",
    "Totally, if you see yourself writing at all in your future (which you probably will be), take this class."
