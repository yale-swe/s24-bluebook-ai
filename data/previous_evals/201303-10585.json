   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the language.",
    "It's definitely a fast-paced and fairly intense class, but still manageable if you put your honest daily work in. A great way to learn the language (it also helps a lot if you're familiar with Latin or an inflected language, different endings but similar structure). I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Classics, or who wants a nice intellectual challenge.",
    "Yes - if you are committed to learning a lot of difficult grammar, take the class. It's easier if you already speak Latin, but accessible to everyone. It is hard, but manageable, and Greek is such a wonderfully rich and literary language that I felt my understanding of English was enriched even after learning the first handful of vocab words.",
    "An intensive introduction to Greek grammar and a bit of vicab",
    "Yes. Would recommend. The book is probably one of the best, the course structure is conducive for consistent progress, the instructors are very good."
