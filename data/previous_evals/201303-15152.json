    "Yes. Very Much. Professor Skowronek deftly navigated one of the most complicated periods of American History and took us along with him. If you want to deepen your understanding of the progressive period and how it flowed from prior events and continues to shape new ones this is the class to take.",
    "This class takes on the very complex and broad topic of twentieth-century progressivism. The first few weeks engage with the theory behind these ideas. The course then moves into the \"practice\" element for the remainder of the meetings, so keep in mind that the first few weeks are not necessarily representative of the rest of the semester. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in twentieth-century American history and politics who is excited to think critically about a large and diverse selection of reading."
