    "Yes, very interesting course. Very eye opening for anyone who is interested in keeping an open mind about America's race issues.",
    "comparative ethnic studies was a spectacular class that included the most cutting-edge scholarship in this crucially important field, bridged the classroom & our experiences in community, & held some of the raddest students on campus. birgit is an unparalleled educator - a brilliant scholar whose pedagogy is rooted in love. she is unafraid to dismantle hierarchies between teacher & student, university & community, who the oppressor has told us has value & who we are in our own souls. her classroom is undoubtedly student-centered, where students can ask questions, share experiences, & build their visions without fear. there are many opportunities to direct your learning towards what matters to you - in discussion, weekly reading responses, the class unit design, the vision exercise, & the final project. this is the class everyone should take to experience education as liberation, realize they have a role, & learn about who they want to become.",
    "AMAZING.",
    "Take this class if you are at all considering ER&M. Pushes you to think more critically about our world and systemic issues.",
    "take it",
    "I would recommend ER&M 300 to everyone who wants to become a better inhabitant of what used to be Turtle Island before the genocide of indigenous peoples and is now called America. Every week students come to the seminar having done assigned readings about the week's topic and having written a reading response about them the day before. Examples of weekly topics include \"Ethnic Studies in the United States,\" \"Queer of Color Feminism,\" \"The Business of Detention,\" and \"Food Sovereignty.\" In class, Brander-Rasmussen starts discussion with either questions or other framing, and student discussion fills the rest. Sometimes there's a video or group discussion. Aside from weekly reading responses, there's a vision exercise assignment in which students do a project in which they imagine a better future - whether that be in terms of racial politics, sexuality, etc. The final project is also open, anything that pertains to course material will work, and you submit a proposal a few weeks in advance.",
    "YES. I recommend it highly! I wish everyone had the chance to take this course with Professor Birgit.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class as a requirement to everyone.",
    "One of the best classes I've ever taken. Idk how it will be after Birgit leaves because I think she made that class what it is.",
    "This is a class that is driven by the participation of your peers. Part of the beauty in this class is that it engages with texts rigorously while thriving off of the comments\/experiences\/perspectives of your peers. Only take this class if you are willing to work and to share-- only then will it be transformative and truly worthwhile.",
    "It is a discussion of contemporary racial\/ethnic issues that are important to you. Guided by relevant readings. Mostly focused on student input."
