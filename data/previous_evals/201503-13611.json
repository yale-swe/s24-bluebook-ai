    "A great foundational course that builds off of both macro and micro. Really interesting material, a reasonable amount of math, reasonable workload\/difficulty",
    "Prof. Lindenlaub did a great job teaching the course (especially considering that this is only her second year teaching. She makes an effort to learn the names of all the students in the class and makes herself pretty available. The course is pretty challenging and requires ability to work through some seriously awful (and unnecessary) Algebra on the psets. I felt like the math was so tedious on the problem sets that I didn't learn as much from them as I could have. If you're a strong econ major, this course won't be too much of an issue for you. That being said, exams can be tough and have some annoying curve balls that can destroy your grade.",
    "This class is very difficult. If you are very interested in complicated microeconomic labor market models and have a strong grasp of calculus I would say take this class, if not then definitely take something else.",
    "A great course - introduced economic approaches to some of the most interesting issues of our time - e.g. inequality, the minimum wage, the decline of the manufacturing sector. Prof. Lindenlaub was an effective and accessible instructor. Exams were not easy but the class was curved.",
    "I enjoyed this class. The lectures were very clear and the class was structured well. It's not as exciting as some of the seminars, but if you don't want to take a seminar then this is a good class. The tests and problem sets are hard, but there is a strong curve. So don't take it if you're scared of math.",
    "Yes if you don't mind the work.",
    "Totally recommend this class. Provides great insight into the current literature on labor economics, technological change, wealth and income inequality. Also teaches you a great deal of the theory.",
    "Take this class; it's one of the best at yale. The material ranges between interesting and super interesting, hw is ok (if mathematically ridiculous), the professor is awesome. Tests are tricky but don't worry because the class is curved.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! I was looking for a labor economics class for a long time, so I was glad to see this being taught. If you're interested in labor markets, education, and\/or public policy, this could definitely be an interesting class for you. I also especially liked the integration between a theory\/model-driven approach with empirical studies and applications offered by the course. A brief caveat: ECON 416 is relatively hard (which shouldn't be too surprising for a 400-level class), and it moves relatively quickly. I would consider (at least) starting the course Credit\/D if you can. Overall, though, a strong course - and one that I expect will get even better over time.",
    "Not sure if I would recommend it, to be honest. The potential is very high, but if you are looking for an interesting class where you will learn a lot, this isn't the class, I'd say. It is also tons of work and more challenging than Intermediate Micro, so shouldn't take it for an easy credit either. However, if you want to put in the work, then yeah sure go ahead. Only biweekly psets, but they took forever and were definitely the worst part of my week.",
    "This was an awesome class. It was totally eye-opening as to what is going on in America right now. I highly recommend the class. It is difficult, but it is worth it. The work load is pretty low, but the information is extremely complex. Ilse is a great professor, really liked that she taught us these things. She also brought a different POV since she is foreign. Highly recommend reading the textbook as supplement to the class. I plan on reading the textbook again over break!"
