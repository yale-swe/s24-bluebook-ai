Great, great class to understand how to use R effectively. What to do to start analyzing data, and some first statistical analysis. I feel more comfortable dealing with data, and have a much better use of R.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really interesting and great course.",
    "The strength is that the professor allows us to engage with the course as much as we want. The weakness is that after a point, I didn't feel like there was a lot of structure to it.",
    "Can strengthen programming skills",
    "This class was fantastic, probably my favorite class this semester. Jonathan is such a great lecturer, he always makes jokes, keeps the audience engaged and motivated. His explanations of the statistical theory were also super clear, he always had powerpoints ready. His lectures were also fantastic. He always had a code prepared for the class, we could follow along while he was lecturing. The examples were always interesting, and I feel like I had understood everything we needed to at the end of the class. The homework for the class were also super relevant, and a great application of what we saw in class. The midterms were also a good way to check on what we learned. And I really enjoyed the freedom to choose data for a final project. All the lectures are video-captured, which is good if there is something we missed from class, but not a lot of people showed us in class, which I think is a shame because Jonathan is such a great lecturer! Piazza was also a great ressource for the course. And the TA team was also fantastic.",
    "This course is really helpful, because it starts from entry level, and it is also really logical, which can make it easier for students without any R background to catch up.",
    "This is a great introduction to R programming language. Class was engaging and hands on and I appreciated the flexibility of participating in class online if needed.",
    "The teaching and ULA support in this course was phenomenal. I can't fault the course in any way.",
    "Organized very well",
    "The online videos are amazing.",
    "It covered a broad range of topics, which was great, but it was unclear in what direction we were moving in a given week and how it tied together well",
    "The course is very well-organized.",
    "Maybe engage more with theory",
    "It is great that we can watch the record of the class.",
    "The strengths of the class are that it provides a good structure and pace for learning R from the start. By the end, it feels we have come a long way."

    "I learnt a lot from this course. It's really a great course for learning R.",
    "I would! Fantastic way to learn how to code in R!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to use R. It is useful for so many other fields. And this course does not require any prerequisites, besides an intro stats class (which is not also super important, as Jonathan will go over the main results in class).",
    "Yes, the professor makes the class and material interesting. A lot of homework sets allows us to learn\/struggle with coding and receive feedback relatively quickly.",
    "Yes, cause it is logical and clear, it can teach you how to use R to solve problems.",
    "Yes! Definitely if you want to improve your R skills and stats knowledge in a very practical way.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The hands on approach to learning how to program was excellent, and I think anyone interested in learning how to use R could benefit from this class.",
    "Yes. This is a great way to learn a programming language and build on intro statistics",

    "Yes, great course to anyone looking to familiarize herself with R.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn R as well as to improve your understanding of statistics.",
    "Yes, because we can learn basic stats concepts and coding skills.",
    "Yes, it is a very useful course",
    "Yes. I believe it is great for biology student to learn some coding and data analysis.",
    "Yes, I believe this course is essential for anyone who is dealing with large amounts of data analysis in their career."
