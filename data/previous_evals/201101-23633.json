   "comments": [
    "I'd say Kant is really a basic footnote to modern philosophy. He's not so entertaining all the time. But if by any chance you get to read more philosophy (or are a philosophy major), you might find more dots connected eventually.",
    "I think that this class is appropriate only for those who have an adequate background in the history of modern philosophy, who have found Kant in particular to be intriguing. This class goes through the text and reveals the strength of Kant's arguments, which is often, for better or for worse, hidden by his difficult prose. The commentary becomes an invaluable aid in reading Kant, as well as Prof. Winkler's lecture hand-outs. Prof. Winkler was a good lecturer, but I rarely felt challenged in lecture to do more than follow his hand-outs and follow the passages he was reading out loud.I had a negative paper-writing experience, and I found the TA and the prof. to be unhelpful in improving my writing.",
    "Take this class. Kant is important (of course) and Winkler is great.",
    "It is a long period of time with one, extremely dense and often-times confusing text. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a merely passing interest in philosophy. If you are interested in philosophy, however, it's a good way to exercise one's philosophical chops in evaluating and critiquing arguments and coming to understand a highly influential text.",
    "I took this class because a friend of mine told me that it changed your life. That's a high expectation to have walking into a class, but I can see where she was coming from. winkler is amazing, as always. I've been trying to figure out what makes him so good, and I think it's the way he gives the impression of figuring it out with you, of really considering what you're saying like it might possibly be the right answer, then really asking himself what he thinks about it, and explaining it to you. there's a kind of genuineness to the way he does philosophy, and a desire to bring you on board. he's also incredibly charming and articulate in a philosopher kind of way.kant, of course, brings down the house. a lot of \"whoa\" moments in this class, which is weird cuz the book is so dense. the best part about kant is the way he really scrapes at the bottom of what we can understand. this class got me thinking a lot about the relationship between concepts and consciousness, the way cognition is in itself a conceptual activity. Also, kant on the self and on things-in-themselves is really cool. generally, the content of the course is awesome.that said, I could see how some people wouldn't like this course. it's one book the whole time, so you have to be excited about it. but the risk is worth the reward.",
    "This class is excellent for serious student of philosophical material. If you are interested in Kant, take it. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Very hard. Sometimes excellent, but I got checked out midway through the semester and it was impossible to catch up.",
    "This is very possibly the best course I've taken at Yale. Gives you a thorough knowledge of one of the most difficult and most important books in modern philosophy. Winkler does a great job connecting the Critique to other important works and philosophers of the era. Eric Guindon is a terrific TA.",
    "I would not recommend taking this as your first philosophy class. It's only a 200-level class but definitely one of the hardest philosophy courses I've taken, and I'm a major. It's not the workload that's difficult -- it's the actual content of the lectures and readings. You cannot just get by in class; you either put in a lot of work or are hopelessly lost. That's Kant for you. Take it if you'll have time to try to understand the Critique. If you are, you'll be better for having learned about one of the most, if not the most, significant pieces of modern philosophy.",
    "Definitely take this course. I'm a math major that had never taken a philosophy class before and really loved this class. The course is difficult and the essays are tough if you have never taken a phil class before, but I think that overall the experience is worth it. Probably the most rewarding course that I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student with an interest in philosophy or metaphysics. The Critique is really interesting and Winkler was great at explaining it. I would not recommend the class to a student who does not have any background in philosophy (i.e. don't make this your first philosophy course ever). Be prepared for some really hard reading, but if you read the assigned guide book with the Kant, thinks should be more clear. And lecture basically covers anything that you might not have understood from reading alone. Really, I think this is a great course that people interested in philosophy should take if they can.",
    "This class is wonderful. I would recommend it to all philosophy majors and to anyone that has some background in philosophy and is interested in more (e.g. someone who completed D.S.). Winkler is an excellent lecture, one of the best I've had at Yale. He is funny, engaging, interested in the material, open to different interpretations and ideas, and very good at explaining difficult concepts.",
    "I think you have to really be interested in Kant to get excited about this class. Kenneth Winkler is great, but for me this was still my least favorite class of this semester. I don't think it was anything particularly wrong with the class\/teachers, simply the level of inaccessibility of the material and my personal distaste for Kant's writing style. Make sure you're willing to do the leg work and that's what's going to make you happy before you take this class.",
    "This was a really interesting class but pretty difficult - Kant is very dense and since you're reading the same book for the whole semester you can't really afford to skip any reading. Don't take this class unless you have a lot of experience in philosophy. It's manageable but you're definitely at a disadvantage if you aren't familiar with the terms being used and the philosophers everyone brings up in section. Professor Winkler is amazing though"
