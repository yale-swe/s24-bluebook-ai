    "Take it if you want some change in your daily routines and vision. But open your mind and let it permeate through you than selectively accepting by your premature judgements.",
    "A ton of work, and a ton of money. But your art will improve tremendously. It's a trade off. If you're serious about painting and have a couple hundred extra bucks to pay for the materials, then this is the class for you. However, if you're looking for a low-key painting class, then take basic painting instead.",
    "If you want to learn how to discipline yourself, or if you want to learn how to paint or if you want to discover who you are, you should take this class. I'm not an art major, but this was the second-best class I've taken at Yale. Also if you decide to take it, try to become friends with your classmates. You spend quite a bit of time around each other and their thoughts can be really valuable."
