   "comments": [
    "Rob Blair makes this class a joy, but unfortunately he's going to Brown next year so the course will probably be restructured and taught by a new professor. I'd still recommend it though, and particularly for Global Affairs majors, as it's cross-listed in development and security and provides a good mix of both.",
    "Would recommend the class for people seriously interested in civil wars and post-conflict reconstruction and development. Would not recommend as intro class for wars or development, but good class to learn the fundamental papers and issues.",
    "I generally enjoyed this class. The other students were really engaged with the material, which made class discussions productive. Prof. Blair is also engaging though sometimes can go off on a tangent about things for a long period of time. The readings are interesting, though they often don't seem to be the best readings for that particular topic, so class time is often spent discussing different readings altogether.",
    "Great course. Tl;dr Professor Blair was a great seminar leader and probably one of my best at Yale. The syllabus struck the right balance between breath and depth of civil wars and material was always interesting. Throughout the course, we covered different aspects of the causes, conduct and consequences of civil wars and what policy responses the international community can do to try and reduce the duration of war or the chance of relapse. We had to choose two case study countries that we then applied all of the larger themes of the course to in our assignments. It was a cool way to learn about different countries and to have a more tangible application of the readings. While the syllabus seems like a lot of work, it was actually very manageable. It was one 2 page paper, one 5 page paper, one mini presentation, one group debate, and one final 15-20 page paper. Since all of them are on the same two case studies, you use a lot of the same background research for the assignments so they go by really quickly. Professor Blair was a fair\/generous grader. There was a nice variety of activities each week. Rather than being strictly discussion, lectures, or presentations (which sadly most seminars fall into one of those buckets), we had a good mix each week. By cold-calling at the beginning of class, it made sure everyone did a decent amount of the reading and was a much better mechanism than reading responses (which is a waste of everyones time and most people still dont do most of the reading). The only thing that was a little weird at first was that some students are clearly passionate about this subject and have taken 3-4 similar courses already. I personally didnt know that much about random civil wars during the 20th century but was able to catch up quickly and never felt at a disadvantage.",
    "Absolutely take the class. Professor Blair is really great and has a lot of creative ideas for how students can learn the often dense material surrounding civil wars. It's a great survey course that emphasizes how to think rather than just how to become fluent in the issues. I feel smarter for having taken this class. I loved it. I hope he teaches it again.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to get a general perspective on how empirical political scientists think about the period just before and after the end of a conflict. I would also recommend this class if you would like to know some of the motivations for conflict that can be quantifiable or observed. I would not recommend this class if you would like to delve more profoundly into the context of certain conflicts or if you would like to understand it within broader theoretical fields.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, it's one of the best I've taken in my time at Yale! The topic is great, the course structure is great, the teaching is great, and you will learn a ton.",
    "This was an incredible class -- great readings, tough but very engaging teaching. The debate was fun, and the whole structure lent itself very well to a better understanding of civil war\/post-conflict situations in the abstract, but grounded by your personal case studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend it with Robert Blair. You get to learn a lot about post-conflict politics and the technicalities of political science arguments as well."
