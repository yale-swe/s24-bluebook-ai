    "Wholeheartedly!",
    "Awesome class. Professor Schwartz gives really interesting lectures that will make you love the stuff.",
    "yes i would. provides a great, broad, all encompassing view of something many people know very very little about but think they know.",
    "Not an easy way to knock off a pre-industrial rest-of-the-world, but certainly effective.",
    "Take it! Schwartz is great, there's plenty of reading but its really interesting and you don't have to do it all. Great rest of the world but also just a great class.",
    "A broad, comprehensive look at the social, cultural, political, and economic aspects of the colonial period throughout Latin America, including Brazil. The course briefly looks at indigenous societies (Aztecs, Incas, etc.) but doesn't go beyond independence. The lectures and readings on Brazil were GREAT, and all other material was interesting. Grading is not terribly hard, but there are a lot of assignments (the ten page final paper is demanding but doesn't make up much of your final grade). However, I recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the period or the region.",
    "This is a great lecture course, especially for fulfilling the \"rest of the world\" requirement. Professor Schwartz is always interesting and entertaining in his lectures and some of the readings are particularly interesting.",
    "I would, especially if you're looking for a rest of the world or pre-industrial credit. The course focuses on a really formative period in the history of the Americas, and perfectly complements courses on North American colonialism and 18th century revolutions.It's a lot of work, but really rewarding. 2 papers, a midterm and a final, and on average about 250-300 pages of reading a week (though doing all of it as by no means necessary).",
    "If you are interested in the subject, absolutely. It is great introduction to the topic. And Schwartz ROCKS. He is an excellent lecturer. A good rest of world credit too for history majors. Really enjoyable.",
    "Good course overall - good way to get a rest of the world. Schwartz does expect you to do all the reading, and so will skim over a lot of the topics that feature in those readings. You get a sense of what happened during the colonial period but it really takes until studying for the final for you to actually put everything together - the lectures go back and forth a lot which can sometimes get confusing. But overall I'd recommend the course",
    "Absolutely. I came to this class w\/o any previous knowledge of the period or area -- I barely knew Latin America existed. After taking this course, I now understand what happened in the colonial period and what the implications are. The readings can be a bit tough if you know nothing in the beginning, but the workload is manageable. Lectures are fantastic, and sections are very well organized.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin America, other history majors in general, and especially history majors that need to complete the 300 level requirement for the major. Stuart Schwartz is the person to take a Latin America lecture from, and if you get a good TA, this course will teach you a lot. Some of the readings can be tough, but they also aren't vital to the tests, and the lectures are enjoyable. The courseload isn't too much, one short and one long paper, plus midterm and final exam. The second paper isn't based on readings, so you need to be interested in a topic that isn't covered by lecture or readings, but that shouldn't be too difficult, as a lot is missed in such a broad survey--covering a continent and a half over 4 centuries.",
    "There is A LOT of reading for this course. Probably more than you could possibly finish. However, it is an awesome class. Professor Schwartz is an incredible lecturer and the class covers a huge portion of history, all of which is very interesting. Also, this is one of the few history classes that covers this part of the world, which is why I took it. Don't let the reading worry you- if you want to learn a lot about Latin America, or just want to get the \"Rest of the World\" part of your History requirements out of the way, this is a great chance to do either.",
    "I would recommend it. Know that it's a lot of work. You can get away without doing the significant reading (though I imagine it would enrich your experience--it seemed to be pretty interesting), but you'll still have 2 papers to write, a midterm, and a final. I took it Credit\/D, which was a good choice, because Stuart Schwartz is a character and a good story-teller. So the lectures were entertaining, though it sometimes felt like they lacked a little historical rigor. Though I often felt a little guilty in section that I hadn't opened that week'sbook, I picked up enough from the lectures and the discussions that an hour or two of studying was sufficient.Overall definitely a worthwhile experience, all the more so if you take it seriously."
