    "I would definitely recommend this course. It provided a great introduction to academics at Yale by putting students in supportive dialogue with one another in the classroom and connecting them with a professor who is such an expert in her field, as well as someone who obviously cares quite deeply about her relationship with students. It will be a very memorable class experience for me.",
    "Absolutely! If you're looking for a general introduction into China, this is a great course to take. It examines China from different perspectives and allows you to come to your own conclusions regarding it. Davis is a great prof, though she may at first seem rather aloof. Lectures were interesting and complemented the reading. Do the reading for this course, or you'll be lost. Grading tends to be slightly harsh but manageable. Two papers, one debate, one final, so overall a good courseload. Readings at times can be rather dry.",
    "SOCY 086 01 is a introductory course to modern Chinese society and social change. I passionately recommend it to anyone interested in this rising superpower. You could have little prior knowledge about China, or you could have, like me, spend all my life there. Either way you are going to enjoy this class tremendously.",
    "The topic was very interesting but the class was very boring. I would not recommend taking the class as an introduction to Yale College.",
    "If you are actually interested in the subject matter then this is a great introduction class to Chinese society. don't take this class if you don't want to do readings as that is the key way you will learn in this course. Also this course has subjective grading so this is not a course for an easy A. However if you can put those two things aside this is a fascinating class which really does give great insight into Chinese society.",
    "A great class for freshmen. I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in China.",
    "I do not think I would recommend this course. I don't feel as though it peaked my interest or changed my viewpoint on anything.",
    "I would recommend to who are super interested in China or curious about sociology major.",
    "It is an excellent introduction to Chinese society and to sociology. If you are interested in learning about Chinese history and culture and their effects on the development of modern China, there is probably no better class. The professor is very knowledgeable, and the course materials are engaging. A wide range of subjects are covered, from developing ideas of family relations, to internet censorship, to Chinese environmentalism. It has been my favorite class of my first semester at Yale, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. You have to really care about the subject to get the most out of this course, but if you're interested in Chinese society, this seminar provides a great overview of how the individual's role in society has shifted since the 1980s. The class is structured into three sections, with three group debates and one fairly simple final. Overall, it was really interesting to see the differences in the perspectives of the Chinese international students and the American-born students in the class, and you get to learn a lot from your classmates.",
    "I would recommend the class for someone who is not very familiar with China. It is a good introductory course that allows the student to easily engage with the topic at hand. However, for someone who is very knowledgeable about China, I would not recommend this course."
