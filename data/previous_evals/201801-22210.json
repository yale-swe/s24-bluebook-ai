    "I learned a considerable amount about Mediterranean historiography in this course, particularly about the different strategies for presenting the history of a region in a book-length work and the authorial biases which can emerge. Through various essays and projects, the course fostered research skills and critical engagement with a particular historical topic."

    "Close discussion of the readings, great individual assignments broadening the perspective. Horden&Purcell could be replaced with other readings (e.g. Goitein)",
    "More discussion on original sources such as newly built historical or archeological databases on Mediterranean studies could be introduced.",
    "The strength of this course was its breadth of focus; we read several works of historiography about the Mediterranean region and compared them critically, determining which books were more successful than others and how they could be improved. We had genuinely interesting and entertaining discussions about both the history of the Mediterranean and scholars' efforts to grapple with the impossible task of encapsulating the subject in a single tome, albeit often a hefty one. I think that the most effective aspect of the course was when sections of long books were divided between students and presented to the rest of the class. The course could potentially be improved by reordering the schedule of readings, although I think that it worked well enough in the order that we followed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the course addressed one of the most prevalent areas of historic research. Far beyond Medieval Europe, the Mediterranean model can and has been applied to other regions and eras in global history (Indian Ocean, Atlantic History, Pacific) and the literature on the topic remains significant for adjacent fields.",
    "Yes, it provides a new perspective to think about the history of medieval Europe, North Africa, as well as Asian minor as a connected entity.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in the ancient and medieval history of the Mediterranean, especially one who plans to write about it in their scholarship or whose work in another field, such as art history or literature, pertains to Mediterranean history in any way. It is a very useful course for examining the biases of historiography and strategies for historiographical writing."
