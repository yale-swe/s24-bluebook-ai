   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking this course with Professor Payne. He teaches the material very comprehensively and it fits very well with the prep problems and video lectures you're asked to do before class. Expect to put plenty of time into this course, but you'll come out really understanding the material.",
    "Standard calculus class with two midterms and weekly problem sets. Take it with Professor Payne if you can. He's an engaging lecturer and very helpful if you have questions.",
    "MATH 115 is a sufficient challenge for those who successfully completed AP Calculus AB and a worth refresher for those who have taken AP Calculus BC in their past. However, the class is not enjoyable. Many have success without even going to class regularly, which is disappointing. If Samuel Payne is your professor, you will be rewarded if you are a good and\/or participatory student. Otherwise, you may find him dismissive or unhelpful.",
    "The material is...well...a large quantity of math, without too many real-world applications. I didn't particularly find the \"reverse classroom\" format helpful, and I would have preferred to just learn the material in class, instead of doing online prep materials. Barring these shortcomings in the course, I couldn't have asked for a professor any better than Sam Payne. He's excellent at explaining tricky concepts to the average human being and to the \"I won math competitions in high school\" student alike. Most importantly, he's VERY APPROACHABLE AND ACCESSIBLE--he's always offering up office hours and lunch discussions if you don't understand something, he's SO friendly, and he makes the classroom feel small and intimate.",
    "I would not recommend this course because of the discrepancy between expectations and the actual curriculum. This combined with the fairly large workload can be really stressful.",
    "A hard class. Coming from high school this was a huge difference in terms of difficulty level. The problems in class and on the (very annoying) videos and quizzes are not anything like you will see on the problem sets, and certainly nothing like the exams. You do learn a lot, but it's not easy.",
    "Class needs to be restructured to actually teach new material in class. Solutions to practice exams should be posted.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to a student who wants to continue with calculus. It is a well-organized and well-taught class.",
    "It's a pretty good math course. Take it if you have to. I would never take it just for fun though.",
    "If you are taking 115, Samuel Payne is the best professor you can have.",
    "An in-depth analysis of single variable integral calculus. There was very little focus on derivatives (first week review) and the rest of the semester consisted of studying interesting integration techniques, differential equations, series, and polar coordinates which are a graphing system very different from yet similar to Cartesian coordinates.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 only to students that had a strong background in AP Calculus BC from high school. The material is taught at a quick pace and is quite challenging. Though this course is a lot of work, it is required for many majors and provides the opportunity to understand calculus and its applications.",
    "I would say that math 115 is a great clas for getting the calculus building blocks in order."
