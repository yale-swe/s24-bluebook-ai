    "Strengths are that the material is taught well and the teacher was very engaging. Weakness is that it is very fast moving.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, which is both a strength and weakness. I felt that I learned a lot, but I also feel like there wasn't enough time to thoroughly practice everything I was learning in order to actually master it.",
    "Huge, sometimes unnecessary workload. Course packet and textbook were helpful. Wish there were more readings and longer, but less frequent, writings.",
    "I enjoyed the course overall. I think there should be more daily practice for students to speak Spanish.",
    "The course is very well taught, but grammatical concepts are hard to grasp because the focus on concepts only lasts 2-3 days then the course moves on."

    "Yes. Good class, not too stressful. Juliana was a great professor.",
    "I would, because I think it is important to learn these specific skills in order to actually speak the language.",
    "I would recommend it, though it is a lot of work as languages tend to be.",
    "I think it is a good class for teaching Spanish proficiency. But there was a fair amount of busy work and less speaking in class than I had hoped. Still, overall, very enjoyable."
