   "comments": [
    "Math 118 basically covers linear algebra, and multivariable calculus, not too much in depth. I would totally recommend this class, especially with PROFESSOR MIKI HAVLICKOVA.",
    "It's about 2\/3 a term of linear algebra with 1\/2 a term of multivariable without proofs. Stay on top of your work and you'll do well.",
    "Math 118 is a very good course. It teaches you what you need to know from both Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. Miki is a terrific professor and she makes the class incredibly engaging.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "Math 118 is not that hard but pretty helpful for econ students",
    "Super great - not too fast. I took 112 and 115 before this and wished I had just jumped into 118 from the start. Miki is great",
    "Math 118 is half linear algebra and half multivariable calculus. A lot of the math is abstract so if you like that, then it would be a good course to take.",
    "Math 118 is great if you need an overview of linear algebra and multivariable, especially for econ, but don't want the pain of Math 120. It's not an easy class, to be sure, but it's manageable, and even interesting if you like math.",
    "Take it! If you want to get a QR out of the way, this is a much better alternative to Math 120 and is better taught. However, keep in mind that if you are still considering majoring in something math related, you may have to take math 120 down the line.",
    "Great class if you're not looking for an extremely intense math class, but also one where you learn a lot. Miki does a good job of teaching the classes, and the exams are very reasonable.",
    "YES. TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR HAVLICKOVA.Professor Havlickova is the best Math teacher I've ever had in my life. She is so passionate about teaching, and explains complicated concepts very clearly. Her love towards the material she teaches is contagious, and actually made me like Math (which was a huge surprise for me, since Math has always been a nightmare for me). She is also very available--holds office hours literally every day, and holds extra review sessions for the midterms as well as the final. The professor is so hard working that I would have felt guilty if I hadn't. Overall, taking Math 118 with Professor Havlickova was one of the best decisions I made at Yale.",
    "Take it! Especially if you're an econ major (before Intermediate Micro or Micro Theory).",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to take another math class. It is well taught and makes sense.",
    "Math 118 is a solid class. Miki is a great teacher--she engages with the class and goes out of her way to be available and helpful. Her explanations are easy-to-follow, so definitely go to class rather than trying to learn from the books (which are far less helpful). Decent amount of work with the weekly problem sets, class 3x\/week, and 3 exams. Exams were fair, stay on top of the material and you should be fine.",
    "A good, easy math class that's pretty useful for econ. If you've taken BC, you'll be bored but it is relatively new material. Weekly problem sets are pretty easy, maybe two hours at most if you've been going to class.",
    "I recommend this class to any Econ majors, as the topics covered are very useful in intermediate and higher level courses.",
    "Yes, especially for those who simply wants intro knowledge to linear algebra. It's a good alternative to taking Math 120 + the higher linear algebra course offered. The material is manageable, the instructor is helpful, and the exams and psets are fair.",
    "I would definitely take it if you are in between Calculus II and Multivariable calculus.",
    "Take this class if you are thinking of majoring in Economics or in any other social science. This is the only math class you will need to take if you major in Economics, and math 118 is a good class for other social science majors in general. Professor Havlickova (Miki) is really a great Professor who will always be ready to help you if you do not understand the material.",
    "If you're an econ major, don't take it unless you like math. You don't need anything from this class that you can't easily teach yourself for further econ.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students for reasons listed above.",
    "Good class, but NOT easy, you have to work for the grade.",
    "I really likeMath 118 because it was the math class that fulfills social science requirements, without having to deal with the proofs of Math 120. Great course for those looking to go in the social sciences, or just don't want to dive right into Math 120.Micky is a good professor. She goes pretty fast through the material, but was always willing to help us out if needed.Good standard math class, all lecture-based.",
    "Take it. It has both linear algebra and calculus, but very manageable. The exam questions are just like the homework, so if you take homework seriously, you will definitely get a good grade out of the class.",
    "Miki is amazing. So nice, so helpful, so dedicated, so professional. You really couldn't ask for more from a professor.",
    "Great course, would highly recommend it! No worries if you haven't done calc extensively, Miki reviews all of it. Miki is a wonderful professor and was always willing to help. The class itself was good and not too difficult if you put in the work. Psets aren't too bad and midterms are fine as long as you practice, practice, practice.",
    "a great introductory course for both calculus and linear algebra. One of the best math teachers I have had and available to review concepts after class and during office hours.",
    "If you enjoy \/ are pretty good at math and are looking to fill a QR requirement, this is a great class, kind of a gem that is well-hidden. It is well taught (if taken with Miki, at least), the material is interesting (I daresay FUN), and it never moves too fast. I'd completely recommend it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so long as you do not need to take further courses in the math department for your major requirements."
