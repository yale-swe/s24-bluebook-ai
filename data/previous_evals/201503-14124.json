    "I would recommend the class, particularly for the experience of creating a hands-on project in a team setting. It was logistically a challenge to coordinate an immersive documentary\/exhibit between 13 students, but ultimately I think we're all proud of the product. The most rewarding part of the class was hearing the stories of people in the New Haven community. I also liked the way Professor Brasseaux structured the course as a transformative kind of learning experience; our discussions and field trips (throughout New Haven, to the Peabody) expanded our conceptions of what humanities scholarship looks like and to whom that scholarship belongs. Public humanities is an exciting new field, and this class presents a unique opportunity to participate in and shape the dialogue surrounding public humanities.",
