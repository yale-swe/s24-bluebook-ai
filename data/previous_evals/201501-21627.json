    "This was a good course. The readings could be long but they were doable. This is a good course if you are an anthropology major or if you just want to get a glimpse into what anthropology is like. A few writing assignments but they weren't too long.",
    "Great class! Take it if you're interested in gaining philosophically abstract and ethnographically concrete perspectives on power\/resistance, fear-terror, hope, space\/time as they relate to violence, and racial hegemony. Come with an open mind and ready to work outside your comfort zone, if you're used to a specific discourse in anthropology or a specific disciplinary framework like quantitative social science, etc. Prof. Lombard is a great discussion starter, and she put a lot of creativity into creating a thoughtful syllabus. I would take this class again if given the chance.",
    "Yes! The class engages with conflict in a rigorous and nuanced way."
