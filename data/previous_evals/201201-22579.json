    "As somebody with no knowledge of the history of the Roman Empire, I was nervous about taking this course. But it ended up being a really fun class and I was amazed by the things that ancient Romans were able to build. I'd recommend this class to anyone! And it has listed readings, which I did at first, but realistically what you will need for he test will be covered in class. You mustcome to class, but that isn't even hard because class is fun.",
    "Roman Architecture is a great intro course for anyone who wants to learn more about ancient civilizations. It is taught in an engaging lecture format, and the class is not one that takes up a lot of your time outside of lecture but is really rewarding. I would recommend this class as a humanities credit or even just as a great class to take.",
    "The success of this course is entirely determined by the effort the students put in. Since it is an Open Yale course, you could conceivably never go to lecture and just take the exams and write on the online Forum. That is not the way to go however. Lectures are far more interesting in person and the monuments are far more appealing to admire in class on the screen. The class would definitely be improved by removing it from the Open Yale selections so more students actively take part in the class. I also wouldn't have minded some more interaction between Professor Kleiner and the TAs with the students.In summary, take the course. It is relatively easy and an interesting topic!",
    "Only if you like the material ... because otherwise that's a lot of monuments to memorize, and you will hate your life at some point.",
    "Great! Professor is passionate. Slides are beautiful! Take this class early in your yale career so you can actually go see the buildings and monuments that you study!",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this class to any students. It is a poor example of what the discipline aspires to be.Studying for the midterms might be one of the most painful mental exercises ever.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer and the material is very interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, it is really interesting no matter what your major is and it was my favorite class this semester. Also professor Kleiner is great.",
    "Take this class. You'll just be more cultured for it. 'Roman Architecture' is the kind of class that you don't put toward your major; you take it because it's objectively fascinating.",
    "If you're interested in the material, Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer. However, it can be hard to motivate that early, and the sheer amount of material for the midterms is overwhelming and takes ALOT of preparation. Only take it if you're truly interested.",
    "This is a great class. You'll learn a lot. The lectures are all on open yale courses, and as far as I can tell she doesn't change them, so you don't have to go to class if you don't want to. Memorization of the monuments is a pain (don't do it all the night before like I tried to do, it will not work), but there's not much work for the class. I definitely recommend the \"design your own Roman city\" option for the paper; it's fun and interesting work, and in my opinion it's easier to get a good grade on that assignment than an actual paper.",
    "The class is very interesting. Prof. Kleiner is great! However, she rarely ends class on time. She is very passionate about the material, and it shows. The workload is minimal - just reading and a term paper. The reading is not really necessary. But, you have to do a lot of studying for the exams - it's basically just memorizing names, dates, and information about all the monuments we learn about.",
    "Small, intimate lecture class with a great group of TAs and an interesting Professor. If you have any interest in Rome or are planning on visiting Rome, this is a good class to know the history of all the monuments and design.",
    "I would recommend this class. It had interesting material that was very well taught.",
    "Prof. Kleiner was fantastic. She is very passionate about roman architecture, and it definitely made me more interested in what could potentially be a dull subject. She was very approachable and extremely knowledgeable. Great professor! The workload is also very small.",
    "I absolutely loved it! I would take it as it's not too much work (though not a light load by any means). The professor is amazing - super intelligent and humorous. The ONLY downside was the online section. It's hard to be proactive about it and everyone's posting the night before the test (two posts are required before each test). I wish there were a section. Otherwise, my favorite class. Get a head start on the paper!",
    "Roman Architecture is a great class. It provides an overview of the evolution of architecture from the early Roman period to Constantinople. I wish there was a little more on the architecture from Constantinople, but you get more than enough before that. You may find it peculiar that you spend a few classes talking about Roman wall painting but it all makes sense in the end. The online forum is also unique but fulfilling. The TAs arealso great. The only negative would probably be the class time, but Kleiner makes it worth going to every lecture. Please do take it -- it is great.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer, and is clearly very passionate about the subject. I also learned a lot about Roman history. The paper was pretty fun to write, too. Only drawbacks are the 9am class time and the online forum. Otherwise, great class!",
    "A wonderful overview of Roman architecture. Professor Kleiner is so knowledgable, eloquent, and sweet. She makes an effort to get to know her students despite the class's large size and lecture format, and is always impeccably dressed (even at 9 am). The class has an online section (via classes v2 forum) instead of an in-person one, which has its plusses and minuses. 4 \"substantial\" posts are required over the course of the semester, plus 2 midterms and a short research paper (6\u00968 pages). An overall manageable amount of work and enjoyable class if you're willing to get out of bed. The lectures are also on open yale courses if you can't wake up one day. But, this means that they feel a little staid\u0097except for Professor Kleiner's gelato recommendations.",
    "Not too difficult, but the exams do require a LOT of memorization. Class is interesting and there's no real outside of class work other than a couple forum posts. Becomes stressful a day or so before the exam, but if you're good at memorizing it should be a pretty easy class.",
    "definitely not unless they want to be bored, uninspired, and never have to go to class..",
    "Definitely recommend. It will change the way you view the world, especially the Yale world. I now find myself looking at buildings as I wander through campus -- I notice so many things about Yale's architecture that I never would have noticed before!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in classical civilization or architecture overall. It was awesome to visit Rome over spring break and have a totally new view and take on all the monuments--and really appreciate the work and artistic genius that went into them. I enjoyed that immensely. The class itself was interesting enough--but the overall effect on the way Iview buildings and my surroundings now is way cooler.",
    "Yes! take it.",
    "Do yourself a favor and take this class. But actually. This is one of those perfect classes where you'll learn an insane amount by doing a very manageable amount of work.Reasons why:1) Professor Diana Kleiner has to be one of the best instructors at Yale. She gives you everything you need to succeed, including custom maps, a comprehensive image database and a program that makes it so easy to study for the midterms. Seriously, even if you decide to take the class Cr\/D, you'll find yourself picking up a lot by just sitting in on lectures. Fantastic lectures make the 9am start time worth it.2) Roman Architecture is on Open Yale Courses, so if you miss a lecture for some reason, there's a good chance that you'll be able to catch up in your own time (Warning: the videos are from 2009, and she tweaks the class a little bit each year, so don't rely on the videos as your prime source of instruction. That said, it's nice to be able to have a video record of a class).3) There are virtual sections, which means that rather than meeting the TAs at a specific time and place each week, you contribute to a threaded discussion on Classesv2. This is awesome because it's super respectful of people's busy schedules.4) The final projects are actually lots of fun. You have the option of either designing your own Roman City or writing a paper. If you decide to write a paper, there are about seven recommended topics, each with a recommended bibliography, so you don't waste time hunting for sources that you later throw away. If you decide to design a Roman city, you have an incredible amount of control about the format (eg. one person presented it as a fictional sketchbook by the architect-emperor Hadrian). If you're sick of writing papers, this is a great option.Basically, this class is awesome because all that Kleiner cares about is that you leave the course knowing something new about Roman Architecture. You can do the bare-minimum and do fine, but the class is such a pleasant experience that you'll find yourself putting way more of yourself into it.I'm done rambling. tl;dr - if you want a solid class that 1) is respectfulof your time 2) isn't a waste of your Yale credit (we have so little time here - do you really want to waste it on a \"gut\" that doesn't better you in any way?), then taking this class is one of the best academic decisions you'll make at Yale. Have fun!",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and I felt like it offered a very comprehensive introduction to Roman and classical architecture. Lectures were always expertly presented by Professor Kleiner, but I felt that sometimes they were a bit rushed because of the large amount of material that needed to be covered. Preparing for the midterms involved a lot of rote memorization, but this was manageable, as was the paper, when started in advance. There is no formal section, just an online forum that must be contributed to. I would take this course if you're comfortable memorizing a lot of information for exams, but also if you would enjoy an hour of looking at beautiful buildings every other morning."
