    "Definitely. Even if its not your major the topics discussed are all very relevant and its good to see how the leading thinkers in different fields are approaching the topics",
    "I would not recommend this course in its current format. It is a grouping of guest lecturers with the only link being that they study Africa within any number of academic disciplines.",
    "It seems like a big commitment but really it isn't. Your whole afternoon might be gone but the class is kind of worth it. You meet great lecturers and learn a lot about Africa and how to understand it."
