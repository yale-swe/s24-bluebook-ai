    "A good course for keeping students on track on their thesis.",
    "Senior colloquium in EVST",
    "As a senior colloquium, this is well run and helpful even if there are some assignments that are busy work. They do a great job keeping you on track and focused and just know now that you have to have to have 20 pages of your thesis done by the end of the semester.",
    "If you're looking at this. It's likely that you're already an EVST major and have no choice but to take this course.It, thankfully, isn't a waste of time. Although it can be annoying that there are so many deadlines for certain aspects of your thesis, it keeps you on track--so its nice to have outside pressure to keep you on your toes.It's super beneficial in the critiques of students and staff that are often expressed.Kinda view this class as a show-and-tell. You basically get to talk a little about your successes and failures in regards to project each week, and everyone hears you out, offers advice, and keeps you in line for the next steps that you are to take.It'll help you write a better thesis.",
    "It's mandatory.",
    "We all have to take it.....it often feels like a waste of time to sit in class. I'd much much much rather use that time to work on my paper."
