    "The course assumes good working knowledge of Hebrew and is probably best suited for those who have had considerable experience of studying the Hebrew Bible. For such a person, the course would be excellent.",
    "It has changed the way I look at Isaiah. Very helpful.",
    "If a student were interested in very specific topics in the book of Isaiah, then I would recommend the class. I would also only recommend this class to a student who was highly motivated to learn and work on their own, outside of class."

    "This was my first in-depth encounter with Isaiah. As I said above, the material is so vast and rich that one can only make a slight dent in it within the confines of a one-term course. This course gave me the tools I would need to pursue Isaianic studies, and raised some interesting questions about interpretation and methodology. To that extent it was very helpful.",
    "This course gave me insight into some of the difficult questions that are currently up for debate in the field of Isaianic studies."
