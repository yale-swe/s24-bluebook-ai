   "comments": [
    "Be better organized. - Quizzes should be administered every week the same day (there was a lot of confusion about this early in the course), posted early (I tried to access the last quiz a few hours after the lecture and it still wasn't there) and always with detailed answers (this wasn't the case early on). - Midterms should be given back IN CLASS. - More accessible textbook would be helpful. - First part of the empirical project was graded over a month after it was due - this definitely could've taken less time. I didn't like the fact we had to use paid software (i.e. Stata) instead of something open-source or accessibly to students for free (e.g. R or simply Excel).",
    "The teacher was terrible. The TAs were really amazing though.",
    "The class was very disorganized, the material was presented in a confusing manner, and I basically had to learn everything on my own.",
    "Pretty good right now, or maybe adding extra sessions for problem sets and quiz.",
    "I thought the course overall gave a good overview of econometrics, which is difficult because there are a lot of topics to cover. For the most part, the content tested on the exam seemed similar to the problem sets. I did think overall, the course was a good amount of work, with the project, problem sets, and weekly quizzes.",
    "This course is all over the place. I do not think an econometrics course should cover so much in one semester given the nature of the material. Because of the large volume of material that the course covers, there was rarely any time to delve deeper and more meaningfully into any one topic. This course is also very uneven in terms of pacing. Perhaps worst of all, it is not explicit about its expectations. That is to say, this course requires experience with statistics, and those learning statistics from scratch just from this course will certainly struggle. This course does a disservice to its students in so poorly introducing these fundamental topics. I truly believe this course should be revised. At the very least, some prerequisite should be required, whether it be a pre-existing introductory statistics class from the math department or a new econ course to take before taking ECON 131. I was very disappointed that a required course for the major was so poorly constructed.",
    "It is pretty easy to follow along based just off of slides and reading textbook. Class is not engaging but midterm\/final were very fair and based off of quizzes, psets, and old exams. Definitely wish we had weekly psets so we could stay on task but only had 5 psets that needed to be turned (plus a drop) in so really easy to get behind.",
    "So honestly this class can get rekt because i really came into it excited about the syllabus and about learning stats skills in an econ context, and it sapped away all of my excitement. The lectures were so boring an unengaging that I still feel unsure about the most fundamental skills. I'm gonna do fine in the class, so I guess it's okay, but I'm already planning on taking STAT 238 next year because I feel like this did such a poor job at preparing me for the types of thinking that it would. Also, group projects in college are stupid if you don't get to choose your group, because people don't know each other, and one person (usually a woman) ends up doing all the work--especially in a class and a subject area that is as heavily male as econ. Also, it was total bullshit that quizzes stopped having retakes in the middle of the semester. I get that people were doing well bc half of the questions were True\/False, but you can't make an assurance in the syllabus that you then go back on. You should've just make all of the questions 4-response multiple choice, or short answer, or just not have made retakes in the first place, but that was annoying and unprofessional. This class was not conducive to learning and it was a horrible horrible experience.",
    "Don't make this professor teach it again. He might be a great person but he can't teach,",
    "The course itself seems fine. The material was not particularly well-taught. The lack of problem sets in this course was a significant weakness, as true mastery of the material often comes from applying concepts in completing problem sets, and therefore, the dearth of problem sets made it difficult for me to master the material.",
    "This course was an absolute nightmare. I've taken a lot of classes at Yale, but only a handful were this bad. First, the professor rambled through most of the lecture, he used lecture slides that weren't his, and seemed just as surprised as we were when he scrolled through. The lectures were excruciatingly disorganized, and half of the time no one in the class really knew what was going on. Then the way the grade was structured was absurd. For every problem set we did, they only graded one question out of six or seven and gave you points on a scale of three -- a mystery to me how that can be a fair assessment of any form. We had weekly online quizzes, they seemed very confused about those (I think those were also taken from previous years); at the beginning of the semester, we had two tries each week at the quiz, then they changed their mind halfway through and decided to make it one try (since most of the questions were true\/false and everyone was getting full points). There is a group project for the class which is a nightmare, since you have to self-teach yourself Stata and try work with people on it over the course of the semester (even though Stata is never formally taught as part of the course). The midterm was a disaster, I think the average was a 64 or something, the material on the exam was completely irrelevant to what Professor Vytlacil had thought he'd taught us. He gave us no practice problems, no material to go off from. I will say, though, that the TA Majed was amazing. He really went out of his way to make this class a better one despite its many flaws. He even prepared a summary of the course material over Thanksgiving break (which we all really appreciated). Summary: You probably have to take this class if you're taking it. Take it with a different professor, or I just hope someone else teaches it from now onwards.",
    "We were told that we would rate group members but that didn't happen, and I think that it's very important in preventing free-loading etc. I also liked having two chances on quizzes for the first half of the course. I think the solution to the issue of everyone getting perfect scores is to make new quizzes every year, with answers that are not T\/F, taking an average of both quizzes, and not showing the answer after the first time around. Also, the instructor and all three TFs (and a majority of the class) were male. Increased diversity in a core, required econ class would be appreciated.",
    "Strengths, great material which is actually applicable to real life Weakness: Nice professor, bad at teaching",
    "I think the incorporation of Stata into the course was great. I thought the lectures need to be improved. There was a lot of superfluous information in the slides and Professor Vytlacil did not do a great job clarifying what should be taken away from each lecture. In addition, I wish he had assigned more practice problems to help measure progress and more in-class examples. I was also in a group for the group project where I had to do almost all of the work. I think this project is incredibly useful at teaching students to use Stata and apply the course but wish it was an individual project.",
    "strengths: STATA weaknesses: disconnect between students and the professor \/ TAs",
    "The lecture for this class was, I felt, extremely weak. The slides were riddled with typos, and the professor often fell behind in the material, which was frustrating. It was hard to know exactly where we were in the course, and it seemed like we got sidetracked during classtime frequently. As far as strengths go, I thought that it was interesting learning how to use stata.",
    "The slides were often not helpful, spent too much time with specific examples without having adequately presented\/explained the theory first.",
    "The course makes it very difficult to understand Econometrics well. Section is only devoted to Stata, and not recapping class from the week, which is often very confusing. The professor rarely made it through all the slides during class, forcing us to teach ourselves most of the material. The problem sets were far more challenging than any problems we did in class, and took many hours to complete.",
    "Strength is the quality of the material. Weakness was that lectures were confusing and too fast paced without an in depth explanation for the material. I had to learn most of the material from the lecture slides\/online prior to the midterm and the final.",
    "Lecture format wasn't that great. Giving examples before the definitions made it a bit easier to identify what was being taught at the beginning and I felt it didn't facilitate targeted learning as a result. Course also started out much more disorganized but got a lot better.",
    "Strengths: interesting, important material. Also Professor Vytlacil is a nice man, so I apologize for what follows. Weaknesses: Professor Vytlacil didn't practice lectures enough beforehand. We were constantly behind, until we sped through some topics quickly enough that no one understood them. We still ended up not being taught diff-in-diff due to lack of time, but we never understood what was being taught anyway so speeding through 1 lecture didn't matter. One day, class started with an announcement that \"We are only ten slides behind now\" but then we spent 30 minutes (not exaggerating, I timed it) listening as the professor answered one single question. We were much more than ten slides behind by the end of class. Everyone stopped coming to lecture because no information was being clearly communicated; occasionally I thought I understood something, only to become more confused the longer the professor talked. Stumbling over words and restarting sentences is natural, but it leads to chaos when the subject is as verbally complicated as Econometrics. You have to know what you're going to say, and you have to say it slowly and clearly. Moving onto the structure of the class. On day 1, the professor told us that sections would not be review, because he would cover everything in lecture. We then went too slowly to cover everything in lecture, and what was covered was not clear, so not having section to clarify\/learn things was unfortunate. There's TF office hours, but if you designate office hours as the place for learning and section as a place for new material (here, how to use Stata), you are giving students too much work and not enough instruction. Quizzes were poorly designed for many reasons: it's unreasonable to quiz us on material \"taught\" (i.e., not taught) in lecture earlier that day; it's super unreasonable to change quizzes from 2 attempts to 1 attempt given that nothing is being taught (justification from a TF: \"it helps us see what's being taught and understood, and what's not\" me: \"yeah but it doesn't help us at all\" TF: \"it helps the best students\" me: \"no, it helps the students who are free on Thursdays [as quizzes are due at 11:59 on Thursday]\" TF: \"oh yeah. we didn't think of that\"); questions were often meaninglessly phrased (\"We might still prefer not to use IV. True\/False\"; asking a question and having the answer choices be True\/False)). Lastly, the midterm. It was really hard, which is fine, as grades can be curved. But rather than curve our final grades, the professor decided that if you scored higher on the final than on the midterm, your final exam grade would replace your midterm grade. The final also had 20 points of extra credit, which 1. is meaningless in a curved class and 2. meant that final exam grades were way higher than midterm grades. Because they were so much higher, and because a higher final exam grade replaced a lower midterm grade, the midterm grade totally disappeared. This is infuriating to people who studied really hard for the midterm (during Yom Kippur!) on the seemingly reasonable assumption that, you know, it would count. So now instead, half the grade in the class is from a 2.5 hour period, something I assumed the professor wanted to avoid, which is why he didn't just have no midterm and a final worth 50% to begin with. The professor also told us in lecture that he was disappointed in our midterm grades, which was farcical. If an entire group of students underperforms, what's the one common thread between those students? Perhaps their teacher (not really, as people ditched lecture when it became clear it was useless)? They didn't book rooms for presenting projects, so they rescheduled to 7:30-9:30PM on Friday. Then they didn't know how to use the TEAL Room, so we sat around for 30 minutes out of 60. Me: Do you recognize that toying with the midterm grades is avoiding the root of the problem, the reason no one is learning? TF: yeah Well as long as we're all on the same page.",
    "Strengths: It was a very applicable class with STATA learning and many examples related to economics and experiments. Weaknesses: There was not enough correlation between quizzes, tests, things that we learned in class, and homework assignemnts.",
    "This course could be great, but it was taught poorly this year. The material needs to be more engaging and interactive. Pset material didn't correlate to class material. The textbook did not use the same notation as the lectures which was confusing.",
    "Course was very poorly organized. Professor doesn't seem to be very focused on teaching. Most of the time, he would come into class unprepared and then proceed to try to fudge his way through the previous professor's slides. This class made me rethink my choices about majoring in economics.",
    "Bad lectures, interesting material",
    "Course was disorganized and slides portly taught.",
    "Some of the strengths of the course were that it was a comprehensive view of Econometrics. It was difficult to follow, however, and all in all the textbook was a much better resource than lecture. Additionally, sections were focused not on course material, but on an ancillary part of the course, the computer program Stata. Though this was helpful for the final project, it did not help with the final exam and was difficult to follow. In general, lectures could have been more concise and helped students better understand Statistics.",
    "This class assumed some knowledge of statistics, which was a learning curve for students like myself who had never seen the material before. The first half of this course would have been more straightforward had there been more resources geared towards statistical understanding.",
    "Prof struggled to go over all slides. Most of he learning done alone by the student",
    "The course covered A LOT which was both a plus and a minus. I wish it would go into more depth.",
    "I thought that the explanation of key concepts could be improved and should be focused on more. I enjoyed working on the group project, as it gave us a better hands-on application of data analysis.",
    "The lectures were just too dry at times- the in class questions helped break up the course but if they were structured differently, where we could discuss the questions in an open environment with the TAs and professor simultaneously, it may be more engaging. The material in class could be better integrated with stata labs since that could offer a more interactive component that could also help us build the skills necessary to understand and complete assignments.",
    "Strengths: this is a stats class, and stats knowledge is very useful. Weaknesses: this class failed completely in its goal of teaching students with little to no stats experience basic econometrics. I'll break down my primary concerns. The Professor: Did not seem experienced with the slide-presentations he was working with or with explaining basic econometrics (probabilities, regressions, distributions, etc) to students in an clear manner. He had horrible time management, and often skimmed through lectures to \"catch up\" (we never did) or skipped some entirely. The Sections: On the first day, Prof Vytlacil stated that sections would be devoted to learning Stata, a programming language, and that they would not review class material, like other course sections did, because we \"would learn all the material in class\" and we wouldn't need sections for review. That was a horrible idea. 1) The prof never covered all the material we were scheduled to learn in class 2) he gave very unclear explanations for concepts like IVs or normal distributions, so we really needed some other space in which to ask clarifying questions and actually LEARN material. The Quizes: every Thursday we had a quiz on the material we learned in class that week. Unfortunately we never covered all the material we were supposed to learn, and even with the TF's efforts to edit quizes appropriately, we often saw new vocab or terms on the quiz that we had never seen in class. Additionally, halfway through the course, Prof lowered the number of attempts from 2 to 1, meaning we had only 1 chance to get answers right. This was frustrating, considering the previous comments, and that we only had 12 hours in which to complete the quiz, which was difficult for people like me, who had more classes and extracurricular commitments in that period. Finally, the quiz questions were poorly worded. I say \"poorly,\" but I really mean that these questions were trash. On multiple occasions there would be true\/false questions in which the statement that should be either true or false was a question (example: Can an instrumental variable be correlated with the error term? true or false?) I had clarify questions with the TF everyweek. I understand that these quizes are from last year's course, and were not written by this year's staff, but new TFs and professors should still review the pre-existing material to correct for mistakes like those. The tests: The midterm was difficult, but reasonable. However, the prof decided that our class had done terribly on it (even though we had roughly the same mean and median score as last year, which I can say with certainty because last year's scores are listed in one of our slide presentations). So instead of curving the scores (or trying to address the real problem, which is that students weren't learning anything) the professor just decided to count the midterm as less and the final as more. The final was ridiculously easy, and had 20 points of extracredit. This is a curved course. Extra credit is meaningless. Grades: I obviously have not gotten my grade yet, but one of my classmates reported getting an A- in this class despite having a 101% in the course. He has a 101%. He has been in the top 20 or 10% of the class in all assignments and tests. And he got an A-. It's almost ironic, because this is a stats course. At this point I'm just going to end my comments, but I want to make it clear how disappointed I am in this class and in the Econ department as a whole. Yale is known for it's econ program, it's supposed to be one of the best in the country, but it can't even find an econometrics professor who can explain instrumental variables.",
    "more work with STATA because that is a skill that would be very attractive for future employers and classes. The tests and psets were very fair. The lectures were clear but boring. It is good that the lecture slides are so comprehensive (I believe necessary for studying) but I found it very difficult to stay engaged in class. Perhaps a different lecturing style ro something that feels more applied and relevant. The examples were very mickey mouse.",
    "ECON 131 was definitely a great introduction to econometrics and statistics, and it definitely gave me (more via the textbook readings and homework assignments than through the lectures) a pretty solid understanding of the subject material. I think the class could be improved by minimizing the amount of \"wasted time\" during lecture and in general presenting the material in a more concise way. Moreover, I think it would be beneficial to the learning process to use examples to illustrate ideas, rather than just presenting formulas or concepts and then using examples to retroactively explain them.",
    "It was impossible to follow the professor. Absolutely hated his method",
    "I had a good TA, and the online quizzes were helpful in learning the information. The lectures were frequently disjointed with the book, the professor hadn't written the slides and was not a clear explainer.",
    "A great weakness of the course is the divergence between the textbook, class and lecture slides."

    "Not unless you have to for the economics major or it's with a better professor.",
    "Yes, very well organized.",
    "If the student was interested in econometrics, I would recommend it.",
    "The only reason most people take this class is because it is required for the econ major. Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing redeemable about this course. It is not necessarily the professor's fault as the structure and content of this course is largely unchanged from previous iterations. However, the professor did not seem to make any effort to improve upon this course and merely reused lecture notes and problem sets. The textbook was of very little help. As for workload, it is relatively light with weekly online multiple choice quizzes and a problem set every other week. However, the semester-long group empirical data project is a waste of everyone's time. It is not especially difficult or time-consuming, but one will learn nothing new or insightful from it. Practicing the methods taught in class with real-life data may seem pedagogically sound, but in the context of a busy semester, it is one of many ultimately pointless exercises in trying to legitimize this deeply broken course. Be sure to have ample experience in basic statistics before taking it. Although basic statistics and probability is taught, it is by no means taught well, and those with absolutely no experience with statistics should invest in an intro stats course. Professor Vytlacil was not the best, but certainly not the worst. He was obviously very knowledgeable about all of the course material, but he often had trouble articulating it in a clear way. I find that the problem with ECON 131 is not as much about the professor as it is about the structure. Whoever originally made the lecture notes does econometrics a disservice in dumbing everything down in a way that makes it even more convoluted. All that to say, take this course only if you have to.",

    "Nope. Take STAT 238 instead. You'll learn real stats in a great lecture. This class is poorly taught. Sitting through lecture is like getting a root canal. I really really wanted the professor to succeed, but he just kept being so so boring and not running the class well. The group project is terrible, and the gender dynamics of the class are super weird.",

    "Only take it if your an Econ major, it's not worth the trouble if you're not.",
    "Absolutely would not recommend this course unless you're an econ major and have to take it. Professor Vytlacil consistently had trouble explaining the course. He's a nice guy and a great econometrician but I would not take it with him if possible.",

    "Standard econ requirement, but be ready to do a lot of self-teaching. The material is not difficult, but it builds up over time, and you cannot understand any given lecture without understanding all those that came prior. With Vytacil, be prepared for what were possibly the worst lectures I have had so far. He is a very nice guy, and I can tell he cares about his students, but he just is not a good lecturer. He would spend most of the class explaining the simplest concepts, or reading verbatim off the slides (the slides were often unclear, focusing too much on specific examples and not enough on theory) and leaving the difficult concepts for us to figure out for ourselves. To that end, I went to maybe 6 lectures, because there was little to no point in attending them. I found it to be far more efficient to read through the slides on my own, and read the textbook, with a little google thrown in. I scored well above the median on both the midterm and the final, and would say that this only happened because of the hours I spent on my own figuring the material out. This class should be a lot easier than it is - the organization is just terrible. Definitely doable, and you can pull off an A\/A- via self-study especially if Ed is teaching again.",

I haven't taken any introductory statistics classes at Yale, but I feel like that would be a better option if you're just trying to learn statistics.",
    "As a prospective Economics major, this class nearly destroyed my entire faith in the Yale Economics department. Professor Vytlacil is a kind, kind man but an AWFUL, TERRIBLE professor. He was disorganized, often showed up late, and seemed unable to answer even the simplest of questions. He seems to have knowledge of the subject, but he EPICALLY failed to help guide us through the material. Econ 131 has the potential to be a decent class if taught by a different professor and if the applications of the material were updated. Nevertheless, I am incredibly disappointed that this turned into the worst class I've ever taken at Yale (or ever).",
    "I would recommend the class in the sense that the material is really important, especially anyone with any interest in statistics, however the \"economics\" aspect didn't really amount to anything and thus I would tell students to consider other statistics course that present the material in a more clear digestible manner.",
    "Not a particularly strong recommendation. I thought that the latter portion of this course had more interesting material, but otherwise very standard...",
    "This is only for Professor Vytlacil's class. Summary: Don't take this class for any reason. The worst class I've taken in college. If it's required for your major, wait and take it a different semester. Details: Professor Vytlacil didn't practice lectures enough beforehand. We were always behind, until we sped through some topics quickly enough that no one understood them. We still ended up not being taught diff-in-diff due to lack of time, but we never understood what was being taught anyway so speeding through 1 lecture didn't matter. One day, class started with an announcement that \"We are only t10 slides behind now\" but then we spent 30 minutes (not exaggerating, I timed it) listening to the professor answer 1 question. We were much more than 10 slides behind after that class. No one came to lecture because no information was being clearly communicated; occasionally I thought I understood something, only to become more confused the longer the professor talked. Moving onto the structure of the class. On day 1, the professor told us that sections would not be review, because he would cover everything in lecture. We then went too slowly to cover everything in lecture, and what was covered was not clear, so not having section to clarify\/learn things was unfortunate. There's TF office hours, but if you designate office hours as the place for learning and section as a place for new material (here, how to use Stata), you are giving students too much work and not enough instruction. Quizzes were poorly designed for many reasons: it's unreasonable to quiz us on material \"taught\" (i.e., not taught) in lecture earlier that day; it's super unreasonable to change quizzes from 2 attempts to 1 attempt given that nothing is being taught (justification from a TF: \"it helps us see what's being taught and understood, and what's not\" me: \"yeah but it doesn't help us at all\" TF: \"it helps the best students\" me: \"no, it helps the students who are free on Thursdays [as quizzes are due at 11:59 on Thursday]\" TF: \"oh yeah. we didn't think of that\"); questions were often meaninglessly phrased (\"We might still prefer not to use IV. True\/False\"; asking a question and having the answer choices be True\/False)). Lastly, the midterm. It was really hard, which is fine, as grades can be curved. But rather than curve our final grades, the professor decided that if you scored higher on the final than on the midterm, your final exam grade would replace your midterm grade. The final also had 20 points of extra credit, which 1. is meaningless in a curved class and 2. meant that final exam grades were way higher than midterm grades. Because they were so much higher, and because a higher final exam grade replaced a lower midterm grade, the midterm grade totally disappeared. This is infuriating to people who studied really hard for the midterm (during Yom Kippur!) on the seemingly reasonable assumption that, you know, it would count. So now instead, half the grade in the class is from a 2.5 hour period, something I assumed the professor wanted to avoid, which is why he didn't just have no midterm and a final worth 50% to begin with. The professor also told us in lecture that he was disappointed in our midterm grades, which was farcical. If an entire group of students underperforms, what's the one common thread between those students? Perhaps their teacher (not really, as people ditched lecture when it became clear it was useless)? They also didn't book a room for presenting projects, so they rescheduled to 7:30-9:30 on a Friday night. Then they didn't know how to use the TEAL Room, so we sat around for 30 minutes out of 60. Me: Do you recognize that toying with the midterm grades is avoiding the root of the problem, the reason no one is learning? TF: yeah. Well as long as we're all on the same page.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you absolutely have to take it. I was very discouraged.",
    "Take this course with another professor other than vytlacil.",
    "This course is obligatory for students in the Economics major, so outside of that I wouldn't recommend it really.",
    "The textbook assigned was not very helpful for the material before the first midterm. I would recommend the student find other resources to learn statistics if they are not familiar with the material already.",
    "If you are an economics major, you have to take it since it is a core class. If you want to learn how to analyze the data, I would recommend it but be prepared to put in hours of work.",
    "This class is a necessary class to take for econ majors and it does teach you useful knowledge (aka Stata). That being said, this year was kind of a mess structurally, which compromised the course a lot and the professor was pretty new at teaching the course. A lot of self learning is needed but its not too bad in the end. Definitely go to the TAs for help with assignments and studying for the exam since they are great resources for knowing what is important and how to understand it.",
    "Based on the experience I had this year, I would not recommend this course to other students. Sure, the Econ and EP&E majors have a statistics requirement, but luckily for the Yale population, there are other stats courses than Econ 131. Take ANY OTHER stats course but this one. Econ 135 is more mathematically challenging, but there's a chance that that professor will actually teach you something, which is more than I can say about this course. Seriously: do not take this course. This is your warning. Look elsewhere.",
    "No, at least not with this teacher. He was truly uninspiring, and with uninteresting material to being with (comparable a slimmed down\/ easier AP Stats class), it made for a rough semester. Maybe 20% of the class showed up on a regular basis, and everyone still did pretty well in the class. Idk, make your own decision, and decide if you're actually interested in the material or not, but definitely aim for another teacher.",
    "I would wait until it is taught by a professor who made his\/her own slides.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for the Econ major!",
    "Yes but with a different Professor."
