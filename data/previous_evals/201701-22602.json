   "comments": [
    "I learned about social processes by which knowledge can gain the status of a widely agreed upon scientific fact, or be marginalized as the limited perspective as an indivdual. I also learned about social processes by which ceratain individuals and spaces become authoratative producers of knowledge, to the exclusion of other actors. I gained critical tools, including feminist, postcolonial, and queer perspectives, to think about issues such as how science may create, and reduce, risk and harm in society.",
    "I developed a much wider knowledge of science studies and relevant theory, which allowed me to use STS theory effectively in my other work.",
    "This course provided me with an introduction to the foundational texts and themes in STS. I also appreciated the intersectional feminist teaching style and approach to scholarship that I hope to adopt in my own work. Not only did this course help me orient my own research, it helped me think critically about my everyday life. The course also offered tools for communicating scientific, technical, and philosophical concepts to a \"lay\" audience.",

   "comments": [
    "The readings for this course were wonderful; they provided diverse perspectives on some of the most exciting questions being asked in the field of science studies. The assignments for the class were also great. They pushed me to take complex theoretical ideas and engage with them in a down-to-earth way. It would be exciting to have a modified version of the class specifically for undergrads. A weakness of the class was that because students took turns leading discussion, the class wasn't always evenly paced (we sometimes got stuck on a point and didn't get to discuss all of the readings. This could be improved by having discussion leaders develop a rough timeline for the class to keep the time allocation more even. Another weakness of the class was that because it is a required class for grad students, some people in the class took a while to commit fully to the readings and discussions. I'm not sure how this could be improved, though.",
    "This course was truly wonderful! The strengths were definitely Professor Radin's insights and the excellent texts we read. I don't think there were any major weaknesses. One thing that could be good is to list the course at an undergrad number too to get more undergrads interested.",
    "One of the strengths is how Professor Radin structured the classroom culture by encouraging student feedback on the material and style of discussion, our discussion of real life problems, and thoughtful critiques of academia and other industries. The course materials were consistently engaging and eye-opening and course expectations were rigorous. I especially appreciated the real and not tokenized engagement with diverse materials from diverse subject specialities and voices. I am thankful for the extra readings and materials listed for each week on the syllabus. The push (and help) to extend our commentary and critical engagement beyond an academic audience was especially helpful. One minor weakness was the lack of time! Focusing on small group work and practical exercises in class after reading multiple challenging articles each week often meant we weren't able to discuss any of the articles in detail. It was a bit frustrating to come prepared to delve deep and only scratch the surface; nevertheless, I recognize this is an issue of teaching a highly engaging class in a two-hour time slot--certainly not the professor's fault. The effect was to leave me curious and eager to learn more outside of class.",
    "Strengths: intensive, great selection of readings, provides strong background into critical topics in science studies, weekly responses encouraged engagement Weaknesses: sometimes class discussions seemed to veer on tangents, or conclusions were entertained that struck me as inconsistent with the author's arguments (or with the period\/audience in\/for which it was written); some firmer guidance on how to interpret the readings would have been helpful in those instances",
    "This was a graduate-level readings course, required for HSHM PhD students, with significant undergraduate enrollment. Given the theoretical density of the texts involved, and the novelty of the subject area for many participants, much of class time was devoted to making students feel confident enough to engage with the texts (and with seminar discussion). Students took turns to present on the texts each week, and prepared a set of activities for the class to facilitate discussion. While I understand the purpose of these exercises, they did mean that little to no class time was reserved for a close reading of the texts in question. I worry that this set-up is not as helpful for doctoral students, who may encounter the texts again, notably in orals. I also feel that this 'deep' level of discussion and analysis is crucial for developing more than a passing understanding of some of the key questions and thematics. Perhaps there is a compromise solution that would accommodate the needs of both undergraduates and graduate students in a single seminar. My feeling, however, is that this course could helpfully be split into two. One further point: the sheer number of texts assigned each week (perhaps 6 or 7) meant that in some weeks, a handful or texts were barely mentioned in class, or not at all. I don't think the breadth of the course would suffer from a slightly shortened list of required readings."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course enables students to ask critical questions how science and society intersect. Students will examine how and why scientific knowledge is produced and valued. They will also learn to think creatively about how science could become more just and inclusive.",
    "This is the best class at Yale. Period. I honestly believe everyone should be required to take this, especially science and HSHM majors. I can't stop thinking about the readings, and Joanna Radin is the most brilliant, kindest professor you'll ever have the joy of meeting.",
    "This is a truly excellent seminar on science and technology studies! Professor Radin is wonderful and makes STS theory very understandable. The reading load for the course is significant, but the reading responses are manageable and Prof Radin gives great feedback. I would especially recommend this class to science\/non-science double majors or science majors interested in thinking critically about science and technology!",
    "This is one of the most rewarding courses available at Yale. It guides you through the major works in STS and provides you with a broad way of viewing problems. Cannot say enough about how this expands learning and thought. Really something that everyone should get to experience.",
    "Yes! I have and will continue to heartily recommend this course to students in a wide variety of fields, from the humanities to the sciences, medicine, business, etc. Anyone could benefit and connect to the material covered in this course.",
    "yes, anyone in WGSS, medicine, basic science, medical anthropology\/sociology, etc. would benefit from this course",
    "Yes, definitely."
