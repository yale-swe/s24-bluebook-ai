    "I thought that there was an interesting range of interests and approaches represented in the class, which created useful opportunities for dialogue.",
    "The historical context, particularly the use of source materials, for the plays we examined was helpfully fleshed out. Political and performance contexts were usefully elaborated as well. I learned a lot about conventions of genre and plot-tropes."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the course design was useful, pairing Shakespearean works against canonical non-Shakespearean works. Some of the critical readings seemed to resonate more with people in the room than others. The final conference is a great way to give everyone the opportunity to learn a bit more about everyone else's work.",
    "I feel that I have a much better grasp of the theatrical scene of early 17th-c England. The critical essays concentrated at the beginning of the syllabus were helpful - I would have liked a fuller bibliography extending through the course. The discussion posts before class were useful towards organizing my own ideas and seeing what classmates were interested in. A clearer outline of what themes we would focus on in each class would have been helpful."

    "Yes, it's a good way to familiarize oneself with Shakespeare's later works in their initial historical context.",
    "I think this course is well-suited for people who already know their interests lie in early modern drama. I'm not sure it would be as useful for a student whose interests lay primarily elsewhere."
