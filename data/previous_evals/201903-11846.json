    "Weaknesses: the work was very long and not too relevant. It was not engaging. The class was not fun or engaging. I dreaded going to class every day. It was definitely the worst class of my first semester. Choose better stories to read and more engaging topics that are more relevant and applicable",
    "It was very well organized, however, at times it was too organized and rigid.",
    "A lot of homework that is just busy work. Supersite grading and penalties are ridiculous. The amount of large assignments we have week after week is ridiculous.",
    "Weaknesses: Genuinely everything ranging from assignments that did not enhance the learning process, repetitive class activities, uninteresting overall. Strength: Meeting every day was the closest thing to immersion.",
    "The online homework was sometimes irrelevant and frustrating.",
    "The reading material is not something students can relate to--I don't mean by nature of it centering around Latin American culture, but by nature of the storylines centering around either abstract concepts or characters quite far from our age and experience. Since they have to be more basic for this level, they're not at all compelling."

   "comments": [
    "No, the only reason I took it was to fulfill a language requirement, and this seems to be the general consensus. Even if you love spanish, you will come out of this course very disappointed and may even like spanish less and be discouraged from taking an L5 course, like I was",
    "Yes, especially to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "No. Not in a million years. Awful. Hard to learn and not at all enjoyable.",
    "Never in my life.",
    "I'd recommend this course to someone who is taking it to fulfill their language requirement and is ready to put in quite a bit of work and effort. It is not that hard to get an A if you try.",
    "I would not recommend this course because it does very little for your actual Spanish communication skills--conversations are stilted and structured by the requests of the instructor, and thus it is difficult to adapt more fluidity in your speaking."
