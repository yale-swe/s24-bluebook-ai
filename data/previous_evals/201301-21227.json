    "I would recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in expanding their mathematical background beyond some of the mainstream courses of calculus, differential equations, and the like. This class is wonderful even if you are not a linguistics student because it makes no strong assumptions about having a linguistics background. This class was one of my favorites this semester because it really stretched my thinking in ways it has not been stretched before, and this was a very satisfying feeling."

   "comments": [
    "I am not currently a linguistics student, and as a result, this course does not necessarily relate directly to my own research area. However, it was useful in forcing me to think about different problems in new ways, and this ability will undoubtedly be useful in my future studies, regardless of research focus."
