   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Valuable class for interviews and resume review.",
    "It was a lot better than I thought it would be. It was helpful practicing for networking and interviewing. The feedback from students and teachers was helpful. The big group stuff on the first day was not my favorite, it'd be great if this could have been done in our small groups.",
    "The course is very practical but maybe a little hard for introvert person. Students have to be recorded when you are giving an presentation, and have to prepare for pitches and mock interviews with people you barely know. But, it is pretty helpful for students who are looking for interns or jobs since the TA and the teammates will give you good feedback to help you improve.",
    "Very useful",
    "The course did not present any new information. All of the information was repetitive of information and seminars I've taken as an undergraduate. The course may have been more useful if there were more skills related specifically to public health specifically and relations we may encounter as public health professionals.",
    "Overall, this course was fine. It was very basic in the topics covered, but the practice presentations and interviews were helpful. Because it was not worth any credit, it was never a priority for me to get the work done over the rest of my work so I never felt fully prepared for a session. I don't think any of the feedback I got during the sessions were entirely accurate because I hadn't had adequate time to prepare. It did seem that many of the sessions focused on professional skills that are more formal than anything I've experienced in any work place, and may not be applicable in the field of public health where teamwork rather than hierarchy is crucial.",
    "I thought that the course did a good job of touching on relevant concepts in regards to interviewing and public speaking.",
    "I think it would be helpful to have a session dedicated to cover letters and resumes. The pitch day could probably be eliminated and combined with the interview day. It would make sense for the oral presentation day to come at the end of the series, as that is by far the most difficult and we had the least practice for it.",
    "I don't think I got too much out of it. I was also interviewing for jobs at this time, so it was not helpful for me because my interviews were already done and I didn't have a huge incentive to get very involved in the course. I can see how it would be helpful for first year MPH students.",
    "I understand the purpose of this seminar, but I did not find it as useful as it could have been. There are a variety of professional backgrounds among the students (some have worked for many years, others were actually interview trainers, etc.), and I feel as if there should be an option to elect out of the course. Overall, I'm not sure if this course is completely necessary--I appreciate having career resource support, but maybe students should attend based on their own discretion.",
    "I was very frustrated that I had to take this course, since I've been working for a few years. It seemed largely geared towards those coming straight out of undergrad with no previous work experience of any sort.",
    "Very useful.",
    "Strengths - really great job with the course. I thought this was a great way to inform everyone about the etiquettes of emailing and interviewing and some basics down on professional skills Weaknesses - would be greatly improved if done during orientation when people have less work load. Presentations was not well liked as some of us had to prepare a whole slide deck for a 0 unit course.",
    "This was unhelpful and felt like a poor use of important time. Students should be able to exempt with two plus years of work experience. The instructor direction was condescending and felt geared towards a much younger crowd than college graduates. Not YSPH's best use of resources.",
    "useful course for finding jobs",
    "good but should be separated into groups so kids of different levels can focus on various levels of technique",
    "good coverage of different skill sets and lots of opportunities to practice. however, WAY too focused on the business\/consulting world. a substantial number of YSPH graduates will probably spend the rest of their lives doing research, and there was very little assistance offered in that arena. I heard my section leader mention more than once to imagine that we were talking to a \"non science\" audience, which seemed a bit odd. also, this might have been because the sessions were led by former consultants, but all of the language they used felt very consultant-like, which was kind of a turn off. If I just talked about my interest in improving the reproductive health of young african-american women, why are you asking me if I have an interest in \"international markets\"? It just might be more helpful to have leaders with a more diverse array of experiences.",
    "Great way to start thinking about applying for internships and how to do it appropriately. I especially enjoyed the help we got with resumes and cover letters. The interview day was helpful, but not as much.",
    "This course really helped me develop and think about the skills necessary to secure internships and jumpstart my future career. I enjoyed the various assignments geared towards helping us improve specific aspects of our professional toolkit.",
    "Great class! It was well organized :)",
    "Strength: Helpful career guidance. Weakness: Not enough time for individual guidance.",
    "I learned some useful things from this course, but I found some of the feedback very generic and not necessarily helpful. For example, most of the topics were geared towards interviewing or presenting for job opportunities. However, a non-trivial portion of the class (myself included) is interested in pursuing additional academic work and possibly careers in academia. It would have been nice to at least have those \"alternative\" career paths recognized, and to make some modifications to be more inclusive of those diverse interests. Some of the staff provided very useful comments during the breakout sessions, and others did not. It might've been better to have the same person for multiple weeks so they could get to know us better and provide us with more nuanced feedback.",
    "Literally everything could be improved. It wasn't amazingly helpful to me especially because most of the exercises required you to know exactly what you wanted to do in public health without training you in the terminology needed to answer those questions. I vaguely knew my interests but not enough to be able to answer as needed.",
    "I really wouldn't recommend it to students who have even a year of work experience. Many things were incredibly repetitive for students who have work experience and certain sessions felt like a waste of time. Also, it would be better for each student if they made appointments with Career Services on skills they wanted to improve on rather than have everyone go through the same modules.",
    "I liked being able to learn from various professionals through hands-on activities.",
    "Good",
    "I felt frustrated in this course because it felt really tailored to people who have not spent significant amounts of time working. I think it would maybe be more helpful to divide the group based on years of working experience so that content could be a little more customized.",
    "The aspect of the course where you watch yourself on video is helpful, the large lectures are not particularly helpful. I felt more was accomplished during the breakout sessions",
    "This class should be restructured to be more effective. The pitch and interview weeks were helpful, but the others were less so. I thought that the assignments were given last-minute and required a fair amount of effort for a no-credit course.",
    "The part of the seminar working with coaches was helpful but course was TOO LONG! Did not need to be 4 separate sessions",
    "This course provided really valuable professional development skills. However, I thought that sessions were unnecessarily long. I thought the smaller break-out sessions were a lot more helpful than the full group meetings.",
    "Strengths: - Coaches provide personalized insight into improvements that you can make to your presentation skills. This brought to my attention certain things about how I presented that I had not realized before. - Course is useful especially for people who have not had work experience. Possible improvements: - While we focused a lot on how we presented ourselves, I wish there had been more opportunity to explore the topic of networking (though admittedly this is something you learn more about through practice).",
    "Strengths- I learned a lot about professional schools through this seminar. I liked that we were video recorded so we could properly evaluate ourselves in a professional setting. Weakness- This course would have been taken more seriously if it was for credit. I felt that students were not as motivated to work hard on this class because it was on a Friday afternoon and it was 0 credits.",
    "I did not enjoy this class but I understand it's importance in our curriculum. I think that, for the amount of work required, it should be a half credit course or something.",
    "I found very few elements of the course helpful. I believe that a large class format is not suitable for imparting the kinds of skills the seminar is meant to teacha series of individual meetings with the same faculty and coaches would have been more appropriate."

For instance, in addition to saying we should use inflection in our speech, giving suggestions on how to inflect.",

    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0His advice to basically every female was that they have an uptick at the end of their sentences that they need to watch out for. Not exceedingly helpful.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He seemed to believe that each female student had an uptick. I don't think I ever saw a feedback to a female student where uptick was not mentioned. I'm sure this is because of his training. Also, having students work away their accents if their spoken english is fluent and understandable doesn't seem correct.",

    "Good",

    "good but redundant and inefficient for many. I would if you can get a one-on-one or have trouble presenting.",
    "This course is required and the assignments may seem a bit tedious at times but if you take advantage of the unique opportunities, you will be able to develop some very important skills such as presenting and networking professionally and effectively.",
    "Helpful career advice, but not enough time for individual guidance.",
    "This course is valuable if you have no idea what you are doing entering into the professional world. If you are confident with your professional skills and have successfully acquired jobs in the past, this course may be a waste of time. Although there are valuable lessons taught, it is a big time commitment and may be redundant for individuals with professional experience. The instructors are very thoughtful though and provide good feedback if you engage.",
    "I think this class is particularly useful for those interested in healthcare consulting, management or industry, as the course topics were specifically focused on those kinds of jobs. There were some useful tidbits for individuals not interested in those fields, but it was sometimes frustrating to attend when you felt that the topics were so off the mark from other interests.",
    "I would really only recommend it for students who are out of undergrad. If you've had any full-time work experience I'm sure you know most of the rules or guidelines they give in this class.",
    "This class can be helpful for those who have never had any classes related to networking, careers, etc.",
    "Good",
    "it's an useful and worthy course",
    "This course was mainly a review of basic professional skills if you have worked professionally before.",
    "This is a required class that meets 4 times on Friday afternoons. It's long and dry and makes people nervous because you have to give presentations, pitches, and interviews. Some weeks are more useful than others.",
    "one on one coaching was good but it was a lot of course time (and on a friday afternoon!)",
    "This course definitely provides valuable and applicable skills for interviews, presentations, and personal pitches. Really helpful to prepare for job interviews.",
    "The activities that you do as well as the one on one coaching provided will be valuable to you moving forward in your professional career.",
    "I would recommend this to a fellow student. It was important to record ourselves in a professional setting and to assess how we did.",
    "I would recommend it because it always good, no matter your professional experience, to get more practice in presenting, interviewing, etc.",
