   "comments": [
    "This class provides a good foundation for clinical trials. Dr. Makuch is very knowledgeable in the field and has several years experience working in clinical trials and the FDA. The workload is light (typically a short homework assignment each week). The homework correlates greatly with the exams. However, the class was poorly organized. Since Dr. Makuch is always busy, I felt that teaching this course was not always on his priority list.",
    "Very good and helpful in understanding clinical trials and basic concepts. A bit too many outside classes with the chinese FDA after the midterm.",
    "Strengths: The material presented in the course, the lecture slides provided by the professorWeaknesses: The class was cancelled 3 times (conflict with talks and presentations about clinical trials irrelevant to our class lectures)",
    "Sometimes the progression between subjects seemed disjointed. A little more structure could have been helpful but is not necessary.",
    "The topics are useful, but it is a poorly taught class. There is little assistance in terms of examples from lectures.",
    "The course was really good at introducing students into the world of clinical trials. I really enjoyed the course and the different speakers we got to meet during the course.",
    "More grade weight to the homeworks than the exams.",
    "Strengths:1. Learn what really matters in clinical trials from a respected and experienced expert in the field today.2. Have the added benefit of guests lecturers who are leaders in the field (eg, Dr Claude Petit from BI, Dr Jeff Sherman from DIA, and Dr Ciarleglio recent PhD from Yale Biostats and now lead investigator at the VA)3. Have the added benefit of a professor who's a clinical-trials news hound ... who's constantly bringing the latest stories from the world of clinical trials to the classroom discussion.Weaknesses:Should be a year-long course.",
    "It was an interesting course about clinical trials- if you take survival analysis theory then much of the statistical portions are review.",
    "This was a good course, and I enjoyed it. The guest speakers were excellent.",
    "Well done, interesting, practical. Biggest criticism is that it was difficult to appreciate\/anticipate\/completely understand how to apply equations from the coursework. Would have been beneficial to perhaps review some homework-related questions in class before setting out to do the homework so we were better prepared. Also had 3 outside lectures which were very interesting but no direct questions related to them on the final exam (would have considered something about NI at least!) Would rec more SAS time(?extra lab session for this?)",
    "I like the general layout of the course, particularly the weekly homework assignments. I think they provide an opportunity for students to apply the concepts they learned in class and see if they completely understood what was discussed. With that said, I would have liked for them to be graded regardless of how they were submitted (electronic\/hard copy).",
    "This course was helpful in providing students with an understanding of the important issues and topics in clinical trials. The main strength of this course was learning more about the statistical considerations behind the analysis of clinical trials -- students had the opportunity to both practice statistical analysis as well as understand the theory behind them. Another important and practical topic was non-inferiority trials.",
    "I took this course to fulfill a biostatistics requirement. Was not totally enthralled with the course in general. Honestly feel as though I haven't heard much during the course of this class.",
    "Very nice professor, who made this a very \"low-distress\" class due to his kind manners.",
    "I thought this was a solid course. I think it may have helped if we were to spend a bit more time on the items we covered in the second half. I know that the survival items were meant to be a introductory, but I felt we kind of breezed through them. Overall though, i enjoyed the class.",
    "Overall a good course.Can be made better if there is more teaching for the basic stuff required for the course."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Great lecturer and provide interesting examples\/stories in the real world, but not always on top of things.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0A nice professor, kind, and caring. Not serious at all.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very helpful in class but hard to reach outside of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He's really great and attentive to students!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Brings valuable industry experience. Guess speakers varied in quality - but extremely important.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Outstanding -- especially when you consider Dr Makuch taught this course, the new course Regulatory Affairs, and was host, lecturer, and key ombudsman for the Chinese FDA who visited 3 or 4 times this semester.Outstanding ... and as the semester neared its end, and the Chinese FDA had left, Makuch's teaching got even more outstanding.If this guy were allowed to teach just one course a semester, who knows!?!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very good lecturer- has interesting and insightful stories to tell that are applicable to the course material. However, near the end of the course- it seemed that the organization and communication between the prof and the students was not as good.But he was very approachable and understanding towards the students.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He was great, he interspersed lectures with anecdotes and personal experiences that made the class a lot more interesting and tangible.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0nice, experienced. As above, would have tried to incorporate problems into class before homework so we had a chance to work thru the problems together.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0pleasantliked his talk.doesn't give stress to students",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a very knowledgeable professor. He's very engaging, however sometimes it's hard to completely understand what we'll be tested on. For example, there are a lot of case studies mentioned in the class that he doesn't touch on for the exam.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is an excellent instructor. His lectures are clear and his explanations of statistics are very insightful. It is apparent that his primary goal of the course is for students to learn and understand -- his student-focus is much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Instructor is very knowledgeable. Definitley one of the best in his field. It is an honor to be taught be him. However, with much experience, comes many stories. At times I felt as though we didn't cover the lectures because of tangents the instructor would go off on and stories he would tell. Great guy though definitely!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Kind. Smart. Fun to listen to!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I think Prof Makuch is extremely seasoned and well-versed in the subject matter, clearly. He is extremely approachable and willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr Makuch has been a very good and interesting instructor.Is very punctual and tries to adapt to student's needs and queries."

    "Pretty good.She's very bright on the subject matter but has a difficult time communicating clearly. She got better, though, as the semester progressed.",
    "The TA tried her best, but she was not able to understand and answer student questions during the midterm and final exam review sessions. I don't think she knew the course material well enough, nor was she prepared to handle the review sessions. For the future, I think any TA for this course should have a better understanding of the material.",
    "very good midterm review session run by Fu-Chi. Would have encouraged more involvement to address issues from above.",
    "Fu chi was a very helpful TA. Her review session for the midterm definitely assisted me as I prepared for the exam. Also she was very responsive to e-mails and willing to meet with studentsone-on-one as necessary.",
    "Fu Chi was a dedicated TA -- her review session before the midterm was very helpful.",
    "Midterm review session very useful. Should speak up more in class, however teaching ability will approve with time ;)",
    "Fu-Chi.Not accessible. Swa her twice, for the midterm review session and final review session. Inability to teach. Not having a TA would have been equal to having Fu-CHi as a TA. I once emailed her for a brief question and she replied back one week later.",
    "Our TA, Fu-Chi Hseih, was terrible. She lacked confidence and had a hard time answering questions.",
    "Fu-Chi was very good, although there wasn't much interaction. I would just suggest that next time when she grades hw, if there is a mistake, she should give the correct answer, or try to figure out what was done wrong.",
    "TA:Fu-Chi(Angela)HsiehGood TA overall, responsive to students questions."

   "comments": [
    "Great course. However, I would suggest to meet more than once (preferably a lab section or even TA office hours?), so the TA would be able to clarify the concepts made from lecture, and SAS-related questions (second half of clinical trials concerns survival analysis using SAS).",
    "The course is a \"must know\" for all public health professionals who are interested in research, but needs a more serious atmosphere.",
    "Good basics but does not go too into depth on each subject.",
    "Essential for satisticians\/researchers.",
    "If you have any interest or curiosity in clinical science ... take this course.Even if you have some experience in clinical trials, you will learn many new things ... especially about excellent thinkers in the field, from Makuch to Byar to Mantel to Lowenstein, who have worked across therapeutic areas for important trials.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who is interested in learning the basics of clinical trials. A basic understanding of biostatistics and survival analysis is necessary.",
    "yes. Interesting, dynamic course with real practical considerations to take into account as one considers clinical trials. Less biostats as part of the lecture compared with discussions during class which are very interesting but don't always sort out issues of the equations, etc...would also consider more SAS time",
    "This is an important course for all public health students to take, since RCTs are considered the gold standard.",
    "the course title says it all. Can learn alot though not much at the same time. Not engaging at all. great instructor. great course if you are really truly interested in this topic.",
    "The guest lecturers are very useful. Dr, Makuch is able to present a comprehensive view of clinical trials 1-iv. Very useful for pharma industry.",
    "Very layed back class. Enjoyed it primarily due to the kindness and teaching style of the professor.",
    "No, this class was very SAS heavy",
    "Good intro to clinical trials.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow student only if one is interested in clinical trials.Course is good, if one has an basic understanding of Biostatistics -I."
