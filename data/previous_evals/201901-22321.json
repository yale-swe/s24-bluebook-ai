    "An incredible wealth of knowledge about Sephardi Jews, the Ottoman Empire, the Atlantic World, and theories of ethnicity and diaspora. I also became a more inquisitive and curious historian!",

    "This course was very strong. Prof. Gonzalez is a wonderful instructor and all of the readings were very well chosen. Prof. Gonzalez did a great job of making the class discussion dynamic and including everyone in the conversation and was very interested in ensuring that all of us understood what was going on and were learning. The emphasis on written assignments over fact-based tests was also very much appreciated (and served, I feel, as a better metric of understanding).",

    "Yes. I learned so much about Judaism and my own Judaism in a fun and challenging way."
