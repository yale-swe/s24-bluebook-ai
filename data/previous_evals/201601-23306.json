I really enjoyed the final prescription assignment, and putting all the pieces together. I would have loved to do more of this, as this was when I could really see what I'd learned and what I was still having trouble conceptualizing. It would have been nice to have some sort of prescription assignment for each module."

The course integrates concepts from other courses in the school and provides a holistic integration of my academic goals in understanding restoration, ecology, rural development, and agroforestry. This has been an invaluable course for me here in FES."
