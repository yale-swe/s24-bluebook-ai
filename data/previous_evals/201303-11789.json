    "A fun, chill, engaging, and rewarding seminar with a great professor. As a STEM major, this class tickled a part of my brain not normally stimulated. You read a series of works written by famous Greek authors and watch five films. The texts are great and the movies, although disturbing, were pretty good. Class is small (5 students) so the reading is not optional. Workload is standard for a seminar: a midterm and final paper as well as two shorter 2.5pg papers. A brilliant professor, Syrimis is approachable and eager to help his students. Take this course."
