   "comments": [
    "You learn about the basic structure of the screenplay by reading other works and watching film clips. At the end of the semester, the focus shifts toward production of your own script.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. I learned so much about screenwriting, movies, and writing in general. I not only feel confident starting my own independent screenwriting projects in the future, but I feel as if I understand movies in general much better in a way that will enhance my enjoyment of films from now on.",
    "A seminar in which you watch great movie clips, talk about them, and learn from them as you develop your own screenplay. It's okay if you've never written one or don't have a lot of film knowledge, you will by the end of the class! Camille is also amazing. She is extremely nice, helpful, and patient.",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to get really comfortable with screenplay structure and the (incredibly important) planning stages involved in writing a screenplay. And by the end of the course you'll really have an understanding of why some movies seem so well-written while others fall apart. And you'll feel confident enough to write your own!",
    "You learn the basics of writing a screenplay. You parse a few. You write your own. It's simple, and a great fifth class (i.e. not much work).",
    "I recommend wholeheartedly.",
    "It's as much about learning the basic structure of Hollywood films as it is about writing them, but Camille is a wonderful professor who will help you in whatever way you need. I'm glad I took it, especially given the relative lack of creative writing classes available at Yale.",
    "If you get into this class you HAVE to take it. It is incredible and not just about exploring how to write, but how to take your own self and translate your emotions, mind and heart onto the page.",
    "Take it. It's the best."
