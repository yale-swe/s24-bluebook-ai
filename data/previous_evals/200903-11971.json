   "comments": [
    "This class traces the development of America's foreign policy, and it does a great job at looking at the history and the various academic theories. Gottlieb adds his own realism, and this grounds the class in the policy world. It's great. Absolutely take it.",
    "Yes, it is the first lecture that I've ever actually wanted to attend.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a good foundation of US foreign policy history and current issues. A lot of the content was interesting, and I feel comfortable discussing most current events now.",
    "Great course, interesting topics. Anyone can\/should take it. Stu Gottlieb is a great lecturer. Workload seems heavy but you don't have to do all the reading. Policy memo was a fun exercise. And don't believe Gottlieb, you CAN Credit\/D the course...",
    "PLSC 148 is worth taking, no matter what major or what interest you have. Prof Gottlieb will engage you with interesting and captivating readings and lectures. You will come away from class every time having learned something, guaranteed. Do the readings, they're worth it even though there's a lot. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, hands down.",
    "Great class encompassing American foreign policy from revolution to present. You will learn a lot about your country, hear great American quotes every day, and become a better citizen for it.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in America's role in the world. You will learn a LOT!",
    "Pretty good class. After the history section of the syllabus was over, I occasionally felt like we didn't have enough direction in day-to-day lectures (which of these anecdotes should I be writing down?) but altogether, after taking this class, I feel much more qualified to talk about the US foreign policy tradition and the challenges that face us abroad today.",
    "Learn about the history of US foreign policy and how it works today. Useful if you are interested in that (as I am)",
    "Political Science 148 discusses American foreign policy traditions and trends since America's founding. While the course covers the entirety of American history, it does not feel like a survey course since the class is small and lectures are detailed and compelling. Professor Gottlieb is also a great lecturer and a very approachable guy.I had never taken a course in political science before and while I found the amount of reading to be a little overwhelming, I felt I got a lot out of this course. If you are not a PoliSci major and are looking to try your hand or learn a bit about America's role in the world, I highly recommend this class, as it is a rigorous but doable course, as long as you are willing to attend lectures and sections and do the reading.",
    "An overview of the important periods and events in US Foreign Policy and the factors which influenced them. View each on an individual, state, and international level and in the context of the global balance of power.",
    "Take this class",
    "This class is wonderful. Take it, take it, take it. Take it no matter how much you know or don't know about the history of American foreign policy! You'll learn American history all the way through today, from a foreign policy lens, with an incredible professorwho has the legit experience to make up what he says. You'll want to go to lecture, and want to do the reading. The workload looks like a lot, but you'll quickly figure out what readings you need and the assignments are very do-able. I had a fair amount of policy and history experience before this class and I still feel I learned a significant amount. altogether one of the BEST classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for all Poli Sci majors as well as anyone interested in America's role in and interactions with the rest of the world.",
    "The class has a very manageable workload, an important and interesting subject matter, and a Professor who is entertaining, engaging, and helpful. It's really everything you can ask for. If you're interested in examining the forces that shape and have shaped US foreign policy, it's a great class. Do not expect Gottlieb to cater to the prevailing liberal sentiments of our age group; he does a great job of examining American foreign policy as a whole, noting both Republican and Democratic successes and failures."
