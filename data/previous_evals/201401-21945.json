    "An amazing class that both introduces WGSS, and places women's, gender and sexuality issues in a global framework. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is looking to discover the world of WGSS and is also interested in international affairs.",
    "Good class if you are interested in WGSS; if you have any modicum of feelings about gender inequality, you can guess what the professors and TAs want to hear. The two papers had strangely specific prompts but were manageable.",
    "This is a solid 5th class in my opinion - two papers, reading responses, and a final. Most of the material was super interesting, and really relevant; you'll start noticing things you talk about in class happening in your everyday life. As long as you actually do the readings, you'll be fine. A word of warning - study for the final!! The final this semester did not match the tone of the course; it was incredibly long and we only had two hours, instead of the full three, so make sure you know your stuff going in.",
    "Very important fundamental ways of thinking about sex, gender, and transnational processes. I think everybody should take a course like this at least once.",
    "This is a great course if you want to explore in depth the terminology and debates in the fields of WGSS or even cultural anthropology. There is a lot of reading, but not much work outside of that. Lectures are interesting overall and will present you with concepts that will make you think about the world more critically. I recommend this class.",
    "This is an amazing course!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! Gender in a Transnational World was an eye-opening class, especially if you haven't taken any WGSS courses before, or done copious amounts of background reading in about gender, sexuality, race, or transnationalism. Not all of the material is going to be completely new, but it's presented in a formalized way that is interesting, and that provides more of a solid foundation for concepts that are otherwise manifested only in an informal, anecdotal form. The readings are interesting, so I think it would be a shame not to give them the attention they deserve. I had other classes that were more work than this one, so I unfortunately ended up having this one fall to the wayside in terms of actually doing the readings, but despite that I still ended up getting a lot out of it from lecture, or even just skimming the readings."
