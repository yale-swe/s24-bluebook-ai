   "comments": [
    "This course was a lot more interesting than BENG351 in the sense that it is a lot more mathematical. It actually felt more like an engineering course, and I appreciated the inclusion of some programming elements. If you have a good understanding of circuits you will find this class to be a cakewalk.Its greatest weakness I would say is the fact that it is team-taught, I feel -and know that I am not alone in this from speaking to my peers- that the class would have been much better had it been taught exclusively by Professor Duncan.I think the course could be improved a great deal by inclusion of design elements (i.e. building some sort of working circuitry, perhaps a rudimentary sensing apparatus). Also, a greater emphasis on programming is essential for the well-rounded education of any engineer in my opinion, and while the course has some simulink early on it could do with a lot more programming.",
    "only take it if you have to",
    "Yes, it is a good BME core class.",
    "I would recommend BME 352 to anyone who is interested in applying math to physiology, or someone who is good with circuits.",
    "Know circuits.",
    "It's not too bad as far as required classes go, but don't expect it to live up to BME I. Both lecturers are a bit dry at times; the material is a lot of mathematical modeling (simplifying physiological systems into analog circuits), which is not very hard in itself, though it can be tedious. GO TO SECTION to get through the problem sets - Prof. Duncan's especially are not trivial, though once you know what to do, aren't that bad. Both lecturers post comprehensive notes after class, and exams are open-notes, making it difficult to resist skipping.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in BME. It covers a spectrum of BME topics and is very interesting.",
    "only take if a requirement. First semester of this class is more interestong"
