    "1. The Graedel et al. text didn't do as good a job of stitching together the themes of the course as we might have hoped. I found it frustrating how much those authors who had contributed to the work stayed within their academic comfort zones in a book intended to transcend disciplines and be integrative across them. Sometimes the number of readings was completely unmanageable - the students would talk about how much they wanted to do all of the readings, but most can't read more than four or five works per week per class, no matter how much they want to. We could have, I think, had there been fewer assignments - but with deliverables to hand in, it's hand in assignments or do the reading. I often chose do the reading over hand in assignments, but this is not a decision academia supports or rewards (even if the point of going back to school, for many, is to have time to read deeply and prioritize time for reflection...)Another important comment on the readings - I know Os is probably already aware of this, but there is tremendous redundancy in the readings being assigned within disciplines - ie I had read a handful of the Os papers in Landscape Ecology; likewise, several of us in my discussion section alone had read many of the Hebert papers in Dove's Social Science - Intro to Theory and Methods last fall. The redundancy at FES baffles me - are there really no other good papers worth reading within these disciplines? Or have we, via our previous courses, already covered a notable depth and breadth of the discipline? Somehow I doubt it, but there is A LOT of repetition. I think it would be terrific to have a faculty-accessed (or TF managed) database listing what readings individual professors are assigning in which classes. You'd find Dove\/Kammen and Kareiva are being read by the same students, many timesover.3. I thought there were too many out of class assignments, and didn't feel writing the Concept Assessments added anything to my learning. I very much liked the reading reponses and the opportunity to read and engage with my classmates' thoughts on the week's readings in advance of discussion. I also got a lot out of discussion, although we had a few really difficult personalities in our section.7. Gabe was wonderful, and really thoughtful and deliberate in the way he managed our discussion section. We were a challenging and high-maintenance group, and he got texts, Gchats, and emails at all hours of the day and night.10. I think that the emphasis the faculty put on the phrase \"conceptual framework\" in the beginning of the semester is really informative, and important to retain. This class (in its current form) wasn't about what you make\/build\/create\/research - it was supposed to inform how you think.",
    "Since this was the first year of the class it is hard to be too critical. However, many assignments were sprung on us last minute, were not thoroughly integrated into the course, and were graded much harsher than they need to be.",
    "Question 1: Not all of the readings for this class were useful. In fact, on multiple occasions the professors acknowledged this to our discussion section. But if each week we have to (1) write an essay, (2) share it with our discussion section, (3) read everyone's essays,(4) write a second essay in response, (5)share the second essay with our discussion section, and (6) read everyone's second essays, shouldn't we be using the best readings available?Question 3: The out-of-class assignments were not particularly helpful, especially the concept assessments. After the first assessment was handed back, most people realized that it was more productive to write based on the grading rubric than to write a good overall essay. My grades consistently improved as the quality of my writing deteriorated. The concept assessments also took up quite a bit of time. Throughout the semester, I spent about 6 full days of work on the concept assessments. I often felt that that time could have been better spent.Question 4: The work load was significantly larger than my other two courses combined.Question 8: I liked the concept of this course, but it will take some time before the execution is mastered.Question 10: This course has the potential to be quite useful to people in my field, especially for students new to the concept of sustainability.",
    "In response to question 7, Laura was a phenomenal TA. I felt I learned the most in discussion section through the dialogs and debates she set up.In response to question 4, the workload was heavier than any 2 other classes combined I have taken at FES. Without the extra project, it would be about the same (about 100 pages of reading per week, 3 pages of writing every week, with an additional 5 pages of writing every few weeks). The concept assessments were especially helpful in teaching me to synthesize what we were learning and apply it to situations.In response to question 6, the lecture portion of class moved very slowly, especially on the weeks where the professors chose to lecture on the exact same material as the reading for that week, in which they generally just summarized what we had all read in preparation for the class. I would have liked to go deeper into the material in class than we did in the readings.",
    "All the subsequent comments come with full recognition that this was the first year of the class. Criticism is intended to be constructive.",
    "Question 11 - This class was all over the place conceptually, but that is in some ways to its credit. This class forced me outside of the fields I'm used to working in, which is especially desirable for a sustainability themed course. If anything, instructors gave too little credit to the students' ability to think about a wide range of fields, and material felt dumbed-down at times, but only infrequently.",
    "By \"Lap\/Fieldtrip\" I assume you mean discussion sessions as well. Our discussion sessions were the highlight of the class. Laura Robb is the best TA I've ever had and I really appreciate the work she put in. She's incredibly adept at managing discussion sessions, was incredibly responsive to students questions and always on the ball.",
    "Taking this course was like doing 3 courses because seems like the professors are pushing us to do so much work to meet the 6 credit hours.",
    "10) The course provides a good overview of many natural resource topics (e.g. water, energy, minerals\/metals, etc.), importantly including how they are linked to each other. I think all students coming out of FES should have a basic understanding of all of these topics.7) Laura was definitely the best TA I have had so far at FES. She kept discussions moving very well.9c) It was great having the talk with David Owen and speaking with Bristol Bay residents re: Pebble Mine.",
    "1, 3, 6, 8:This is a new 6 credit course and the 4 professors gave it a commendable effort. There was a heavy load of reading and writing to justify the 6 credits. The assignments helped to develop imaginative thinking and analytical skills, although there was less feedback on skills than if it were a writing class, probably because the profs and TA's were overworked also.There could (next year) be more done with the integrative aspects of sustainability study. We were often hugely impressed with the environmental challenges faced by the discrete disciplines being represented, and how one thing complicates another thing, but less often learning about putting it all together effectively, making the \"Linkages\" usefully.Expect changes from comments made by student discussion groups at the end of the term to improve the content and approach to the subject next year.",
    "I enjoyed the course, the professors' perspectives, the assignments and the discussions but I think I would re-consider the concept assessments. At times, the assignment was not entirely clear and I'm not sure how much I actually benefitted from writing them.",
    "The course was disappointing and frustrating.",
    "7c. Laura was easily the best TA I have had at Yale. I was impressed with how well she prepared and smoothly transitioned topics in section, creating a comfortable atmosphere where everyone was able to voice their opinion and learn from\/challenge each other. This was one of the first sections I actually looked forward to.",
    "There were clear problems with the format of this course and some tactics explored were clearly more successful than others. For example, the little debates and talk show format of the last ten to twenty minutes of class always seemed like a waste of time, though we all know what was being attempted. It might be better to just embrace the fact that the group dynamic of a small seminar and large lecture of very very differeent. Opening the room up to questions does not equal some sort of group participation. It is not a terribly comfortable space for discussion or for the open airing of any real disagreement.The pairing of two or three professors within a single lecture however was quite successful. Early in the semester the transitions were very very forced and the short interjections felt like littleinserted PSAs (\"this brief message brought to you by the field of anthropology...\") but as the course went on, they seemed to get more engaging and it was very effective when instructors were willing to disagree and engage with each other's arguements or line of reasoning.",
    "I think the concept of the course is fantastic and really important. The problem was in execution, which I understand is very difficult for a new class of this type. I found the workload to be huge, without giving me the same benefit learning-wise as the number of hours I put into it. I would encourage in the future for the course to reduce the load - e.g. the number of pages of reading, the number of concept assessments and\/or the midterm and final projects - and pay special attention to clarity. The concept assessments in particular often felt forced, where by the end I felt like I had to go through every reading and lecture and pull out anything that might be relevant and make sure to document it, rather than being able to rely more fluidly on how the course materials had impacted my thinking. Greater coordination would also be helpful in giving the assignments and clarifying expectations. In addition, although I recognize the professors want the course to be academic, I think a lot of us struggled with wanting to know how to fix the problems raised, or at least some of the approaches that have been tried. It's very demoralizing to sit in a class that tells you about all these horrible things that are happening to the planet and then not to get into the discussion about what to do about that. We talked a lot about those issues in section, but it would be nice to have the lectures augmented by some presentation of potential policy solutions.",
    "#3. The weekly responses to the readings were very helpful - I learned more doing these than at any other point in the class. The Concept Assessments were not. It doesn't seem to me that an additional assessment of our grasp on the concepts is necessary (I would think the weekly responses and discussion board are a more accurate reflection than anything else could be). The concept assessments didn't seem to serve any purpose other than trying to tell us that communication with various audiences is important. That is a different class, and one that certainly needs to be taught at FES -- trying to teach it by tossing it into a rubric without any attempt at guidance shows a shallow appreciation of exactly how important that subject is.#6. We seemed to go over the same things several times. It would have been more interesting to get an overview from each teacher first, and then delve deeper into the interconnections earlier on. It seemed like the bulk of the class, up until the last week or two, was introductory.",
    "This class was sometimes confusing. Expectations for assignments were often communicated unclearly or too late. The concept assessments were annoying and, toward the end of the semester, used up time that could have been better spent on the group projects. The readings could have been more focused.I chalk all this up to it being the first version of this class. It was apparent that the professors all put in significant effort (preparing their lectures, etc.). Also, the tag team format must have been challenging.Overall, I'm glad I took this class and I got a lot out of it, but hopefully if it runs again it will run more smoothly.",
    "I am commenting on question 7. I believe that 3 of the 4 professor did an excellent job. Karen Seto did not do an excellent job. We turned in a 20 page midterm that she was supposed to grade and return with insightful comments. She wrote 40 words that did not say anything about our subject or what we could do better or what she like. She then gave us a 9 out 15 with no explanation about her criteria. The mark and the comments was interesting because the other professors that read our paper thought our work was great, but also gave us lots of feedback about what they like and did not like about our study. Karen Hebert and Oz gave us extensive comments. Karen Hebert gave use more comments on our first paragraph then Karen Seto gave us on our entire paper. When we questioned Karen Seto about what we could do better, the meeting did not illuminate anything that we could do better or what she liked about our study. She told us to not feel bad because she had given other people worse grades. We came away from the meeting feeling like she did not read the paper and did not really care about our work. I mean if someone gave us an awful mark and explained the reasoning behind their thinking then it would be ok.",
    "If I felt likeF&ES administration cared at all or read our course evaluation responses, I would feel more inclined to spend a lot of time answering these questions. However, I have spent a lot of time in the past composing thoughtful answers, and it has been clear that F&ES does not take student opinion into account.That said, I do NOT recommend Linkages of Sustainability as it is AT ALL, I resent every last second I had to spend working on contrived, educationally worthless assignments for this class. It is not worth 6 credits of time, energy, or tuition money. I do know that the professors spent a lot of time planning the class, I think that with MAJOR reworking, it could be worth taking, but if kept as is, it is not."

    "I enjoyed the opportunity to take a course with a disciplinary \"hub\" (of the four \"hubs\") way out of my own research interests. I would never have taken a course with Tom Graedel\/focusing on anything involving industrial anything if it were not for Linkages. Not because I don't want to (I want to take almost every course we offer) but because there is so little time in a two year degree. I use the Rhenium example all the time when discussing natural resources availability...the same probably goes for Karen Seto and her class, although to a less extreme degree. It was neat to achieve greater breadth in disciplinary areas with the same number of course credits.As I mentioned already, I really enjoyed the weekly response and the comment on the response process. I also loved about our discussion section that we created a little community around food and friendship, which buoyed our project group when we really wanted to kill one another, right after the midterm. Had we not had that (carefully created) community, at least two of us would have dropped the class.",
    "Giving me a broad view of sustainability and how they might be linked together.",
    "The lectures, readings, and even the concept assessments were useful, I thought; I learned a lot in this class. There was just too much work overall. The professors were very accessible and open, which was nice, and I got more opportunities to interact with them than i thought. I loved having all of the professors' viewpoints in lectures, and I liked hearing about how their perspectives had changed as a result of the course.",

    "I like the interdisciplinary approach.",
    "The diversity of student interests and ideas.",
    "Discussion section.",
    "It was a good survey course. It gave a good introduction to environmental\/sustainability issues that I've never studied.",
    "Broaching the fact that interdisciplinarity is a necessity in thinking about environmental issues, or issues of sustainability. It was also valuable to hear from all of the professors in various classes. A new perspective was always illuminating. Finally, the last lecture in which professor's provided their personal frameworks of sustainability was quite interesting, and informed much of what had been said over the course of the semester.",
    "I thought this course was a good general overview of concepts of sustainability in the beginning. However, as the course progressed, it seemed like concepts just kept being repeated without any real \"linkages\" being made. Furthermore, I wish the professors had given more solutions of sustainable systems... instead of just showing how everything isn't sustainable... Or was that the message of the course?Furthermore, I think there needs to be an economics viewpoint brought in... since most of the issues we covered in the course required that perspective. I would NOT make this course a required class for all MEMs... it needs much more development before that happens.",
    "Discussion sections.",
    "Discussion sessions were great. Also the opportunity to speak more philosophically about the issues we'll face as \"future leaders\" or whatever we're calling ourselves nowadays.",
    "-really great introduction to many sustainability issues - think that every 1st year should at least know a bit and read a few papers, selected by profs in each field, about major sustainability issues.-i never got bored with the way the class was structured, it was really a 'buffet' course where I feel like i gained a huge breadth of knowledge, and the point was not necessarily depth in every area, but ability to talk about and understand how to approach and think about many different issues.-by far the class i talked about most 'outside of class' with peers and family etc.",
    "it forced me to dig deep into my conceptualization of sustainability",
    "Learning about topics I knew less about (minerals\/energy) and seeing how they applied to the topics I was more familiar\/interested in.",
    "Laura was an excellent TA and made discussion sessions interesting and meaningful. also, thinking about definitions of sustainability is a useful and important exercise that is often overlooked otherwise.",

    "The concepts were very interesting and very important. The readings were usually thought-provoking and informative.",
    "You get to know four faculty for the price of two.The group project was the best part of this class. The exercise of choosing a concise and interesting research question is good preparation for doing the same on a larger scale later in the FES program.The practice of having profs. attend a section or two is valuable and should be continued.",
    "There were few bright spots. One was the final project - I enjoyed working with my partner and we really through ourselves into our final presentation and paper, working extremely hard and learning a lot.Overall, the class was good and has the potential to be great. It should be kept, should be made into 2 mandatory semesters (6&6 credits spread across the 1st year), and should take the place of the bin requirements for MEMs. I also strongly suggest that the administration take a long hard look at this class and streamline it to be a great one. There should be a selection committee to decide who gets to teach the class and professors who do should be honored to do so. Teaching this class should be something that professors put on their resume.",
    "The TA was great and so were the lectures by Oz, Tom and Karen Hebert.",
    "The professors clearly spent a good deal of time preparing for the class and attended every lecture regardless of whether they were lecturing or not. This was impressive.",
    "All four of the profs attended each class session. I think this is an amazing break-through for FES! This kind of team work was wonderful to see and i think that profs should see what each other are teaching in the classroom more often."

   "comments": [
    "Everyone is going to say the bins. But really, the bins were not the problem so much as the fact that the faculty (the non-Linkages faculty) compelled conformity to the bins in the face of innovation. That completely disgusted me - there should be a system for applying to the faculty (as a unit) to be \"forgiven\" or allowed to transcend outdated or overly prescriptive course requirements (bins, or some future version of bins) in order to experiment and innovate. Even if the bins are replaced in the near term, any future set of requirements will eventually become outdated by the very nature of the way systems develop. The key will be to create a process that supports and enables innovation, instead of hindering it. Those requirements really made the students who were affected by them completely crazy with frustration this semester. Here they were trying to take their education in new and more integrative directions and getting pushed back into disciplinary boxes (I mean, we even CALL them bins!)The thing that bothered me the most was the lack of communication about expectations (there are many, many formats a professional memo can take, as those of us who have worked professionally can attest), both with assignments and with the midterm and final. Trying to meet with the faculty with our project group was absolutely self-defeating because you so contradicted one another. The excitement the faculty felt while helping us to explore their disciplinary areas was exciting (to me, at least), but was very, very frustrating when you took it back to the workbench and tried to combine it into a project that anyone could do in a semester. My roommate commented that the class effectively had us writing finals more similar to mini-master's theses, ratherthan creating a theoretical framework and trying to actually apply it (which we so, so, so wanted to do, in my group).Finally, my TF's group made some really wonderful suggestions about where this class could go in the future, in terms of format. I think the SOM-inspired case study approach has a lot to offer Linkages - more classes like Pebble Mine and the see-it-from-all-sides approach, more content, better analysis, closer and more in-depth focus on a problem, and less incomprehensible professorial tag-teaming in lecture. I hope that that feedback will be incorporated, because we effectively designed a class we'd all love to take!",
    "Since the reading is different background, I would prefer professors gave a little bit instruction to link them together before.I always had a feeling that i had so many questions after reading but I didn't know how to solve them effectively.The discussion section sometime made no sense to me because there is always no specific topics.Lectures are sometimes too repetive of the readings but offer no new ideas and thoughts.And it took too much time for the professors to approve our project and also to grade on our mid-term project. There is not much time left for us to work.",
    "It sucks. It takes up ALL OUR TIME, we have no room for anything else in our lives. The \"debates\" toward the end of class were of limited usefulness, especially the last one. The grading was absurdly hard, and I felt like every time I did an assignment I tried my hardest but received a terrible grade simply because the professors were unable to articulate exactly what they wanted well enough for me to fulfill that. Basically they were such hard graders and so unable to articulate what they really wanted out of assignments that I did terribly on pretty much everything and now, writing the final paper, i have ZERO incentive to even try. I hate this class, I hate how much stress it has caused me, I hate the arbitrary grading, I hate this final paper, basically I have a lot of hate for this class. Also, the lack of a policy person was difficult at some points, when we wanted to know what is actually done about issues in addition to how to think about them.",
    "The organization of the lectures and the integration and scheduling of assignments.",
    "The practice of identifying the possible definitions of \"sustainability\" needs to be addressed early in the semester with athorough analysis of the various approaches one can take. The professors never presented their own definitions of \"sustainability\", nor did they provide a framework for using the word in practice. For each concept assessment, students simply made up a definition for \"sustainability\" that agreed with the argument they sought to make. I understand that \"sustainability\" is a difficult word to define, but other disciplines have equally challenging terms and manage to establish working definitions. Our class lacked any sense of a working definition of \"sustainability\", greatly hampering our discussions.The class should focus more on case studies like those used toward the end of the semester. Case studies provide opportunities for the students to address complex yet limited problems using the various perspectives presented in lecture. Without opportunities to apply the perspectives, little is taken away from the lectures.The grading system also needs improvement. Grades were assessed not based on the quality of writing, but on whether the student somehow mentioned each topic listed in the grading rubric. Overall, the grades were quite harsh given that the lectures presented so few techniques for applying sustainability in practice.",
    "This course would be more successful if the focus of the class was on sustainability solutions...not merely a barrage of problems. The class should also make more of an effort to tap into student ideas. The panel discussion among professors that concluded some lectures was of little benefit to students and was, quite frankly, a little pretentious. In addition, the course requirements that force students into discussion (reading reviews and responses) were entirely unnecessary and very undergraduate-like in nature. Student opinions and discussion would have flowed more freely on the discussion boards if those draconian requirements and weekly deadlines were removed.",
    "Coordination of the workload, such that concept assessments are not due the same week as the midterm\/final presentation, or the same week as extra-long reading assignments.",
    "- Making sure that it covers the bins it's supposed to be covering- The policy\/economics perspective - would have been better to have a professor who could cover that perspective- Lecture style - the panel in front of the room was awkward, and it seemed like there was a semester-long struggle to figure out how to allow for class participation",
    "1) Communication about assignment guidelines and expectations.2) The function of the final project. (Research for the final project should, I believe, be better integrated into coursework.)3) More work toward synthesis of concepts.4) More specifics--perhaps case studies--and less conceptual discussion of what sustainability means and the inherent trade-offs. This can, and should, occupy the first three or four weeks of classes, but probably no more.",
    "Concept assessments and the whole-class debate. Concept assessments steadily improved over the course of the semester. The final debate was a disaster.",
    "The course touched on the surface of many issues but didn't delve deep enough. Most people had a decent amount of experience with most issues that professors raised but we were ready for a more in-depth conversation.Also, instructors were sometimes not as prepared for lectures as I thought they should have been. Students would ask them questions about graphs they were using and the instructors did not know the answers.",
    "-figuring out how to make the assignments manageable and worthwhile",
    "better coordinated assignments. too much writing. not enough time to ponder.",
    "- The flow of the course. Every environmental problems were discussed without solutions. We need to know and learn what the solutions are.- The professors are not giving their views, which student are so curious about.- We need to also learn ocean and policy, which haven't been touched in the class.- It was strange that the concept assessments were not related to the weekly readings. They were like the additional burden given just to make students busy.",
    "Some of the readings were, quite frankly, a waste of time. I'd have preferred fewer but higher quality readings.",
    "lectures could have been a lot more in depth. some lectures only barely scratched the surface, and were frustrating in their simplicity - particularly those on ecology.",

Responses tended to be too long to provide the opportunity to review them effectively before discussion group.",
    "Not enough depth in any topic; it was somewhat disorganized and I often felt unsure of what the requirements for a given assignment were; we were told about many assignments last minute; some assignments seemed like busywork and were not particularly worthwhile; the concept assessments were graded rather arbitrarily.Also, I grew frustrated with the constant reiteration of the complication of many problems, with little attention dedicated to problem solving. I think that rather than doing more of a research project, it would be very interesting to use that opportunity to try to tackle some of these challenges, and actually suggest a more concrete solution.",
    "Format (how to break out into smaller groups more efectively. also how to have more productive TA sessions). Quality of readings.",
    "Coordination amongst the professors and TA's; clarity about assignments; workload (too high). Also, I think a lot of people would have appreciated greater depth on the topics presented. This is of course very difficult given the huge amount of material the professors are trying to address, but it might be achieved using case studies more or even just going more in depth on a particular example as part of the larger, higher-level lecture.",
    "Assignments. Directions for concept assessments werepoorly written, and expectations for the midterm and final project were unclear. These assignments were not complementary with the lectures, readings,&discussion board, but detracted from my experience in the class.I think a lot of the difficulties with the class are due to the class size. This is a good model, but not one suited to a large lecture. Maybe all faculty members should teach a version of this class so it would be open to all students while maintaining a discussion size.",
    "See #11, above.",
    "Lectures need to be more focused. I would suggest that the professor review each presentation and really cull out what the learning-goal is for that presentation. Identify what the main concepts that students should gain and keep coming back to these in the lecture. The lectures should be organized and a complete thought on a topic. Some lectures attempted this but still failed. There were two particular lectures where the professor had put \u0093questions to answer\u0094 on the first slide and did not answer any of them by the time the lecture was over. Professors must ask themselves \u0093what is the objective of this lecture\u0094 before proceeding and they must constantly remind themselves (and the students) of this objective throughout the presentation.Because the class covers a wide range of topics, it did not seem fair to have TAs doling out number grades on topics that they don\u0092t fully understand \u0096 sometimes less than the students writing the responses. I\u0092m not sure how to fix this, but the grading system needs to be reviewed with this in mind.The concept assessments must be better organized, especially in their grading. It was never made clear to students that we must define our \u0093own version of sustainability\u0094 to be successful on the concept assessments until after the 2nd grade was handed back. I don\u0092t mind the assignments \u0096 I actually enjoyed them, but it seemed like the professors and TAs were attempting to hide their true expectations in the CAs until well into the semester. This is obviously a problem. What they are, why we are doing them, and what is expected should be made clear from the get go. We had suggested not grading the first CA so that folks could get used to them before working on the next 4 \u0096 I would agree with this.When the professors ask questions for which they should be providing the answers, it wastes students\u0092 time. There were numerous occasions in class where broad-ranging questions were asked about topics that the professor should have been providing case studies, opinions, or answers for. It was troubling how often some of the professors shied away from trying to come up with solutions for such problems. Such class moments must be avoided next year.More case studies are needed. As I\u0092ve noted, the class rarely provided \u0093answers\u0094 to problems. Granted \u0096 there are few answers that we currently have for our numerous environmental problems. But the class must provide opinions or examples of successes \/ failures \/ hypotheticals that we can discuss and critique.The course was challenging and I\u0092m not asking for increased rigor - however, some of the lectures seemed to cover relatively obvious concepts that many of us already understood. Providing a baseline is necessary, but spending too much time on elementary concepts takes away from the linkages.Class organizers should go to the Yale Library journal article search and type in \u0093link\u0094 or \u0093linkage\u0094 \u0096 you\u0092d be amazed how many articles have been written that we didn\u0092t read that have been looking at how certain environmental issues link up with others.Another suggestion would be a repository (NOT on classes V2 \u0096 but something faster and more user friendly through myFES) of past presentations and documents from students\u0092 final projects from the course. No one wants to lose that work forever once the semester\u0092s over. And if this course is to be a bedrock, we should keep records of what we\u0092ve all learned in the past.:::CONTINUED IN NEXT ANSWER BOX:::",

More office hours in advance of the midterm would have been very much appreciated. If I'm not mistaken Professor Seto actually canceled a bunch of her office hours right before the midterm, which a lot of groups were upset about. We of course all know you can bring questions to faculty long before the midterm is actually due, but sometimes you don't realize how little synergy group members have until you're trying to put it all together.We were very appreciative of the time and guidance when we did meet with faculty, though.",

    "QUESTION 13 - CONTINUED:::Team teaching this course will require more communication about teaching style in the future \u0096 not just content. There was a large discrepancy in how each professor seemed to think the course should be moving. I did like that Professor Schmitz was willing to constantly go out on a limb and present his opinions on issues at hand. He also seemed to possess a definition of sustainability that other professors were never willing to give. Professor Graedel also did a fair job of explaining how he views the world in an environmental sense, however Profs. Hebert and Seto never seemed to give opinions on how they thought we should attempt to solve the environmental problems at hand \u0096 they just gave more and more problems.This was a let down for us. I was hoping that professors would stir the pot with their own versions of sustainability and we could use discussion time to agree or disagree with their opinions (especially since they demanded that we have our own versions of sustainability through the concept assessments). I am certain that many students wanted more opinions from professors as to what they thought were good starts or inroads toward curbing environmental degradation. I certainly don\u0092t expect professors to solve the world\u0092s problems, but some positive case studies could be a start. Even in the last lecture \u0096 when each professor was supposed to give their vision of sustainability \u0096 most shied away from taking stands. It\u0092s grad school, not high school \u0096 don\u0092t be afraid to give an opinion. Also, they have PhDs \u0096 they shouldn\u0092t be afraid to show us why they got one.",
    "Jen was wonderful. She really worked hard and took a lot of heat that was really aimed at the professors.",

Those ended up being some pretty big, occasionally pretty lumpy bumps, though.I'm a forest-research-focused student, with several years' professional work experience, interested in non-profit management. And the course as it was - I don't know that it fit at all, to be honest.",

Basically I think it would be a really great, really useful class if I didn't have so much burning, all-consuming hatred for it.",
    "My academic background is in social science. This course was not particularly helpful for this background. Much of the class focused on how difficult it is to identify the most sustainable approach to a topic. I'm well-educated in understanding complexity; I came to F&ES to learn how to identify and implement solutions.For someone without a background in social science or prior experience in the field of sustainability, however, this class could be quite useful. This is especially true for first-year students who have not yet taken a wide range of other classes at FES.",

On the other hand, as someone who has been working between academic discipines for a very long time, it was interesting to see how dificult this was for individual instructors and how uncomportable it often made both teachers and students. So, I'm glad this course was offered, and I'm sure it was useful to me, but it did not help me develop any new perspectives on sustainability or realy move beyond a very basic popular science level of instruction in any topic.",

I think the future iterations of this course will live up to our expectations (I hope so!), but I don't know that I learned very much from the class, in terms of new knowledge. Some of my classmates really did (I can think of one converted sceptic in particular), and it was exciting (really exciting) to watch him learn the biology, and the natural resource management, and the social science stuff. I think talking to him helped me to like Linkages more because I saw how much he was taking away from it. I think I come from a more inter (trans, multi, whatever) disciplinary background, and so had been exposed to a greater breadth of readings before the class. But man was it cool to watch him learn.As for me, my response to question 16 sort of sums it up. The personalities in my project group left me utterly exhausted andemotionally drained, and I feel like we have little to show for it, despite having put in completely ridiculous amounts of time on our group project. Because there is no space for us to hand in our \"process\" (the things we produced between assignment and midterm, or midterm and final) the faculty will never see what I consider to be among our most interesting work and documents.

It was impossible to coordinate the six people involved not because there were six of us, but because of the personalities involved. It was a truly miserable experience for me - I lose every discussion we have, no matter how much energy, positivity, pep, or innovation I bring to the project or the discussion at hand. I've tried everything I can thing of, but at this point I just want it over with.",
    "We got along really well and learned from each other a lot.But the requirement to choose a partner inside a discussion group is so limited and we are all sacrificing our own interests to work together. Hope we can pick partner in the all class.",
    "oh god. basically there is no reason to assign group work except to illustrate what work might be like in the real world, and it makes everything 100% harder. since we only got to pick our partners in our discussion section, no one's interests really matched up with mine. i guess an advantage would be that we HAD to be more on top of things than we were otherwise, but basically everything else was a ton harder.",

    "In our section, each student presented an idea for a final project and the TA selected half of those projects and paired the other half of the students whose projects were selected with those students whose projects were selected. I ended up working on a project I did not choose with a student I never would have chosen to work with. I was left without any input in the project for the rest of the semester, being almost completely clueless about what it was, and in the end we produced a second-rate project after far too much disagreement. Working with others, especially those with whom you disagree is valuable, but there is a limit to how far that disagreement can be tolerated.The final presentations resulting from our groupwork were similarly overly stressful and underproductive. My biggest complaint about the final presentations is the time allotted to present a semester's worth of work. Several times I was given the answer that 10 minutes is the same amount of time that researchers are given at conferences, and I understand that, but at conferences, researchers are presenting to peers in their field. Because of the variability in groups' project topics, each group spent almost all of their 10 minutes introducing the material, having to start at the very beginning, and never got to present their interesting results in depth. In addition, each group should have been given 5 minutes for questions, which would have been interesting, but were instead allotted 2.

If things go downhill, you're already outnumbered.-This course has tremendous potential if taught as a series of closely focused case studies and analyses addressing interdisciplinary themes.-Don't attempt to do more than four or five discrete readings in a week, no matter how many are assigned. If you are the kind of person who has to read them all in depth to feel satisfied, you will drive yourself crazy.-This is a six credit class for a reason, and there's a reason 12 credits is a full courseload. I took 15 (2 six credit classes) and barely kept up.",

    "Lots of reading - plan accordingly",
    "Make sure you know the subject matter is somewhat topical, and with that in mind be sure to pick a project you're really interested in so you can delve deeper into sustainability issues though that assignment and get more out of the class.",
    "Keep in mind that this course involves a lot of writing. If you enjoy the semantic game of trying to come up with opperative definitions of sustainability over and over again and exploring the progression o your thiking through writing, the course will be grat for you. If you are looking for any concrete answers, benchmarks, guidelines or detailed or advanced analysis, this course will probably be very frustrating.",
    "It's a heavy load, and can be frustrating, but it's also a good opportunity to focus on and better understand the global - and often indirect - drivers and impacts of sustainability.",
    "The workload is heavy, even for a 6-credit class.",
    "I would advise students to critically consider the utility and pedagogical justification for this course, both its content and its design. This class was only successful in operating as a survey course, which is of poor utility for second year masters students. Given the lack of an articulated framework for interdisciplinarity (let alone \"transdisciplinarity\"), the course as currently structured provides little insight into either theoretical nor practical applications of environmental science. Disorganization plagued this course so I would advise students to critically assess the course syllabus for upcoming years, should this course continue to be offered. This wasimportant attempt towards a more comprehensive environmental education but the current iteration fell well short of the mark.",
    "It's a lot of work if you do it all - probably more than 2 regular other F&ES classes combined.Do the reading, keep an open mind, and try to get as much out of your final project as you can. For as much of a beast as the class is, it's do-able and you'll definitely learn a few things when all's said and done.",
    "This course is a lot of work. I think the professor will iron out the kinks, so take this course if you want to see the linkages between systems. If the course stays the same then there will be a lot of writing. The readings were great, but again this course will take a lot of time. If you have the time, the course will be worthwhile.",
    "Don't.",
    "Take it! We need this kind of course at FES! It was rocky this first semester but I believe it will be greatly improved and an amazing learning experience!"
