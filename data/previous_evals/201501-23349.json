    "I love this course for a few reasons. The first being that Dr. Leaderer challenges us to truly understand the obstacles of exposure assessment by making us our own research subjects. The methodology exercises were fun, informative, and a great way to fall back in love with science as a grad student. Second, Dr. Leaderer not only invites many other experts in their exposure field, but we also had some lectures with an individual with many years of professional private exposure assessment experience. Each lecture offers a wealth of information. I did feel that some of the readings in the beginning of the semester were a little redundant, but I liked Dr. Leaderer's ability to relate what we were learning to his experience in the field.I also really enjoy the assignment structure. The critiques are fun and offer us a very important skill. The take home was challenging, but getting to choose our final paper topic allows us to apply what we have learned to something we really care about.",
    "Introduction level course for occupational exposure assessment. Some guest speakers are really good (i.e. water lecture).",
    "I really enjoyed the format of the course. I thought that it was nice to have speakers come in and talk about their specific areas.",
    "Good.",
    "Overall this course was a very a good overview of how to conduct an exposure assessment. It was also one of the only courses in environmental health that was hands-on, and allowed you to conduct personal air monitoring and noise exposures.",
    "Strengths: broad coverage of exposure assessment techniques; interactive exposure assessment activities (i.e. the PM and noise exposure assessment exercises); critiques were great for showing how the concepts learned matter, etc.; tapping into the expertise of other faculty at YSPH\/Yale for topics in the latter half of the course Weaknesses: at times, especially in the beginning of the course, it seemed difficult to follow the flow\/organization of topics (I guess the course could have been better organized); it would have been nice to either have multiple lectures during the week or even give a 5-minute break in the middle of the lecture (between the two hours); some of the guest lecturers could have done an overall better job of keeping their lectures about exposure assessment",
    "This course provided an excellent introduction and overview to the complex topic of exposure assessment. The first half of the course was structured to give us an overview, and the second half gave us a series of different examples from different guest lecturers. Starting with the first half of the course: it is obvious that Dr. Leaderer brings a tremendous amount of experience to the table. To that effect, it seems rather frustrating to both us and him that so much time is spent covering basics of epidemiology and risk assessment, when we have had those concepts covered before. Given, this is primarily our own problem, since he frequently asked if the speed\/content was appropriate, and we failed to respond at all. Perhaps it would be better to push faster through the introductory information, then slow down if the class has trouble keeping up. Moving beyond, into the second half of the course: the guest lectures were very much hit or miss. The two lectures of physical stressors, while obviously important to the topic of exposure assessment, were not taught effectively at all, fraught with frequent tangents, trailed-off-sentences, and a fairly ineffective organization of information as a whole. Aside from those two lectures, the others were quite engaging and interesting. The checklist for critiquing exposure assessments that we needed to use for a number of assignments was fairly frustrating to use. While it does provide a good framework, there were many repetitive questions, and some room for expansion (results? potential impact of results?).",
    "Slow. Unclear. Not professional. No deep insights. I am disappointed."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is always available for us to help with anything from summer research, to general EHS questions, to thesis work. He is very approachable and provides irreplaceable advice. He is very forthright and direct, which is helpful for students trying to navigate research and class.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Professor Leaderer is knowledgable. We've been assigned of 2 interesting \"real world\" exposure assessment assignment.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Dr. Leaderer is an excellent professor, and is very receptive to students' needs. However, he needs to be clearer about what he expects from his assignments, as well as when they are due. I also think he is a little too slow when going through his slides, since he was never able to get through a lecture in one class period.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Prof. Leaderer is very kind and understanding, and is clearly extremely well-versed in the material that he is teaching. I enjoyed learning from him overall.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0We only actually had Dr. Leaderer as an instructor for half of the course, but he definitely expressed himself as a capable, approachable instructor. The pace at which he covers content could possibly be a little faster, but he seems to truly care about the information he is sharing, which makes it more interesting for the students as well. In the small class size, it might be better to actively engage some of the students in conversation, rather than the lecture format that most of the classes took. He was definitely open to questions, which would often lead to a bit of a small discussion, but maybe a sort of formal discussion at the end of certain classes might get people talking a bit more, rather than just waiting for the students to ask questions."

    "This course is a fun exposure assessment based course for anyone who wants to get some field experience and truly understand the obstacles to exposure assessment.",
    "Professor Leaderer is knowledgable. We've been assigned of 2 interesting \"real world\" exposure assessment assignment. The course is a good one for introduction level of occupational exposure assessment.",
    "The workload for this class is a little heavy. I think four critiques are not necessary. Those are simply repetitive work.",
    "Good.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in this subject.",
    "This course should be taken by those interested (whether EHS or not) in better understanding how exposures to environmental stressors are assessed\/measured. The material is easy and interesting to follow overall and covers a fair range of topics from the various types of exposure assessments to specific ones like the use of biomarkers in exposure assessments and water pollution.",
    "This course provides an excellent background to reading, conducting, and interpreting exposure assessments. I would recommend this course to others, since it provides an in-depth perspective to a crucial aspect of risk assessment."
