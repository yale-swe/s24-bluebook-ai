    "This class is falsely advertised as being about Norms and Deviance, generally. It focuses on a very specific subset of deviance (black men in urban areas), which is a really interesting subject and definitely good, but difficult to talk about for an entire semester. Anderson is a brilliant scholar, but this class was definitely not what I expected.",
    "I took this as an extra course that isn't going to count towards my major or distribution requirements, and really liked it. It's a very relaxed class, and Professor Anderson leads an interesting discussion every week. I'd recommend taking it. I definitely enjoyed it.",
    "My best suggestion would be to shop the class and see what Prof. Anderson is about. If you don't like the way he teaches then you'll probably get tired of him. Otherwise he's got a lot to say about his field of work.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this class, definitely take it, regardless of what your major is. Listening to Professor Anderson every week is reason enough to take the class. Professor Anderson takes a lot of care to make sure that every student understands what is going on, and he really puts a lot of work into trying to make the class interesting."
