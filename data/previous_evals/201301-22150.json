    "I recommend reading the Gruber textbook",
    "Poli Sci majors beware, this is a pure Econ course. If you don't understand the math involved, you won't do well. Take it if you want a good understanding of the economic decisions that policy makers need to make when creating public policies. NOT a course that you should take just for fun. The 5 problem sets will catch up to you.",
    "If you're interested in public econ!",
    "i would, but i didn't go to the lectures. the material is all in the book.",
    "It's a frustrating econ credit. Professor Washington teaches straight from the book, which is often unhelpful. Be prepared for long psets and ambiguous questions.",
    "No",
    "",
    "Ehh the psets are lots of busy work but a ton of this stuff is super important so I'd say yeah. Make sure you do well in the psets",
    "Take it. It provides a lot of information about our government that most people don't know. Necessary to be an informed voter in the future.",
    "Textbook: Very enjoyable to read if you are interested in the subject matter.Lectures: I hate to say this, but it wasn't so inspiring.Problem Sets: Initially, they were really badly worded, but I think they got better in the middle.TA Sections: Emily Nix was really good. Other TAs, not so...",
    "Very, very easy class. Probably a waste of your time. No one goes to lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. Although the class can at times be frustrating because it is graded somewhat arbitrarily (20 point tests with no partial credit are the worst), I am a more educated citizen for having taken this class.",
    "Easy class if you do your work. Exams somewhat straightforward, Psets, not so much. Read the book and its a good and interesting class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, only because it is essential to be informed about the economic theory behind social insurance, social security, taxes, etc. I can now carry intelligent conversations with others about the very real issues we face in the US. The course also provided me with information that has helped shape my views. Very rewarding class material, but the design of the class was poor (lecture and section were not really helpful).",
    "If you really need the knowledge then take it. Otherwise, there are many more interesting stuff at Yale.",
    "Teaches you a lot that you have already learned in other Econ courses, and it's useful stuff just not taught very well. May not be fantastically taught but you will do well.",
    "This is the worst class I've taken at Yale and that is so unfortunate. The topic is so important and could be so interesting. But why should I have wasted a whole wonderful Yale credit on a class where the professor just reads and follows the material from the book -- which by the way, is not at a high enough level.If you have created a test for students to take, you should be in the room while they take it. It is not your TAs job to administer tests, especially when they are so vaguely written and poorly worded. I find this rude that a teacher doesn't even show up for the midterms and finals -- even just as moral support or clarification.Additionally, when I want to ask a question about the material and I ask it to the professor directly, I'm looking for the professor to answer it, not to be deferred to the TAs. Well that's exactly what happened in this class. I felt like I was being taught more by the TAs and reading the book because Professor Ebonya only used examples and material from the book directly. There was no variation except for the excellent guest lecturers we had come in on one day.This class has such a potential to be a good class. I wish she would add some more material to the class and not have such a focus on what the book provides (which is not much).Additionally, the tests and psets need to be better written. The ambiguity written into the questions was frustrating and time consuming. It would take me pages to just lay out the assumptions I needed to make in order to tackle the question. This is not! a good test... good tests are clever and make you think\/apply the material in a new way.",
    "Not sure - good things to know but really boring lectures, hard problem sets, and hard tests. However, the curve is pretty good.",
    "Pretty boring and not well taught -- the prof just goes straight by the book. It could be good for sophomore econ majors, who can begin applying what you learned in intro to policy issues. Other than that, take it only if you want a low stress econ credit.",
    "The class is a fairly easy economics credit and does not require extensive mathematical knowledge. Take it if you need an easy economics credit, but be prepared to be quite bored in lecture. Consider not going; everything is in the book anyway.",
    "Highly recommend the class to anyone interested in public economics. workload is not bad and class materials are not challenging.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this course and the material it presented. This is the kind of economics that I enjoy the most--using economics and applying to affect real people in the real world. I loved how this course made me think: using Econ to assess policy decisions that impact the real world, in a more qualitative way. Unlike Intermediate Micro or other more quantitative Econ courses, which also taught about adverse selection, health insurance, externalities, and public goods, I have never gained such a deep understanding of these issues as I have through this course. I feel like after this class, I now have a truly deep understanding of what drives insurance markets, of health care, of when\/why the public sector needs to intervene, because it has presented these concepts in light of words, andin my view, to truly be able to understand a concept, you have to be able to explain it in words, in terms of the real world, which is exactly what this course allows you to do. I feel like this course has also helped me strengthen my analytical abilities. It is so cool to be able to read current events\/current policy decisions and be able to analyze this from an Economics point of view. I also feel like I have learned empirical analytical tools better in this class than from Econometrics, which was where you are supposed to learn about these tools. Difference in difference was explained more clearly and I understand it more from having taken this course than from taking Econometrics, which is saying something.This is an important course subject and, despite the dry lectures that rehash the textbook (my only complaint), the TAs are amazing (especially Emily Nix and Wieland Hoffman) and passionate about the topic and are willing to answer all of your questions until you truly understand everything. Take this course! You may find the course, at times, extremely dry and the professor annoying because of the boring lectures, but the material is really rewarding.",
    "Very interesting material; it will change the way to understand policy debates in Congress. You will come out of this class understanding the economic logic behind the political jargon you read in the NY Times. The textbook is fantastic, and Prof. Washington doesn't really do anything more than summarize it in class, so I would just read the textbook and skip lectures. 55% get A-range grades, so you probably won't have to worry about your grade. All in all, take it.",
    "It's an econ class. Boring, no one goes to class or section, 6 psets, 2 midterms, and a final. Harsh grading, so be warned.",
    "Buns. Only take this course if you have to. Otherwise, avoid the heck out of it.",
    "Yes, if you want a relatively easy Econ credit.",
    "Overview of how government economics works. I would have liked to incorporate more contemporary research (such as Professor Washington's!). One way the course could be improved is by making the phrasing on the problem sets less vague - we consistently had problems interpreting what we were trying to answer.",
    "I would reccomend it to anyone who is an EP&E or Economics major, but no one else.",
    "The material covered in this class was actually very interesting and helped me think about economic policies from new perspectives. However, the class itself was not enjoyable. The assignments are frustrating, and there is no point in going to lecture because Ebonya does not teach anything that is not in the book. Take this class if you are very interested in public econ, but expect to do all if your learning from the book.",
    "I would recommend this to a student if they are interested in political programs (taxes, health care, social security, unemployment etc) and how they relate to economics. You gain a good basic understanding of all of the topics, but the econ used is very elementary.",
    "Public Economics is one of the better classes I've taken in the Econ department when considering the material we covered. It was interesting to learn about how all the concepts we've learned about in intermediate and intro microeconomics courses applies to solving real-world policy issues. The textbook reading was great (which is shocking considering it's an economics textbook). The workload was manageable (6 problem sets spaced evenly through the semester) and the grading was reasonable (you can make up for a poor performance on a midterm by doing well on the others). The lectures are redundant if you do the reading; you can get away with missing a fair amount of lecture. Professor Washington is strict with deadlines for problem sets so don't think you can get away with doing them during class and taking it at the end. Section attendance is also not very crucial; I didn't attend a single section all year for this class and still did fine. Overall, I would take this course if you're an Economic major looking to get another Economics elective for the major.",
    "Great topic, horrible lecture. Professor Washington does not like undergraduates, and is the worst econ professor I have had. I still say the course material is interesting enough to take the course though. Psets are very mathy, exams are very conceptual.",
    "Pretty good. I'd say, despite Professor Washington, take it for the interesting, relevant, you-need-to-know-this-to-be-an-adult material. Good for Econ and PLSC majors alike.",
    "The material for the class is quite interesting, but it follows exactly Gruber's book (the textbook for the class). The class is relatively easy once you have taken intermediate micro, for the math is simplified greatly, but similar to that of intermicro It's difficult to recommend this class; lecture attendance is definitely under half and you can learn the same material by reading Gruber's book.",
    "The course material is very interesting and relevant (healthcare economics, U.S. tax laws, etc.). The textbook is also very well written and thorough. The lectures are useless, there is no point it going up Science Hill to listen to the professor repeat the same information that's in the textbook - as in, the lecture slides that she uses have the same numerical examples as the textbook, and were probably included with the instructor's edition.The six problem sets for this class are also very annoying. The questions are poorly written, hard to deciper, take a long time, and do not resemble the exam questions in the slightest. That being said, most of the exam material is directly out of the textbook.",
    "Public economics is a very interesting field of economics and covers a lot of the essential topics that are closely related to our life. The lectures basically follow the structure of the textbook, which is a GREAT book, so you can do well by reading the textbook alone without going to class at all. The professor tries to be friendly and helpful, though sometimes the lectures are a bit dull and unclear. Problem sets are fair, and so are midterms and the final, and grading is generous. Overall this is a good class to check out if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "ECON 275 is a fairly easy economics course for majors. If you've taken micro already, the mathematical concepts are stuff that you should already know. Although you do learn a lot about various government programs such as Medicare or Social Security, the couse may be dry to some people, but I personally found it very interesting. It's easy to skip lecture and just read the book, but I would say that if you go to every lecture as well, you will be well-prepared for the exams without studying too much for them the night before. The exams are fair and are an accurate representation of the concepts that the professor goes over in lecture. Just 6 psets, 2 midterms, and a final. Overall, an easy econ class if you keep up with the reading and go to lecture. Nothing tricky.",
    "Good class, especially to become knowledgeable about the current policies and ways to approach thinking about them. Read the textbook, and you will be in a great place! (pretty good textbook too)",
    "I thought the class was quite easy and only involved a very superficial coverage of many topics already seen in intro micro or other electives such as externalities, insurance, and taxes. Take this class if you're looking for an easy econ elective and you've already taken several of your intro\/intermediate core courses--it will be a piece of cake and mostly review.",
    "If you want to know more about macroeconomics and how many of the US programs (e.g. health care programs, insurance programs, etc.) work, you can take this class and it will give you a simple overview of the public economic system.",
    "Yes, I recommend it although it is a lot of work. Problem sets are every other week, so it's definitely manageable.",
    "Take it if you are looking for a relatively easy economics class for the major. The material isn't fascinating, but read the textbook and you will be fine for tests and problem sets. The class is nothing to write home about. Going to class is not really necessary as everything you need to know is in the textbook. It's kind of annoying problem sets can only be turned in the first 10 minutes of class. . . I was always running up hill house to get to LUCE.",
    "Do not take the class. Many better classes you can take at Yale. The material is interesting but you will not enjoy taking it with this professor. She made the class a read-along-with-the-book class. I hear it is taught in cambridge\/london over the summer. DO IT THERE INSTEAD.",
    "Unless you are really interested in the course material, don't take it. Painful to sit through. More econ heavy than expected.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good survey of public economics and the fiscal policy of the U.S. government. I would recommend it to economics students and to political science students.",
    "A very easy intro to the role of government in the economy. Problem sets are straightforward, the TFs are helpful, and the professor gives both sides to the argument. Many of us took it without any intro econ and had little trouble with the work."
