    "We covered selected topics of evolutionary and cognitive foundations of infants, siblings, parents and their interactions.",
    "This was a very interesting course for anyone who likes reading articles and discussing them. It definitely covers more than just infants as well, it's really more evolutionary psychology.",
    "Great class! The discussions are super interesting, Professor Wynn is awesome and knowledgeable. Take if you're interested in the topic she chooses for the semester.",
    "Do it! Fun class and not too much work!",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar to anyone who is interested in developmental psychology! It was a great course. Manageable work load and you learn a lot! The discussions and fun and interesting."
