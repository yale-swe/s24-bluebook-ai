    "This class is a good overview of international trade theory and the empirical evidence that exists. The work is very manageable and the papers are interesting. I definitely have a good grasp on the logic of different arguments for and against trade.",
    "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in trade and development then take it.",
    "Good overview of international trade theory. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Great class. The professor's really organized and his lectures are interesting. Should definitely take.",
    "This is a decent econ seminar. It's more a lecture course than a seminar, so there's not too much discussion. The course itself has an interesting mix of theory and empirics, but the class presentations during the second half were pretty boring. Not a bad class, but not that great either.",
    "Pretty interesting and easy, a good intro to trade economics."
