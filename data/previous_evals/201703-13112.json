    "I learned a lot about writing fiction and about workshopping other people--what I liked in stories, what I didn't like, and how best to articulate that in critiques\/incorporate it into my own stories.",
    "My understanding of narrative, style, and other story writing mechanics has certainly grown over this course. I have also received exposure to a variety of stories I may not have read initially.",
    "The class was mostly about principles of fiction; it felt like most learning was done by giving an receiving feedback rather than discussing concepts in class.",
    "I have developed my style as a writer and become much more intentional about my writing choices.",
    "Learned how to structure a short story with a crisis and sense of action, write compelling dialogue that furthers the action of a story, write story openings that introduce voice and style and hook readers, maintain and develop characters' worldviews throughout a story"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A great place to workshop other students work, but our class didn't get to do too much style work or professional reading due to time constraints. The workload is manageable but might be improved with a more concrete schedule up front and more time spent on style overall instead of issues within each workshopped piece. It might be more helpful if everyone wrote a workshop letter for everyone and that would help move workshops along more quickly, saving time for other work.",
    "Time sometimes wasn't managed well during workshops. Because of that, we didn't really get to cover a lot of the topics on the syllabus. I found it very informative and helpful when Professor Spargo did occasionally talk to us about specific topics.",
    "Professor Spargo clearly cared a lot about our writing, and really took the time to read each story carefully and give clear feedback. He also made himself really available to us outside of class, which was great. I get the impression that the success of workshop classes often depends on the composition of the class itself, and I think we had a really engaged group, that Prof. Spargo led really well in a seminar. It did seem like, at times, we couldn't get through everything in one class, and it's possible that, if we had fewer assigned readings (not written by students), we might have gotten through some of the students' stories faster. But at the same time, I did enjoy the readings... maybe some could've been optional?",
    "Overall the course went pretty well. I'd say structure is the main work for improvement. The limited time structure prevented us from always discussing our readings but I still enjoyed myself.",
    "While I was happy with the workshop format, at times it felt like there wasn't any time for non-workshop discussion.",
    "Strength: The workshop format is a great tool for learning from each other, and learning to recognize what to be aware of in reading or writing short stories. Weakness: The amount of time allotted for the class did not allow for everything to get done - we had to plan two over-time classes.",
    "I think the class was well-structured in every way. We read compelling short stories each week that showed us what we should aspire to. These stories were integrated into our discussions of peers' work. We got incredibly in-depth and insightful feedback from Professor Spargo and the opportunity to meet with him one-on-one several times. Peer workshops and exercises were all very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you like writing your own stories and reading and editing others stories.As a workshop course, it gives you a chance to work on your own craft and learn from others. Be prepared for time management issues though as you can start talking about a story and get off track for an hour.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Spargo is wonderful, and my writing is improving a lot.",
    "Definitely--it's a different kind of work than you'll get in your other classes, which can be challenging at times, but I found it really really rewarding. If you put the work in, you'll come out of it with 1-2 stories you're proud of, and that's really cool.",
    "Definitely a good way to improve your writing! Reading and commenting on the works of other students is just as helpful as receiving intelligent commentary on your own pieces.",
    "Yes, absolutely- it will greatly develop your skills as a writer!",
    "Absolutely. A really intimate, fun and rewarding learning experience."
