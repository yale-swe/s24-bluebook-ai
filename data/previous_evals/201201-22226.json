    "ODE is a very elegant and beautiful subject matter that you may wish to look into if you are a person interested in Math. It's a relatively light class compared to other math courses(like Analysis or Abstract Algebra), and I think the problem set took me about two hours every week. Professor Wang presented the materials really nicely, and I had a blast taking this class this semester. I wholeheartedly recommend this class.",
    "It's a very easy course, but fairly poorly taught. If you don't need it, I wouldn't take it. You learn very little in this class.",
    "Differential equations is not that interesting, but Professor Wang did a great job of teaching it. I felt bad because this was his first class at Yale, and fewer and fewer people came to class as the semester went on because of the subject matter and because of the 9 AM class time. The professor himself was excellent, in my opinion, and if you have to take differential equations, I would recommend him. The problem sets are very simple and are not sufficient to do well on the exams.",
    "I would recommend it. The content is not too hard, and the class is not proof based although you do go over a lot of proofs. Chances are you'll have a grad student, so it may be hard to understand sometimes but if you're patient the class becomes better taught towards the end. Take it!",
    "This is a basic course on ODEs. It goes an quite a slow pace and doesn't cover some extremely important topics (Laplace Transforms). The homework takes about two hours a week, and the exams were quite fair. This was my easiest class of the semester.",
    "This course is about ways to solve differential equations through analytical, geometrical, and numerical means. It is avery interesting course especially because the graphs become really complex.",
    "Math 246 is one of the easier intermediate math classes to take. It's not a stellar class - overall I feel like you cover much less than other Math classes, and the problem sets are right from textbook problems so are usually very straightforward, although they can be a bit tedious.I did find the subject matter interesting, and it can serve as a lower-stress slower-paced class to take along with some harder courses.That being said, I must warn that the midterm was incredibly stressful in that it was in-class for only 50 minutes and the test seemed too long - 30% of the class probably dropped after the midterm. The final was about the same length, but we had plenty of time, so it was fine.",
    "I would recommend it because you get to gain insights into differential equations!",
    "The professor is nice, and go talk to him would deepen your knowledge in this topic, which is his specialty!",
    "Not a hard course but not one in which I felt I learned many real world applications of differential equations. I learned best from the textbook, which was an excellent choice by the professor. Zhiren is a nice guy but needs more experience teaching.",
    "It's a good class, but if you aren't interested in pursuing a math major I would suggest shopping the ENAS version of Diff Eq instead.",
    "The techniques you learn can be useful for other science classes, but the course isn't very fun.",
    "I would not take this class unless I absolutely had to. Lectures are dry and boring and often don't help with the homework. The material is hard. I took it credit d and was very glad that I did.",
    "Take it if you need it; it's really not terribly exciting material, no matter who's teaching the class. That said, it's not terribly difficult, either.This class is a LOT LESS work than the ENAS version.",
    "I would recommend it to everyone who plans to major in Math or Sciences.",
    "A solid course on differential equations. The professor tries to explain everything clearly but sometimes goes a bit too fast on difficult concepts. Also, there is no practice problem or exam, which makes the exams more challenging. Problem sets are much easier than the exams so beware. Take the class if you are really into the material, otherwise don\u0092t, as curve isn\u0092t generous either. Overall this is a solid math class."
