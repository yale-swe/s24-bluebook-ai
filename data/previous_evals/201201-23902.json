    "Expectations were not met.That said, I learned a great deal about myself and my own design agenda, principles and values.",
    "Judging from the work last year, I expected the studio to be primarily about using environmental optimization as an excuse for generating and arguing for architectural form. Moreover, I thought that I would learn a number of computational tools that would greatly enhance my skill set. The studio met these expectations and exceeded them. While at the outset, given Alejandro's background, I realized that the would be a theoretical component to the studio, I did not realize how important theoretical concerns would be for the research. The theoretical positions that I encountered and began to explore in the studio will, I believe, provide a solid foundation for future research.",
    "The studio was quite what I expected. I though the studio was a more \"ordinary\" urban design studio using digital tools. But it turn out to be more that and it was quite. The objectives of the studio were quite different from other studios that I haven been taken and they were of great relevance in today's world. In a word, it was a very productive studio and I think what I learnt from the studio will influence me a lot in the future.",
    "This studio exceeded my expectations. The brief was well-developed and allowed us to explore multiple scales to really develop a comprehensive project that combined a theoretical agenda with architectural and urban design. Our conversations as a studio were really wonderful in the way they explored important issues related to contemporary architecture. The one weak point of the semester was the trip to Amsterdam. Instead of visiting useful precedents, we had to work the entire trip with many different people who had conflicting agendas, and the result was a wasted opportunity."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for the most part. It would have helped to have more powerful computers as I felt that we were occasionally limited by the computers we had at our disposal.",
    "The school's resources are quite available. It will be better if we can find some expertises in school to consult some environmental issues.",
    "The resources were fantastic."
