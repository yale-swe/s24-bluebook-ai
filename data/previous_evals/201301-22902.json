    "It was great! Really fun environment with your fellow students--I love art classes because you always make friends. Definitely go for it!",
    "Challenging, requiring commitment to working on your projects, BRILLIANT experience!",
    "Brent is a fantastic teacher. The only real assignments in the class are a midterm and a final -- no writing :) The first week you learn the techniques (welding, plasma cutting, bandsawing, etc) and after that you just work on your sculptures. This class is extremely fun and can be relaxing if you plan it right, but it will easily take up all of your time. Make sure your one page application on the first day demonstrates how cool you are, and if you get in TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would recommend this class. Its a great introduction and a lot of fun. The work load is manageable.",
    "Definitely take this course, but only if you're honestly interested in metal sculpture. You have to put work into it to get a rewarding experience. Brent is awesome, super helpful and available. But don't miss class, he'll notice and he definitely does not like absences.",
    "Learn to weld, make a sculpture.",
    "definitely take it (if you can get in)! loved it, very fun while still being challenging, one of those courses where you get out of it what you put in. take it take it take it."
