    "If you will need to solve crystal structures at any time during your research, you should take this class.",
    "It's a lot of work and you will be working hard to do the work properly but it's really worthwhile if you will ever use a crystal structure in your research or in a publication.",
    "I think it is very beneficial to become familiar with the theory and the steps of solving a crystal structure all the way to writing an Acta Cryst report. I would recommend the class.",
    "I would summarize this course as an in-depth look into the theory and history of crystallography. I would only recommend this course to another student if he or she knew it would be useful towards future research. I would probably recommend that a graduate student audit this course rather than take it."

   "comments": [
    "Helped me understand how X-ray crystallography works. Useful in a theoretical and practical way.",
    "It deepened my understanding of crystallography immensely, but not particularly any other aspect of chemistry. Take the class if it will be useful for you practically.",
    "Very helpful and gave me insight to the long process of solving a crystal structure. Very applicable class.",
    "This course will be extremely helpful towards my research. I look forward to working with Brandon solving my own crystal structures in the future, and I am confident that I will be able to address common problems associated with obtaining and solving crystal data independently."
