   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Frank illuminates the poem and highlights its literary value and import at every turn, making it valuable not just for Anglo-Saxonists and medievalists but for people from every field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has some grasp of Old English or has taken the introductory course. You get to read through the whole of Beowulf and, if you care to poke into Klaeber's text and the accompanying essays and footnotes, you can go very deep into the text. Also, Prof. Frank is a delight, you have to take a class with her!",
    "A fast-paced read-through of Beowulf in Old English, if the Old English class wasn't enough for you. The volume of reading is quite high, as we covered about 300 lines every class. If that sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy this class. And as always, Professor Frank is a joy to learn from.",
    "For Roberta alone I would recommend ENGL 501. For those actually interested in Old English, yes, of course - a vital text is being taught by a great teacher.",
    "We translate and discuss all 3000 lines of Beowulf. Yes, it's a great course."

    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline very much, and it certainly gave me things to think about going forward with my research and ideas.",
    "Given that my interests don't align with this course, I feel like it's going to have oblique but significant effects on the way I view my studies.",
    "I would like to incorporate some Old English into my dissertation.",
    "As someone with very little experience in medieval literature, this course deepened my appreciation for the field."
