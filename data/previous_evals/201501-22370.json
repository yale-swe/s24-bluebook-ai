    "Good class for continuing Italian study. There are a variety of activities (movies, readings, music, etc.) and you are assessed in your ability to read, comprehend, speak, and write.",
    "fun class, learning about italian culture through film, short stories, etc",
    "If you are on the fence about continuing after you have finished your language requirement, take this class. It is more like taking a culture and history class, while learning Italian at a lower stress level than previous courses. And there is no final!",
    "Absolutely, especially if you're working to become fluent in Italian. It's fun to learn more about Italian culture and history, and it's not too much work. Take it!",
    "yup! take it! you learn some cool things about italian history in the 20th century.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken the previous italian courses and wants to delve even deeper into the italian language and culture."
