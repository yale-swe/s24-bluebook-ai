   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about political science, economics, and ways in which I should evaluate public policy.",
    "Great understanding of policy's effects on political landscapes. Improved my policy memo-writing skills.",
    "Nothing. Policy memos were WAY too hard, and they were graded ridiculously. Lecture was a joke. I learned nothing.",
    "This class required us to write three Policy Memos. However, the professor and TFs assumed students knew how to write memos and provided little to no direction in how to write them and\/or how to improve.",
    "How to think about public policy and how to write policy memos",
    "I learned about the complexities of public policy and the many factors that need to be considered when making policy.",
    "Honestly I don't know that I did. Which is a big issue I had with this course.",
    "The foremost skill I learned was how to consolidate information into a concise yet informative brief. I also increased my familiarity with policy topics that I would have not otherwise been exposed to, like the federal budget. The course also provided insight on the historical factors influencing today's political environment.",
    "Learned how to write a policy memo, and do the research for one.",
    "A greater knowledge into the political difficulties of passing public policy, the strengths and foibles of the US political system and how it has evolved over time. skills related to writing policy memos were particularly useful.",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. I learned that policy isn't just a linear process trademarked by \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\". There is much more nuance and appeasement involved to make laws work for the most people. My social policy researching skills vastly improved because of the memos that the class was assigned. The memos allowed me to explore issues from different angles and get into the mind of a lawmaker.",
    "As someone who had never taken a class on public policy before, I learned a lot about how to write\/read\/understand public policy - especially in this current political moment.",
    "I learned to think critically about policy issues and approach American government in a new way. Overall, I did learn from this class.",
    "understanding of the workings of government",
    "I loved learning about tax reform and the healthcare system, and I particularly enjoyed Professor Hacker's lecture style. This was a topical class for the semester that we had it in given the current administration, and it was awesome to see him navigate this while sticking with the syllabus.",
    "I've learned how to be critical about policies, how to keep myself up-to-date with news and how to write policy memos.",
    "A survey of political concepts like polarization, public opinion, and their applications to current political issues (health care, climate, etc). Helps to understand the intersections (similarities and differences) of politics and policy.",
    "I loved doing the memos, and being forced to think about policy within the context of politics. It is extremely useful to know that we will never be able to divorce policymaking from politics.",
    "I have never taken a civics class and this course was a wonderful introduction to American public policy and politics. I learned how to analyze policies from different angles, with a particular focus on how different constituents view them and how procedures and institutions shape the policy making process and policy outcomes. I gained a better understanding of a number of key policy areas including health care and tax reform. I felt better informed to understand current events as they unfolded.",
    "I feel much more prepared to engage with the work of public policy formation and implementation of this course. The course was a strong overview of decision-making the policy making.",
    "Class was irrelevant to any of our assignments and felt irrelevant to go to. I don't feel like I learned a ton in class about anything. Most of our learning was done on our own completing our assignments.",
    "I learned a lot about the affordable health care act, some things about the tax code, and a little about environmental policy. I did become much better at writing policy memos, and doing research for policy memos which I think is helpful.",
    "Politics of U.S. Public Policy helped me draw connections between case studies\/ events in policymaking history to overarching themes. I believe the class helped me become a better critical thinker who is capable of synthesizing large amounts of information and summarizing it in a clear and coherent way.",
    "I came away with a greater understanding of so many topics I'd read about in the news but realize I didn't even understand the basics of.",
    "I learned how to more craftily write policy memos and about a lot of current political issues.",
    "How American government works and policy is made. We explored many of the the various nuances behind federal and state policymaking.",
    "I learned how to write memos (which I considered extremely valuable since I would like to work on the hill) and how to think about political decisions in a practical way. It was also great to learn about current political issues",
    "Course that ties economics, psychology, and politics into a coherent story explaining why American politics is the way it is today. You learn about the art of making trade-offs, and how almost everything has second-order, unforeseen effects. You also learn how to write memos (very useful!)",
    "I learned a ton about how public policy is made and how it interacts with the electoral\/rhetorical politics of Washington. The memos are a great exercise for thinking about both politics and policy in a practical combination.",
    "Took the class credit D, didn't learn anything from lecture, but learned a lot about health care, taxes, and environmental policy from the memos. Completely self-taught",
    "Writing policy memos, understanding current tax and healthcare debates.",
    "An understanding of how policies are constructed and the inner workings of the legislative world.",
    "I learned how to clearly think through policy issues and write concisely and to the point. I am 100% sure that I will use the skills I learned writing policy memos again.",
    "I learned about the ways our institutions and policy-making mechanisms often hinder effective policy-making.",
    "To be honest I have no idea what the heck I learned in this class...",
    "I learned how to write policy memos.",
    "I learned about public policy and american politics and how the two influence each other.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Totally changed the way I consume news and think about politics. I'm hoping to do government work, so learning to write policy memos was also a big plus. It might have been a quirk of taking this course during the first hundred days of the Trump administration, but Hacker had an uncanny knack for teaching material that would become relevant to what was happening on the Hill like two weeks before it happened.",
    "Content knowledge: healthcare, tax reform, environmental policy, affordable housing Skills: basic policy memo writing",
    "I learned a lot about public policy in healthcare, climate change, and budget policy. I learned the format of a policy memo and the various perspectives from which these memos are written.",
    "This class covered many relevant topics of public policy, providing great historical and political context as well as charts, facts, and figures to support possible solutions.",
    "I learned about a few key issues in US Public Policy.",
    "I learned about the nuances of American politics and political institutions, especially as they pertain to healthcare reform, tax reform, and climate change reform.",
    "While I arrived in the class with a strong knowledge of politics, I came to know much, much more about policy in key issue areas; climate change, criminal justice, tax policy, and healthcare. I learned how to think critically about the ways the political system's moving parts interact, and really enjoyed figuring out ways to maneuver policy passage while considering political ramifications. Amazing course for the current political climate.",
    "I LOVED this class. We covered much of American politics and history relating to public policy in the country. I learned so much about public policy, but it definitely was made easier by my previous exposure to economics and American government and politics. Including more explanation of them may be useful to students.",
    "I learned how to write a policy memo, how the healthcare system currently works, and about tax credits and cap and trade policy.",
    "The course provided a deep knowledge of current issues in American Policy, such as healthcare, taxation, and climate change. We covered a lot of issues that were being discussed simultaneously in Congress, and my political knowledge grew a lot thanks to Politics of US Public Policy.",
    "I learned a ton in this class. I gained a language to discuss and analyze public policies such as health care, the budget\/taxes, the environment\/climate change, and criminal justice reform. I learned about path dependence, market failure, public goods, externalities, and collective action problems, which underpin these policies and the justification for government's intervention. I learned a lot about the specific market failures and nuances of health, budget, and environmental policies, and how\/why we have the current policy landscape that we do. Moreover, I gained the ability to put this knowledge into writing in short, persuasive policy memos, which I had never written before. This course taught me to think and write like a social scientist and public policy analyst, not just a partisan.",
    "I got an overview of several areas of public policy including health care, environment, and criminal justice. I also learned how policy is developed and the challenges that face policy creation in the US.",
    "I learned how to write well-organized and informative policy memos, which could be useful in my future career considering I want to work in education policy. I also learned a lot about health care, tax reform, and green energy policy. I feel like my writing improved in this class--it became less wordy and more straightforward. I enjoyed researching the different policies and framing them within the electoral context.",
    "I really learned how to understand policy. Going in, I had no idea how the budget process, or healthcare worked, and now I know enough to have an informed discussion about it.",
    "memo writing and thinking critically about polixy",
    "Enhanced understanding of the United States political system and inner workings of many current policy issues. Developed skills in policy writing and memo writing.",
    "You will learn so much in this class (if you come to lecture and are engaged). You start with a basic overview of political theory and some concepts of American politics to set the stage which can be repetitive if you've taken intro to American politics but I found it helpful. Then throughout the semester you learn about the politics of trying to pass laws\/policies at the national, state, and local levels. At the same time you go through different themes of public policy: healthcare, taxes, environmental law, criminal justice, and some others. Through writing the policy memos you learn how to analyze the political feasibility of different policy options, which then helps you understand why it's so difficult for our government to pass logical things sometimes. The policy memos also teach you how to write succinctly and effectively. You will become a much more informed reader and citizen and policy analyzer! Great class!",
    "Through this course I developed the skill of writing policy memos. I also gained knowledge about public policy in general in the United States and learned how to view societal issues from a public policy approach.",
    "this course provides a cursory view of american politics and policy, with each week dividing into separate topics like healthcare, tax legislation, incarceration, urbanization, etc. The two lectures each week though are really not enough to get more than a basic introduction into these topics and its very similar to any introductory american politics course, not really specific to the policy aspect. That being said, it does provide you with the crux of the arguments and gives you the tools and resources to know what the major debates are in the field. It falls short however in teaching the different policy considerations politicians are advocating for, the processes they went through to win over constituents and those across the aisle, and how they plan to navigate the difficult minefields that are topics like healthcare.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of some of the central players and obstacles in the passage of legislation and the implementation of policy initiatives. I learned about the theory and history behind several of the most salient policy areas in our country today and the congressional, special interest, and public politics that must be maneuvered in order to get any policy put into law.",
    "The course served as an introduction to conversations around a handful of public policy topics. We were tasked with writing policy memos and whitepapers, concisely conveying important information to a client (or other audience).",
    "I learned to write policy memos and I learned I never want to write one again."

   "comments": [
    "The readings felt entirely disconnected from the lecture. Less reading would be great, but readings that felt relevant to the course would be even better.",
    "I was initially very excited for Professor Hacker's lectures, but it quickly became clear just how difficult they were to follow. Given Professor Hacker's lecture style, which often involves jokes or witty comments, I would often walk away from class having been entertained by the class but without really having learned anything. I also felt like the policy memos were inconsistent with what we'd learned in class, and I often felt like I had to start from scratch and do a lot of self-teaching before each assignment. Over time I became very disengaged with this class, which was disappointing considering how excited I was to take a course from Professor Hacker.",
    "Amazing lectures. One small suggestion - get the memo prompts on Canvas a bit earlier. It's nice to have a little more time to research and plan out the memos.",
    "Strengths- lecture was chill and enjoyable. Weaknesses- the policy memos were ridiculous and section was awful.",
    "The strength of this course is that reading is not mandatory and no one would know if you did not do it, so it is a good fifth course. But the main weakness is the lack of organization in the course, the inaccessibility professor, and the lack of guidance. Additionally, the lectures are all over the place, not prepared well, and hard to understand. By the end of the course, about a fourth of the students ended up attending lectures.",
    "Strengths: Hacker is an engaging lecturer, the class forces you to learn about three topics (healthcare, tax policy, environmental policy) that are crucial for American policy but that college students typically ignore, the TAs made SUPER helpful research guides for the policy memos Weaknesses: Needed better communication about topics of policy memos at the beginning of the course. It wasn't clear from the syllabus that the memos would focus on healthcare, tax policy, and the environment.",
    "Honestly, the class felt like wasted time. professor hacker didn't prepare much (if at all) for lecture, and it definitely showed. I didn't learn anything new and definitely questioned my choice to take the class. I learned so much more from my TA than from the professor. it was frustrating to have a class that I thought would be interesting and relevant turn out to clearly not be a priority of the professor. all of the books were quite expensive and not necessary to purchase, which I wish Id known at the beginning of the class. I didn't find much of the reading useful at all. the memo prompts were difficult. it was interesting to work through them, but they also felt unfairly difficult because these are policy issues that literally 535 senators and congresspeople cant solve!",
    "This course was simultaneously high level and vague; very rambly",
    "The lectures were incredible - interesting, well-paced, and responsive to student feedback, but did not seem to correspond well with the individual sections. Professor Hacker is a natural teacher, that can approach the topics of the course with both the humor and thoughtfulness they deserve. Professor Hacker was also incredibly communicative and organized, which was a delight. He also did a great job explaining current events through the topics covered in the course. I am not for sure how to make people attend class more, but that seemed to be a minor problem (it seemed like there were a lot of seniors?)",
    "Health care and environment are great topics to learn about. I could do without tax policy. I learned a ton from writing the memos, but very little from lecture because Hacker talked for the first twenty minutes of every lecture in abstractions about Washington -- gridlock, partisanship, protocol etc.",
    "This was an extremely engaging course which covered pertinent content that resonates deeply with the political situation today. However, at times the syllabus seemed disorganized and haphazard. There was also very little help given for the final and we were kind of thrown into the deep end, which was especially frustrating given that the course covered such a wide range of content that sometimes required specific knowledge of names, concepts and interest groups, none of which were clarified before the final.",
    "Unfortunately, the experience in the class can vary greatly depending on which Teaching Assistant is in charge of the section\/grading. Despite some others' criticisms, Dr. Hacker did a wonderful job curating the readings to be applicable and relevant during a tumultuous political period.",
    "I think this course could be improved if discussion section was a little more organized, and reviewed lecture material that Professor Hacker glossed over. This class was pretty challenging as someone with very little background on politics\/economics, so if programming could assume as little knowledge as possible that would be ideal.",
    "My main issue was the policy memos. They were incredibly fun and interesting to write, but they had almost nothing to do with the lectures. Each lecture got more irrelevant and useless to the policy memos than the last. Overall, I learned good things on my own by doing research. But every time I went to class, I was frustrated by how little I felt that I gained. Instead of trying to tackle every policy issue, Professor Hacker should go more in-depth into a few things so that we understand them, rather than just give the briefest of overviews of many topics. The books and readings were good, especially America's Bitter Pill.",
    "So large, no personal feel, and no reason to be present during lecture when the professor reads of his unordained slides.",
    "Literally the only thing I would change about this course is the number of readings that were required. Very quickly I fell behind, and I became disenchanted with catching up, so I just ended up not doing the readings, but if there had been less of them at the beginning I more than likely would have kept up.",
    "Honestly, I don't see any weaknesses in this course. It was absolutely great. The lectures were amazing and engaging, my TA was incredibly helpful and nice, the policy memos were tough, but I've learned a lot writing them, and I was actually having fun doing the readings, which was mind blowing.",
    "Strengths: Good mix of theoretical frameworks and concrete policy examples. The arc of the course made sense and when taken together I learned a tremendous amount. Integration of course material with current events was superb. The assignments were valuable. Areas for Improvement: The first memo's scope was way too big for 4-5 pages.",
    "The course was excellent, but seemed to jump a bit from topic to topic. Also, while the policy memos were an excellent assignment, it seemed that we were a bit thrown into them without preparation. I felt they overall didn't particularly align with the lessons that the course provided. For someone taking this course without a significant policy or political background, that might be a challenge.",
    "Class was boring. It started strong and quickly went downhill. We don't learn much that is new if you've taken AP US Government. It'd be nice if he slowed down and focused in on the intricacies of some topics rather than trying to speed through 30 different things.",
    "Great class, really interesting. I loved the topic we covered to wished we could have gone in deeper detail in some of them.",
    "The big strength is the topical nature of the course material. Everything we were studying was folding out in real time on CNN, and that was fascinating. It was nice to read articles about the AHCA and actually have a lot of understanding and context for what was happening.",
    "Professor Hacker is enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and the course material itself is very interesting and relevant. Nonetheless, I do think that the structure of the class could be slightly improved. Many of the fundamentals of policymaking were explored in the readings rather than being explicitly discussed in lecture, where we devoted more time to specific case studies\/ examples. Provided that students do the reading, they understand what is being discussed in class. Nonetheless, I do wish we had spent more time going over economic concepts and policymaking specifics, as it was sometimes not sufficient to read about them without receiving further explanation.",
    "As someone interested in a career in policy, I really enjoyed taking this course. The policy memos were a great way to develop my writing skills and we covered a tremendous amount of material. We had to run through things a bit quickly for that reason, but I don't know if there would be a good way to avoid that.",
    "Lecture was dull. Sections and assignments were great!",
    "Strengths: Clear lectures, fascinating additions a la Hamilton songs Weaknesses: The expectations for the memos could have used more explanation beforehand, the TAs' advice and course document guides notwithstanding",
    "The content for this class was very interesting and I think the assignments were very fair. I would have liked more focus on the criminal justice unit, I think we rushed through that but could have spent much more time on it",
    "Strengths: A good course that ties together economics, politics, and psychology to real-world applications. If you have taken past economics course, a lot of the course will just be applied case studies. If you keep up with the news by reading the NYT, WSJ, and the like, you'll be in even better shape. Weaknesses: 1. Although I didn't feel like the conservative viewpoint was censored, per se, more conservative readings would have been nice. 2. The weekly reading load should have been made more consistent. 3. You have to give people more than a week to finish their memos - especially when the last memo has not been returned yet! Not all students finish their memos at the last minute. Some like to start early. 4. This could just be me, since I have a background in economics, but it would have been nice to spend more time in lecture on applications than on definitions. Save the theory for the reading.",
    "There was often too much reading and Professor Hacker, while a genius in the field and one of the best lecturers I have had, didn't make much tie-in with the assigned readings regularly so I felt like I could get away with not doing them.",
    "The policy memos were some of the must frustrating assignments I have ever done at Yale. Nothing we learned in lecture (or were supposed to learn) had anything to do with them, and they were also just very difficult to grasp. There were not enough examples and we did not have enough guidance. I also felt that lectures were pointless. I went to them for the first half of class because I found them interesting, but by the end I stopped going because they were pointless and I had work to do. A strength was that none of the reading was necessary since it was very random and only related to lectures, and neither lecture nor the reading related to section or any of the assignments, if you weren't taking the final. So very possible to do well without going to class and without doing the reading.",
    "The lectures had nothing to do with the assignments.",
    "The strengths of the course are 1. Professor Hacker, and 2. the policy memos. Professor Hacker is a dynamic lecturer and fun to listen to. He includes multi-media and anecdotes in his lectures. Additionally, the assignments were a lot of work, but instrumental to my learning and very worthwhile. The weakness of the course was that sometimes the lecture material was a little dull, especially towards the end.",
    "The lectures were sub-par, and the slides were not very effective-- oftentimes, the information was constantly repeated and very basic. However, the readings were interesting. Also, my T.A. truly made my experience incredible. He was an amazing teacher that really took my learning to another level.",
    "The course was just so scattered with no central theme that I had no idea what the end goal for this class was in terms of learning.",
    "This course was extremely interesting, but more organization and structure would be helpful.",
    "I thought this was a great course but the readings were heavy and somewhat boring. I would say 50% of the readings however were really great and those were usually the shorter ones. I definitely liked this class but didn't feel like I was being engaged that much, given that whether you paid attention or attended lecture or did the readings didn't really have much to do with the papers. I just wish the assignments and the lecture and readings went better together.",
    "Strengths: interesting policy memo prompts Weaknesses: simple lectures, boring at times, low course engagement",
    "More emphasis on teaching the structure of a memo should be given - the professor never fully explained the purpose of various portions of a memo but asked us to write three. I would have liked more guidance. The course gives a distinct advantage to people who happen to know about certain specific subjects (it focuses very heavily on climate change, budget policy, and healthcare). For others the course is less accessible. Good lectures!",
    "There should be some sort of consequence for not completing the readings. I tried to keep up, but there were days I just skipped them altogether. If random quizzes were worth 10-15% of the grade, I would have made more of an effort. Also, more students would show up to class.",
    "The best part about this class is the fact that the curriculum gets to be closely tailored to current events and policy debates. I loved having to read closely about policy issues that were highly relevant to what was going on in American politics. But I did feel that it was a bit disorganized, with lectures often going off on tangents that kept us from covering all the material, last-minute research guides for the memos, and tons of emails every week with materials we hadn't gotten to in class. I loved Prof. Hacker as a lecturer, but he was sometimes a bit hard to follow and didn't give us the hard skills we needed to write our memos. This was probably supposed to be covered in section, but there was a huge disparity among TAs' teaching styles and expectations, so I often felt like I was scrambling for information more than some of my peers.",
    "The course definitely touched on many relevant topics, but its greatest weakness was its tie to the main assignments: the policy memos. A very rigorous and thorough policy memo was expected, all within 5 pages. I had significant points taken off for going a little into the 6th page. The amount of detail required to write a good memo does not correlate AT ALL with the depth of information covered in class, leading to intensive research for all three memos, as well as the final memo if you choose to write it instead of the final. Professor Hacker is extremely friendly and reasonable when you speak with him, and also open to modifying the course to improve it, but lectures always seemed too overview-y rather than working into the details and debates to help us start our thinking\/prep work for the memos. Otherwise, I think this is a very important course to provide for undergraduates, and I still learned a lot (even if it was mostly through my own independent research work).",
    "The policy memos are good because you actually have to engage (on a somewhat deep\/nuanced level) with current issues. This course had many weaknesses. Hacker's teaching style was problematic: he taught us things that basically had nothing to do with the policy memos, and his lectures as a whole were unorganized and not particularly interesting or informative. He also frequently set up his slides late, wasting our time in the classroom, and emphasized his role in certain policy issues (ie, showing a picture of himself with a CT governor), which I found to be extremely off-putting. Because the course lectures themselves had nothing to do with the memos, or honestly the final paper, I did not apply any classroom learning. Eventually I stopped going to lectures because I thought they were a waste of my time and found Hacker to be annoying. Also, Hacker kept begging us to come to lecture in messages on Canvas. I also thought this was odd. If he wanted us to come to lecture, he should have been less narcissistic in his lectures and made them actually relevant to any coursework we were doing. I also did not appreciate the 2 page, single-spaced memo prompts, along with somewhat disorganized research guides for the memos. I felt overwhelmed and very confused a lot of the time about what the actual expectations were for some of the memos.",
    "The lectures were super engaging and interesting. I really enjoyed he material covered in the class and the syllabus. I wish it wa say seminar though just so we have more time to discuss the material in small groups.",
    "This course is a MUST TAKE if you want to understand the current political and legislative climate, especially if you have little background in politics. Strengths: enjoyable readings (esp. the books), Hacker really cares about his students and takes into account your feedback and makes himself available for office hours, lectures in general can be kind of basic if you have taken other poli sci\/pub pol courses before, but Hacker is a personable and engaging lecturer. THE TFs this year were AMAZING. Weaknesses: sometimes lectures & policy memos didn't correlate with readings, but Hacker fixed that pretty soon into the course.",
    "I was engaged with everything we discussed in class and enjoyed all of the class material. However, getting feedback for policy memos was difficult. I felt like we were not provided with much instruction and then were not given much feedback on how to improve. There was also almost no information given about the final. However, the strength of the course is definitely Professor Hacker, who is amazing at what he does.",
    "This course is strongest in its assignments. I learned the most from writing the policy memos and doing the research myself with the guidance of my TA and the prompts of the policy memos. I also really enjoyed writing the final paper, even if it was very vague in its prompt. I think this course's lectures were weak. Professor Hacker is clearly incredibly accomplished and brilliant, but I think he limited himself in underestimating his students. He spent so much of lecture trying to explain to students why the material he was teaching mattered, or why it was cool and relevant. I think he often forgot the fact that even though it is an introductory course, all the students in the class opted into it and are already interested. I think we could have covered a lot more interesting ground if we didn't waste time doing things like watching the \"I'm just a bill\" videos time and time again or comparing policy to the Simpsons. I also think that although the theory was important to ground our understandings of policy mechanisms, I think it would also be really interesting if we actually spent time learning about effective policy mechanisms policymakers have used in the past to accomplish their goals. I also think it would have been interesting to actually have read laws or policy briefs in class.",
    "The course was well structured and covered lots of relevant subjects in a way that was conducive to learning. I could've benefitted from a more structured way of learning about how to write policy memos, and sometimes a lot of the information we learned about specific subjects didn't end up applying to the memos that we wrote.",
    "The format of the class is great, in my opinion: modules that begin with a discussion and analysis of a certain aspect of the political landscape (i.e., gridlock and why we have it) and then a policy application that is directly connected to that aspect (i.e., how health policy is made in the context of a polarized and stagnant Congress). This format balanced politics with policy and was a creative way of hitting on the major issues facing the country today. There isn't much I would change with the class. The only thing I can think of is that it felt like there was perhaps a week too much of \"introduction\" in the lectures before we got to the substance of policy. Obviously, those introductory lectures (about federalism, the Constitution, and why we even have government) were extremely important, but if they could be condensed a bit more so we had more time to delve into actual policy, I think that would be better.",
    "The course could be improved by trying to cover slighlty less but going into what we cover more in depth.",
    "Lectures are unclear and sometimes difficult to link up with the policy memos. I eventually stopped taking notes during class because they were not helpful in writing the policy memos. For the first memo, I already understood the concepts relating to healthcare policy because they had been explained to me in another course, so that memo was easier to make sense of. The other two required a lot of time outside class trying to figure out the details of tax reform and cap-and-trade, two concepts I was not familiar with at all. Lecture covered them, but I still came out feeling like I didn't understand them well enough to write the memos. I found that, in general, lectures lacked an overarching theme and a structure that was easy to follow. I know Professor Hacker had a slide with a roadmap in the beginning of each lecture, but it wasn't very helpful. It was odd, because every time I came out of lecture I felt like I hadn't learned anything cohesive--just bits and pieces of information that was interesting. My friend and I discussed this and theorized that the lecture contained a couple of key concepts, and then a TON of backstory, facts, and examples. And a LOT of political philosophy, which I dislike and which is generally unhelpful in a course like this (where practical memo-writing and understanding policy in the context of politics should be the main focus). There should be a more clear, overarching flow to lectures, in which there are multiple key concepts and a couple of examples for each (but not too many extraneous details). I really like Professor Hacker and I think he's super cool, and I also enjoyed my section\/TA and writing the memos, but by the end I stopped taking notes in lecture because it simply was not useful to me.",
    "The memo's, while hard because they relate shockingly little to what is discussed in lecture, really make you understand issues through research. I thought the lecture was a good lecture, and Hacker really knows his stuff, but most of the time I would go to lecture, enjoy it, then look at the memo prompt and have no idea what to do for a while. Also, sometimes he used misleading slides. For instance, when making a point about income inequality, he used a graph of pre-tax incomes to show the disparity. That is not a great graph to use because we have a progressive tax system, which means that raw comparison is irrelevant. Wasn't a huge deal but bothered me.",
    "more dynamic lectures",
    "The course was very disorganized when it came to memo writing. We would not receive the memo prompt until days before it was due and would not receive feedback on our last memos until literally 2 days before the next memo was to be turned in. Due dates kept being pushed back which was largely unhelpful, especially for students who had organized their schedule at the beginning of term according to dates shown on the syllabus (for example booking spring break flights before the memo was pushed back and being unable to complete to memo early because the prompt was then distributed late). The course also had a huge left leaning bias and rarely discussed the conservative view point, often times assuming it was wrong rather than discussing any of its merits. Lectures were engaging but did not seem to relate to the memos.",
    "Strengths are Professor Hacker and all the skills and knowledge that you gain. And the fact that you become a much more informed reader and citizen! Weaknesses are that the lectures try to pack too much information in and it sometimes doesn't make sense (but if you ask the TAs they will explain)",
    "A strength of the course is that it covers various types of public policy issues in the US to give students a comprehensive view of public policy. Another strength of the course is the reading, as the books and textbook assigned to students were very insightful, instructive and interesting. A weakness of the course is that lectures were not very helpful.",
    "The course should really focus more on current policy debates between politicians on these subjects, instead of just providing a cursory introduction to what these topics are and what their pros and cons of. Often times the lecture was on things like \"here are the pros and cons of private prisons,\" rather than \"this is the type of prison system republicans are advocating for, while democrats stand here, and this is how one side is trying to sway the other and what their constituents want as well as how they're navigating between state and federal obligations.\"",
    "I think a weakness of the course was how separate the assignments felt from the class discussions. While the theory and history we covered in lecture was interesting background information, the assignments were entirely based on current political issues, which we almost never covered in class or in section. It is certainly reasonable to expect a certain amount of individual research (and the TFs' research guides were helpful for bridging that gap), it would have been helpful to talk a bit more about the current political climate at the end of each class or each unit.",
    "Professor Hacker is an engaging lecturer and was visibly invested in the course. As an introduction to policy discussions, this course more than met expectations. I would very much appreciate the opportunity to continue the study of policy issues through a seminar or more advanced lecture, however.",
    "The professor's lectures were awful. Individually, the lectures were jumpy and the message convoluted. Overall, there was no grand takeaway or direction guiding the course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. A great course, especially for someone with no political science background",
    "Recommended to anyone with a real interest in policy and its effects on people, especially those who are vulnerable.",
    "Run from this class! I took it Credit\/D so I was fine, but it was a lot of work for very little reward. Policy memos were graded too harshly, and lecture was a mess. Section was loathsome. Learned nothing!",
    "I would take this class if you have some experience with writing research papers or have experience with policy. I would not take this class if you have little to no experience or are not good at independent research.",
    "!! If you care about US public policy, you will take this class. It gives you a theoretical framework to understand public policy but also makes you engage with the particulars of the issues. And though writing the policy memos can be a pain, it's one of the few classes at Yale that you can walk away from having acquired a new set of skills. I could write policy memos in my sleep now.",
    "no because professor hacker cares more about academia and his reputation than his students. you will feel like this class is a waste of your time, and you wont get anything out of lecture or the readings. the only things you will learn will be what you teach yourself or learn from your TA.",
    "Nope. Prof Hacker pretty much just rambled through lectures and it was very hard to get anything out of them. There was wayyyy too much readingso much that it was just impossible to doand the reading often had nothing to do with lecture. Would not recommend.",
    "Would 100% recommend this course to anyone that was serious about domestic politics. I like that it teaches a practical skill as well with the memo writing assignments. I am able to understand the compromises going on at a national level to ensure that policies pass. Definitely not a course to take if you just want to breeze through (but courses are better when you aren't just breezing though!)",
    "If you want to learn to write memos or broad overview of public policy, then yes. But probably more interesting, in depth classes to take.",
    "The course offered great insight into the system, but frankly the organization was a tad confusing and it was difficult to synthesize everything towards the end.",
    "Yes! If you want to explore today's most important political issues and develop paths to good policy, that this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Lectures were incredibly engaging and the reading and writing assignments were structured in such a way that they enhanced our engagement with the material.",
    "I recommend this course to someone who wants a broad survey of current public policy and to improve upon a skill-set. Not a gut by any means. Also, I recommend taking the final exam over the paper. It is fair, easy to study for, and over-all a better experience.",
    "I really wanted to enjoy this class. I really did. However, a disconnect existed between the lectures and assignments in such a way that I felt very little reason to really go to class. I learned important things like how Obamacare works and how Cap and Trade is implemented. BUT, this was all from my own research with minimal foundations from the course. I came in excited, but ultimately left disappointed.",
    "If you want a liberal perspective on the current workings of government, take the class.",
    "Professor Hacker is an awesome lecturer, and given that this class will continue to be topical for the foreseeable future with this current administration, I would highly recommend it, especially as a Credit\/D option, which is how I treated it to go to the lectures and listen.",
    "Absolutely! Yes! Take this course!!! Prof. Hacker is great and my TA (Brian) was incredible. Honestly, this was the best course I've ever taken at Yale, and I say that as a senior who has completed all of my Yale coursework. The lectures were engaging and fun, the sections really made you think about what optimal policy solutions would be (and we weren't really quizzed about readings! I actually learned quite a bit in section!), and the policy memos were tough, but I've actually learned a lot from writing them. Grading is not easy, but I was taking it Cr\/D, so I only cared about learning as much as possibly could, which maybe was why I've enjoyed the course so much. As a STEM major, I should say that I was rather surprised by how much fun I was having doing the readings. The course was so good that, even taking it Cr\/D\/fail, I made sure to do all of the readings and attend every lecture\/section, because they were just that good and interesting. After taking this course, I almost wish I had double majored in political science while I still had time. Plus, the course really made me rethink my career choices, which was rather scary since I'm graduating in a couple of weeks. 10 out of 10 would recommend!",
    "Absolutely. If you're at all interested in politics or current events, this is the perfect course. It goes a little quickly at times, but very interesting to learn about policy issues in greater depth and their overlap with political issues.",
    "Take this course, no matter what you study. It really forces you to think critically about how to break down problems, sift through competing alternatives, and write in a clear and concise way. I would strongly recommend the course. Also Hacker is a true gem! He is so funny, and you can tell he works really hard to make the class successful.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this course unless you already know a lot about American public policy and politics. It's very relevant and interesting material.",
    "Yes, absolutely recommend this course! Professor Hacker is excellent. I would, however, warn that the policy memos are pretty much thrown at you without a lot of preparation. Professor Hacker has designed the course around policy \"modules\" but I didn't find that they provided much help for the policy memos. If you do take the course, I recommend taking it for writing credit. You get to have drafts for each policy memo and instead of the final you write a 10-12 policy \"white-paper\"",
    "Probably not, not unless they already know how to write a policy memo and are good at it. There's very little instruction on how to do that and those are your only assignments. Class is irrelevant and boring at times. Its a skippable class if that's what you're looking for. It did a good job completing my second US requirement for polisci but I was overall frustrated with the class.",
    "Hacker is a very good lecturer. But, this course can be a bit infantile at times, and moves quite slowly. There is very little work, and the reading is almost completely unnecessary to do the assignments.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to people interested in public policy. You should shop the first couple classes to see if you like Hacker, who can be a polarizing teacher. But if you like his teaching style, then you'll probably like the class because the material is good and well structured.",
    "I would recommend Politics of U.S. Public Policy to anyone interested in the intersection of policymaking and the law or current events, with the caveat that if you do not have prior knowledge about economics or policy fundamentals, you must do the reading to understand the material.",
    "This a very good survey course to learn about issues you see in the news all the time but don't really understand the intricacies of. You do cover a lot of material, so it can feel like a lot is going by you. But anyone interested in politics at all should take this class.",
    "Yes I would, especially to Poli Sci majors or those interested in public policy.",
    "Yes. All of the finer points of policymaking are covered, and writing the memos is great way to test the waters for if a career in the government or research may be the right choice.",
    "If someone is interested in politics, then absolutely! The topics are very relevant to current issues and I felt like I was a more informed citizen as a result of taking this class",
    "You should take this course, even if you aren't planning to go into politics (like me!) While nothing in the course is done at a very high level (no crazy philosophizing or quant skills required), it does an excellent job of using basic ideas from many fields to explain today's political environment. You won't learn HOW to do a regression discontinuity analysis, for instance, but you'll learn what it is.",
    "I had a hard time following or concentrating on lecture. Hacker is fun, but if you follow current events in the U.S. you'll already know most of the material.",
    "A really great class for understanding the daily headlines a little better, Professor Hacker is excellent. You have to focus on the assignments and do at least some of the readings but it's totally manageable. Would recommend.",
    "Probably not. I didn't find the material very engaging, lecture was pointless, and section was annoying. I'm glad that I have an understanding of policy memos and how to write them, but there are other classes at Yale that can teach you this which will be more worth it.",
    "Awesome class - a must-take for anyone considering a career related to politics or policy. Hacker is a great lecturer and an incredible source of knowledge on policy issues. He's also a very dedicated professor, taking a lot of time to craft interesting policy memo prompts and frequently update Canvas. The TAs for the class are absolutely fantastic and the memos are difficult but very rewarding",
    "Interesting class if you want to understand why policies are written they way they are, and why it is so hard for something to get passed through Congress. Three 5-page papers and a final exam\/paper.",
    "No. I didn't learn much that I couldn't have learned from MSNBC. Prof. Hacker is funny and certainly knows what he's talking about, but the course isn't worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in working in government.",
    "Don't take the course with an expectation of great lectures. Rather, I learned the most from my incredible TF and writing the policy memos. However, from those two sources, I learned a ton about the way government works, and how policy-making occurs on an in-depth level for healthcare, budgetary, and environmental policy.",
    "If you want to learn how to write policy memos this class can help you do that.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student but would tell them to really try to read all the readings even though they don't really go with the course all the time.",
    "Definitely. The sections were much more helpful than the lectures. This course is super helpful for understanding what is happening in the world today. Professor Hacker really cares about his students and giving them the best experience possible.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's a must for anyone interested in politics, but frankly it's worthwhile even if you're not super politically engaged (this class might turn you into a news junkie). Great analysis both of how things really work in Washington (and at the state level) and of how American demographics and popular thinking shape (and don't shape) our politics.",
    "Lackluster lectures that don't provide much insight. Everything I learned from this class came from doing the policy memo assignments, meaning I learned pretty much everything on my own. An easy class to disengage from, which is great if you want a gutty credit, but sucks if you want to actually learn something.",
    "Yes. Great course. You learn a lot, the lectures are fun, the material is very fun if you're into the subject material.",
    "yes, I think so.",
    "This is an important course that I think every student who wants to understand relevant current event policy debates should take. Professor Hacker is a clear lecturer and very friendly and knowledgeable. However, students must understand that a good policy memo takes a lot of independent research work. The course definitely touched on many relevant topics, but its greatest weakness was its tie to the main assignments: the policy memos. A very rigorous and thorough policy memo was expected, all within 5 pages. I had significant points taken off for going a little into the 6th page. The amount of detail required to write a good memo does not correlate AT ALL with the depth of information covered in class, leading to intensive research for all three memos, as well as the final memo if you choose to write it instead of the final. Professor Hacker is extremely friendly and reasonable when you speak with him, and also open to modifying the course to improve it, but lectures always seemed too overview-y rather than working into the details and debates to help us start our thinking\/prep work for the memos. Otherwise, I think this is a very important course to provide for undergraduates, and I still learned a lot (even if it was mostly through my own independent research work). I also took the class as a WR section, which gave me the ability to have drafts for my memos. This was my first time tackling the memo format, which was a huge and difficult learning curve for me. I can't even begin to imagine how the non-WR students fared without the draft option. Be warned: if you don't feel comfortable with your writing abilities, maybe Credit\/D this course!",
    "I would not recommend this course. Honestly, I found Hacker to be narcissistic and uninteresting in his lectures, so much so that I, and probably the majority of the class, did not attend lecture. The memos are tricky because of Hacker's 2 page prompts, and lectures are completely irrelevant to anything else in the course. There are many other more interesting and relevant political science courses to take.",
    "Yes!! This is a must take class to have a strong foundation in American politics and political institutions for everyone.",
    "Definitely!!! If you want to understand current events\/the dysfunctional party system\/the Trump administration-key to combatting it!! and explore different underpinnings of diff political perspectives and policies and get into the nitty gritty of policy, TAKE THIS CLASS. I wish more people understood how a) difficult it is to get shit done in the system and b) also how vital that shit is and c) got involved in politics and public policy. THIS IS THE PERFECT INTRO TO THAT! TAKE TAKE TAKE!",
    "Yes, if the student had previous knowledge of American government\/politics and possibly economics too.",
    "I would not recommend this course if 1) you are an informed person who reads the NYT at least weekly or 2) have taken any kind of course in which you write a policy memo. I took this course because I have taken niche policy clases, but wanted a broad, more strategic overview. I was very disappointed. Professor Hacker is a world-renowned public intellectual and policy mind, but he was a very disappointing lecturer. He spent so much time trying to convince students that what he was teaching is cool that we didn't really get to learn all that much. This meant things like watching the I'm Just a Bill videos 3x in class (and spending 10 minutes to pull them up when they didn't come up automatically) and comparing policy mechanisms to the Simpsons. Of course, you want a lecturer to be intriguing, but here the balance was tilted too much to the side of trying to be relatable while sacrificing actual material. Writing the policy memos was interesting, but I wish we actually learned about the issues surrounding the policy memos in class. I would only take this class if you need an easy 5th credit and don't want to go to class but can devote ~12 hours for 3 policy memos and are willing to write a final paper.",
    "I would recommend Politics of US Public Policy to any student who is interested in the debates on public policy that are happening in government today. The class teaches you about the many considerations that policymakers must address when writing policy, and is interesting for any student of American Government.",
    "Definitely, take this course! I learned so much over the semester, and this class really galvanized a deeper interest and understanding of the policy landscape in our country. This class teaches you to think and write like a social scientist\/policy analyst, not just a partisan, and I found that extremely refreshing and valuable. Even though it is an introductory-type class, I learned a ton about the nuances and details of health care, environmental policy, taxes and spending, and criminal justice and this class made me want to study those issues further and learn more. Professor Hacker is an amazing professor and is extremely engaging and devoted to his students, and his lectures were always entertaining. Lastly, the policy memo assignments were challenging and really fulfilling, more so than most other short paper assignments you will have. This is a great class take it!",
    "I would recommend if someone has very little experience with policy formation and wants to learn the basics.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially the writing section. If you don't take the WR credit you will have to write three policy memos and do either a final exam or paper. If you take the WR credit, you write three policy memos and you get the chance to revise them so you can get a better grade. The process of revision for me never took that long--usually just another hour and you get a week to do it. You have to write a final paper, but I was really relieved I didn't have to take the exam because lectures were kind of confusing and I stopped taking notes for them since they didn't help too much with the policy memos (neither did the readings, and you are actually encouraged *not* to include references from the readings in your memos because it looks unprofessional). Overall, a pretty laid-back class with the only stressful moments being in the couple days before memos were due. My TA (Ben Miller) was really nice, helpful, and relaxed, so section was enjoyable and papers were graded fairly. You get to choose your topic for the final paper, which made writing it much more enjoyable. Also, Professor Hacker is super fun and loves to play Hamilton and weird video clips in class. It's a good lecture--take it if you want to learn more about policy. If you already have experience writing memos, and especially if you know the details of health care, tax reform, and cap-and-trade, you may want to find a higher-level course. That being said, Hacker adjusts the course to keep pace with current events (which was really interesting for us in light of the new administration) so topics may change.",
    "Yes I would, but I would caution them about the weird lecture-memo disconnect.",
    "Yes yes yes! One of my favorite classes at Yale. It is the most practical and applicable political science class you can take, in my opinion. As accomplished as Professor Hacker is, he still cares about students and their educational experience so much. Once you do the research for the memos, they are pretty simple to write and a really great skill to have. You will learn a ton about policies and the politics of those policies which will help you understand why the best outcomes don't always happen. If you like solving problems and thinking methodically, I think you will enjoy writing the memos as much as I did.",
    "I would recommend Professor Hacker's course because Public Policy is relevant to everyone, and he structures the course such that anyone, with any background in political science (mine was minimal) can come and learn a lot about how American government functions and the complexities of enacting policies that affect the public. Overall, readings are informative, the memos actually teach you a new way of thinking about writing didactically (if you haven't written a policy memo before), and the stuff you learn in this class is both current and practical. If J. Hacker's still teaching it, take it if you can.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have little to no experience with public policy and writing policy memos.",
    "I would not. Many of the things I gained and learned from this course I could have done on my own if I was personally invested in learning more about these topics.",
    "This is an interesting class, and it was great to take it in the current political climate. You'll learn about a lot of the dilemmas facing our political system today and many of the origins of those dilemmas and possible future solutions. I definitely would have gotten more out of the class had I done more of the readings, so I recommend doing so if you take the class. It's not the best class I have taken at Yale, but if you are interested in the material, I would still recommend it.",
    "Yes, it is approachable for those with little political science experience, but also useful for those with a background in policy. Professor Hacker is fabulous and very engaged. I was lucky to have a law student as a TA, and felt I received valuable feedback on my memos.",
    "Absolutely do not take this class. It made me question my interest in politics as it was mind-numbingly boring. Lectures are not only awful to attend but useless as they don't relate to the assignments. Instead you're given a policy memo prompt as broad as \"repeal and replace ACA\" and it's just miserable."
