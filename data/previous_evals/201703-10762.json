   "comments": [
    "I feel comfortable discussing a whole range of historical authors' political vies and writings and can parse and identify the important statements and opinions of any new writers I may come across.",
    "I gained a large exposure to the development of political philosophy. This was invaluable.",
    "I learned how to interact with the works of the western cannon and how to write, along with how to synthesize texts across generations.",
    "This class gave me a fantastic introduction to political science and philosophy and helped me develop opinions of my own. The syllabus is very interesting and I started to learn how to write a political philosophy paper, something very different than a history paper.",
    "I improved immensely as a thinker, reader, and writer in this course. Above all, Professor Smith taught me how to grapple with a text -- a skill I will undoubtedly use for the rest of my life. Now, whenever approaching a work, I ask myself two questions: what question is the author trying to answer through this book and what is the writer's answer. In addition, every seminar was fascinating and I feel so grateful for all that Professor Smith has done to help me this term.",
    "I learned how to read texts critically, understanding the significance of undertones and subtleties, rather than just taking the text's assertions at face value. Further, I learned about significant questions in political theory, such as what the role of religion should be in a society, how governments should be structured, and how one should act in response to tyranny.",
    "I learned to approach history in a different manner from high school, and I thought it was a great class where we thought about political ideas that are still relevant today.",
    "LEArned how to approach political philosophy and discuss texts through a political lens"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is most certainly the reading list. It is varied, in depth and the works complement one another well. I wish in class discussion we had focused more on big picture views of given authors rather than short passages, as I think we often missed the forest for the trees, not fully grasping a writer's meaning because we were so concerned with a word here or there.",
    "This was a great course and I really enjoyed the instructor. The seminars were relentlessly insightful and the readings were awesome. I think that Prof. Smith should get a canvas. Just to have one. I don't think the course had a syllabus either, so I was really flying blind with the whole grade thing. That made me focus on learning rather than other things, but it was still a strange experience.",
    "The syllabus and class discussions are both great. Students are definitely invested in the material and care about seminars. I feel like my professor could have spent a bit more time teaching us how to properly write a poli sci paper correctly.",
    "I would not change this course in any way. I loved it!",
    "The specific section I was in took place early in the morning which probably brought down the overall level of engagement (I certainly wasn't able to participate as much as I would have liked to, especially later in the semester when I was up late at nights writing essays). Professor Smith always had interesting insights, but the class often devolved into a couple of men in the class feeding off of each other in a way that wasn't super inclusive or always helpful. I think it would have been a better class if Smith had contributed a bit more or done more to direct the class when people seemed to get off track."

   "comments": [
    "If you would like an introductory course in political philosophy, this is the best you can ask for. So yes, I would recommend.",
    "absolutely. This course is essential to anyone wishing to understand the development of politics as a means for persuasion and control.",
    "I would strongly recommend Directed Studies and the H&P course. I love H&P it was great.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in politics, history, or statesmanship. It covers a broad range of topics and helps a student hone their writing.",
    "Yes! I have already told all of my friends that Professor Smith is an amazing instructor.",
    "Yes. The critical reading skills it teaches are superb. It is a great introduction to important political controversies.",
    "Absolutely. DS as a whole is great, and the HP section specifically ties together well with the other two sections. Some big ideas can be seen in literature, and other ideas can come from philosophy.",
    "Professor Smith gave extensive feedback on my essays (even if it wasn't always feedback I agreed with) and was always very accessible. Our section got sidetracked a lot and was often dominated by a couple of men who fed off each other. I would have liked for smith to take more command of the direction of the seminar and contribute more to it himself.",
    "Great course, excellent intro into political thought"
