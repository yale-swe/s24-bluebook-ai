    "It tackles a subject that no other course at Yale (that I've found) really does and the projects allow you to really get your hands dirty and to make connections.The main weakness is just the huge amount of work you need to put in (depending somewhat on your project) combined with the fact that, since it only occurs over a single semester, you feel like you are still leaving loose ends!",
    "See Question 9",
    "This was a fantastic course, exactly the sort of thing I came to Yale hoping to take. I appreciated the rigor of the projects and the real-world nature of our work. The work load was much greater than most other classes I have taken, but it was worth it. I do think students should be aware of the work load in advance so they can plan their semesters accordingly."

He is also very intelligent and fun to discuss global health justice with. Sometimes his desire for the best outcome possible can cause him to become a little micromanaging, but it seemed like he worked on that through the course of the semester.",

    "If you're prepared to work hard and are enthusiastic about global health justice and applying your education to those problems, then I think this is a great class for you. Just make sure you have the time and desire to go the distance. You will learn a lot and make connections that I'm sure will serve you well for a long time to come.",
    "What I learned from this course was immensely valuable, and I really did feel like my project and my team produced a productive product. I am grateful for the guidance I received and the relationships I built - Amy, Ali and Gregg are all incredible instructors and I am so honored to have learned from them. I loved working with them both inside and outside the classroom and am thus happy I took the course for that reason alone.However, I spent a great deal of my time in this course and in my team feeling like because I was not a law student, I was not good enough or smart enough to be there. I consistently felt like I was being talked down to, and that my contributions were marginalized. The workload was insane - and completely unexpected. I sometimes found that my team members had no respect for the fact that I was in a different school and on a different academic schedule. I understand that group work has to come first, and I tried my best to balance the workload, but I was made to feel like if I wasn't spending at least 10 hours a week on our project, I was simply not doing enough. It didn't help that we had one member of our team who was particularly rude and tended to use a disdainful and condescending tone of voice whenever she spoke to me - and that I had to work closely with her for months, while consistently being made to feel like an immature idiot.In sum, I learned a ton (including the fact that I will probably never go to law school) - more so than I have in probably any other class I've taken at this university. But at the end of the day, this class made me feel like shit about myself as an individual. I really, really wish I had better things to say about it because I think the collaboration has so much potential and I really want the course to grow and the work togo places. And I think it will in time, I'm just not sure I would recommend the experience I had to others.",
    "This practicum offers a chance to build research and advocacy skills while working on a project with real implications on health and justice. I would recommend it to anyone interested in global health and human rights."
