    "I developed more confidence in dealing with liturgical material. I also gained familiarity with the Sarum liturgy in particular. Experiencing the Sarum liturgy first-hand was a wonderful learning opportunity that let me get a much firmer grasp of the inner workings of a medieval mass.",
    "This was a somewhat difficult course because it was so interdisciplinary. Each student brought a very different knowledge set to the class and it was a very difficult task to try to bring everyone to the same point (which I guess was not the task of the course). I felt like it would have been helpful for me to have had a slightly different knowledge set for me to get as much as possible from this course, as it was, I had some difficultly keeping up with large chunks of the course content. For me, it was more helpful as an exercise in thinking through a subject from multiple perspectives."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength, in my opinion, is the focus on thourough undestanding of specific liturgy. Combined with the travel seminar portion and the mass, this was very helpful in understanding the sarum liturgy in more depth. Preparing and performing an actual mass was, for me, an excellent educational experience and I would recommend the course on the strenght of it alone. On the other hand, I would suggest the instructors reconsider slightly the order in which they present the material. The midterm assignment, for example, was a great way to delve into the material in a more guided way. Some assignments like that earlier in the semester might be useful in allowing the students to get more familiar with the topic and get over the hurdle of it being a vast, yet very detailed, body of material. I would strongly suggest to shift more of the discussion towards the students (as opposed to lecturing).",
    "I don't think that the team teaching element of this course was particularly successful. It was a benefit to have two professors with varying interests and areas of expertise. Unfortunately, I think that they had different ideas of how course time should be spent. Professor Parkes made an effort to engage the class in discussion from an interdisciplinary perspective, he organized a very useful trip to the Beinecke, and he made the conversations productive for people whose interests were not primarily theological or liturgical. Professor Spinks did not really seem to want to engage with the seminar aspect of this course. He read from a script for large chunks of class, the content of which largely repeated the assigned readings. He made very little effort to foster discussion and did not seem particularly interested in the non-liturgical aspects of the course, to the extent that he seemed to have been reading a book during the entirety of our midterm presentations. The trip to Salisbury (etc.) was a very good way to bring the themes and thoughts of the course together. I got a lot out of our performance though I think we could have done with a bit less traveling between towns. We never received a midterm grade, though I am not sure if this is a standard practice."

   "comments": [
    "In general, I would recommend the course to another student. It is an effective way to get more in-depth knowledge of a particular liturgical tradition (and also what is involved in studying it). The travel seminar and the mass greatly outweigh some slight drawbacks to the course, such as the amount of lecturing based on assigned readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a very strong liturgical foundation. Because I think that many times, Professor Spinks overrode Professor Parkes for speaking time in this course, the emphasis became slightly less on music and art, etc. Activities like practicing and performing the liturgy in the spaces of the churches we visited were the most helpful elements for me, as were the moments when Professor Parkes engaged the entire class in discussion."
