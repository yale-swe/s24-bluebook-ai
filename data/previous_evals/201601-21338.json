   "comments": [
    "An absolutely phenomenal class. The syllabus is wonderfully structured and curated--not just a chronological sweep through the history of political thought, but an extremely thoughtfully designed thematic examination of the central political and economic institutions of liberalism. The course has a coherent argument, and agree or disagree with it, the structure makes it all the more enriching an experience. Professor Sabl is also a gem. Seminar discussions were some of the best of any course I've taken at Yale. So many political theory seminars aren't actually about *politics.* This course certainly is. And by bringing classic texts in conversation with more contemporary works, and by allowing discussions to be informed by relevant, normative debate, Professor Sabl does a phenomenal job running the seminar.",
    "This was an amazing class. I think I learned more in this one seminar than in all of my other EP&E seminars combined. It was well taught, really well facilitated, and comprehensive. Professor Sabl was an absolutely amazing professor, always willing to meet with students and giving extremely constructive feedback on essays as well as in class comments. He really forces you to think about what you are really saying and looking at things from different perspectives. I would definitely recommend this version of Classics of EP&E to other students. It was definitely a lot more work than I thought it would be, but well worth it in the end.",
    "Sabl is a great teacher! You read both primary and secondary sources on a bunch of cool topics. The workload is not bad at all (4 short reading responses and a final) and class discussions are great. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course, but take it junior or senior year to avoid feeling trampled over by senior EPE majors who are pretty sure they know everything there is to know (and have read many of the texts already)."
