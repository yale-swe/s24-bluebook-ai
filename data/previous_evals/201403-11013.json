   "comments": [
    "I would recommend HSAR 739 01 to other students. It has a very specific focus over the semester, so if the topic is of interest it is hard to think of a better course to enroll in that will offer a more complete understanding of the rise and fall of mechanization and parallel reactions. I learned an enormous amount through the precise selection of readings and intimate class discussions.",
    "To a fellow student, I greatly encourage them to take this course. An art history course by a professor of Art history in architecture, is not very common and provides a very different point of view to look at architecture. It is also a great course to explore cross disciplinary interests. The aspect of exploring history using Machines as a hinge is a great tactic, and in spite of Machines not being my primary area of interest in architecture, attending the first class had me hooked! The choice of readings were great, and meticulously selected.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The course was extremely thorough and I have learned a lot from having taken it."

   "comments": [
    "As an architecture student this course allowed an oblique view into the discipline that introduced me to many key figures that I previously was unaware of or knew very little about. I am very pleased with this course and believe it has offered me an understanding that is both instrumental to my interests in architecture as well as one that would be hard to achieve staying within the disciplinary boundary lines.",
    "The course led me to fields I didn't know about, and that I now have a great interest in - in fact, even a commitment to! I am very grateful to Craig for this. It allowed me a window to read extremely interesting books and papers, and Craig's recommendations of these resources was extremely impressive. I didn't have an initial research question, and this course allowed me to build one - one which I may now pursue in greater detail. 'My research' was something I didn't have and Craig brought to light in one of the emails exchanged, and I am very grateful for this.",
    "As a student with a background in architectural history and theory, but no specialized knowledge, this course gave me a very useful overview of the historiography of modern architecture and theory that will greatly aid my future research, not just in architecture but in aesthetics more broadly. As a model for historiographic readings of texts and other materials, it will also prove very helpful for future research dealing with historiographic arguments and material."
