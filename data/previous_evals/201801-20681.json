   "comments": [
    "Not only did I significantly expand my Chinese vocabulary and pick up new grammar structures, but I learned more about Chinese cultural nuances. This semester helped me learn and understand Chinese proverbs and customs. I gained the ability to watch and understand Chinese movies, and learned about calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, and Chinese philosophy.",
    "A great continuation of Chinese 153. We got an introduction to more nuanced topics like music, philosophy, and business. Still dont feel fluent by any means but Wang Laoshi does a great job in vastly improving our language skills from the beginning of fall semester!",
    "learned more about Chinese language and culture",
    "I learned how to speak, write, and read Manderin Chinese much more fluently, particularly in formal settings.",
    "Continuation of Chinese skills from CHNS 152",
    "Wang laoshi works really hard to make sure that your chinese writing, listening, speaking, and reading improve over the course of the semester",
    "I learned so much new vocabulary and grammatical structures. I'm so happy to say that through the course of this semester, I've learned how to write Chinese essays about politics, economics, and the arts!nn",
    "oral reading writing chinese skills",
    "I think this semester I really solidified my writing skills. I'm proud of how well I convey my ideas and I feel like I got a solid foundation in essay writing. In terms of reading and speaking, I think that my presentation skill improved as well, and I can now read a lot more words than before.",
    "I felt like my Chinese has advanced a lot since taking both 153 and 152. In addition, in comparison to 152, I felt that the content of 153 is a lot more applicable to various topics. The course content has cultural, historical, and political focuses, which is really interesting and useful to learn about."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Wang Laoshi is an amazing teacher, she always takes the time to answer any questions you may have during class and is more interested in helping you learn than about grades. On top of that, she's always full of energy and very personable. That, combined with a small seminar style class, helps you learn a lot through discussion and interaction using the language. It also moves at a pace that is reasonable but challenging. I think the only (minor) weakness of the course is that some of the Chinese proverbs we learn aren't always applicable for day to day conversation. However, I think they're extremely helpful to anyone who is aiming to understand Chinese culture on a deeper level.",
    "The main issue about CHNS 153 is the sheer amount of work it is. It isn't easy. Especially compared to CHNS 152, this class is a huge step up. Some of the lessons seemed rushed and that the professor finished working on them the night before. Moreover, the projects take a lot longer time to prepare than the professor assumes, which is a big strain on time, especially when we have to make a lesson recording, write a 600 word essay, study for dictation, and make a skit all in the same weekend. That being said, my Chinese improved without question. If the lessons were spaced out better and at least a little rest between lessons, this class would be nearly perfect. Wang Laoshi makes sure to teach relevant topics, show interesting movies, and assign fun pertaining to the lessons, which is a treat and makes the class so much more valuable.",
    "The class was less than 15 people, so it was easier to get questions answered, and to receive more attention and feedback",
    "The strengths of the course were that it met everyday. This resulted in a lot of practice, particularly speaking, which is hard to come by when learning Chinese. The weaknesses of the course were that it can be hard to manage with a lot of other high-workload classes.",
    "Strength --> the seminar style of Chinese and the fact that it meets everyday meant that our class could really become very tight knit, and all of us are true friends outside of class too now! lots of practicing really forces you to improve weakness --> I heard the class was going to be changed to 3 days a week with only 50 minute periods, but in my opinion, that is a negative change to the class because students won't be able to practice chinese everyday and establish the same kind of camaraderie with their classmates improvement --> class should stay daily!",
    "I personally liked meeting every day for class and I think that was a large strength of the course",
    "The workload is on the high side, but it's because of the workload that you're forced to review day by day and improve your Chinese exponentially as a result.",
    "na",
    "Strength is definitely the teacher. Wang lao shi definitely brings a lot of energy and makes us enthusiastic about participating in class. Weaknesses: the work is a little over the top some weeks and easier others. The workload should be more balanced. I think there should be less additional work on the weekends, especially when essays are due every Monday.",
    "Strengths - The content is really great. Our lessons, as well as presentations, pertained to current issues in China like the rural-urban gap, cross-strait relations, and the phenomenon of Starbucks in China. Weaknesses - Sometimes it felt like there was too much homework, as well as sometimes, the class schedules weren't updated very clearly so it was easy to miss assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're serious about learning Chinese, this course has an amazing professor and a reasonable but challenging workload that will help you achieve that.",
    "Yes! Wang Laoshi is such a delight, and the community she creates within the class can't be matched. The students and the professor are friends on WeChat and in real life, which is such a valuable and great dynamic. Wang Laoshi teaches interesting and important topics, and always asks us for feedback. As long as you do the work and don't slack off, your Chinese will improve substantially.",
    "Yes because the teacher does an excellent job to further student's interest in learning.",
    "If you are interested in getting much better at Manderin, and are willing to put in the work, then this is a great course for you!",
    "This class is definitely super super enjoyable but be prepared for a heavy workload. It can sometimes be very frustrating to have to deal with all the Chinese homework, because while it is not hard, it does take time away, and it can stress you out when you have to do other homework for other classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class is truly a bonding experience, and Wang laoshi is amazing and truly cares about her students. My closest friends at Yale are from this class",
    "Yes, absolutely! As I was placed into 153 without taking 152, I initially worried that I couldn't keep up. The first few weeks are definitely a challenge trying to get used to the workload (and fitting it alongside other classes and extracurriculars) and catching up on the vocabulary and grammar my classmates might've learned from 152. If you're in a similar situation, don't worry! There's plenty of support from Wang Laoshi and your friends. You will be able to keep up in the end.",
    "Yes. definitely",
    "Yes wanglaoshi is amazing. take her class",
    "Yes. Not only do you improve your Chinese, but you also learn so many topics that (in my opinion) are really useful, such as Chinese politics and Chinese philosophy."
