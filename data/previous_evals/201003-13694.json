    "Movie Physics is a great introduction to physics! I came into the class with no physics or calculus experience at all and I found the material accessible and interesting. If you're entirely unfamiliar with the material, you will have to study for the tests, but it's comforting to know that no one test can make or break you. Tests occur throughout the semester and really aren't cumulative, but focus on the material you cover in the month or so preceding the test. There is no final, nor is there a final project or paper,so you're finished with the class going into reading week, which is great! I would recommend this class to any freshman or sophomore who is seeking to fulfill a QR or SC requirement, especially those folks who like action movies - this class will really change your perspective on some of your favorite films!",
    "We watch movie clips and discuss the physics of the scenes. Awesome class. Professor Robinson is patient and thorough. Take it if you can get in.",
    "awesome course! not much work at all and very very fair grading. i highly recommend taking this class",
    "Take the class if you can get in. It's extremely small so consider yourself lucky if Professor Robinson selects you. It's a great way to knock out a QR or a Sci. I'm really not a math person and I have never wanted to be, but Movie Physics was still interesting to me and I learned really cool concepts that I know I'll be able to apply to life (and obviously movies).",
    "I would highly recommend this. A great SC or QR for non-science majors.",
    "I highly recommend this class",
    "An overview of the fundamentals of physics through the lens of film. Take this course. It is truly an enjoyable experience, and a great way to get a science or math credit.",
    "Absolutely recommended. It's a great, fun, educational class that fulfills a science and a QR credit. Take this if you can. Plus Professor Robinson is the greatest.",
    "YES YES YES YES. This was an amazing class and I HATE Science and Math. It was very engaging and definitely doable if you are not good at Science and Math. Professor Robinson is amazing and everyone should take this class.",
    "Movie Physics is a great science credit, but wouldn't take it if it were any other professor than Frank.",
    "Please take this class. You will not regret it. It was the best decision of my semester. The course material seems difficult, but Professor Robinson explains it in a way that makes it easy for everyone to understand. The problem sets are wonderful; you only have about five or six, and he makes time to meet with you if you have any questions. He is very flexible, and very easygoing. Sometimes in class, the material would get a bit dry, but then we would watch a movie clip and I would become interested again. If you have the opportunity to take this class, please do so.",
    "The best class ever!"
