    "I think the pronunciation section in the class can be more efficient. Currently, it is like student practice the pronunciation one by one.",
    "Strengths: Presentations with feedback are a very good system. Discussion in class is engaging. Pronunciation sessions helpful to improve specific sounds. The exam in the end professionally organized. Weaknesses: Some of the in-class activities (mostly during pronunciation) were quite childish (like singing). Also, I think that 4 hours a week is a lot of time. My other courses were much shorter. Finally, I wish we had time to talk about some other things we planned to talk about (they were on the syllabus).",

    "It gives good opportunities to present in English."
