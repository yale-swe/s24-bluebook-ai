    "Group work can be hard, but our capstone leader Prof. O'Brien was excellent and made the project as good as it could have been given our unclear and nonresponsive client.",
    "Team work, big picture insight and understanding so much more about how development initiatives work in the real world",
    "I learned an immense amount about the best practices being implemented on the ground in food security and advocacy and the difficulty in measuring the outcomes of those best practices. As for skills, this project gave our team a lot of practice clarifying objectives, developing a scope of work, carrying out a research strategy, and producing a final report.",
    "Learned a lot about working in a team, about advocacy and how civil society can be a part of implementing policies. Also refined interviewing skills.",
    "Learned an incredible amount about what it means to take a project from the conceptualization stage all the way to a finished report. Great experience working as part of a team and leveraging individual strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I found this course to be incredibly valuable, mostly due to our advisor. I learned effective teamwork strategies, how to write a report for a client, how to best split up work according to talents\/strengths\/weaknesses, and honed my research skills.",
    "Working on the capstone project was a great, eye-opening experience. Instead of framing our findings from an academic standpoint, there were many real-world considerations to keep in mind. I learned to work together in a big group of different personalities."

   "comments": [
    "Our client was not very good, but Julie was a great leader and the other students were generally great. Any group project with 8 students is going to be difficult, but this capstone worked decently well. I was very disappointed in the Jackson Institute who gave us absolutely no guidance or feedback. It felt like they totally forgot about us with regards to promoting our work and assisting us. Class trip to DC was great though",
    "Difficult to work in the team with a quiet personality",
    "I think the greatest strength of the course is the student-led design. It makes you feel like you have ownership over the project. I would say the greatest weakness was probably the lack of clarity from the end of the client, especially towards the beginning.",
    "Our client was not great, but our professor, Julie O'Brien, was amazing, and made the best of a not-ideal situation.",
    "strengths: teamwork, project completion weaknesses: jackson institute was poor about communicating, etc.",
    "I think that the Jackson Institute provided us with little support and the project was not well outlined by the client that they chose for us. It was however a great course overall and our advisor, Julie O'Brien was fantastic in directing us.",
    "The project itself was meaningful and relevant. We covered a broad range of topics and concerns. We were unclear about what to produce at the start of the semester, but that was soon clarified. Class discussions were mostly fruitful although people didn't always come prepared."

    "You have to take this if you are a Global Major, all the projects sounded only okay so probably best to choose based on the instructor, in which case Julie is great so do whichever one she is doing",
    "it's mandatory for the major. can be very beneficial and engaging if you have a good project AND a good team. Team chemistry makes all the difference",
    "I think that this course is incredibly applicable and is a phenomenal reason to be a part of the Global Affairs major.",
    "It's mandatory for Global Affairs students, but an important and enriching experience. Would recommend."
