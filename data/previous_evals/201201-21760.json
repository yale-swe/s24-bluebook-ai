   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class. It seems like a lot of work, but it's really not. The reading is fun and will take you back to your childhood, and the conversation is fascinating.",
    "Take it if you're interested in working creatively with children's lit. Warning: it's really hard to write lit crit on Dr. Seuss. It's also a ton of fun to put on costumes& act it out in class.",
    "This was a great opportunity to reread some favorite books and discover some new ones. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to truly appreciate children's literature. The secondary reading is almost as interesting as the books themselves, and the discussion was also very enjoyable. The different projects were also surprisingly valuable. I wasn't looking forward to doing a group project, for example, but it ended up being lots of fun to do and didn't require too much of a time commitment. Take this class if you can!",
    "Perhaps the most enjoyable class I've taken at Yale. The class has two foci: 1) Talking about children from a psycho-social, developmental viewpoint. This is pretty light. 2)Literary analysis and enjoyment of books we read, or should have read as children. Delightful.",
    "It should be obvious from the syllabus that Children's Lit is a great class. Getting to write papers about Babar and Harry Potter is incredibly interesting, and Prof. Stepto does a great job of assembling provoking secondary sources that mean you are not just reading kid's books. The reading can actually be fairly heavy some weeks, but you can choose when to turn in the various assignments, meaning that it is not too hard to make everything fit with your schedule. If you are excited about reading children's lit and analyzing it, I would definitely take this class!",
    "If I could do it all again, I wouldn't have taken this class, but at least I'm glad I took it Credit\/D\/Fail. The reading and course load are heavy-- don't make the mistake of thinking this is a gut or an easy seminar. Stepto is also a pretty tough grader on the analytical assignments, but more easy going on the creative assignments."
