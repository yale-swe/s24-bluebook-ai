   "comments": [
    "If you are going into laboratory science in the future, I would definitely recommend this class - there are a lot of biophysical properties that are utilized in various assays, and it is really helpful to understand them conceptually. If you are an MB&B major, you are required to take this class, but I wouldn't recommend it to other science majors unless you are really interested in the topics.",
    "My thoughts on this course are mixed. Professor De La Cruz was by far the best lecturer, but the material he covered was mostly review for me. I did like his lecture on biopolymer mechanics, and wish we could have learned more about it. Professor Wang had trouble communicating with the class, and I felt that he taught us quantum mechanics at a much more detailed level than we were ever tested at. His material on spectroscopy was good though. The EM lecture was a complete blur. Professor Steitz was fine as a lecturer, but the X-ray crystallography material is difficult, and I feel that we didn't spend enough time on it.",
    "The class is actually not very quantitative at all, so don't worry. It will teach you a lot of broad biophysical concepts,and serves as a good survey course. Easy problem sets and reasonable exams. I would much rather take this over PCHEM II.",
    "I would recommend this course to another MB&B student that is choosing between the various options for the required credit. The workload is not very heavy and the course is well structured.",
    "MB&B 302 still has not been perfected. It was a good experience -- in that I definitely learned something -- but there are some definite issues with how material is presented and what material is covered. With that said, it is going to change next year when Professors Steitz and Wang are no longer teaching, so take care to feel out the class and the syllabus (it changes year to year) before deciding on this class over, say, the second semester of physical chemistry.",
    "Good course this year, not as hard as in previous years. Useful to a range of major even though it is mostly MB&B majors.",
    "This class has improved a bit since the previous years. Enrique's lectures are now pretty good. However, Hongwei is not that great but would probably improve in the future, probably because it was his first time teaching, and Tom Steitz is pretty much terrible. I understand that crystallography a hard topic, but that is definitely not the cause for the poor quality of his lectures (well technically he used Yorgo Modis's lecture slides). He is a busy guy but I still feel the professor is responsible for teaching the students in the best way that he\/she can.The grading is kind of weird, and potentially scary, because they claim that it is based on percentage of top score (i.e. 95% of top score is A, 90% percent of top score is A-, etc). Apparently the idea behind this is so that \"everybody can get an A\". As most people would guess, many people were scared of whether there will be a genius in the class that will screw everybody over. However, the tests are generally \"easy\" enough I guess for everybody get a good score I guess, but just be aware of that.",
    "The crystallography lectures were terrible, but the rest of the class was pretty good, and it seems like a much better option than pchem II.",
    "Not an entirely difficult course, but not always fun. Mostly harmless.",
    "An introduction to the principles of biophysics, understanding the physics behind crystallography and microscopy, as well as the basics of kinetics.",
    "This course is a very good survey course of biophysical methods used in many labs. It is very relevant for those currently doing research. The course has changed much each year but many improvements have been made. You learn kinetics, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and a little of cryo-EM and polymer mechanics. The crystallography unit was not very well taught and the material is quite dense. Problem sets are very manageable and the paper discussion sections were a great way to learn about actual applications of material taught in class.",
    "You have to take this class for MB&B, so you really don't have a choice. But, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I learned a lot about the techniques I was using in lab.",
    "This is a course that gets a lot of grief from students and through evaluations. However, 1) you have to take it if you're an MBB major, and 2) it's actually improved a LOT and is a pretty decent course. There are still a lot of problems (it's difficult to organize and present the material in this course in a clear fashion) and a lot of problems with the crystallography stuff, but overall Prof. De La Cruz is incredibly nice and enthusiastic and cares a great deal about trying to make the course good, and so is very receptive to student feedback. The curve isn't unfriendly, though the material is challenging and the students are smart.The material you learn is very very useful and important for two reasons: the first is if you want to be a biologist or do biological research and be introduced to many methods which are used in modern research, and the second is if you want to read papers which use any form of biophysical techniques and understand what is actually going on.So it's not a phenomenal course, but it's improving a lot, it's got an enthusiastic lead professor, and it's important. And you probably have to take it.",
    "Very poorly taught and structured course. Not for non-majors. Only for those who need to take it, given its current form. Very disorganized topics, disjointed team-taught themes, and very little inthe way of evaluations outside of two midterms. Literally, one of the most needy of sciences classes that I have taken at Yale in the way of help and some sort of memory passed on from year to year. This course needs work and Yale should be embarrassed to continue to offer the course in its current form given the tuition they charge. I did not learn much, and what I did learn was not properly evaluated or reinforced outside of lecture. Not up to Yale standards.",
    "Required for the major; is getting better every year; next year should be fine with Yorgo back and Enrique improving."
