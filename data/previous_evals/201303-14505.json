    "An excellent course that provides a solid foundation for engaging with contemporary debates in political theory. Pogge is a great lecturer, and Daniel Putnam, our TF (and really, co-instructor) was really, really, excellent. Note, though, that despite Pogge's poverty-fighting ventures, this is a course in ideal theory.",
    "If you are interested in egalitarianism, Rawls, or social justice, take the course. If you think you need to educate yourself about any of the three, don't take it--just read about it online. Otherwise, you'll die during the semester",
    "I don't think that political philosophy is really for me, but it wasn't a bad course. We covered many different ideas, but some of them seemed kind of divorced from practical issues.",
    "It's a fun overview of the major contemporary debates surrounding equality and recognition in philosophy. It's an interesting class with great material and Pogge is super sharp. It's just a lot reading for a lecture.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Perhaps the very best I have taken at Yale. The course is structured as one large debate over political and moral philosophy. The readings almost always directly respond to one another, and as the course builds, so too does the richness of the debate. John Rawls (a profoundly influential philosopher, cited not just by academics, but also by courts and lawmakers) gets the first word in the debate, and remains the focal point for much of the rest of the course. We hear responses, rejections, additions, changes, and reinterpretations of his work as well as a variety alternative theories. Perhaps the most valuable takeaway from the course is a working understanding of the context most modern political philosophy takes place within. Another valuable takeaway is a nuanced understanding of the disagreements within liberal accounts of equality, respect, redistribution, and justice. Understanding the different liberal perspectives of these ideas will better equip you to wield them in the real world and defend the liberal position overall. Taken together, the specific political philosophy covered by the course is one of the most engaging and exciting areas of philosophical work today. About Professor Pogge, I cannot say enough good. Pogge himself was a student of Rawls, and today is quite possibly the world's foremost Rawls scholar. But Pogge is even better a teacher than a scholar and an even better a person than a teacher. He lives and breaths the material and brings passion and enthusiasm to teaching his students. His lectures are a joy to attend and each compliments the readings very well. Pogge's insights were extremely helpful for deepening our understanding of the ongoing philosophical debate. And the class was made all the better by the personal insights Pogge could give about John Rawls (after working closely with Rawls for decades). It would be difficult to get so good an education anywhere else, and it might be impossible to get one so personal. The course has quite a bit of reading, but not an unreasonable amount. Most is quite enjoyable, and almost all is unusually well-written. The papers are very reasonable in number and length, and rather fun to write. Daniel (the teaching assistant) was exceptional. He devoted more time, thought, and effort to this course than I have ever seen a teaching assistant devote before. Section with him was fascinating and a pleasure to attend. His comments on papers were thoughtful, helpful, and insightful, and grading was very reasonable. In sum, if you have any interest in philosophy or politics, take this course. You'll see the very best of both.",
    "This class actually doesn't read a lot of Rawls, but it does read a LOT. You start out with a big chunk of Theory of Justice, and then move on to a lot of other philosophers going back and forth about the issues therein. If you're a big philosophy nerd, it will be exciting to take a class with Pogge. If you're not the lectures will be fine, though not really gripping. The class is full of a lot of YPU boys who like to argue for a long, long time. If you're looking for philosophy to apply to another field, this might not be the best class for you.",
    "fantastic. wonderful Professor, fascinating syllabus, and a terrific format when we took it - a small lecture with plenty of student interaction but also plenty of instruction from a professor.",
    "I want all of my yale classes to be like this one. It covered the major texts in an intellectual debate that is relevant to any one living today. The lectures were oriented around simplifying the texts.Pogge is not the most dynamic lecturer, but he is straight to the point, clear, occasionally humorous, and humble. The pros far outweigh the cons.The class was small as a large seminar, yet i didnt have to listen to my peers make comments for the sake of it as goes in section. instead, they got to interact with pogge when they had something really good to say. a good balance, which requires a casual setting that pogge created"
