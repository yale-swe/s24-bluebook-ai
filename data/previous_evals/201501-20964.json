   "comments": [
    "The class is an introduction to the physics principles that underlie a variety of biological processes and phenomena. I would recommend the class to another student, because I think it is a useful additional perspective for understanding biological problems.",
    "Would recommend for one with a fairly developed background in matlab and interested in",
    "Interesting course that covers a lot of important topics in biophysics. Even if students have the corresponding knowledge, the course allows them to think in a different perspective, whether if they have a background in biology or physics. More theoretical \/ coding based, but somewhat relaxing.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in doing modeling work. If programming is not your thing, I would expect this course would be tedious and unpleasant at best. That said, if you wanted to learn programming, this course would be a great \"trial by fire\" way of getting your hands dirty with matlab.",
    "I would totally recommend this course. Specially for someone who enjoy's coding.",
    "Computationally heavy class but overall I found that beneficial which is why I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody who is interested in simulating biophysical models in molecular biology or biochemistry.",
    "If you are interested in biology or materials science from a computational\/simulation perspective, take this! Make sure you are familiar with MatLab beforehand.",
    "yes. good. should know physics to really get alot out of it",
    "I would recommend the course because I think that the course material is interesting and covers a nice range of biophysical questions. It serves as a very effective introductory course to biological questions that can be answered using different tools."
