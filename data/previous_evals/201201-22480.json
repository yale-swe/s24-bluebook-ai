   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if your interested in clinical psychology. As someone who wants to become a clinical psychologist, this class was really useful in giving me a taste of what it would really be like. Also it just educates you about health behaviors, all of which some of us have bad ones and you can learn something about yourself in the class. Especially through the self-change project which got me to go running 3 or 4 times a week which is a miracle in of in itself. I would definitely take it again if I had to make a choice.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend the course if you're lucky enough to get in. I can't stress how nice it was to learn something applicable to everyday life. This class taught me how to be approachable and conducive to open discussions; it taught me how to control and change unwanted health behavior; and it taught essential bedside manner for anyone interested in going into a medical profession.",
    "This is definitely the course to take if you are considering pursuing a health or doctoral profession. The skills and information you learn and practice in this course are very useful for you in the future. Don't pass the chance up if you get selected (your admittance to the course is application-based).",
    "Health Psychology was a very good course. The topic of Health Psychology is very interesting and I learned a lot over the course of the semester. I would recommend this class to a peer who is interested in the psychology behind patients in the clinical setting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in health behaviors and clinical psychology. Dr.Toll is an amazing psychologist and he leads a very interesting and interactive lecture. The course is not too rigorous and overall was just very enjoyable and applicable to everyday life.",
    "good intro to health psychamazing health change projectstudy for tests",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE (if you can get in)! So many fantastic lectures by Dr. Toll and the teaching assistant Kevin, as well as plenty of fascinating guest lecturers that Dr. Toll brings in. Workload is not too bad, only the final paper is the heaviest amount of work, which is not too bad actually because Kevin was able to read drafts of our paper. Tests are very specific though, so study well and know your facts. If you work hard and show a genuine interest in this material, you will enjoy the course and do well. Also, just a note, this is a great class for premeds who want to appreciate the social aspect of medicine because we learn so many skills that a doctor or health psychologist uses on a day to day basis. Also, I loved the small classroom size environment because it encouraged classroom discussion and insightful reflections.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in! It is very real-world applicable, and will be particularly interesting for students looking toward clinical psychology or medicine. Workload is very manageable.",
    "This is a relatively low workload course that has interesting, relevant lectures. Definitely find out about the self change project before taking the class. It is what you put into it, but it's a very big part of the course and you have to be prepared to put at least some work into it.",
    "This is a very good course if you want learn CBT but it does not provide many other frameworks in which to address health issues. It is an enjoyable and relaxing course and teaches you personal skills.",
    "Material related to health psychology, which applies to everyone's lives or at least to a relative. Scientific papers and textbook, guest lectures",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any of my fellow students. Most of the classes I have taken at Yale are heavily theory-based, and there are few opportunities to practice what has been learnt. On the other hand, what makes this class unique is its pragmatic character, because the student have constant opportunities to practice both the interview techniques and patient interaction skills presented in class through interactive case studies and role plays.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It was one of the best psych classes I've taken at Yale. The class is very hands-on and not boring at all. There are a lot of role plays and most of the classes are discussion based. The self-change project is a great experience. Also, I learned valuable skills about patient interaction that I feel like I will actually use as I head off to medical school."
