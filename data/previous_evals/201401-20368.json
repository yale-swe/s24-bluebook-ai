    "Didn't ever attend, read the lectures online, turned the papers in late.",
    "This course was so interesting. It touched on exactly what I was hoping it would. Karsten Harries is an amazing lecturer and teaches like no one else in the department, as far as I know. The way he draws connections between thinkers and ideas across time periods is brilliant, and is something Yale needs more of. One thing that probably made it less accessible to some people was the constant references to other thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, and Nietzsche and Descartes. That worked well for me because I took DS freshman year, and I took a class just on Plato and Aristotle last semester, but I think some people didn't have enough background for it. So be careful about whether you have enough philosophy background for his classes (unless it's like Intro Ethics, in which case you should be fine), but his classes are really really amazing. This is the second one I've taken at Yale, and they are the absolutely the gems of my education at Yale."
