   "comments": [
    "In History 263 I learned about Eastern Europe from around circa 1000 until 1914. An overview of the major empires, nation states, and players within Eastern Europe. Overall, a fascinating course on material I had never seen before.",
    "I went from knowing absolutely nothing about this topic to knowing more about it than any other historical period.",
    "I learned an extraordinary amount about the history of Eastern Europe so much that it felt more like I've taken a seminar than a lecture.",
    "This class covered the basic facts of Eastern European history pre-1914. It's pretty much what you would expect.",
    "The capacity to properly synthesize a lecture into notes rather than just writing (typing) down everything you hear. Prof. Snyder doesn't allow electronics in classrooms (which I love since I use notebooks always anyways), and given that he speaks tremendously fast, this is a skill you're forced to develop by the end of the class. I learned a tremendous amount about the early histories of Eastern Europe, but also about Western Europe since the class inevitably covers material that Western Europe takes part in. It also gives you so much more context to understand the political underpinnings of WWI, WWII, and much else.",
    "It serves as a survey of Eastern European history, but it more generally takes Eastern Europe as a case study for the rise of nationalism.",
    "A comprehensive and engaging education on the early history of Eastern Europe.",
    "Taking quick notes by hand.",
    "This course was outstanding. Professor Snyder does a great job at explaining the political principles that move history forward in this time period.",
    "Professor Snyder allowed us to break down our assumptions about modern politics and reconsider the national organization we have today, using Eastern Europe to dive into global history. As such, I also developed insights far beyond national histories by learning several perspectives and storylines simultaneously. I also developed the skill of critical historical thinking in a way that I had not previously experienced when studying history.",
    "I learned a lot about Eastern Europe, which was not a part of the world I had studied at all prior to the course. The class also taught me about Christianity, conversion, and modernity -- themes that are integral to understanding world history.",
    "I developed a general sense of the arc of Eastern European history with many concrete details to place on this arc.",
    "A great overview of Eastern European history from around 1000 AD until 1914. Stellar class that covered a lot of regional themes as well as broader historic frameworks for considering history, politics, and state formation.",
    "This class provides a very good overview of Eastern European history from shortly after the Roman Empire fell to 1914. It covers a lot of material and moves very quickly.",
    "Great way of viewing the connections within the story of the region's history.",
    "I gained a strong sense of the historical trends that shaped Europe from the medieval to modern period, particularly focusing on religion and the emerging nation-state.",
    "Amazing course with an amazing professor! It did sometimes move a little too quickly though.",
    "This course gives you extensive knowledge about the history, the political structures, territorial entities, culture and changing frontiers of Central\/Eastern Europe.",
    "The course has a really good scope, and you get a strong sense of the chronology and big themes of Eastern European history. The readings tend to be heavy, but they're very helpful and by the end of the course, you're a much better reader than you used to be. Also, because the course deals with a lot of pre-modern history, and pre-20th century history, you deal a lot with the topic of how ideas such as nationalism came to be in Eastern Europe, which is always an interesting topic to keep in mind.",
    "A VERY thorough understanding on East European history pre-1914. It's a lot of information so get ready to read and memorize a ton!",
    "Taking this course is a fantastic way to realise just how much people's interpretation of history can differ from what actually occurred. You get to read a ton of primary and secondary sources and think critically about why some events are viewed as deterministic and how they need not be. In addition, you'll get to learn so much about Eastern Europe and it's geopolitics, history, culture, communities, religions, societies, and economics. Prof. Snyder is one of the best lecturers ever - absolutely breathtaking lectures!",
    "I learned to manage a heavy reading load in a short amount of time, as well as gained insights into themes of the nation\/national identity and religion."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is run very well - no electronics in class, and so you need to take detailed hand notes. Snyder speaks very quickly and covers a ton of information during each class, which can be a little stressful, but overall I liked his pace.",
    "The strength of this class is Tim Snyder's lecture. He is amazing. The weakness was the mandatory sections but I think that was just because of my TA.",
    "The course's biggest strength are the lectures. Professor Snyder is extraordinarily funny and engaging, and his lectures, despite being densely packed with information, are very engaging and fun to attend. The weakness is the reading. I started off doing the reading but didn't feel like I was getting anything from it so I stopped and my performance stayed the same. Honestly the reading didn't seem to make a meaningful addition to the course experience.",
    "Strengths: very clearly organized; readings are almost always relevant (and when they aren't, it's very clear and you can skip); amazing and engaging lectures; straighforward tests and no final during reading period. Weaknesses: I love this class and can't really think of any.",
    "A lot of the readings felt unnecessary, especially when lecture would be heavily based off of the readings. The course itself is incredible though. Professor Snyder is one of the best lecturers I've ever had, and the material is fascinating.",
    "I loved this class! The lectures are great. Professor Snyder makes everything interesting. I wish we had spent more time on Lithuania and less on the Balkans, but that's specific to my interests. The reading is kind of a lot, but you should definitely do it! I embarrassed myself in section when I had to give an impromptu presentation and had not done the reading for that week.",
    "The lectures were incredible, I think the discussion sections could have been more engaging.",
    "I would have loved to write a paper about the material instead of only 3 tests.",
    "There was a general lack of survey-style readings and summaries in lecture to tie together some of the data points of the truly massive time period and geographical area this course coverts. The readings were often confusing and unnecessarily detailed (I actually did them) and when it came time to study for tests I often had to look things up online. Professor Snyder should really write a textbook for this course or at least assign some more readings that provide basic milestone dates and events. Price of Freedom, for example, was good, but some of the packet readings were way too in depth and never even touched upon in lecture.",
    "Professor Snyder is a very engaging lecturer, and his lectures always have a message that extends beyond the course's content. I appreciated that every reading served a purpose, and that there wasn't an overwhelming amount -- it made it easy to do and care about every reading. I think the course's main weakness is its overwhelming focus on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to the neglect of other parts of Eastern Europe (particularly the Balkans).",
    "The course is very strong. The readings are sometimes extremely long, but they all add to the course, so I see no need to reduce them.",
    "Really great class with great lectures, sections, readings, and general content. It's not a heavy workload and it's not a difficult class. Three midterm exams means no final and no paper, which is great too. See above for strengths. I can't think of one weakness.",
    "Some of the readings were a bit tedious, but I enjoyed most. I also enjoyed discussion sections. And Tim Snyder is an excellent and engaging lecturer.",
    "Only weakness is fact that so much of the grade is dependent on an essays only written in 30 minutes.",
    "This is a brilliant overview of the history of Eastern Europe - Professor Snyder's lectures are the best part of the course, and were constantly engaging and encouraged me to think about history and the pattern of events and movements in a more holistic way. I would have preferred the opportunity to write a paper in place of one of the midterms, since there is a lot of unfamiliar material to synthesise (particularly for the first midterm).",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its lectures and readings! Prof. Snyder is an absolutely incredibly lecture - the kind that blow your mind away every single time and leave you wanting more. The readings are a great supplement to the lectures and provide a lot of the background and nuances to the topics. The discussion sections could be improved. One thing I noticed was that there are just so many topics and issues in the class that it's impossible to exhaustively go through all of them in section. Maybe a rethink of how to approach the sections is required?",
    "Great lectures, although Professor Snyder talks very quickly and it can be difficult to keep up. The large amount of reading seemed unnecessary, as some of the topics discussed in readings were not mentioned in lecture at all."

   "comments": [
    "It's a good class, and Snyder is an entertaining lecturer, but I wish there had been more cultural history. Snyder tends to focus on the development of political philosophy and military history, which are all good things, but there was almost no cultural history, and the last month and a half was almost entirely political philosophy.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Snyder was a great professor who really enjoys what he does. He would always make snide comments during lecture, and all of his lectures were connected and provided context to the larger pictures of Eastern Europe and Europe as a whole. A great fifth credit - three midterms, section, and a map quiz (no final!) makes up all the work for the class.",
    "This class was my favorite part about Yale so far. Every single lecture was amazing. You have to take this, even if you're not a history major.",
    "Definitely! Must take! A brilliant class taught by a brilliant professor. 3 non-cumulative midterms is a great organizational structure, and you will learn so much!",
    "This is a good course if you're genuinely interested in Eastern European history or if you want to take a class with a famous professor without putting in too much work. It does feel like the majority of the students don't take the class super seriously (and section is a joke), so sometimes lecture is pitched at a lower level than I would ordinarily expect of a Yale history class.",
    "100% yes.",
    "YES, BEST CLASS AT YALE. Seriously, don't graduate without having taken this class.",
    "Everyone should take a class with Professor Snyder - easily the best lecturer I've had.",
    "Yes! I'm a Russian major, but even if you don't have a particular interest in Eastern Europe you should take this class! I particularly appreciate Professor Snyder's sense of humor and the way he tells stories.",
    "Yes. Best lecturer I've had at Yale. Make sure you can learn just by listening though; no visuals, no slides, just him talking - but Snyder's lecture is more than enough to keep your attention.",
    "Absolutely. I learned about an area of the world in a time period that I had never before explored. Whether or not you are interested in history\/Eastern Europe Professor Snyder's lectures should not be missed.",
    "Absolutely - one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes! This course was by far the best I've taken at Yale. You will not regret taking it, and the workload isn't too bad either.",
    "Great lecture, but prepare to do a ton of reading and still be confused.",
    "I would recommend this course. It offers a view of European history that you certainly didn't get in AP Euro, and Professor Snyder is an engaging and entertaining lecturer. However, I found the exams to be much harder than expected. You actually have to do the readings and really know your stuff in order to do well.",
    "Yes! I think this history is so important and this course also teaches how to think about history as a discipline in general.",
    "Yes, without reservation. It would be a mistake to not take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Eastern European history, or who just wants a taste of what makes Yale's history department so great.",
    "Yes",
    "I would strongly encourage people to take this course, but be prepared to do the reading to do well in the midterms.",
    "This course was very interesting. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer, and he makes what might seem like a less compelling subject very interesting.",
    "Yes, any students who are interested in this subject material will benefit from it! However, a lot of the success in the course depends on a student's outside work.",
    "Prof Snyder is hands down one of the best lecturers at Yale. This course is an amazing window into a period of time\/historical region that is just fascinating. Take it!",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, it was super interesting and covered a lot of material but tied it all together. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer too. The exams are just 3 50-minute long, IDs and an essay.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. You will learn about a history that you have most likely never heard of before, and with Tim Snyder's amazing lectures, it will not disappoint. BE READY FOR THE FIRST EXAM.",
    "Definitely. Consider this course even if you've never have had any exposure or interest in Eastern European history. Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer, and the way he presents the material makes it very interesting.",
    "Yes! One of my favorite courses I've taken so far!",
    "20\/10 would recommend! This is one of those classes that exemplifies the Yale experience. Fantastic lectures, engaging discussion sections, and not too heavy on the workload. I can guarantee you that this class will change how you view the world, politics, and history. And you'll learn more about Eastern Europe than you ever expected! Fantastic, incredible class.",
    "I would recommend if you have an interest in eastern European history - the material at the beginning of the course was rather slow in my opinion, but got more interesting as the semester progressed.",
    "If you want an easy class sure, but didn't really look forward to class."
