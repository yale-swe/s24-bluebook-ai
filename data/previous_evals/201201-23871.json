    "This course was heavy on the reading, heavy on the assignments with very little feedback from the professor. Much of it is focused on theory with very little practical application.",
    "I enjoyed that the course began with a philosophical justification for public health\/ development. This added an interesting dimension to the subject.The course could be strengthened if it went into greater depth and focus. There was too much overview and general knowledge. In addition, some of the materials used such as the videos were outdated. The readings were also repetitive and too long. It would also benefit if some of the readings looked at concrete examples of what is being done or could be done to address the issues raised. The Fictitia assignment was great for providing practical experience. The course would benefit from more assignments like this.",
    "The course discusses all areas of development. Very interesting course.I do wish we had less philosophical readings and more practical cases\/examples. Also, the deadlines for the ficticia case and the final paper were too close to each other. I really enjoyed the videos and the discussion about the countries.",
    "Strengths: great overview of a diversity of different issues in considering health policy; instructor is fantastic and brings a wealth of experience and thinking about these issues; projects helped us to really think like policy makers, but we also had classroom discussion in order to field theoretical ideas\/questions etc.Weaknesses: sometimes I thought that we couldn't spend as much time on some topics as I would have liked to (but this is a tradeoff for covering a lot); videos and some materials were outdated (would be nice to have some current materials so that we are clear on the present-- nevertheless, they were great tools and I appreciated the multimedia)."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0Jennifer Ruger is clearly passionate about her work but it appears that she would rather be conducting research and not teaching. She always seemed to be rushing you when you wanted to meet to talk to her to the point where you did not even want to meet with her again. Much of the feedback she gave you on your work was vague and full of jargon that really did not mean much.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0The professor is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. If she could speak more about her own work and experiences that would be interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0She was available to meet anytime and had great feedbacks for students.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Prah Ruger \u00a0The instructor was fantastic, as articulated earlier. Despite her clear expertise in the area, she was a great facilitator of discussion and was always very respectful and receptive to the ideas that were fielded in the class. It is clear that Dr. Ruger loves what she does, and her multidisciplinary way of thinking and experience made this class truly wonderful- one of the best classes I have taken at YSPH."

   "comments": [
    "A very broad look at development with a heavy focus on theory and little on practicality. It is definitely an undergraduate class.With a reduction in workload, I would recommend it.",
    "This course provides a good overview of public health as a means to development. It would be useful for a student without a background in development.",
    "A great course to take if you want to understand more about the social and political dynamics of development. It also allows you to learn more about international organizations and their role.",
    "This class is a great summary of the issues that policymakers must think about when assigning health policies. The class started off with a lot of Amartya Sen readings and other theoretical work on health and health capability. THis was then complemented by practical evidence, and towards the end of the semester problem solving."
