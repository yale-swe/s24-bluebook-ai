    "Definitely. My Korean improved more this term than ever before, and I now feel quite comfortable writing short essays.",
    "take it!",
    "It's hard and frustrating but if you're through with or placed out of the earlier Korean classes and you want to take Korean, this is what you've got I guess.",
    "You are introduced to different writing styles and a great bank of new vocabulary. I would not recommend the class if learning Korean is not your top priority.",
    "Definitely. It has improved my Korean tremendously and you really get as much as you put into it. Do the assignments, study for the tests, listen to Professor Choi in class and you will actually learn a lot. But if you don't intend to put a lot of work into it, it might not be as rewarding for you."
