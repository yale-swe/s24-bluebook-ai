   "comments": [
    "Lots of conversation, very invested and accessible teacher. Be aware, however, that Professor Seymour is a difficult grader. She is extremely willing to help students outside of class, but holds them to high standards. The online homework and textbook assignments were a complete waste of time, but activities in class were very valuable. Overall, I loved the course. Highly recommend Spanish 4 with this professor.",
    "You probably have to take it, but Seymour is awesome. Very understanding professor and grades fairly.",
    "It is very structured and I believe that the tone of the class very much depends on the instructor. Get Professor Seymour.",
    "This course is geared towards teaching spanish, meaning grammar rules, speaking, and writing. I would recommend the course if a student is looking for a great way to quickly improve spanish and learn grammar rules. The class can require a good amount of prep at some points, so the student must be willing to put in the effort.",
    "Challenging course. Much tougher than L3. But, if you don't take grades too seriously, it can be pretty fun. You get to know a small group of students and your professor pretty well and do some cool projects in spanish including historical\/art presentations, moral debates, and reading Mexican literature",
    "Similar to level three, though definitely more work. However, many of the assignments actually are meaningful and allow you to better connect with the Spanish language and Hispanic culture. As far as instructors go, Professor Seymour is a great choice. She will push you, but is very supportive and kind.",
    "It builds upon the foundation established in L3 while expanding on more detailed grammatical points. I would recommend the course."
