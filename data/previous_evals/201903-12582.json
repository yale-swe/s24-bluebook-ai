    "I received a thorough, insightful survey of historiographical changes in my field. I think this course really helped my ability to think about larger questions pertinent to the work musicologists do and see the field in a way that isn't so buried in scores and primary sources.",
    "Different historical methods for music research Drawing from a lot of different fields for their insight (anthropology, psychoanalysis, philosophy etc) Developed new ways to approach my research interests",
    "This course helped me to understand how historiography can relate to my own work. It discussed some of the issues when writing or creating histories, but it also introduced me to some of the foundational musicological literature.",
    "historiographical insights into music history, critical reading",
    "Awareness of historiographic methods."

    "weaknesses: more guidance on papers would have been nice strengths: everything else",
    "Dr. Tomlinson's understanding of the texts we read and his plan for the course were great. I do think we could have had a better experience if discussion among students was encouraged more. It was more of a lecture environment at times.",
    "Sometimes the definitions to specific terminology was not clarified, and only weeks later did I understand what specific terms mean. Having clear project aims and deadlines from the beginning of the semester would also help."
