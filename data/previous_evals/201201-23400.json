    "#1: The reading was really tough, and I'm not sure it added that much.#2\/5\/7: Jonathan and Tim are both excellent professors - and the course benefits from their combined perspectives. The material is very difficult though.#4: I think a few assignments throughout the semester would be helpful.#6: I think there were the right number of topics covered in the class#10: FES definitely needs this course - it's crucial material for everyone who is studying anything spatial (climate, ecosystems, forestry, wildlife, renewables, land conservation, etc etc etc)",
    "Assignments would have been helpful, but there weren't any.",
    "Textbooks were great. Glad to have free online resources via Yale!The professors both are willing to explain concepts to students. I wish that Tim would be a little more straightforward in his speech, because sometimes his lectures and his responses can be convoluted. He has a great amount of knowledge, and I hope he can convey that more clearly to students.The final project was very valuable for students to apply course material to their own dataset that was selected by them, and is data that interests the students. I really appreciate that we could choose our own dataset. Perhaps we could have benchmarks along the way to monitor our progress through the course? I also really enjoy how we are meant to experiment the techniques learned in the course to find out if they are relevant for our data. Even if certain techniques are perfect for a certain type of data, the process of attempting the techniques is very interesting.",
    "The course would be really valuable for someone with dataset they really wanted to work on because it is more self directed, but it is hard for other people.",
    "The course is project based with no exams and two instructors, so the slightly unusual format may not fit perfectly with the formulaic questions above."

    "I think this class would really benefit from a lab portion, the class could even be structured completely as a lab where we could follow along with the R or GIS code in the stat lab. That was by far the most helpful day in the course.",
    "It was a bit unorganized--I was unclear on what I should be doing the first few weeks, so it would be helpful to have the syllabus structured from the beginning of the semeseter.",
    "perhaps a few loaner data-sets would be helpful, in case our data is not appropriate for certain methods we're learning. Also, maybe after each topic, we could spend a class in the computer lab going over applications.",
    "Professor Gregoire's lectures are very abstract. I would have appreciated having more concrete examples.",
    "Clearer organization of topics, and clearer presentation of the concepts as opposed to the hard math of it.",
    "Tim Gregoire's teaching style - in one on one interactions Tim is always excellent, he listens and teaches very well, but not so with group teaching I feel.",
    "I wish it had a more consistent assignments throughout the semester, rather than one big project at the end. The concepts and thechniques for this class can be attained much better if we got a practice in small chunks, one after each topic."
