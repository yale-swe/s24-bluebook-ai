    "A \"must take\" for those who wish to conduct experiments was part of their research.",
    "As basic as the course description seems, anyone interested in doing psych research should try this course to clear their minds and regain their faith in the scientific pursuit of human behaviors!",
    "Don't take it if you just feel like you \"should\" or need a credit. I'd recommend it only to people who care deeply about their research being actual science. It's not always going to be super interesting or fun. In fact, it's a scary course to take-you'll probably come away from it overwhelmed with all the ways in which your research isn't true. It's a course that fills you with doubt about everything that you're working on, and exposes all its weaknesses. But on the flip side, it gives you a taste of what good science is. If you use what you learn in the class and apply it, then you can be much more confident in what you do, as well as be better at defending against the inevitable barrage of attacks that will come. Also, validity starts to look like a funny word after saying and writing it so much. So that's a negative."

   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent way to help students build their ongoing research or form a new project, and to hone their skills in coming up with better questions, designs and constructions of the research plan.",
    "See above. Basically, it was an extension of undergrad methods, but with more historical and present-day context. I'm much better at analyzing research than before. It's hard to say to what extent, but obviously a methods course is invaluable for anyone. If you apply it, you will do better research, period."
