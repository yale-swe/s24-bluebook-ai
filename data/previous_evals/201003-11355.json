   "comments": [
    "I think all the material was important for understanding empirical methods in general, and it was very clear by the end of the class why this was so. On the basis on that alone, every Poli Sci student should take it.",
    "I recommend this course to the students who have little exposure to the statistics and econometrics so far like me.",
    "I wouldn\u0092t recommend this course. I would suggest to go and take a basic stats course on any other department.",
    "No, see my answer to Question 1 above.",
    "Of course, this class is effectively compulsory for those wanting to do statistics. Through class, but mainly through personal labor, you learn a great deal, and I expect this will be an excellent foundation for 503. I think there could certainly be big improvements to the way the class is taught, however - most of all in terms of clarity.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as an introductory course that will cover some of the basics but will leave a lot of gaps in both probability theory and regression."

   "comments": [
    "Essentially left with one lesson: quantitative method, and stats in particular, matter in this discipline...and it matters a lot.",
    "Thanks to this lecture, I am now confident to start studying the econometrics in the next semester.",
    "I really need stats and unfortunately I feel like I may have to retake this course as I still no not have a grasp on the material. My sentiments are shared by at least half the class. I wish I had taken stats at the Forestry School or with a different professor.",
    "It provided some basic knowledge of statistics and regression that I will come to use in research. It didn't depeen my knowledge about the discipline too much since we only covered regression analysis and causal inference in a cursory manner."
