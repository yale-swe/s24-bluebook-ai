    "Take it if you need it. Material is kind of dry, and the course doesn't do much with application. Still, it's well-taught, the workload is very reasonable, and it's a natural extension of multivariable\/linear algebra",
    "MATH 250 was an enjoyable course, covering the main connections between linear algebra and calculus, and culminating in the powerful Stokes's Theorem. Professor Casson is a very clear lecturer, but can sometimes be a little dull at the chalk board. If you have trouble paying attention in class, you will fall right asleep. But if you're excited by vector calculus, Casson's whiteboard performance will give you a perfect set of notes from which to review. Professor Casson's tests are usually 5-10 problems, and they are typically all-or-nothing, so if you stress about grades this may not be the course for you. Overall a nice continuation of MATH 120 and 225, highly recommended.",
    "Good transition course between the easy classes of MATH 120 and 222, and the proof-based classes of real analysis and the like. (I've heard real analysis can actually be easier than 250; vectors can do some weird stuff sometimes.) Lectures were clear and instructive, exams were relatively fair (although you probably will still slap yourself for the questions you didn't get), and the homework fun (but frustrating). After this class, your mathematical maturity (whatever that means) will bloom; at the very least, you'll be able to write semi-coherent proofs. If you haven't really been exposed to proofs yet, you're in for a...rough ride, to say the least. For those doing Econ\/Math, this class will tell you if you should continue your pursuits, or just do Econ. Except for manifolds, you won't necessarily learn anything new, per se, but you'll gain a beautiful appreciation of the things you already \"know\" (i.e. Stokes' theorem, continuity, inverses, etc.)",
    "Depends A LOT on the professor. Cassons course was extremely fair, closer in difficulty to 222 than to 300. There were no difficult proofs on the exams, and the exam problems tended to resemble the homework problems (i.e. occasionally challenging but usually pretty doable). This is a good bridge math class for those who werent ready for 230\/231 freshman year but are also hoping to study mathematics at a more sophisticated level than 120. Dont be intimidated. Id also say that some of the material is fairly interesting, especially parametrizations, manifolds, volumes, exterior derivatives, and Stokes Theorem (i.e. most of the material after the first midterm).",
    "It's a fair class, but the applications and relevance of what you learn won't be clear.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this course with Casson. He isn't super exciting but he is very clear and easy to follow and his tests are fair.",
    "A great class with a great professor willing to help his students. Holding 3 office hours and a 2-hour section every week on top of the 3 classes ensures you always have help if you need it. You largely won't need them because he is a clear lecturer, but be sure to keep on top of your work! In addition, there's a peer tutor. This is a foundations class that will ultimately give you the tools you need for higher math. I would like to have seen a greater emphasis on proofs and less focus on chapter 6 (differential forms). That way, we could be better prepared for analysis. However, I definitely felt like I learned a lot. I never took multivariable calculus, but this wasn't a problem. I felt like a great, rigorous strengthening of the concepts I learned in calculus, that was less computational and more generalized. Lastly, I have heard about his harsh grading before, but his tests are fair, at least for this class. Perhaps that is because this is a 200 level course. It was his first time teaching, so no practice tests were available, but everything was still fine (well hopefully, I haven't gotten my grade back yet).",
    "The class materials are hard - don't kid yourself. Esp. at the beginning when you start doing proofs. It takes a while to get used to theoretical proof, but after a few weeks you'll get used to it. Some may say it's easy, but really though, how much of the concepts did the truly understand. (Or may be they're geniuses which Yale seems to be abundant of). After the second midterm, things get confusing fast, and you have to read through the textbook many times to understand the concepts clearly (the textbook is a gem btw, very sassy and a great read, which is rare in a math book). You can probably pass the final without really understanding the material, because Casson knows it's confusing too, but I wouldn't recommend that. The exams are fair though, and Casson isn't as mean as some people may say. The workload is very manageable, but when it comes to exams, it's stressful, because most of your grades ride on two midterms and one final.",
    "If you are taking this for the math major, you know why you're here. It's a fine course under Casson, but not fantastic. Really liked the textbook. The problem sets and exams were pretty reasonable. Really interesting material, great way to combine what you have learned in linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. Exterior derivatives and a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus is really cool, and very interesting, especially for applications to Physics. Casson is dull, but precise.",
    "It's a required course for my major. I would never recommend that anyone take it that doesn't think they will need it for something else. It's such a mechanics focused class, it's really hard to think that someone would take it for it on it's own.",
    "I recommend this course for math majors. This is a must take if you want to go further in math.",
    "I imagine you only take this is you have to. The class is quite computational, despite claiming to be proofs based. Especially after the first midterm, there is very little to do but understand which formulas apply when. Casson obnoxiously expects you to write the exact theorems you use on the exams, but otherwise not too bad.",
    "Take it if you must",
    "It covers the things it's expected to and Casson's not a bad lecturer. However, your problem sets go out into a great void and all that returns is cryptic comments and grades, no problem set answer keys. Just a warning.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. Gotta work hard though",
    "A continuation of math 120. If you like calculus and linear algebra, definitely take this class!!",
    "I would recommend MATH 250 to another student if they want a nice culmination to their studies in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. It is an interesting subject, and I think Professor Casson did a strong job of teaching it.",
    "MATH 250 is a great way to really understand multivariable calculus through linear algebra, and this makes the calculus applicable in any number of dimensions and much more useful in the 2 or 3 dimensions of most applications. There was a fair amount of work in this class, but it is definitely manageable and much less than the workload of MATH 225. The two midterms were five questions over the course of three hours (they never took that long, but the time was appreciated), the weekly problem sets were a handful of problems at or above the difficulty of the tests, and the final was similar to the two midterms. I do believe that the final carried too much weight in the grading (50% of the final grade), but I thought the test was fair. Prof. Casson was a nice and patient man, even if some of the lectures were a little dry. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in any type of math, especially linear algebra or calculus.",
    "A poorly taught, too slow class with a boring lecturer. If you have to take it, you have to, but don't expect the class to captivate you."
