    "Strengths: Abhishek is the best and most engaging CS lecturer Ive ever encountered at Yale. You can feel that he genuinely cares about the class, the students, and the material. The lectures proceed in extremely intuitive ways, and I would recommend taking any class with him. I had absolutely no interest in hardware before this class, and now Im like, its pretty interesting!! Also, I actually got feedback on my code that was submitted for homework, which has never happened to me at Yale before (and Im a senior). The TA actually read through my code and gave me specific comments on what couldve been improved. Weaknesses- the concepts taught in class were not super well translated to the homework (LLVM programming), because there was so many auxiliary components in LLVMs implementation of algorithms taught in class.",
    "The workload of the course didnt hit for a few weeks which made it a bit hard to plan for during shopping period. The assignments were also occasionally a bit hard to follow",
    "I really liked the programming intensive assignments. I appreciated how much we got to get our hands dirty so to speak. While they were not my favorite, the written assignments did help to solidify the concepts in my head",
    "The computer architecture material was taught very well, and I haven't seen any other classes in the department that cover this material in anywhere near the same level of detail. Despite the depth and breadth of the content covered in half a semester, all of the lectures felt very accessible to a CS student with no prior background in computer arch or EE. It would have been nice to have some more hands-on assignments to work with some of this material, but I understand that next year's iteration of the course will include more of these assignments. The compiler content was also interesting, but it felt very secondary to the architecture ideas. We only had time to cover a handful of ideas in compiler optimization, and it felt like the pace of the course slowed down considerably in the second half of the semester. The compiler assignments were challenging and offered a good hands-on introduction to working in LLVM."

    "Absolutely. Abhishek is a gem and his attitude alone can move mountains. This area of CS is also rather neglected in our department, since we dont emphasize an EE or computer engineering component to the CS major.",
    "Absolutely. Id recommend this course to any student with an interest in low-level computing",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the way compilers and architecture works in modern computers, take this course.",
    "Absolutely yes. I found the architecture material to be very interesting, and one of a few areas within CS that is relatively challenging to self-study because of how dominated it is by industry. The assignments familiarize you with the LLVM codebase and are generally well organized. That said, take note that future iterations of the course will likely be much higher workload than the class offering this year, so expect the workload rating of the course to go up considerably."
