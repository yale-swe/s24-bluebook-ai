    "First Half: extremely rigorous, fast paced, and thorough introduction to the nuts and bolts of microeconomic theory. A lot like real analysis in that you build up from the absolute basics (choice rules, preferences, and utility representations) the fundamentals of decision theory (classical demand theory, utility and profit maximization, aggregation, choice under uncertainty). I got a lot better at writing economics proofs, which actually vary a lot from pure mathematics. I also have much greater intuition for why certain assumptions are made and how mathematical assumptions and economic assumptions are intertwined. Finally, I picked up a lot of extra math skills and theorems (separating hyperplanes, convexity ad infinitum, and weakened notions of continuity, to name a few). Second Half: less rigorous, but still fast paced, introduction to general equilibrium theory. Similar to the first half, started with the very basics (exchange economies) and worked through lots of different models (Arrow-Debreu, Radner, models with incomplete markets, OLG, etc.) I enjoyed the contemporary knowledge that I gained from the end of this half of the course, especially on topics like bankruptcy and collateral.",
    "Understanding of core micro",
    "unclear",
    "Ability to make proofs, and thinking deeply about problems. Problem sets are challenging and deep.",
    "Nice introduction to micro theory, good grounding (especially first quarter) in fundamental topics.",
    "Lots! This was my first rigorous look at the connection between choices, preferences, and utility, as well as the most in depth I have gone on the foundations of supply and demand. This was also a good look at general equilibrium and asset pricing.",
    "Mathematical skills, few new economic concepts"

   "comments": [
    "The amount I learned in this course can't be understated - I learned more in one semester than I did in all of undergraduate microeconomics. One of the key strengths of the course is how it builds on itself - everything you learn in the first quarter is useful in the second, and each quarter builds up from the very basics (assuming no prerequisite economics knowledge). That said, the problem sets for the course were absurd (especially in the first quarter). I typically started working on each problem set several days before it was due, only to be up until 3:00 AM on Wednesday night\/Thursday morning putting the finishing touches on the 15+ pages due for the week. This got better as the semester went on, as the material got slightly easier and more computational, but it was still a hassle. Some problems could certainly be removed from each week's problem set.",
    "This course is a good introduction to graduate level microeconomics, so it serves its purpose. However, the problem set workload is extremely high and it is not entirely clear to me that this was all necessary work.",
    "Exhausting to do the problem sets for this course. Some might say inhumane.",
    "explanation of relevance to empirical research (if any?) would be greatly appreciated",
    "Strength: course is broad and deep. Weaknesses: problem sets are fundamental to learn; but they are too long. There is a lot of material to absorb, and I feel I could go deeper if I didn't have to spend my entire time doing problem sets.",
    "I thought the first half did a very good job of introducing \"proof-based\" microeconomics, and, while very difficult, I really enjoyed it. Maybe there could be slight focus on quality over quantity wrt the problem sets. In regards to the second half, while I personally found the content more appealing, I really did not enjoy how disjoint the lecture material was from the problem sets and exam questions. The problem sets generally felt at most marginally harder than the problem sets I had done at undergraduate level, in fact, it seemed to me as if some of the problems were even identical. In general, for both parts, I think it would have been more useful for me to have shorter, but conceptually (not mathematically) harder problem sets.",
    "Slides and lectures could be adjusted to more carefully distinguish core topics from extensions. Problem sets a little long, often needlessly.",
    "Somewhat more engaging lectures could have helped. But the materials provided (textbook, lecture notes, and slides) were high quality and very useful for learning. It also would have been nice to receive a bit more feedback on problem sets, but I understand TAs are busy."

    "This class felt like it lasted a full year and was easily the hardest of the first-year courses (and probably the hardest class I've ever taken). You'll enter this class as an economics novice and come out as a fully automatic analytic weapon, thanks to the gratuitous amount of homework problems and material you'll work through in just four months. With all that being said, it's definitely worth taking. The material is essential for economics, and even if you're not doing a PhD, it makes you so much smarter with the critical thinking the course requires.",
    "Yes, useful if you haven't had heavy exposure to micro before",
    "Required for Econ PhD so yes.",
    "Absolutely yes. Challenging but beautiful course.",
    "Yes. Overall good intro to micro theory, nice way of hitting the necessary material while offering larger context.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing a PhD in economics, because it is required for the PhD in economics.",
    "Yes, only Grad level course which gives an introduction do decision and firm theory as well as GE, so necessary for any aspiring economist"
