   "comments": [
    "If you can understand that more than half of what J.D. McClatchy says is not actually serious and he likes being as offensive as possible, and you really like opera and literature, definitely take it. It's only a lot of reading every week and a final paper. Not the most academically rigorous, but the reading is interesting. Plus you might get a free trip to the Met!",
    "Incredible class. McClatchy is brilliant and hilarious. Great only if you are an opera fan.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have any interest whatsoever in opera, music, libretti, or literature. J.D. McClatchy is terrific if very unconventional, and makes the course what it is. Also, the course packets are wonderful and provide libretti that you really would not be able to find elsewhere with much ease, should that make a difference.",
    "Yes. But on one condition - you should only take this course if you will keep up with the operas. It really isn't that difficult...all Yale students can use a utility through the University Library called \"Opera in Video.\" This database has most operas you will cover in the class, and this is - by far - the best homework at Yale. Also, pick Professor McClatchy's brain...he's a seriously smart dude and loves telling stories.Really, a must take at Yale.",
    "The Opera Libretto is a class in which you'll study opera libretti from Mozart to Britten and how they are adapted from original texts to form a dramatically acceptable opera. I would recommend this class to any student interested in opera. Having a profound understanding of the words of what one is listening to can aid in enjoying the work more. You also get to go to a trip to the Met and take a tour backstage!",
    "A great survey of opera that focuses on the oft-overlooked talents behind the opera: the librettist. What makes a good libretto& how it must be in symbiosis with the music are fascinating discussion topics each week. Awesome course that also refers to many opera DVDs to analyze what works in performance. Take this course if just for the exposure to Prof. McClatchy's hilarious and intriguing anecdotes, as well as a possible trip to the Met and\/or a discussion with famed librettists.",
    "Yes!",
    "I really enjoyed the first few classes, and would recommend shopping the course just to garner a little knowledge about Opera and hear J.D. McClatchy's cool stories. However, the class became nothing more than J.D. McClatchy's cool stories and he learned almost nobody's name in a class of 12 students, which was ridiculous. It was really frustrating, and while I enjoyed the librettos I wished we could have actually gone into the process and a real analysis rather than just voicing superficial opinions about the characters and criticizing the physical appearances of various actors and actresses that played them (a long portion of one course was spent discussing whether a certain opera singer's mouth was too big to not be distracting). However, I enjoyed writing my final paper and had no trouble filling the requisite 20 pages really delving into an opera."
