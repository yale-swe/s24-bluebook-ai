    "I don't know exactly, but I got the sense we often deviated from the syllabus, and it seems homework assignments were entirely forgotten. Perhaps we can blame snow days for some of that, but homework assignments are very helpful for me actually learning the material.",

    "Alan did a good job making the course material relatively entertaining. He also kept everything in perspective relative to our industry, which is easy to get lost on given the amount of equipment that is designed and marketed for industrial use.",
    "Lots of hands on examples is a must for this class. It was great to actually pass around different parts during class.",
    "Mostly great. Show and tell is very helpful. The handouts are always well-prepared if sometimes out of date. The ones with some introduction, explanation, or synthesis are awfully helpful. I find that if I took too long taking notes or inspecting whatever was being passed around and therefore missed a second of two of catalog page explanations, I was completely lost."

    "Alan sources material and handouts with the aim of building a good binder that is useful moving forward in this field. I felt that the notes I took along with the handouts will be a good guide when I do hydraulics and pneumatics in the future.",
    "I'd prefer more actual work, either in labs or in homework. If I don't have to work through the material or put something together myself, I don't actually learn the material. You know - I hear, I forget, I see, I understand, I do & understand."

    "While I have not yet needed to design a hydraulic or pneumatic system in production, I feel confident that I could successfully design and execute a system in either flow medium.",
    "I feel WAY more comfortable incorporating pneumatics into productions, and also feel some familiarity with how to start the process for hydraulics. At least the math would make sense to me.",
    "This class, in addition to teaching me how to design systems, taught me that the complexity of hydraulic and pneumatic systems should not be taken for granted.",
    "Pneumatics more than hydraulics. While I get the big picture considerations of hydraulics, because we didn't actually put a system together, or even hypothetically on paper have to spec the parts, I doubt I'll remember much of it by next year. The reference material will still be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was great. One thing that the course lacks is an in-depth, hands on hydraulics project similar to the end of the year pneumatics project. I understand that time is limited and hydraulics is often difficult\/time consuming. However, I feel that the educational benefit would be well worth the time, especially if an entire system needed to be designed, parts pulled, assembled, tested, and presented.",
    "The final project is wonderful. The course is presented well. It was a great class.",
    "The summary is that I would like more hands-on components. Following along as Alan puts together a system or does flow-rate math is helpful, but until I have to do it myself, I won't really get it, and sadly this program doesn't allow free time to spend hours mucking around to make an optional lift, or whatever. A few more labs would have gone a long way, though I'm not sure what fits into an hour without losing all the time to clean-up, etc. that said, I always had a very nice time in class.",
    "More projects or labs would be nice. I really enjoyed the hands on aspect and being able to ask questions about what we were doing is when I learned the most.",
    "I really like Alan's handouts and PowerPoint presentations.",
    "Great class. I feel like this evaluation was supposed to be for Hydraulics and Pneumatics, but it says Physics of Stage Machinery on top. Either way both classes were very informative. I appreciated the final project in H & P, as it enabled me to get my hands on some automation that I wasn't able to do in production assignments.",
    "Yet another FANTASTIC Alan Class. This is why I came here."
