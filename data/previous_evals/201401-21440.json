   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to everyone. Learning how to acquire and analyze data is useful for any field. The class teaches you to appreciate the capabilities of GIS.",
    "EVST 290 is a LOT of work. It is not an introductory course. Make sure you want to put in the time and perhaps have an idea of a project for a final project.",
    "This class is very useful for anyone looking to learn the basics of ArcGIS in a formal setting. I would recommend it for anyone who has an outside project requiring arcGIS or for whom the program will be useful in a layer career.",
    "I'd say do it if you want to learn GIS, but don't expect it to be a great class. I took it Credit\/D and I'm really grateful for that. If you are just curious about GIS and don't really care one way or another about learning it, don't take this class.",
    "If you are thinking about doing research that has a spatial element, I would highly recommend this course. You will walk away with a tangible skill that you can apply to your own research, or market to future employers.",
    "I would advise against going into this class just because GIS sounds cool. Your grade is based entirely on your final project, so if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do for it, you might find yourself stuck.",
    "I would suggest this class if you really need GIS skills for a job application or if you are interested in working in GIS. I would not suggest this class just as an extra random, possibly interesting, class. If you are not invested in learning how to use the program and spending lots of time on it, you will just get frustrated and hate it. If the skill is important to your future use and job prospects, I would definitely recommend it. I would also recommend supplementing with Stacey Maples' GIS workshops.",
    "Yes, although if you have more time at FES than I did, I think you might want to take the two graduate-level courses instead.",
    "I would absolutely recommend EVST 290 if you are willing to handle the workload. Dana is very clear about the time commitments he expects each week, and the class is selective to get into, so I felt that people who dropped the course deprived other students of learning a truly fascinating subject matter in depth."
