   "comments": [
    "I improved my research skills, learned how to ask insightful questions of the text, and learned how to organize arguments.",
    "Through taking this class, I definitely have noticed improvement in my ability to formulate arguments and creating sturdy supporting evidence. Due to some very good advice and pointers, I was able to improve my writing style and my method of presenting cohesive arguments.",
    "My analytic writing was definitely improved after taking this course. I learned how to engage with sources and respond to those sources thoughtfully in essays. I grew more confident in my analysis skills, as well as my writing skills overall.",
    "I learned so much from this course, about the specific topics, but also about writing in general. It is a very valuable course in improving and directing your writing skills and one I am very glad I took.",
    "This course forced me to revise my work, which I was initially highly uncomfortable doing. In the end this led to me making sharper claims and writing clearer prose."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course include the subject matter and the focus on understanding and critiquing arguments. One weakness of the course was that the discussions were sometimes a little slow and participation in class movie nights was sparse. One area for improvement is to maybe have one presentation day where everyone presents their research paper briefly and discusses the parts of their research they found interesting.",
    "Overall, the course was very satisfying. I came into the course expecting a higher emphasis on analyzing film techniques, but the emphasis on the system of Hollywood and how it historically operated was a bit of surprise. However, I was nevertheless extremely interested\/engaged with the material, revealing to me a new interest that I hadn't considered before. The course obviously benefited from a great professor who was able to guide discussion, offer helpful and revelatory advice, and just be engaging in the classroom. There weren't any noticeable weaknesses.",
    "I enjoyed that this class was very engaging and it was built heavily on the students. The course was not rigid; it adapted to each of us and each of our preferences and thoughts.",
    "There were definitely a lot of readings, but were all interesting and necessary to the course discussions. It also is an additional time requirement to be able to watch movies throughout the semester, but is still an enjoyable experience. Discussions were very in depth and thoughtful."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I felt as if I learned a lot about not only Hollywood and filmmaking but also how to formulate arguments and engage with sources. Professor Brower was always available to answer questions. I felt as if I learned a lot about writing and research by meeting with him one-on-one and discussing my writings.",
    "Yes. While the course is indeed somewhat challenging and abstract sometimes, anyone putting in effort can easily see the merits of taking this class. The information is unique and interesting and the more thorough exploration of how film evolved over the years is very interesting to regard. I would recommend this class to anyone with a passion for film",
    "I enjoyed this course for its content and writing requirements. I enjoyed the topics and readings, and I loved the professor.",
    "Yes I would. It is very helpful for learning how to write well and was an enjoyable course."
