   "comments": [
    "For a number of reasons, this is a very solid class. First, the workload is very manageable. Each week, we had a modest amount of reading from some Latin text drawn from the third, fourth or fifth century. One student would present on the week's reading, with helpful interjections from Prof Matthews and a general discussion of points of historical importance. At the end, everyone produced a fifteen page paper that was essentially a write-up of their own presentation. There were no exams. Second, the class is accessible to students with various levels of familiarity with Latin. Some people in the class were graduate students in ancient history, others first-semester freshmen with a high school background in Latin. Expectations were adjusted accordingly. Third, the seminar was always relaxed, and Prof Matthews himself is very friendly. If you need to get your ancient history requirement done, whether for the classics major or the history major, this class is probably the way in which to do it.",
    "So, I came into this class wanting to get Yale's pain in the rear language requirement out of the way. I was fuming for weeks during the summer that I had to waste time with a language. I took 4 years of mediocre Latin in high school and didn't think that I'd be able to get through an L5 Latin course as a Sophomore. Then I found this absolute beauty of a class. I came \"this\" close to taking three semesters of Chinese to fulfill my language requirement (god help me), but Latin 447 snatched me away from certain doom at the last moment. This class meets once a week for 110 minutes, has two general assignments the entire semester (a class-long presentation of a Latin text and a 14-page final paper, in English (again, thank god)), and caters to all experience levels. We are given a Latin text to read before each class. We are also given a translation of that text. The divide between history class and Latin class and really be placed anywhere you feel comfortable. Prof. Matthews is brilliant and funny. For anyone who took Latin in high school, Latin 447 is a painless way to jump through the language requirement loop and, if you have any interest in Roman history, the course and professor are truly fascinating.",
    "I would highly recommend Roman Social History in Latin Texts. It combines the study of the language with the study of social history, and incorporates other ways of thinking as well. I would suggest picking a text or group of texts you are really interested in, and starting to prepare for the presentation and work on the paper as early as possible, since those are the two main assignments of the course.",
    "Pretty interesting especially if this is your fifth class",
    "This class is perfect for you if you took Latin in high school but are rusty and have decided to not pursue language as much in college, since this class is almost more a history class than a language class. Professor Matthews just assigned us readings for each week, which we then discussed. The only work we had to do was one presentation on a reading and a final, 10-14 page essay. The class was very laid back and listening to Professor Matthews lecture was very enjoyable since he's an expert in his field and the class covered fascinating stuff.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a strong background in the history of the late Roman Empire and are interested in getting depth in specific aspects. Each unit in the syllabus, corresponding to one class, is not obviously related to the others, so you have to either make the connection yourself or be content to not make it. That said, it's an interesting class; you get to take your own angle on it (Professor Matthews is very accommodating to whatever your interests may be); and you gain a huge amount of detailed knowledge about your choice of topic for the presentation and final paper. The last part I found extremely rewarding.",
    "This is a fairly low key seminar. I took it not having taken Latin in a few years and never felt out of my depth. It is an interesting look at texts that most undergraduate Latin students don't look at, like gravestone monuments and inscriptions. Be aware, though, there isn't much discussion--one or two students give a presentation a week, and class is mainly them talking. Still, it's a good class, and a different point of view on Roman society than most history classes give.",
    "Latin 447 01 presents a wide range of Latin texts from the first to fifth century. Utilizing Latin documentary and epigraphic as well as literary sources readings, students will explore issues in the social and economic life of the Roman Empire. The course pays special attention to historical context rather than the syntax or style. I would definitely recommend this course for any student with a great grasp on Latin and love for ancient Roman history. While translations may be used to prepare the texts, the classes work as far as possible from the Latin. Students can enjoy learning about different facets of Roman history without being overwhelmed by unfamiliar Latin."
