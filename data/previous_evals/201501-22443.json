    "Definitely take this course. If you're taking it as a second semester senior, realize that it is a TON of work. Definitely the class I've spent the most time on in my life, but it's all worth it. Don't take this class if you like to free-ride. Everything is group-project based so you won't get anything out of it and you'll bring the team down if you don't actually care about working hard. You really do get what you put in, but you have to put in a lot to get a lot. It'll change your way of approaching problems and just thinking about life and possibilities in general.",
    "MENG 491 is a great course for anyone interested in design and solving real world problems.",
    "MENG 491 is a brilliant class. You get to solve actual problems, build things, and work in a small group of very bright, passionate people. If your group has a good dynamic, it may be the most meaningful class you take at Yale.",
    "Definitely, if you have the time to invest into the class. You have the opportunity to create something pretty meaningful.",
    "It is one of Joe Zinter's classes, so you know what you are signing up for. This class is a lot of work, but you will also build great relationships with your teammates as well as the teaching staff. If you do think you should take this course, make sure to build your semester around it. You cannot take many difficult classes while you are enrolled in this class.",
    "Its hands on and you totally get what you invest. It's the class you'll want to work on because it's such tangible engaging work.",
    "There are courses at Yale where you make stuff, and courses at Yale where you study stuff. Not many students who focus on the former get to do the latter. MENG491 is the rare bridge between the two, which makes it an extremely satisfying experience for most of those who take it. It's quite a bit of work, and the work will push you outside your comfort zone, but the opportunity to work on an interdisciplinary team to design solutions to pressing contemporary problems is 100% worth it. In addition, Joe and Bo (and the teaching staff!) are amazing educators, whose knowledge and expertise are paired with a crazy amount of dedication to the course. I've never taken a class where the professors work so hard to make sure that you have a good experience and can be successful. Be wary that in order to have the best experience, you need to place this class pretty high in your priorities for the semester. If you do so, however, you'll learn a lot about your own abilities and how you work on a team, and become close to many more amazing students.",
    "This course is really great for getting a chance to push through the design process and understand what it takes to get something out there in the world. Organizationally, it's a little crazy, since even the teaching staff don't know how the semester is ultimately going to go. But overall, it's an incredible experience and honestly one of the best group work experiences I've had at Yale.",
    "Amazing course! Great for meeting amazing people, working closely with your peers, and doing a deep dive in a field that is probably unfamiliar to youthis should be the baseline for a great Yale course. Unfortunately for Yale, this is easily top 5 classes I've taken here, and though it's hard work, it's extremely rewarding. Really try to get in junior year because then you'll have time to work on your project after class ends if you want to.",
    "Absolutely. This course has changed my outlook on engineering at Yale. It will be a ton of work but totally worth it by the end. This course will take more time than 2 of your other courses though so be careful.",
    "Take it if you get in, try multiple times. But make sure you're committed - 15+ hours a week. You learn a lot about a global issue, you learn to narrow it down, you come up with a real solution in an interdisciplinary team. This is a great class and we need more classes like this at Yale. This class involved every aspect of learning that I think is important - research on an important issue, building theoretical frameworks (for design & on how to narrow down and tackle a complex issue), working in interdisciplinary teams, and applying theory and research to real life solutions. The theoretical frameworks in particular I found really valuable. The skills I learned in this class will serve me for a very long time beyond the classroom. Bo and Joe care a lot and bring a diverse array of knowledge and experiences into the classroom. They spend an enormous amount of time into this class and the students benefit a lot from it.",
    "Amazing!!! Perfect class, even for social sciences or humanities majors. I learned a ton and the professors were super flexible about helping us progress (despite having a team without mechanical engineering experience). The class was time consuming, but if you have fun with your team it can be great!",
    "491 demanded a lot of time and dedication, but ultimately proved to be one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. 491 pushed us to not only think deeply about a big, complex real-world issue specifically the Ebola outbreak but to develop feasible, scalable, concrete solutions for it. We made high-fidelity prototypes with our own hands, which I think the whole class, especially the non-MENG majors (the majority of the class, I'm a bio major), found extremely empowering and exhilarating. This class will make you realize and truly understand the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and show you that by asking the right questions, being persistent, and taking well-defined steps (in short following the design process) anyone can transform a big abstract idea into a real, impactful solution. Bo and Joe were extraordinary instructors. Sana and Teresa were amazing TAs. The CEID is an incredible space. Our field trip to SYN:APSE and guest lectures were really enriching. The team reports were fairly time-intensive but overall a joy to write. The final presentations were a lot of fun. Lastly, I was perhaps most impressed and inspired by the students who made up the class. Take 491! Or for that matter, any class offered at the CEID. It will prove to be an extraordinary educational experience. Be prepared though to spend a lot of time on your project. Without that commitment, you will not get out of the experience as much as you should.",
    "I would recommend MENG491 to anyone who wants to do something hands-on that involves innovation, technology and applying it to developing world settings. But, I would also set expectations. The course has no budget to go to the developing world so that was the \"fatal flaw\" in not being able to really do a user-centric design process. Also, if you lack technical expertise you might find yourself struggling to contribute to your actual product. In addition, it takes a ridiculous amount of time if you're just going to try to teach yourself circuitry or coding or any of the other hands-on skills from scratch using Youtube videos, which seemed to be largely what was expected from the course instructors."
