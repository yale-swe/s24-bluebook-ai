   "comments": [
    "I learned much more about Spanish grammar, use of tenses, and vocabulary.",
    "I really developed my Spanish speaking and listening skills. I learned how to think critically and communicate about important issues in Spanish. I developed my interpersonal skills by continuously working with other people on activities and assignments.",
    "I improved my Spanish grammar and speaking ability.",
    "Learned more spanish",
    "I feel more comfortable speaking and I learned key grammatical skills. One insight I've developed by taking this course is that I need to put in more independent work to elevate my skills; this means going beyond classwork to review concepts or vocabulary that I struggled to grasp completely.",
    "Improved my Spanish (speaking, reading, writing, listening, grammar) with new grammatical structures, thematic vocabulary, and cultural activities like short stories and presentations.",
    "We covered many aspects of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. Leaving the class, I feel like I've learned a lot more about the language and culture and that I can now have a conversation with many of my Spanish-speaking friends.",
    "I improved my grammar particularly and my vocabulary a bit. I learned a number of new tenses which I can use to read, write, and speak more like an adult.",
    "I learned so much about Spanish culture and my speaking is much more polished. My confidence in my Spanish has grown a lot!"

   "comments": [
    "Teaches quite efficiently the grammar necessary, but moves very quickly.",
    "The professor is a major strength. Giseli Tordin is an amazing professor who is very skilled at engaging her students. She is very knowledgeable about spanish grammar and culture and is always willing to explain something to her students. She has countless office hours each week and is always available to help her students.",
    "Course was thorough, not many improvements necessary",
    "Strengths- Professor was high energy and very committed to preparing engaging activities. Weaknesses- Needed more incorporation of older material into current activities",
    "The course does a good job between balancing practical Spanish and culture - there is a good range of activities, like presentations, dialogues, role play, and short stories. One thing that could be improved would be to spread out the grammar\/vocabulary more evenly across the semester so that there's better retention, and to do more review of previous material learned throughout the semester once in a while in class or through the homework. For example, more review of grammatical concepts could be integrated into those activities (e.g. requirement to use x structures) so that we're applying\/connecting what we're learning.",
    "Well-organized, you know what you need to complete before every class, engaging. Nothing to be improved upon.",
    "I loved the practical components, getting the students to speak to each other. I'm worried that though we covered a number of tenses, it appears that students weren't using the latest ones in conversation after learning them, suggesting they weren't sufficiently comfortable using them.",
    "This course is great. The pacing is nice and the course forced me to go out of my comfort zone in regards to my spanish ability but I never felt like there was anything that I couldn't do. That is Amazing!"

    "I would recommend this course, particularly with this professor because she really made it an engaging experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody looking to learn and improve their Spanish - you get a good basic grasp of grammar and vocabulary, as well as culture. There are some assignments that take up more time but overall the workload is manageable!",
    "Yes. Great course with a great professor.",
    "I would, I learned a tremendous amount (and would particularly recommend Professor Tordin).",
    "Yes. This was by far the class that I enjoyed the most. I truly felt that due to the class' structure I learned so much from my peers as well as my instructor. after this course I genuinely feel like i have gained knowledge that i'll use in life and I'll honestly never forget this course. 10\/10!"
