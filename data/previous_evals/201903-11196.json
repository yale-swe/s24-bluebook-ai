    "Good introduction to the field of semantics",
    "I gained very surface level knowledge of semantics.",
    "I learned a good amount of linguistics related to how meaning is interpreted, and approached the field from a more quantitative perspective.",
    "Basic introduction to the study of meaning from a logical and linguistic standpoint. Particular topics were predicate logic, intensional logic, entailment and presupposition, and lambda conversion",
    "Standard methods of formalizing natural language into logic, and the challenges of doing so. How to attempt to address and narrow down the fuzzy syntax-semantics and semantics-pragmatics lines."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty fun course but starts off a bit messy, you start to only get things once you can draw the links later in the semester, which is normal, but it was at times hard to see the larger point behind what we were doing",
    "A weakness of this course was that after the first assignment, we stopped going over them after they had been returned. Another weakness was that the professor taught to the graduate students and senior level linguistics instead of those with little to no prior linguistics experience, even though she said this course was open to all levels.",
    "While the material was generally engaging, at times it was dense, and more varied lesson plans, i.e. activities utilizing the topics, would have been beneficial.",
    "Professor Dayal was a good lecturer, and in general the classes were well-structured. As a linguistics major with no background in formal logic, I did find certain concepts confusing at times, but the handouts given out in class were generally helpful.",
    "As a humanities major, there were a lot of concepts from the wider world of linguistics that flew over my head, and though most of the time, I was able to glean what I needed to from classroom discussion, I sometimes felt out of my depth.",
    "The core material progressed very linearly and systematically. However, a lot of the more interesting topics we addressed in our readings and tangential class discussions felt disconnected from the main part of the course. Perhaps it is jut the nature of semantics that this core material must be mastered before more technical work on the bigger questions can be attempted, but if possible that would have been preferable."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are already interested in semantics",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student with a background in linguistics. It is not a course to take as your first introduction into semantics, even though it advertises itself as such.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to learn more about a core area of linguistics or a moderate-difficulty QR credit.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone looking for an introduction to semantics and the formal study of meaning. For linguistics majors, I would say that this course is a bit different from courses like phonology and syntax, given that a lot of it defining logical, quasi-mathematical models for computing meaning, but it's interesting overall.",
    "If you're familiar with predicate logic and relatively comfortable with mathematical formalisms, then it shouldn't be the toughest QR.",
    "I personally did not appreciate semantics very much, which I think has more to do with the field itself than this particular class. So I would not recommend it to someone unless the idea of mapping natural language to first order logic sounds particularly exciting to them, except in order to get a fairly non-demanding credit for the linguistics major."
