   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend really making sure you like the language before committing to it.",
    "Take this class, especially if it's with Professora Vanessa. It's not an overwhelmingly hard language, but do expect to put a fair amount of work in. This class is incredibly vibrant and fun to be in--part of this is due to who your classmates are, and a large part of this is due to the professor's enthusiasm. From just having taken a semester, I can converse in Portguese (albeit at a slow pace and in rather simple words). The class moves fast and covers many topics, but you do really emerge with a good working ability to speak and write Portuguese and some cultural knowledge about Brazil too. Highly recommended.",
    "The instructor began using strictly Portuguese after the first day. She answered all of my emails about the class in Portuguese. She does not work with her students to be flexible. I do not recommend taking this class with Prof. Cunha.",
    "It's a great intro course to the language. My knowledge of Portuguese really increased, and my speaking skills and confidence increased dramatically! I wholeheartedly recommend it!",
    "Definitely take it - just not with Vanessa. Marta seems great.",
    "A good class to take if you are looking to learn a probably new language.",
    "This is a great class for undergraduates, especially if you have never taken a romance language at the advanced level. It moves at a relatively slow pace and the instructor runs a really good classroom. I would not recommend it for Spanish speakers because of the slow pace. Unfortunately, Yale does not currently have any other options for Portuguese however, so it is the only option for Spanish-speaking graduate students."
