   "comments": [
    "Good!",
    "Pretty low pressure. Some topics are more interesting than others but you get through. He tries to give anecdotes to make the class more fun.",
    "Seems a bit disorganized at times and the homework assignments don't always line up with the lectures.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and provided lots of good information. But the lack of fundamental knowledge became a huge problem for the first year students as me. As I know, many students did not take any clinical trails class before.",
    "I thought the course was an extremely interesting to the idea and practice of clinical trials",
    "Strengths:-Nice overview of issues relating to clinical trials-Incorporated topics relating to health policy, biostats, and study design-Required text was very readable-glad I own it now!-Excellent TA and instructor (see below)Weaknesses:-Class size was too large, preventing discussion on potentially interesting topics-powerpoints\/lectures were not well organized and often repetitive-Overall, a lot of overlap with Survival Analysis (BIS 630b)and Design of Epi Studies (BIS 632b). I'm not sure why my degree program required me to take both?!Areas for improvement:-Provide more \"real world examples\" in class and in homework reading to apply concepts-Either limit class size or have discussion groups to allow for more discussion on topics",
    "The homework assignments were helpful for practicing the concepts learned in class.",
    "Great course. Very helpful.",
    "The materials are very interesting and helpful.The lecture is too long that is more than 2 hours. It was hard to focus on every min.",
    "good",
    "This was a nice overview of the major principles of clinical trials. A lot of the material was a review of things we learned in Biostatistics II and Epidemiology II, but it was helpful to learn that material again. Overall, it was a low-key and low-stress course and I feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "Very informatve",
    "The second half of the semester covered many models and data treatment for clinical trials which heavily involved the statistical program. However, there is no lab session for this class which make this part difficult. It's better not to cover longitudinal data analysis. One lecture doesn't help that much.",
    "This course was very interesting, but during the second half of the course, I do not think the professor explained the mathematical components of the course at all; I think he assumed we knew it. This was very confusing to figure out for someone who is not a biostatistics student.",
    "very good coverage of topics in clinical trials.",
    "The class and instructor are nice but the class materials (presentation slides) are not well organized especially for quantitative theme.",
    "Strengths - interesting material, good TA, not that difficult of a course at all, only once a week, good professor with interesting personal anecdotes, easy homework, open notes exams, interesting guest lecturersWeaknesses - didn't feel challenged, did not feel like i learned half as much during the second half of the semester, lectures were very repetitive and did not get a lot out of themImprovements - we should go over in class how to do what we learned to do in SAS code in hand-written form. When it came time to study for final exam, I did not know where to start. We were not using SAS during the final, but we had to do it by hand - I had to go to the TA to learn all of this.",
    "The course is great! A lot of useful examples and good explanation of key concepts.",
    "The content is flexible, and you can learn a lot if you are interested in Clinic Trials",
    "The strength of this course was the weekly homework assignments. They really helped me to understand what was being taught in class. Overall I learned a lot from this class and I really appreciate how Dr. Makuch explained what goes on in clinical trials from his personal experience.",
    "Didn't learn very much.",
    "Lectures are interesting, but not clearly that useful for people who are not interested in the process of clinical trials. Survival analysis is useful, but taught in many other classes. Does not seem like it should be a required class.",
    "This course could be improved with clearer lectures. The topics seemed to skip around quite a bit. While studying for the final it was helpful independently compiling pieces of information about survival analysis over the last 4 lectures. It would have been much easier if each piece of the topic was throughly and completely discussed, rather than bits and pieces that need to be gleaned from the slides over multiple lectures.",
    "Very informative, at times too detailed and hard to grasp concepts.",
    "New knowledge provided in this course is very limited beyond Epi I and II. Being a course from the stats department, it might be better for this course to give more emphasis to statistical methods used in clinical trials",
    "I really like this course and the content is very applicable for my career interest.",
    "Since it is a BIS class, I expected it to focus more on the statistical elements in clinical trials. However, the professor actually spent a lot time talking about ethical issues and regulatory issues. I don't think I learned as much skills as I expected from this course.",
    "excellent",
    "The course is taught by an extreme nice professor who wants everyone to do well. This course is great for those who have an extensive mathematical background. But the overall course was poorly taught. I had to rely upon the help of others who were free to go to the TA sessions or those who has previously seen the material to learn what was going on.",
    "Strenght: real world examplesWeakness: too much statistics",
    "Some slides were a little confusing when trying to do the math\/formulas.",
    "I felt I had to teach myself most of the material. A lot of the homework didn't seem to be covered in class.",
    "The concepts taught are very applicable to all public health students and physicians. The book provided a good foundation and was not too detailed to read. I would have liked the professor to explain in detail more and go through more in class examples of the math part of the class."

I really enjoyed how he used his personal experiences in the industry, as well as his knowledge of various trials, to provide numerous examples and to illustrate the complexity of the design and analysis of clinical trials.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch was excellent. His breadth of experience and perspectives were refreshingly honest. I loved listening to his anecdotes of working at the NCI years ago! The homework and exams were very clearly written and covered key topics. Dr. Ciarleglio lectured a couple of times as well- she was fabulous, as always.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor really knows what he is talking about.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch definitely knows many stories in the area. I hope he can cover more content in the text book and not just make us read it by ourselves. add some examples when talking about the calculations in Kaplan-Meier curves.Maria is excellent. the slides is well organized and the lecture is clear and coherent.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good personality.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Prof. Makuch is a great person and a pretty good lecturer. He has really funny and interesting anecdotes, and he is very very successful in his field. While he does not have time to really get to know his students well (he was nice enough to host a end of semester party for us, but left within the first 15 min), I liked him. Heis often very repetitive in his lectures and does not explain things well. He is very fair in terms of readings, homeworks, and exams. That being said, I had to rely on the TA to teach me things that I needed to know, but did not get out of the lecture.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch was very enthusiastic, and clearly has an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject.He has a tendency to go off-topic, but that keeps the lectures interesting. It's not always clear what we are supposed to get out of the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good instructor - sometimes hard to follow in class during tangents",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I love this professor! Provided very interesting stories during lecture, and gave students plenty of time and space to fully understand the material. I learned a great deal and the exams were very informative and reflective of materials taught.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor is very kind and is willing to answer questions. The main problem was that he is so smart that he didn't realize that the majority of what he taught, was dificult, especially to those who had limited maths backgrounds. There were some lectures were he barley got through teaching because he kept being interrupted by questions from students. He is very nice guy, but needs to make the class more easy to follow for those who don't have a Phd in biostats.",

A nice and relatively easy course work load-wise but repetitive if you have already taken BIS 630b or BIS 632b. If nothing else, take the course for Dr. Makuch's anecdotes from his years at NCI and serving on DSMBs.",

    "Yes, this course provides useful knowledge of clinical trails to beginners.",
    "I will recommend. This course is a fundamental one, and it is very helpful for the future public health study. I learned how to set up clinical trials and many useful statistics knowledge.",
    "I honestly took this class just because I needed a 5th class and wanted something that did not have a heavy workload or high stress level. This was the perfect class for that, and I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Intro course to clinical trial. Recommended to students who are interested in doing clinical research.",
    "I will recommend this course to student if you want to know something about clinical trials but be prepared to learn it by yourself through the assigned reading and not just listen to the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommended it to others. I learned a lot about clinical trials. Would be better if can bring people working in this field--such as FDA, pharmaceutical companies.",
    "Recommend this class but need extra self study",
    "A good biostats course for non-biostats concentration who need the course requirement. It's not a big time commitment - only once a week with easy homeworks due each week. The lecture is alright, the professor is pretty interesting and has good anecdotes. You should understand that it will take time outside of the lecture to teach yourself some things, because they're not nicely laid out in the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone interested in clinical trials or interventions research.",
    "You can take it if you have no knowledge of what clincal trial is.",
    "This was a great class and I learned a lot about clinical trials that I wouldn't have learned on my own. I highly recommend it to other students.",
    "Nice option for a stats requirement that won't crush your soul.",
    "This course provides a lot of information about how a drug goes through the process of clinical trials (focusing on stage 3) and approval by the FDA.You learn about randomization processes, study designs, and data analysis with a focus on survival analysis.",
    "Yes recommend",
    "Yes would recommend. Very informative and relevant to MPH.",
    "It is an entry-level, comprehensive course for student who has no background and knowledge in clinical trials at all.",
    "very practical and useful content if you are interested in the pharmaceutical industry, this is a highly recommended course.",
    "If you have taken Epi I and II, then this class have little to add in terms of concepts and statistical methods.",
    "If the teaching remains the same, I would only recommend this course to those who really know biostats well. This class felt very fast and didn't feel like it was a class for those with beginners knowledge of biostats. But, for those who told me they asked many questions to the professor after class, I was told that he did a good job of clarifying misunderstandings.",
    "Great easy course",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "It is helpful information I will probably use in the future to evaluate clinical trials.",
