   "comments": [
    "This course teaches some of the broader ideas in quantum mechanics as well as a lot of the math behind those ideas.",
    "This class teaches you about basic concepts in quantum computing and quantum cryptography and teleportation.",
    "builds on a lot of things you learn on in other quantum classes and it's pretty easy if youve already taken quantum. definitely important for understanding how it applies to the actual world.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to the world of quantum computing. It featured great information on both the physical realization of quantum bits, as well as a good introduction to qubit logic. I wish that we spent more time on the latter, especially since it only introduced NMR Qubits. While we had one guest lecture on Superconducting Qubits, I wish we had more time to spend on this idea, especially resonators and other related topics.",
    "I learned a lot about quantum computing (I had no background in quantum physics, though some math and cs) in theory and practice. The problem sets were cool and I actually got some intuition about quantum algorithms and the current problems faced by quantum computing researchers.",
    "Introduction to quantum physics, focusing on applications (quantum computing and information). Highly recommend for non-physics majors, a great way to get insight into quantum without taking more stressful classes (the class has no tests, which was a god send). Psets are straightforward if you can crunch through a lot of tedious algebrabasically if you're good at math this class will be really easy, if you aren't, avoid at all cost. Usually STEM classes at Yale are either really easy but poorly taught, or really hard but taught well. This is one of those magical classes that is simultaneously pretty chill while also being taught by an amazing and engaging professor. Sean is always open to any questions you have and makes complex topics easy to understand. A chill but extremely interesting class.",
    "Bra-ket notation, basic mathematical intuition behind quantum physics, basics of quantum computing",
    "This class taught a good foundation in quantum mechanics and illustrated some interesting applications to quantum mechanics. It gave a good general understanding of the potential and limitations of the field.",
    "Knowledge: Review of Linear Algebra and the math necessary to describe a spin 1\/2 system. Shrodinger and Heisenberg representation of quantum particles and their time evolution. Entangled particles. No Cloning Theorem. Bell's Inequality. Quantum algorithms, including Quantum Key Distribution (cryptography), Teleportation, Error Correction, Parity of an implicit function, and (for my final project), Grover's Search Algorithm. Notably, did not learn Shor's Factoring Algorithm. Skills: Applications of Linear Algebra, understanding the quantum behind qbits and quantum computing, and analysis of some basic quantum algorithms. Insights: Why scaling q computers is hard, what is needed for their creation, and what can we do already. How impactful are quantum algorithms (while they don't yet provide P = NP solvers, they help with factoring (Shor's) and give some still-exponential speedup to NP (Grover's)). Ironically, while quantum computers jeapordize cryptography (Shor), they also provide quantum-safe protocols for private keys, securing cryptography again.",
    "This course was an introduction to quantum computing. It also provided a mathematical overview of basic quantum mechanics, which is very useful. I now have a reasonable conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics from a mathematical perspective.",
    "I learned a lot about quantum physics and obtained a better understanding of the subject."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material of this course is super interesting and Sean Barrett is a great lecturer and professor. The problem sets were also really informative, and the only part of this course that might be improved is the journal club presentation, for which there was limited guidance.",
    "The psets are very long and heavy calculation based so you need to learn a lot of the rules and tricks for the math, but the concepts we covered in class were very interesting.",
    "it's at 9am so no one really shows up which is kinda sad but other than that it was good.",
    "The strengths and weaknesses are the same... all the information in this course is from the lecture notes that are posted online. So, it means that the lecture notes are a great review tool, but they also \"cheapen\" the effect of lecture, since not much new stuff is posed during lecture. Although lecture should be a great time for questioning, the sheer amount of stuff that we have to go over makes Q&A a very limited task. When we begin to ask too many questions, we began to fall behind on our course work. One possible suggestion is to only go over the basics of many of the topics and direct people to typed lecture notes. That way, the same content can be communicated, but in a much more condensed format.",
    "I was one of the few (~35%?) students who went to nearly every class meeting. The lectures were clear and relatively interesting, although a few of the early lectures were too low-level which caused us to speed a little too much through other material (more time spent examining a couple more quantum algorithms in detail would have been really interesting, for example; we only did that in the journal club presentations). The course is a relatively light workload, which is great (especially if you don't have much physics background); on the other hand, the problem sets involved some tedious computation. I thought that was a strength (it made the results more convincing), but some less math-inclined might think it's a weakness. The biggest weakness is that so many students don't show up.",
    "This class was amazing! A really great intro to quantum. The only problem was that we fell behind near the end and had to rush some of the material; it'd be helpful to streamline some of the material so we can get to everything by the end. Also it shouldn't be at 9 am.",
    "It's a little early in the morning",
    "The course covers some very interesting topics and the material is covered thoroughly. Possible spending more time on the material at the end of the semester (the applications) would make the course better.",
    "Strengths: The clearest weeks of class were the first two and the last two. In the first two, the professor used powerpoints and spoke at a high level about quantum systems and some interesting phenomena. He used slides and animations. In the last ~2 weeks of class and during final projects, the class came down to earth with really cool quantum algorithms. Weaknesses and Improvements: Before those two \"applications\" weeks, the course material is very abstract and one can easily get lost. Sprinkling in animations from computer would have been insanely helpful. Also, sprinkling in algorithms can give the class a sense of direction even before we've covered all the quantum principles.",
    "It is possible to get through the psets while not actually understanding the material, which I find to be a bit problematic. At times I wish I was forced to learn the material a little better than I did.",
    "The class ran pretty smoothly and it covered a wide range of topics in a way that didn't feel to fast. The only problem with the course that I can think of is that we somewhat made up the schedule as we went along and it would have been nice to know some of the deadlines in advance."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. As someone who was very interested in physics, particularly quantum, but am not a physics major and do not have an extensive background in physics, this class was extremely interesting.",
    "If you want to learn about quantum computing, teleportation, and cryptography take this class. The first half of the course is spent on basic quantum mechanics and linear algebra needed to do the cool parts so it starts off slow but is really cool towards the end.",
    "as far as Physics electives go, very very chill and pretty interesting even if you're jaded and tired of physics.",
    "If you're at all interested in quantum physics, in particular quantum computing, but don't have any formal background in physics past high school, this is a must-take. You work your way up from a classical spin abstraction for NMR all the way up to quantum circuits and quantum algorithms, and though the material is slightly boring towards the middle, the stuff at the end more than compensates. This stuff is really cool! Professor Barrett may be the nicest human being alive. He's always willing to stay behind after class to explain things, and he tries hard, both in lecture and in person, to maximize your understanding of the material. Don't be afraid to ask questions in lecture -- I wish I'd asked more. Also, go to lecture -- I didn't, and it gave me a lot of trouble towards the end. Also, if you do CS, the really good stuff is the quantum circuits\/quantum algorithms stuff. That stuff is pretty independent from the stuff in the beginning, so if you get a copy of Professor Barrett's notes, you can start studying that from the beginning. Do that, so that you can go learn more about this stuff if office hours throughout the year. Basically, you likely won't regret taking this class unless you already know the material, and even then, talking to Professor Barrett for long periods might make it worth it.",
    "This is a great introduction to quantum computing. It's not a substitute for 439\/440\/441, but instead, a great way to show the application of quantum systems. Very interesting for people who are interested in quantum computing research for the future.",
    "I think this is a great way for someone with strong(ish) linear algebra skills and interest in the subject to get a Sc credit. I took it to satisfy the BS requirement for my major, and I think it was a great fifth class. In my opinion, it is a waste of time to take this class and not attend lecture. But I guess physics students can get an easy credit for their major that way.",
    "Usually STEM classes at Yale are either really easy but poorly taught, or really hard but taught well. This is one of those magical classes that is simultaneously pretty chill while also being taught by an amazing and engaging professor. Sean is always open to any questions you have and makes complex topics easy to understand. A chill but extremely interesting class.",
    "Absolutely take this class; I'm a CS major--hadn't done any other physics courses here--and it was fine. In fact, it's perfect for CS majors; this is quantum physics with a focus on how it applies to quantum computing. Super chill, just a few psets and a presentation at the end, and Professor Barrett is really dedicated to answering questions! He stays after for ages! If you have a decent grasp of linear algebra, it should be a relaxed fifth class in which you learn a ton. You'll be comfortable with bra-ket notation by the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you have the math background (linear algebra) then it is a good introduction into quantum mechanics with applications into an expanding and exciting field. Professor Barrett explains everything very thoroughly and generally cares about the students.",
    "I would recommend this class to those reasonably comfortable with Linear Algebra without prior quantum experience (that's where I was). I'm a CS guy who wanted to know the basis of quantum algorithms and the impactfulness of quantum computing. The class set the foundation for that, and in my final project I was able to delve deeper, which I really enjoyed. The class gets a bit mathy and abstract in the middle, so go to office hours and watch YouTube videos that give visuals of these described phenomena. But cool applications are sprinkled in here and there (Quantum private key, teleportation, etc.), even before the last week which is all about quantum algorithms. As a CS guy, I was a bit dissappointed to learn that quantum computers do not give a polynomial solution to NP-complete problems (it's an open question, if someone can show they do, their funding would x10).",
    "I would recommend this course to a physics major looking for a non-intensive introduction to quantum computing.",
    "I think this is a great physics elective. The course is not too demanding but gives a solid overview of quantum physics."
