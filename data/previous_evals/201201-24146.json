    "Loved this class - great survey course of state formation and IR theory, with a lot of time spent on China, European history, and Cold War-era America. Definitely take it, it's a great intro course to IR as well.",
    "Good course, with solid classic readings and a very knowledgeable instructor. Fairly run of the mill seminar format, with an introduction by the professor, readings and discussion. A key strength, however, was the presentation of traditionally Western theories of IR in the Eastern context. Many readings were focused on China, and the rise of other poles. This definitely gave the course body and allowed for critical thinking.",
    "Take it, though if you have a background in the field the first few weeks will be review."
