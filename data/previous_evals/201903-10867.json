    "I learned a lot about econometric techniques like instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, and propensity score matching. Id taken stats, but none of the above techniques, and I got a great intro to all of them",
    "I learned to evaluate empirical microeconomic research methods and think about how to break down a broader question related to economics into a feasible quantitative study with",

   "comments": [
    "It's a nice little class to facilitate further exposure to economic literature and quasi-experimental methods. The professor is very responsive to the students' subject interests. I'd like to see a little bit more on the infrastructural side of things -- showing more of the math behind each of the research designs at the beginning of class to make sure everyone's up to speed with the analytics. That said, the class states up front that students should have already had exposure to these methods, so maybe just emphasize that guidance a bit more at the beginning of term.",
    "Its pretty interesting but maybe repetitive if youve finished second semester econometrics. Questions and class will be interesting if you put in the effort to engage",
    "ECON 481 is a very manageable senior seminar with its greatest strength being a facilitated and structured opportunity to closely read and understand economic research papers of your choosing. I came in without taking econometrics and was able to keep up with the course with just a minimal amount of supplemental reading, but I think for most others in the course who had taken econometrics, much of the content had been seen before. I appreciated the structure of the course, the first half of the semester being pseudo-lectures by the professor on foundational techniques in empirical economic research and the second half being student presentations on economic papers. The workload was super manageable, with three problem sets in the first half of the course and 2 presentations in the second half.",
    "student presentations take up too much focus of course, should be a way to engage more with material for second half of class But overall this class taught me a lot about how the benefits of drawbacks of different econometric approaches to addressing social problems"

    "Extremely low workload. Interesting material, and you can explore the topics that interest you. Cool professor. Take it as a light fifth or sixth.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn and apply econometrics",
    "I would recommend it if youre interested in learning more about how microeconomics research is done especially if youre working on a senior essay. It would also be good if you like reading Econ papers since youll be giving a couple of presentations in the second half of the class. Psets are based on class material but theres not much feedback between them. You just kind of have to figure them out",
    "Yes, Guillermo is a fun teacher. But the first half of the course won't be very useful if you've already taken ECON 117",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who are interested in empirical economic research -- while a manageable senior seminar, I'm not sure if students would find the material interesting or engaging if they weren't interested or considering pursuing\/using empirical research in the future (potentially in a senior thesis, etc.). On the other hand, if you've been seeking an opportunity to deeply and closely read economic papers on topics that you're passionate about or wanted to rigorously explore a handful of economics papers but never had the opportunity\/the discipline to do it on your own time, this class is an amazing opportunity to do that.",
    "yes, if you want to take a more seminar like approach to econometrics"
