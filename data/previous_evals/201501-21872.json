   "comments": [
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to any student interested in sharks or even more generally, fish or evolution that led to tetrapods.",
    "Who doesn't love fish? Grilled, poached, roasted or raw and wriggling, fish are great. Whether you'd rather see one on a dinner plate, preserved in a laboratory with its organs carefully labelled, or swimming happily in the ocean, this course has something for you. Prof. Near is one of Yale's hidden treasures, and is amazingly approachable and friendly for being one of the world's greatest fish nerds, besides a residential college master and a top-tier speaker. You'll not only learn great cocktail party anecdotes (hey babe, did you know there's a type of perch which has its anus beneath its mouth?) but also learn a ton of evolutionary biology which the intro bio sequence skips over. And all this for a very reasonable workload and quite lenient exams.",
    "Would highly recommend, if only for the professor - he makes it totally worthwhile, and a it's great science credit that doesn't make you feel like you're doing it just to fulfill the distribution requirements.",
    "At first ichthyology seems like a weird class to take. I ended up taking it in order to fulfill an E&EB requirement and was a bit skeptical, however, by the end of the class I'd highly recommend it! The material was engaging and Professor Near is great. I also appreciated the cross over between the Ecology and the Evolutionary Bio classes offered in the E&EB department.",
    "If you are a non-science major keep in mind that unless you have a strong background in biology, much of the terminology in this class might be foreign to you. Two quizzes, one term paper, a midterm and a final exam. The final is cumulative which makes it a pain to study for because the questions are very specific.",
    "The only reason I would say the workload of the course is greater than average is because of the high degree of pure memorization necessary for this course! There are so many orders and families of fish that you are required to know and as an audio and visual learner it was extremely difficult for me to differentiate between the different fish because I could not imagine what the they looked like. If you like fish take the course. If you like animals and think, this course would be close enough I would say it's not for you. Although professor Near is a great professor and you'll learn some cool factoids about fish, it can be pretty difficult to gain personal interest in fish. At the end of the course, I left thinking...there are a lot of different fish in the world, but if I were to go snorkeling or diving I would still probably think, look at all the pretty fish.",
    "Take this class. One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes! Great class.",
    "Yes. It is a great course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to learn about something they know nothing about. For non-science majors who have no background in biology it may be challenging but is definitely a worthwhile endeavor simply because this is such a wonderful subject matter taught by a passionate Professor.",
    "This was a great course! Prof. Near delivered engaging and well-organized lectures. All of the assignments were fair, and the two books we read were really interesting and easy reads.",
    "Of course! After I took this class, I fell in love with fish. This is one of the best course I took so far. There was so many things about this amazing group of animals and there was so much you could learn about. I had no feelings for fish at all before I took this class and to me fish was just delicious food. But after I took this class, I was amazed by the morphology, ecology and evolutionary history of fish. To be honest for the first few lectures I was very confused and overwhelmed because of the big vocabulary of fish, but later after I continued going to the lectures, many of the vocabs made sense to me because I constantly heard them in lectures. And also you could ask for Prof. Near and the TA's help. They are very helpful. Take the lab if possible. The lab definitely helps with the material in lecture!",
    "Yes, great science credit and Professor Near is the man.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a science course or even an E&EB major looking for an elective. The content was fun and interesting and Professor Near is very knowledgeable on the subject.",
    "Would recommend for an interesting science credit.",
    "Take this lecture take this lecture take this lecture. Professor Near is amazing. The exams are fair (if you study!). I wouldn't recommend the lab though; it's a lot more difficult than the other animal diversity lab courses at Yale (the standards are way higher and they expect a lot more from the students). So if you're an EEB major, take this lecture, but not for your animal diversity requirement (unless you want to take the lab for something else too).",
    "A lot of memorization, but very manageable.",
    "I'd certainly recommend this! It can be a fairly rigorous (but not painful) science credit, but is also a definite yes for those in E&EB, or really in any field related to biology or natural sciences. Very interesting lectures, focusing on broad topics and themes will using evidence and examples to provide context. Readings, 2 quizzes based on books (really interesting ones!), a midterm and a final exam, and a paper. However, all of these were really fair and not very stressful. Prof. Near is also absolutely fabulous - he makes the course as awesome as it is. He's such a fun lecturer, and clearly loves his subject and his students. Definitely take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for another student if they are just the slightest bit interested in fish.",
    "Take it. You'll love it.",
    "Take it if you love fish, or the ocean, or evolution, or animals in general. This is a great course.",
    "super hard",
    "NOT A GUT. The first 2 lectures make it seem easy. It is not. Would not recommend to non-science majors looking for an easy credit. If you do take it, the professor is great.",
    "Even without any interest in biology or fish, this class is great. The professor is wonderful, and it's not much work except for exams.",
    "This course is a great survey of Ichthyology. It goes through topics such as morphology, phylogeny, and examines different species of fish by focusing on their evolution and history as well as feeding and breeding habits. Really interesting!",
    "An excellent organismal diversity course taught by a brilliant professor who also -- perhaps even more importantly -- is a truly great teacher. This class presents a large amount of material, and you'll learn about dozens upon dozens of orders and families of fish. But in doing so, you'll gain a profound understanding of the way evolution shapes the living creatures around us, and even our own bodies. I'd highly recommend this class, though it's important to keep up with the admittedly large amount of material.",
    "E&EB 264 is one of the best organismal biology classes that you can take at Yale. Professor Near is amazing and will really make you take an interest in all the different types of fish, and their families, that are discussed. Definitely take the lab class alongside this course if you can, because you will have a hands-on look at many of the families discussed in class. There are two quizzes, a midterm, a paper, and a final. Make sure you do the readings and you should do fine in this excellent class.",
    "Ichthyology is a great course, both for people who are E&EB majors and are looking for their organismal requirement and for non-majors looking for an interesting science credit. It's not a huge challenge; the term paper is fairly straightforward at only 10 pages, and you can write on pretty much anything as long as fish are somehow involved. Prof. Near is an excellent lecturer, and his enthusiasm is infectious. I would highly recommend it."
