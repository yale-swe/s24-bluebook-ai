    "Like so many history seminars, if you like the topic, it's a good class, if you don't it probably isn't. It wasn't the best-run seminar ever, but Professor Perdue is brilliant and the readings are pretty good.My one warning, as someone who has now taken 4 junior seminars is that this class, like so many other seminars, does not actually teach you to write a good history research paper and isn't structured to enable you to do that on your own. Only one of the seminars I've taken has done that (luckily, it was my first), and though it results in a lot more work - it really is very useful and makes you write a way better paper. A good seminar should get you started on the final paper by the fourth week, and should require regular progress on it over the course of the semester. Class can be enjoyable and interesting without that, and well worth taking (as this seminar was) but it won't make you a better historian, though it may give you more practice with the \"write 20 pages in 2 days\" trick.",
    "Overall, a really laid back class. Although Professor Perdue is a very nice old man, he seems to be occupied by things other than teaching. We never got any of our written assignments back, and the professor gave us limited feedback on our outlines for the 25 page paper we had to write at the end of the semester. Few people completed the weekly readings, and the course ended with people playing bingo on their computers instead of paying attention. We drank tea in class, which was nice, but didn't make up for the lack of engagement."
