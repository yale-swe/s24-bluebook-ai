    "Yale's a mean, messy pageantry of social presentation, but this is an opportunity at real self-examination. Flight LC212, Air Liberal Arts, has a black box and its name is Anne. Socrates died for your sins and your WaO essays. Take this class seriously! Drop your extracurriculars, your friends, your lovers, your parents\u2014 the 12 people around the table are your new family. Don't just apply for this because it's Grand Strategy for the hipster-set. Do it because you're willing to invest time into a real class community and into figuring out who you are.",
    "Writing about Oneself is bliss. It's three hours with a group of 12 amazing writers every week. It becomes your support network, the highlight of your week, the thing that keeps you going when the semester gets rough. You'll write 4 shorter essays and one longer piece; you'll put more energy into writing them than you have for any other assignment at Yale, and you'll love doing it.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This class is spectacular. This class is a lot of work. Anne Fadiman is a superb instructor and gives everyone lots of personal attention, including hour-long one-on-one editing meetings every other week. Again: this class is a lot of work. If you get in, take it. If you don't get in, apply again.",
    "It's a major undertaking. Anne advises her students to take it Credit\/D in order to feel comfortable taking risks, and even though I did this, I found myself spending more time on this class than any other. That said, the reading isn't that much. For me, the workload came from the fact that I wanted to do a good job in a class where I really respected the professor and my peers. TL;DR It's a lot. Read the syllabus.",
    "Believe the hype. Take this course. It will change your life for the better. But also be advised that this course is a *significant* amount of work! The best kind of work, the funnest of all possible work, but work nonetheless -- Weekly readings and discussions, weekly peer workshops, bi-weekly peer critiques, bi-weekly compositions, bi-weekly line-editing sessions with Anne, a culminating identity capstone project, an author report, constant online comments on your classmates' pieces -- *Especially* if you are taking the course Cr\/D (as Anne recommends) this is SO not a gut, it's not even funny, and you're going to want to pour your heart and soul into every detail of the carefully crafted WaO experience. So please please please, from my heart to yours, I sincerely recommend that you plan your extracurricular and academic obligations accordingly!! You (and your beloved classmates) won't regret it.",
    "If you get into this class, take it. Be warned that although you will be highly recommended to take it credit\/d (a class philosophy), it is A LOT of work. It's fun work, though. The topics are always very open, you are encouraged to take risk and pushed boundaries. The other students in the class are amazing writers and will set the bar very high. Expect to have everyone read your work and read everyone's work. Anne is fantastic, and you get plenty of conference time with her so that you can get to know each other. Definitely one of my best experiences at Yale.",
    "Take it! This is a wonderful class. Anne is a great professor: she is kind, incredibly organized, and amazingly helpful. She really cares about her students and their work, as well as the authors on the syllabus. Class is well-run and carefully thought out. Part of what makes this class wonderful, too, is that Anne is encouraging about writing\/becoming a writer, and that causes everyone else in the class to be supportive of each other as well. I liked this class more than other \"writing workshops\" I've taken at Yale because the focus was on reading and writing more than solely \"workshopping\" student work. The classroom was a respectful space, and the class grew into somewhat of a community. This was my favorite class this semester: I feel like my writing improved and I began to love a genre that I'd never spent much time reading.",
    "Writing about Oneself is a great class, but also a challenging one. Take it if you're willing and able to devote a lot of time and energy to it, because this type of work--writing personal essays about your life and responding fully to other people who have written about theirs--is the kind of work you'll want to do really fully and really well.",
    "If you get in, you must take it. It might be the best course you ever take in your entire life.",
    "There's a lot of well-deserved hype about this class and about Anne as a teacher. The seminar is intimate and challenging, and Anne is the most dedicated professor I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. If you've already gotten in, I'd advise you to take it over any other writing class, because Anne's personal attention to her students is unparalleled and you'll learn lessons that will translate to any genre. She's great at making her students believe in themselves as writers. If you're thinking of applying, you're in a slightly different boat. A few things to keep in mind: 1) there are approximately one zillion applicants to this class every year, and getting into Yale writing classes is a fickle business. There are always a few sophomores and occasionally a freshmen in Writing About Oneself, but most of the people will be juniors and seniors. A lot of those upperclassmen had applied before and been rejected, so if that happens to you, don't despair, and remember that it's not a referendum on you as a writer. 2) Think about whether this class would fit into your schedule before blindly applying. For one thing, it's a lot of work--essays every other week, and a big final project about your identity, and very substantive critiques of your classmates' work on weeks when you're not writing yourself. Because Anne is such a conscientious professor, you'll feel bad if you're not putting time into your writing. You'll be meeting with her one-on-one about every single piece, and it would be super awkward if you had dashed off an essay really quickly. Think about whether you have the time and desire to put in a ton of work! It wouldn't be a lame decision to not apply if you're going to be overburdened, it would be a good and well-considered decision and a courtesy to everyone involved."
