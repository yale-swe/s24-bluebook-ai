   "comments": [
    "It's a great class for humanities majors who want to deal with that pesky science credit. I enjoyed it a lot, and learned a ton that's got me looking at the night sky in a whole new light, but I also think that science and math kids could get a lot out of the course as well. It's easy to interpret the information philosophically, but I assume it could be taken at face value just as easily.",
    "I think the course itself has a lot of potential. I came out humbled by our human condition. While we still don't know much about the possibility of life elsewhere, we do understand, because of astronomy, the vastness and infinity of the universe. On a personal level, it was amazing to learn about our place in the universe and I had daily \"WOW\" moments in class, that however were hard to piece together into the big picture sometimes because of the often scattered nature of lectures.That said, professor Fischer told us that she plans to entirely remodel and restructure the class, and I think this can be a truly great class with a little more order and structure.",
    "YES! There is no reason to not take this class. The grading structure is such that it is easy to get a good grade as long as you put in some work. The midterm (15%) was straightforward and the bi-weekly homeworks (25%) were pretty simple. The semester paper (10%, 3pgs, double-spaced!) was a lot of fun to write and graded fairly. The weekly quizzes (10%) are open-book, and there is a free 10% for attendance and 5% for the observatory visit. The final (25%) was so different from any other final I have taken at Yale (I'm a senior), because I felt like I had accomplished something instead of just regurgitating information like for other classes. Do not judge this course based on past evaluations as Professor Fischer has made a huge effort to make this class more accessible to students. She is a leader in the field and has changed the way I think about life. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would summarize it by saying it's a broad history of the universe and science in general. Only at the beginning and end is it really about astronomy. I would recommend it because, though we haven't discovered life elsewhere in the universe, Professor Fischer's optimism is contagious. You get the sense that you're studying something that has the potential to change on a dime.",
    "I would recommend it to people interested in astronomy and with a knowledge of basic science.",
    "Problem sets and online quizzes each week. Manageable exams. Little reading. Interesting lectures. Good class, especially if you're interested in the subject anyway.",
    "I recommend it. If you are not a science major and need a Sc credit. Take this course. It will be well worth your time and you'll get the credit you need. Two birds, one stone.",
    "Great class!",
    "If you're looking for a chill but interesting science class, yes!Prof. Fischer is really great. She was really flexible throughout the semester, and seemed to always be looking for ways to make the course better. She's clearly good at what she does (a pioneer in the search for exoplanets--how cool is that??), but she's also good at making the topics accessible and easy to understand.",
    "I would recommend it definitely , if you are trying to fulfill science credits and have looked up at the night sky inquisitively before. The highlight of the class was definitely the trip to the observatory ( and watching the movie Contact).",
    "Astrobiology builds on the basic tenets of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology in order to answer certain questions regarding life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. The material was sometimes challenging, but never unmanageable - I would suggest this class to any student that has an interest in astronomy in general.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit that won't make your traipse all the way up Science Hill twice a week, this is a great option. The workload is fairly easy, and the material is interesting and engaging. It's a good course, and I would certainly recommend it highly.",
    "Very little work. Not a huge time commitment, either in or outside of class. A very broad range of topics covered, so you're sure to have one strong point among the syllabus. It was sometimes apparent that this class was more of an experimental nature than others you've perhaps taken, being as it is something of a Frankenstein's monster of scientific topics. Where the professor's knowledge falters she brings in professors of different departments to talk about their work, which was always extremely interesting and I think the highlight of the course.",
    "Definitely recommended. I could only dream that classes of my major subject (music) would be half as interesting."
