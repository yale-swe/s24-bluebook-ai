    "Conversational Spanish is a really good L5 class to take first. There is an increasingly large load of reading from the first class to the last class (as would be expected) but still has plenty opportunities to practice speaking (and writing). Definitely take this class if you are considering an L5! And definitely take Tortora's class - she's the best!",
    "This class is pretty good if you want some more exposure to advanced spanish. It will not get you fluent quickly, as it's only three times a week for fifty minutes, and even during class time it's mostly the professor talking. Nevertheless, you will improve somewhat, and Profesora Tortora is the best Spanish teacher you could have. She is incredibly nice, and the class is definitely manageable if you do the work.",
    "I recommend it. Spanish 150 is a great class to refresh your Spanish skills and complete your language requirement at the same time. Tortora is a wonderful teacher, so try to get her if you can.",
    "Take this class",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to keep up with the Spanish speaking skills in a low key environment. I would recommend taking it Credit D Fail though because there is a significant amount of work and if you don't want to be stressed out by it that will be better.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I really enjoyed the course, especially the professor. It was not too much work, but I also really improved in Spanish.",
    "If you are looking to maintain your skills then yes, although it is a bit of work especially the way grading it done (quite unfair considering that it is conversational and the large amount of our grade comes from quizzes)",
    "yes, its a good L-5 conversational class"
