    "I think assigning some required exercises would be useful, because it would allow students to get feedback on course material before exams. It would also force students to keep a regular schedule with internalizing the material, which I think would benefit students' understanding of the course material.",
    "The lecturer gave an intuitive picture of the presented topics. This is very helpful. However, to actually use all this one also needs to be familiar with the formal definitions and proofs. This came a bit short in the class. Homework assignments would be extremely helpful to get the hands on the concepts."

    "I would recommend it because the material is interesting, but I would caution any student that to keep up with the course material requires significant work outside of class. The exams are extremely difficult, and it takes a lot of work to be adequately prepared for them."
