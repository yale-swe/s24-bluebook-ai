   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was great!",
    "If there is one course that should be mandatory for all students, this is it.",
    "This course is very tough, but I do not regret taking this class one bit. If someone is thinking about majoring in Econ, I would definately recommend taking the seminar than the lecture.",
    "Consumer theory and then supply side theory. I would recommend the course , especially if Professor Koker is still teaching it. It is very relevant to many situations people will encounter in there lives and gives a good basic understanding of how people and companies make decisions.",
    "If you can get into this seminar and are even mildly interested in econ, consider yourself extraordinarily lucky and stay in the class no matter what. This is the best possible way you can be introduced to econ at Yale. Tolga is a genius teacher and so incredibly committed to his students. If you puta good amount of work into the class and keep up with the reading, your returns will be pretty substantial.Great class, wish I could have Tolga for the rest of my econ classes at Yale.",
    "I only recommend the seminar if you are looking into being an Econ or EP and E major. Don't take the seminar if you don't do well in math.",
    "ECON 110 02 is offers a great introductory look at economics. While I obviously haven't taken it as a lecture and can't directly compare the two, I definitely think that the more personal interaction with my professor definitely added to my understanding of the material. This was especially important to me because I had never taken Econ before this class; still, though, the class structure made it easy to make up lost ground. I recommend this class.",
    "Yes, professor is great and material is pretty basic stuff of life students should know.",
    "If you are interested in how the world works, take this class. Take it with Tolga. He is a better teacher; his classes are more fun, and you will learn more. He will emphasize the competition; it is not easy to get an A. Don't worry about it. The amount of money you will make by understanding economics is far greater than the amount you will lose by having a B+ \/ A- on your transcript.",
    "If you are interested in learning about economics then definitely take this seminar. Even if you have done advanced economics in high school, this course really helps in building many concepts and gives a feel of how economics in high school and college are very different. But if you take the seminar, know that this course is challenging and maintaining a grade in this is definitely hard.",
    "i dropped it",
    "I would warn them that it is very math heavy.",
    "Economics 110 is a rigorous introduction to the basic theories of economics. The seminar focuses on a more quantitive and example based problems while I believe the lecture is more theory based.",
    "I would recommend for any students interested in Economics 110 to also shop Economics 115. This seminar moves at a faster pace and is more rigorous than Economics 115. Shop both courses to decide if a seminar setting or lecture setting is best for you.",
    "This class covers the basic tenants of microeconomics and does so really effectively. Tolga's lessons are never dull, and he makes micro interesting to learn about. The overall workload isn't too heavy, and if you keep up on reading, you will always be prepared. If you have a chance to take this class with Tolga, I would highly recommend trying it out.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this course to a fellow student. If they had taken a serious economics course prior to Yale, I think they could do ok in this course. A lot of knowledge was assumed and expected that wasn't necessarily available to all members of the class. Students with a background in econ had a definite advantage. As an into course, I think this is a tough one, but worth taking overall.",
    "If you are interested in economics this is the prefect start-up class for you. If you have never taken an economics course it may be slightly difficult but the benefits will outweigh the costs. I would definitely recommend tho class to another student.",
    "It's a great course to take if you want to learn about how people behave and the different aspects of a consumer market."
