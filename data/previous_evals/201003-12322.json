   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you are in need of a QR but not so strong in math. There are 6 problem sets, some of which can be very frustrating but doing them in a group makes them a lot easier. Lecture can often seem repetitive but it means there aren't too many concepts covered in class. The midterm was also very frustrating. However, in terms of QRs it's definitely one of the better and more interesting ones and Professor Donegan is really nice and always willing to meet and explain anything.",
    "I would DEF reccomend this class if you're looking for an easy QR.",
    "Take this class! It's a piece-of-cake QR, sure, but you might find that you'll actually use some of what you learn in everyday life, which is more than can be said for a lot of Yale courses. Although you might be bored if you took stats in high school, if you haven't, it's a great introduction. But since this is for humanities people, don't expect to learn about regression lines or computer skills you can use for your summer internship.",
    "Boring. You may not get much out of it but just take it for the QR.",
    "Psychology 129 is a good statistics class to take if you want a QR credit and a VERY basic understanding of statistics. It moves very slowly.",
    "Oh god this class is boring. I took it for an easy QR--which it is, but my god, it's terrible. Don't put yourself through it...Donegan is nice, but he cannot teach statistics to save his life and is totally non-engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student is not very fond of complicated math but enjoys calculations. It definitely opened my eyes to statistics as a whole.",
    "If you would like a relatively easy QR, do it. If you want to learn basic stat in a non-intimidating environment, do it. If you want to learn stat in the view of interesting case studies, do it. However, be warned that the extra package of psychology promised in this course isn't delivered.",
    "This class was boring, but if you need a fairly easy QR and don't mind the dull lectures, this is the class for you. I've heard it's the easiest QR at Yale. Try to email Professor Donegan early expressing interest if you want to get into the class--it caps, and since not everyone gets in you should tell him early that you want to take the class. Stats as a Way of Knowing is pretty basic statistics. The textbooks are good and if you can't pay attention during lectures you can teach yourself.",
    "Yes, especially for a QR. Not too hard.",
    "Yes, because I learned a lot about Statistics and Psychology.",
    "It's a not-super-intensive introduction to statistics, focusing more on discussion than on rote memorization of formulas. If you need a QR, you will not regret taking this. There are very few problem sets, and they are more than manageable. We had 6 problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Do it!",
    "Psych 129 is a relatively easy QR class and some parts of it are interesting. It can also be incredibly dull and dry, which makes the hour and a half class periods feel much longer.",
    "Very catered towards non math-minded students, PSYC 129 is definitely one of Yale's more approachable QRs. The lectures range from relatively engaging to pinching yourself to stay awake, but the light workload and relevancy of the subject matter make the course worthwhile overall.Avoid asking Professor Donegan questions though because he tends to confuse more than he helps - relying on classmates to explain is much more productive.",
    "Nice intro to statistics.",
    "Psychology 129 01 is not a class that requires strength in upper-level math concepts. For that reason, I would only recommend this course to those whose strengths are not generally in mathemathics and to those who are looking to fulfill a distributional requirement."
