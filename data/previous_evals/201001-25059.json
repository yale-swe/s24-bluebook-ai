    "You learn a lot of Persian after just one year of class. The Professor is also very spirited and makes the class interesting. The homework is constant and sometimes is rather involving, but I imagine that's normal for all language classes.",
    "If you want to learn Persian, this is your only choice, but the class is great anyways. Even if it meets at a really early time, you will come out of it having learned the basics of the language and will have a proper foundation in both conversational and literary Persian to continue studying the language in greater depth.",
    "If you want to learn Persian, this'll do the trick. You know what you're getting into since you took Persian a previous semester, I assume."
