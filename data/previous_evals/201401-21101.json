   "comments": [
    "A class that is interesting and good to take to learn about the region, but do not expect to learn anything during the actual class time.",
    "I would recommend this class. I learned a lot even though I didn't have any background. It was very interesting.",
    "Take it! Professor Hanson is super knowledgable and nice. The course is a great introduction to South Asia, especially for students who don't have much experience with the region.",
    "It is two medium length papers,and one 13-15page paper and lots of discussion once a week (class was on tuesday afternoons)",
    "Great class! Professor Hanson is phenomenal. She is incredibly thoughtful and caring.",
    "Yes, for sure. Professor Hanson cultivates a very relaxed and open seminar environment, rather than some of the high pressure ones you can take as an EPE student. It's a lot of really interesting, relevant, and applicable work. The readings are super manageable (I actually would be able to complete every page most weeks) and there are just two short papers and then a longer research one. The class gives you a really strong foundation in South Asia 20th century history and modern issues.",
    "I would recommend the class if you want an intro to the issues (it covers a lot so it's pretty broad).",
    "Yes definitely. Great overview of an important world region with very manageable work load.",
    "The class was very interesting. It is very discussion based, so it depends on the year, but it is very exciting, argumentative and focused on India and Pakistan.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it!",
    "Okay course. The reviews were awesome so I had very high expectations. However, while you get to learn a lot through the readings, I was really disappointed by the discussions. There were too many people in the seminar, and rather than getting to have true discussions with each other around the table, it was more that individual students asked the teacher questions and got responses. It would have been infinitely better if discussions had been structured more like actual discussions. That said, workload is not bad at all. So if you have a busy semester but still want to learn about South Asia, it can be worth it.",
    "Take it! South Asia is an an important region, there are few classes on it offered here, and this course affords a very good introduction. Plus, Professor Hanson is fantastic and there isn't that much work.",
    "Good class, relaxed discussion in class, assignments are pretty easy"
