    "Absolutely! Take this course, whether for a WR credit or not. It's thought provoking and demanding in good ways, and it really shapes the way your perceive language as a whole. Prof. Bate is phenomenal, and the sections are super low key, but equally interesting and fun! CR\/D\/F isn't a bad option because of the work load, but totally doable as a letter grade too.",
    "This is a very unique class, and I feel like most people either love it or hate it. I was somewhere in between. I came in to it for the sake of the writing credit on an interesting topic, and the professor's lecture style completely drew me in from the start. He continued to be a fantastic lecturer throughout the semester, really engaged and excited about his material.With that said, though, I couldn't always appreciate his enthusiasm, because you really did not need to pay much attention to the readings or the lectures. At some points, the material gets ridiculously theoretical--but you can tune it out and realize that doesn't particularly matter if you're just working on getting through the course. An entirely basic understanding sufficed for papers (though that might vary based on the TA), and I might have appreciated being \"forced\" to engage with it a little more. Then again, I had a really busy semester, so being able to take it easy and just pay attention to the amusing Colbert and Stewart clips (which, for the record, I'd never watched before--you don't need to be a news junkie for the class) was nice. So basically, I wouldn't say I got a ton out of the course, but what I did was interesting if basic.",
    "Interesting class, but the theory gets a little tedious at times. I would recommend it if you are into theoretical humanities-esque thought or post-modern-sounding literature.",
    "Take it! Professor Bate is wonderful and you are unlikely to come across material like this again.",
    "Absolutely! I thought this was an absolutely fantastic course! The readings and lectures were fascinating, the \"workshops\" were excellent, and my section was great as well. The papers are a decent amount of work, however, but the Wr credit is useful. Professor Bate is a great professor and a really nice guy, and makes it easy to get to know him - try to!",
    "If they are interested in anthro academic theory.",
    "I would recommend this class with some hesitation. It's often engaging and very interesting, but it's sometimes difficult to follow and feel like you can grasp at any of the theoretical concepts. Do I regret taking this class? No. Are there other, better classes? Yes. Also, i would recommend taking this class credit\/D because then you can take it for the fun parts without having to slave over the less-than-enjoyable parts.",
    "Take. This. Class. If you do nothing else at Yale, take this class with Professor Bate. He's a brilliant individual and the class is so interesting and not an overbearing amount of work. If you've ever even had the slightest interest in the topic, take it. And the daily clips of The Daily Show and the Colbert Report are just a nice bonus.",
    "Strengths: engaging lecturer (Prof. Bate is a lot of fun) and much fun conversation. Lots to be learned about the history of oratory, its many manifestations around the world, and other aspects of linguistic anthropology, with gender and race as important themes. The workshops in section were an excellent addition to the lectures; I learned as much from my fellow students as I did from Prof. Bate.Weaknesses: Prof. Bate works hard to mesh the theory of linguistic anthropology and pop culture, but he doesn't always succeed--students can be lost by the abstruse technical language, and amused (but not engaged) by the funny YouTube videos. Too much on Sarah Palin, too.Take the class. You can't escape learning something, although applying what you learned from it might be difficult.",
    "Extremely enjoyable and a rare topic to find in courses. Combining Gender Studies with Anthropology and Ethnicity and Race Studies was a super interesting approach to the topic of oratory and rhetoric. Makes you think about modern political speakers in a new light--their successes and failures, etc. Bate is a phenomenal lecturer, brilliant, and very approachable. There is a lot of work 4 papers and 2 1.5 hour lectures and a 50 minutes section, but if you're committed it's very worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Take it if you want a different perspective on the way communication in politics works. Keep in mind the professor's bias, but keep your own in mind as well, and prepare to have your view changed no matter your political leanings.",
    "ANTH 298 is an excellent course. Professor Bate is brilliant and consistently engaging. I learned much about the current mediascape (fox news, Colbert) and how it shapes modern politics. I also gained an entirely new perspective on gender and race in society. Lecture is spruced up with lots of video clips, so it's easy to pay attention. Definitely shop!",
    "A good class covering modern western political oratory, and oratory (as defined broadly) in different cultures. Analyzes structure and tropes in western oratory, and the definition of oratory itself as a something that effects change on the broader world.Lectures are quite interesting; very free-form and encourages participation.Readings are not easy, especially at the start of the semester, and has quite a bit.I personally liked the course, but didn't like the sections. I would recommend it as long as you're interested in politics and at least somewhat interested in anthropology.",
    "Yes. Material is interesting. Class will change how you listen to speeches.On Mondays, Professor Bate gives theoretical lectures. These can be hard-to-follow and frustrating. He uses way too much anthropological jargon, which makes them very difficult to understand. But it is okay, because on Wednesdays, he dissects a piece of contemporary oratory. This is accessible and interesting and so fun! This was the most interesting section I've ever had. The format is great. Each week, one of the students gives a \"workshop\" (as in the student does the same thing that Bate does on Wednesdays). People bring in interesting pieces of oratory and usually give engaging presentations.There are 3 papers of 6ish pages and 1 final paper\/project of about 8 pages. There are too many readings, but you don't have to do all of them. You'll watch all kinds of cool speeches, advertisements etc.Get Mike as your TA!",
    "ANTH298 was described as a survey course into the workings of speech and rhetoric with regards to gender, politics, economics, to name a few. Although some of the readings were deeper anthropological case studies than I expected as a non-major, I still enjoyed the overall themes of the course and would recommend it to anyone who was interested. The reading load was moderate to heavy and the written work was varied from week to week. Also, Professor Bate (thankfully) allows rewrites for all papers you aren't satisfied with! Perfect for when you have no clue how to address the prompt and end up completely blowing it.",
    "This class is a lot of fun, and not a whole lot of work. Make sure to do the readings if you actually want to learn about rhetoric in anthropological practice. The papers are not too hard, and Bate is great to be around.All of this said, lectures can be hard to follow, the material can seem irrelevant, and the papers can be frustrating.",
    "definitely-it's great.",
    "I have always been really interested in oratory so I thought this would be the class for me. I was right and wrong about that: I loved Wednesdays (and sections), when we would always look at great speeches from history or the modern day\u0085but I had a lot of trouble understanding and paying attention to the Monday lectures, which were concerned only with anthropological\/linguistic theory. I\u0092m guessing the anthropology or sociology majors understood a lot of what was going on\u0097but as a non-anthro major, I was very lost. The professor is very nice and very dynamic; he had a lot of fascinating things to say about oratory and the current political situation during workshops\u0097but during lectures he tended to read directly from notes, which made those classes far less interesting and understandable. Most of the readings were likewise very challenging and very dry--I should have tried to read more of them (but they were usually quite hard to get through). Overall, if you\u0092re really gung-ho about oratory and think you\u0092ll really enjoy analyzing speeches and their underlying messages, I\u0092d still recommend taking the class\u0097but know that the theory half of class may be far less intelligible. That said, some people seemed to really enjoy the theory lectures and actively participated in class discussion on those days. The professor is also more than happy to talk outside of class\u0097he is a very nice person and clearly cares about the course and the students.",
    "Prof. Bate is a fair grader and an engaging lecturer. There's a good amount of writing in the course (3 1500 word papers and a 2500 word final paper), but overall they're very flexible, interesting assignments. Lectures are generally fun and interesting, though they can sometimes focus too much on current events and not help with the more difficult linguistic scholarly stuff assigned in the readings. I'd definitely recommend this course if you like an anthropological approach to studying rhetoric and oratory, or even if you usually don't but are willing to give anthropology a shot for a semester, as this is probably the most interesting class with which you will be able to do so.",
    "The class allowed you to analyze many oratorical and historical instances in a seminar type setting within the larger lecture. The readings are difficult to get through, but overall the class does teach you a lot about a topic that isn't commonly taught.",
    "YES YES YES YES! TAKE IT!",
    "Amazing course. Even though it's in the \"linguistic\" track, it's very relevant to cultural anthropology. If you're looking to satisfy the distribution requirement within the major, take this class. And even if you're not, the class is still definitely worth taking. Not that much work and lots of interesting and relevant material."
