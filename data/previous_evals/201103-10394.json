   "comments": [
    "I believe this class is a must for all synthetic chemistry graduate students, and thus I would recommend it. However, the course needs to be taught differently next time round or by another synthetic professor in order to make the class more beneficial.",
    "I would normally not recommend that someone else take a course that I was so discouraged with, but for the organic students, they don't have many other choices. I am hoping that the class will be different once he settles down with his baby and gets himself in order. If the class doesn't change, then I definitely do not recommend it. If it does change and the coverage expands, I would recommend it hesitantly.",
    "I would not recommend Chemistry 523 as is. The course attempts to convey the wide expanse of organic chemistry but only gets through half.",
    "I would say it was a combination of physical organic chemistry and synthetic methods. I would not recommend it if the class remained the way it was when I took it. I think there need to be some changes in its structure (see above) before I could recommend it in good conscience.",
    "Class that teaches conformational analysis to allow you to rationalize the product. Will be useful for organic research.",
    "For Chemistry student, it is worth to take. But for engineering, it is a little bit beyond the knowledge.",
    "This course describes different synthetic techniques and the mechanistic routes from reactant to product. Several key reactions are discussed. This course is challenging. If a student wants to be a synthetic chemist, then yes they should take this course.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course as it is taught now. It is very disorganized and half of the material can be learned from Jorgensen's class anyways.",
    "i would recommend this class to undergrads and 1st yr grad students but not advanced grad students",
    "CHEM 523 ought to have been a thorough (as much as possible) course in useful and notable transformations and mechanisms in organic chemistry. This semester, I would argue that the course was not what it should have been, and I would not recommend it as such -- I was pretty disappointed -- but if issues are corrected, I would certainly recommend the course, as I think it's essential that the budding organic chemist has a survey of the reactions that are \"out there\"."

   "comments": [
    "Despite my feelings about the course, I did learn a lot. Most of it was on my own though.",
    "I think I will use all the information that I learned in this class, I just wish more was covered.",
    "The class will help with rationalizing organic reaction products in a variety of circumstances in the future which will be of great help in the years to come.",
    "The knowledge is helpful even for the engineering level. The course gives knowledge about basic mechanism which helps to understand the reactions.",
    "It helped introduce me to new transition states for different organic reactions as well as the accompanying mechanisms. Having a good understanding of not only reaction conditions necessary to convert a reactant into a desiredproduct, but also a knowledge of how this occurs is important for all chemical research.",
    "This class was just taken as a filler since not enough inorganic classes are being offered. I was hoping to get some better knowledge of synthetic methods for making ligands etc. I definitely benefitted from this class, but not as much as I had hoped.",
    "it was a good review of physical organic chemistry"
