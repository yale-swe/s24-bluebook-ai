    "I would recommend this class - if you like solving problems, are interested in programming, but don't like math, this is a great QR credit. But you won't get much out of this class if you use Facebook duringlectures and if you don't build a good foundation early on. The lectures might seem a little hard to follow at first or even boring, but if you pay attention you will reap great dividends. The workload is manageable - one problem set a week. Some people spend a lot of time on problem sets, some don't. The difficulty of the problem sets vary, of course. The longest I spent on one was 10 hours and the shortest, 1.5 hours. My only complaint is that the textbook is monstrously expensive if you buy it from Labyrinth. You can get by sharing one with a friend since you need it only for readings before classes.",
    "I love java, and the course material. Professor McDermott is a little scattered as a teacher, not awful though. On Fridays we had special topics taught by the TAs, which were interesting, or review sessions for the problem sets (due at midnight Friday). Problem sets were extremely easy at first, and got harder though still doable. Exams were much easier than the problem sets, very respectable. The textbook is excellent, so if you really have a problem with the teaching you can just read the book.",
    "With a different professor, this course could potentially be fun.",
    "If you want to learn how to program, take this course.",
    "I recommend CPSC112 if you've never programmed before. It is a good introduction, not too difficult to follow, and you learn Java pretty well by the end. Prof. McDermott is not a great lecturer, but if you look at his lecture notes online and read the book, you'll be able to get through the problem sets without too much trouble.",
    "this class started out easy, but about halfway through the homework started getting deceivingly more difficult. good class to learn the basics of programming \/ java, not necessarily an easy QR",
    "Professor McDermott... what can I say about Drew...To begin, I'll say that I had a background in programming before taking the class, so I was fortunate in that I did not have to learn much from Drew. Those who had no such background struggled through the class, and by visual estimates between the midterm and final, nearly half of the class dropped. Fortunately for their GPAs, the class is curved, and curved generously, so after the weekly 12-hour struggle through a problem set because its concepts were so inadequately addressed in class, the 3\/4 of the material that they managed to teach themselves earned them better than a C. Less fortunate is the fact that one will not learn as much as he hopes to out of this class and will spend far more time on the problem sets than is justified as a result of this process.Even for me, Drew's lectures were very confusing. He tends to use words which have specialized meanings in programming in their conventional English sense alongside the specialized sense without any distinction. His problem sets, which take several pages to explain two or three problems suffer most greatly from this effect and are under constant revision over the course of the week they are assigned. This has the double effect of confusing everyone and making it such that if one attempts to finish a problem set early so he can focus on a different assignment, he might find all of his work undone the day before it is due by a revision in the assignment.Drew insists that each student keep the same directory structure and compress his files in the same format (using a program that Drew provides), which is entirely reasonable, but along the course of the semester this program and structure, like the problem sets, receive a frustrating amount of revisions. The TA's, knowing this, are generous in that they did not penalize students for incorrect compression or structure, but they also did not mention it in their comments on returned assignments. It came as a surprise then, when the TA's had fallen so far behind in grading (four problem sets were regularly outstanding, such that even as I write this, having taken the final, I do not have assignments returned that I turned in over a month ago, nor anything since then) and Drew began to grade, when he sent out an email to all students which read:\"I've been in contact with several students about bogus jar files for PS10, which I'm grading. ... I'm just amazed at the poor long-suffering TAs, who've patiently unwound a lot of idiosyncratic file formats week after week, while having to listen to complaints about how long it takes them to grade the problem sets.\"and an email to one student which read:\"I'm grading PS10. Your jar file does not follow the rules for howthese things are supposed to be laid out. All you have to do is runthe script psjar112 [the program he provided]. It's not hard, provided CS112_CLASSPATH and NETID are set correctly. It's hard to believe you've made it through. the entire term without getting that right.\"Two weeks later, he sent out an email which revealed that:\"Here's one possible reason why students have had problems using psjar112: It had a bug, in particular a misspelled occurrence of $NETID.\"He was the one who made a mistake. Those who managed to turn in something correct did so in spite of them, rather than because of him. This is, in fact, the best way I can sum up CPSC 112. Those who managed to learn something did so in spite of the instruction, rather than because of it.",
    "This is a really easy course. You don't actually get anything from going to class, as the lectures are often far more complex and confusing than the material. The textbook should have everything you need to do the problem sets. Sometimes one gets frustrated trying to understand what Prof. McDermott wants (as problems are often far more complex than they need to be).",
    "If you're interested in CS, this class is okay. Don't expect to get much out of lectures, though. You'll probably be doing most of your learning through the book and through the internet. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on problem sets, because even though they don't take that long to do, it might take quite a while to decipher the cryptic instructions.",
    "Horrible. A needlessly difficult class that could use a professor who can actually teach and TAs who can grade.",
    "McDermott ruined a wonderful subject.",
    "This class will test your patience more than anything else. The lectures are esoteric and unhelpful and you will spend more time deciphering what a problem set wants you to do than accomplishing it.",
    "Much tougher than made out to be. Psets due at 4am Friday night (Saturday) and most people need to stay up until then to get them done...",
    "I took this as a class to sort of ease the rest of my schedule. It thought it would be pretty fun cuz I thought it was like solving a bunch of puzzles. But, needless to say, it wasn't like that at all. The problem sets took about 8 hours a week (and even then some of the programs didnt work) and they were very vague and could be misconstrued easily. This class also has some experienced computer programmers in it, which kind of sucks for the rest of us who just started and had NO idea what was going on.",
    "The problem sets were more work than I expected - around 10 hours a week is not an exaggeration. The Friday night midnight due date pretty much kills your Fridays for the semester.",
    "CS112 is a great course for anyone who would like to learn more about programming or computer science in general. It doesn't require that you've had any experience, but by the end of the course, you really will have learned a lot from both the lectures and the topic sections. Although the problem sets are challenging, they are well worth the effort spent!",
    "Take it with anyone but Drew-baby.",
    "AWFUL.",
    "Programming is cool but try not to take it with McDermott.",
    "Despite the fact that it may take away your Friday nights or Saturday mornings, I think anybody remotely interested in computers should take CPSC112. The material is interesting and even such a cursory understanding of CS as this course offers is of great use in a world increasingly dominated by algorithms and computer scientists. A good deal of work, no doubt about it, but valuable. Ultimately worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend it because computer science is interesting. However, I wouldn't recommend it instead of another comp sci course necessarily.",
    "Please, don't even think of taking this course!!!!! It's sad to admit, but Yale has some very-very bad courses and it is one of them!!I thought it was all right during Shopping Period, but then it got soooo much worse. The professor doesn't know how to talk to students, the lectures are useless, and the questions in psets are harder to understand than the material itself. And also the problem sets are due Friday midnight, so they will ruin your weekends!!! There is NOTHING good about this course!!",
    "WORST class I have ever taken. Professor is mind-numbingly dull and his problem sets are so confusing the TAs don\u0092t even understand them, and they take upwards of ten or fifteen hours a week. This class literally ruined my term, and certainly ruined any chance of me taking another comp sci class in the future. Half of the class dropped out by midterm, I wish I had been in that half. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I came into it hoping to learn something about programming, wanting to make my way in this technological era. I learned next to nothing, and I suffered useless amounts of frustration and anger. It might be different with a different professor, but if it\u0092s with McDermott you will definitely regret taking this class. If you don\u0092t believe me, shop the first one. It only goes downhill from there. The textbook is the only thing that gets you by, and if you just read through it you can learning something about loops and recursion and interfaces, but nothing you can apply to the problem sets, which is unfortunately all that matters.",
    "Take it if you want to learn Java. The main difficulty with the course is that the problem sets are poorly worded and hard to decode (though if you can figure out the specifications the problems themselves are easy)."
