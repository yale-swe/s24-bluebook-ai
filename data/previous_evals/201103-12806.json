   "comments": [
    "We mostly did RNA extraction, PCRs, gel electrophoresis, in situ hybridization, and microscopy. The course was more interesting because all the work we did was associated with a project in the Elke Stein Lab - it was nice to be doing some small part of real research rather than just performing many experiments and using lots of resources only in order to learn a technique. If you have worked in a biology or biochemistry lab before, this course will be really easy for you, since you already know how all these techniques work. But it is a well-taught course, and Professor Nelson explains everything really well.",
    "The class was centered around performing research for another lab, with the pertinent principles and techniques along the way. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Overall a good bio lab. It's always nice to be working on a real project --no matter how small--instead of carrying out experiments with known conclusions. Professor Nelson is kind and accessible, and I left feeling like I actually learned the material. Workload is manageable, just don't leave the lab notebook and paper till the end.",
    "It was a great course and a fantastic way to complete the lab requirement for the biology major. Professor Nelson is fantastic, and the course is very manageable, fair, and fun. It is really low stress compared to many other lab courses at Yale. The paper at the end of the semester is a great learning experience, but make sure to keep up with the work because it gets easy to push things off! Overall, great lab!",
    "I would highly recommend taking Nucleic Acids lab. It was definitely my favorite lab class at Yale. The workload is manageable (a lab notebook, a couple problem sets, and a final paper) and you will learn a lot of useful lab techniques. I would suggest emailing at least six months ahead of time though, as this lab is popular.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The workload is manageable, you learn a lot, and the projects are very interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this lab - I learned so much about science and lab work and I love it so much more now! This lab has made me interested in pursuing a job in lab\/clinical experiments next year, just because it showed me how much fun science can be! The professor is incredible and the experiments are fascinating, because you work on real questions that don't have conclusive answers yet. One word of warning - email Professor Nelson in December, or even earlier, the school year prior to when you want to take the lab. Openings fill up fast!! But definitely take this lab!",
    "I would highly recommend the course. It is one of the few times as a biology major where you will get the opportunity to be in a small class setting. Professor Nelson is wonderful. The class is perfectly paced. The work load is very manageable and the material is also interesting, especially for those who are working\/plan to work in a bio lab at Yale.",
    "great way to knock out a credit of bio lab in one year, interesting lab, very little work outside of lab: weekly problem sets and one large project at the end, only downside: some long evenings (yes, evenings) in lab and it meets twice per week",
    "This class is probably one of the best science lab courses to take at Yale. Not only do we work on a real project from an actual professor's lab, but we also learn a lot about the science behind the lab work. It is very useful for anyone interested or currently doing research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a great way of learning science in research, feeling part of a research project and being able to write a report on it, not too much work or stress. The days were definitely pretty long and a majority of the time we were there until at least 4ish, but for the very little weekly work we had, I didn't mind.",
    "Yes, I would. This is a good course that teaches you a lot about DNA, RNA, separation procedures, extractions, PCR, etc. its really great to have this knowledge. One thing though, is that the lab notebook can become particularly difficult to deal with. You should not wait until the last minute as it will be almost IMPOSSIBLE to complete it as its so long and encompasses the entire course. Also it was not that fun to have both Tuesday and Thursday afternoons blocked off from 1.00 to 5.00 pm every week (and sometimes even later) but you just have to learn to enjoy being in lab with your classmates. Our class was particularly fun because we had a lot of funny people and everyone helped each other out.",
    "I would highly recommend this lab. The lab work is really interesting and not stressful. The workload is completely reasonable. Prof. Nelson is incredibly chill and approachable. Be sure to sign up early for this course because it fills up quickly!",
    "The class allows you to learn how to do research in a real setting, and provides a comprehensive learning process including basic theories, scientific findings and lab techniques. Because it is a small lab, you end up knowing each other very well in the class. I would recommend it to any science majors in related areas.",
    "I would definitely recommend Nucleic Acids Lab to any student interested in a research lab experience. This is one of the best biology lab courses at Yale. The learn-as-you-go, project-based format is a wonderful departure from the week-by-week experiment curriculum of introductory labs; there is no busywork, since every step is essential to the project (which contributes to the work of an actual researcher at Yale). You keep a lab notebook that is turned in at the end of the course, and write one final report in the style of a real journal article as if you're submitting it for publication. I learned more in this lab than in many lecture courses. The experimental techniques used in this lab are widely used in real research labs. Professor Nelson really cares about teaching and will help you to obtain good results. You actually learn why you're doing each step, rather than just blindly following the procedure.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. It's laidback and not much work compared to other labs, and it's great to be able to learn why you're doing what you're doing. I also enjoyed being able to work on a project from someone's actual lab because it gives you a sense of purpose. Keeping a lab notebook, problem sets and paper at the end are all very manageable. Be sure to contact him pretty early, though, to get a spot in the lab!"
