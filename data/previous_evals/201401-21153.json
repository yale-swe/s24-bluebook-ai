    "This class is easy and fun, and you also learn important key concepts of building structures. Prof. Moon is the sweetest man alive. If you can't get an A with all the help he gives you, you must not have come to a single lecture.",
    "Problem sets every week, two structural competitions (we built a roof out of glue and pasta, and we built a column out of wood), and open-notes midterm and final. The midterm had 120 points but max score 100, and the final had 115 points but max score 100 (so you could miss 15 points and still get 100). Class is fairly easy if you've taken college level physics before, and I think manageable if you haven't. It ended up that only juniors and seniors got into the class, since he capped it at 20 and too many people wanted to take it. All juniors \/ seniors who wanted to take it got in. Not too content heavy (a lot of the class is just looking at power points of bridges, roofs, beams, buildings), with some physics illustrated. You learn how buildings stand up in this class.",
    "This is a really fun class! You should be comfortable with basic algebra but its not that hard and if you pay attention in class Moon is a great teacher. He also really tries to have the class understand the concepts and is really patient. This is not a hard class at all, but if you do care you can get a lot out of it. Moon is also hilarious. If you want to take it, just stick with it through shopping period and if you are a junior or senior or if your an architecture student you should get in no problem.",
    "YASS",
    "If you are looking for a not intense science credit, you should take this class. The workload is not too heavy and the building projects are interesting. Professor Moon is really fun and explains the content very clearly.",
    "This is a good class to take to fulfill a science credit, especially if you enjoyed math and physics (although no physics background is necessary). If you are looking for an extra elective, it's also a great choice because the material is super interesting and you'll probably never look at buildings the same way again.",
    "I did not find this class to be as much of a gut as others suggest. I truly enjoyed the material and thought that Professor Moon made it both interesting as well as understandable. The structures competitions were lots of fun, and he always made sure that the material related back to the real world. It was a refreshingly relevant QR.",
    "Might be more work than expected",
    "ARCH 161 was an excellent class. Professor Moon is the best! He is a great teacher and you can tell that he really wants his students to not only learn the material, but enjoy the experience in doing so. The workload is very manageable and the class is not too difficult. The in-class competitions are a lot of fun. I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for a QR or SC credit.",
    "In ARCH161 you learn about various structural elements that are common in buildings and the mathematical\/physical concepts governing their behavior. The material is really interesting and Professor Moon is a great instructor. Workload is really light and exams are open-book. Overall a fun and very manageable science credit.",
    "I would recommend ARCH 161 to another student interested in learning about structural systems and how they work. Practically mandatory for architecture students (it is) and a great science credit for everyone else.",
    "A lot of fun, fairly useful, and because of the manageable pace of the class and patience of the professor you're almost guaranteed an A if you do the work.",
    "Fun, interesting, worthwhile course, and a great way to get a not-too-difficult QR or SC. Definitely recommended."
