    "I learned form the best botanists in the field how are plants classified according to their traits.",
    "I feel like this course gave me a literacy to read what I was seeing in plants all around the world. In some ways it was like learning a new language. We also covered an impressive spread of plant families that have already proved useful and relevant in my work."

Fantastic course!! The field trip made a total difference in the way of learning.",

   "comments": [
    "The field trip to Costa Rica is really excellent, and is highly effective in showing that there is more to identifying plants than just looking at them out of context. It's unfortunate we couldn't see more plants in class before going on the field trip. Maybe in the future, you can refer students more directly or explicitly to a resource that can be a quick read or skim to introduce us to some of the other families we might see.",
    "more focus on anatomy;",
    "The main strength of the course is definitely the field trip and the incredible depth of knowledge on the subject matter that is displayed by the instructors. One thing that may have improved the class for me would be to improve the organization of the lecture slides and also to go through plant samples in the classroom as we did out in the field on the field trip.",
    "I felt as though the teaching was not strong. Each week the professors would provide us with a list of characteristics for each family and then give us plant material to examine, but they wouldn't make it apparent which characteristics were the most important or essential for identification. A lot of the most useful information came in side comments instead of during the main presentation during class which would be a disorganized mess of information with no clarity as to how best to actually identify the plants (which was the only component of both 2 hours exams which made up our whole grade). Even basic strategies such as focus on vegetative characteristics (opposite v. alternate, stipules or not, compound or simple) were not reinforced by materials in teh class or behavior of the professors. For example, despite how important these characteristics were supposedly, many lectures would not include that information for a particular family (making it seem like a less important characteristic). In addition, when actually looking at the plants in class, we never had the chance to actually practice our identification skills because we only had about 45 minutes to an hour with the plants which was basically just enough time to take a look at the characteristics for the first time. I personally needed far more time to practice and would have liked to have had access to clearly marked plant materials for each of the families outside of class. I have taken plant taxonomy courses before, and that is how I learned -- by spending time with the plant material on my own focused on really learning it (not quickly taking a look at it in a rush at the end of class while trying to keep all of the information that was just thrown at us straight). When studying, I spent a TON of time just trying to organize the onslaught of information and figure out what was important and what wasn't. This detracted from my time spent memorizing\/practicing (as much as I could without any plant material to investigate).",
    "Strengths: Hands-on nature of classes and field trip really strengthened my plant ID skills, professors and TA were really engaging and personable Weakness: The slideshows weren't super well-structured. They could be streamlined a bit to clearly show the relationship between orders and families.",
    "The field trip to Costa Rica was by far the strength of this course - the material we learned was really put into practice on the field trip. Fabian and Larry and Kyra the TA are also incredibly knowledgeable which was helpful and inspiring. A weakness of the course is the way the information is presented at times, especially early in the semester, the sheer quantity of information without the context that the field provides made it feel like we were trying to drink out of a firehose. The instructors mentioned ways to organize the information, such as forming lists of families with certain characteristics, but more guidance in this organization would have been helpful. And perhaps more knowledge check-ins such as occasional quizzes to force us to study! Its hard to self-study on a regular basis without structure, especially to show if our study methods are effective.",
    "The biggest 2 strengths: the instructors and the field trip The biggest weakness: I believe that learning through PPT presentations is not the best way to do it. Despite the fact that at the end of every class, specimens were brought to the classroom, the way in which the families were presented took me more time to remember than if depicted in terms of a philogenetic tree (making zoom to different segments on every class). I would definitely suggest restricting the number of students to a maximum of 10",
    "Both instructors had an insanely impressive depth of knowledge about everything we covered in our class an in the field. We were able to walk through several different forests in Costa Rica with the instructors, ask them about any plant, and receive a wealth of information. That depth of knowledge was unparalleled from any other instructors I had taken a class with prior to this semester."

    "If you like plants or plan to work in a tropical forest, this class is a must! The teachers balance out the classroom and trip dynamic really well!",
    "great class for introduction to botany",
    "Stay on top of your studying. I fell behind in this class and it was an uphill battle at the end to try and get prepared for the final exam.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to other students.",
    "Definitely take this course if you will be working with tropical plants. However, work hard to organize the information from the very beginning, and if youre very motivated, quiz yourself regularly. Or convince Fabian and Larry to provide regular quizzes!",
    "Excellent course! Although a lot of technical terminology is used, it is definitely worth memorizing it to learn about plant families and overall diversity of species in the tropics.",
    "Make sure you have enough time to dedicate to the course and be sure to study each weeks material before the next weeks start. Go into the field trip with as up to speed as you can because it will enhance what you learn in the field tremendously. Definitely take the course."
