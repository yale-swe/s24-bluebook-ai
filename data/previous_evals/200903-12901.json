   "comments": [
    "The syllabus incorporated very interesting combination of reading material and practical assignments, where we were given theoretical readings to analyze, and then asked to translate the theoretical content discussed in the class into a specific design project.Actually, it challenged very controversial aspect of architecture: is it possible to closely translate written philosophy into corporeal architectural product. It seems that in this class for the first time I felt that it is probably possible.Theory and practice will never be equal or will never have perfect relationship. At the same time, defining what is the strategy of your product with the theoretical basis is a very strong and important move.So, I think that the syllabus was very interesting.",
    "Great selection of reading and categorization of case studies. Sequence was sensible: readings and discussions first, then half the semester to work on a final project. The Grasshopper introduction was also helpful.",
    "I think it would be better with a little less reading and a little more design. I really liked the confluence of theory and design but the ratio was tilted a bit to much to the theory.",
    "The course's division into theory then design, while enabling us to engage each subject more one at a time - hampered the development of the course.The theory section was extremely interesting and lively. The best selection of readings of any course at Yale so far.The design section needed more friction - more variables. It was too vauge and they theory too complex to just attack based on a few descriptive variables."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the goal of the course is mainly about fabrication, but I could not get enough time and technical information (strategies) to make a fa\u00e7ade system.",
    "My expectations were completely met.This class opened incredible room for creativity, since its essence is completely novel outlook on the facade.",
    "I expected a more technical assessment of facade design and performance, but in retrospect a broader study of meaning is more important in setting the stage for coherent design projects.",
    "Yes, the course was really well done. I think it would be better with a bit more technical instruction in terms of developing a clear technique.",
    "My expectations were to learn a bit about the history of facade design as well as some contemporary theory.The theory was crackerjack, but as a primer for an overall conception of the facade in design - it was a bit lacking. Mainly due to the constraints of time and also - my early misconceptions about the course.",
    "In general, I admire Brennan's ambition to synthesize theory and fabrication in his courses. Readings and discussions were good and pin ups were helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I wanted to know more about the specific precedence that show me effects of building fa\u00e7ade rather than philosophical and political aspects of building facade.",
    "The course was very valuable to me.Like I mentioned above, one big advantage of the class is consideration of latest theoretical works to provide a basis for the specific design.Yet another, and the most valuable advantage was, that for me this course raised the problem of the facade design to an unprecedented level, where the ideas of repetition, variation, and figuration worked together to generate very unusual visual effects, which have to do with theabsolutely novel idea of facade aesthetic and novel idea of design in whole.",
    "The course was a valuable choice: good readings, vigorous discussion, not an overwhelming workload.",
    "This was a incredibly valuable course both in the theory portion and the design portion.",
    "Incredibly valuable. My gripes about course layout are secondary to being able to explore the readings presented to us this semester. I was craving a contemporary discussion at Yale and I got it!",
    "I will continue to bring the discussions, readings, and topics into the network of my practice. I found the course to be of considerable value, and would recommend it to others."

   "comments": [
    "I think that teaching was very effective.Besides very interesting combination of theory and practical assignment in one course,we were given opportunity to utilize parametric software to generate various effects on the facade.It was very effective to experience how parametric tools influence formation of novel facade substances.I would like to thank our TA Ryan for his great help with the Grasshopper.",
    "The instructor was organized and open to let class discussions wander while keeping them to some degree in check. He was available for help outside of class hours.",
    "One thing that would be helpful is if in the discussion section the instructor game a brief summary lecture at the end, just a small thing. Also taking a class or too to get into the software on basic level would be better. Ryan was very helpful one on one.",
    "Brennan was very good at fading into the background of discussions to allow us to explore on our own. I feel that he could have been a tad bit more operative or vocal in his own critique or ideas - of which he obviously had, but withheld for our sake.",
    "Brennan's approach was both professional and generous towards all students, while maintaining a high level of course expectations.."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the time for such course was extremely limited.I would like to have one semester of the contemporary facade theory and another semester of facade fabrication within the same course.Thanks to the School for this class.",
    "It might help to introduce the production aspect of the class earlier, maybe by looking at readings in concert with some small study model or fabrication exercises. By early Novemeber, students probably need to have developed a certain technique or process of making in order to have a successful final project. Even simple, seemingly rigid exercises such as \"produce a 12\"x12\"x2\" pieces which demonstrates this...\" may be a good way to start.",
    "Slightly Less theory, slightly more making. More preliminary instruction on the software. Thats it! Good class.",
    "Projects could have been further explored and more developed had there been more exercises integrated into the course. If we were given at least two examples of facades from the readings\/case studios to reproduce as an exercise to familiarized ourselves with the digital tools then most of the slightly undercooked projects could have been stronger. Overall, the sequence was great because we were introduced to theories on facades and then given the opportunity to design one of our own while being conscious of the readings.",
    "Tighter integration of theory and design - perhaps in group charettes - which allow us to overcome some of the time issues of an 18 credit semester.",
    "\"Fabrication\" as an activity is extremely time consuming. After one has conceived a project working drawings need to be made, materials need to be ordered and time needs to be provided for experimentation\/failure. Failure in the fabrication process in school is an inevitable and essential part of the process. The syllabus as it was presented was very smart. Its only flaw was that it expected a one to one design progression through a series of design exercises. Again, it was a very well-thought out appealing progression of exercises, but it framed the working process narrowly. I would allow more time for fabrication in the future.In addition to being less specific about the way the work is done, I might recommend being more specific\/ambitious about the final form of the work. It is not difficult to drop work in an in-design template and fairly easily make a booklet. If students were working toward a final booklet it might help them focus the way the thought about the work. Also, requesting a 200 word statement might help students clarify their own thinking about the work and would obviously help make sense out of the work for the book. Just an idea."
