   "comments": [
    "In this course, I was able to better understand how eigenvectors and eigenvalues work, applied to many different kinds of situation (for many graphs). I learned how to better do mathematical proofs and discovered a whole new field of spectral graph theory. This course also helped building bridges with other fields, with some applications to optimization and random walk and probabilities, and abstract algebra. I enjoyed learning about the pretty math of the class.",
    "Basically, went from 0 to very reasonable proficiency in understanding what a graph Laplacian is, what eigenvectors and eigenvalues mean, understand the basics of diffusion. Gained a lot of practice with several proof writing approaches and several good skills in applied mathematics. Major insights into spectral theorem.",
    "Learned what an eigenvalue is",
    "I relearned a lot of linear algebra and was exposed to whatever Dan thinks is most interesting, which is basically very elegant results in spectral graph theory.",
    "I learned spectral graph theory, which basically means linear algebra interpretations of graphs. This graph gave me a much stronger intuition in linear algebra, and exposed me to new proof techniques. I became a stronger mathematician through this class.",
    "I really refined my knowledge of advanced linear algebra, but generally got a very nice overview of spectral graph theory. I got a sense for the sorts of bounds one can prove and the methods for doing so, as well as the algorithmic questions and recent advances. It was definitely good practice for various proof techniques (again, particularly drawing on linear algebra), which are more broadly applicable.",
    "Spectral graph theory",
    "Really tough problem sets, but Dan is great, and you learn a lot.",
    "Overview of spectral graph theory and its applications to a variety of problems.",
    "A variety of topics related to spectral graph theory.",
    "I learned a lot of linear algebra, as well as gained some intuition for dealing with graphs and matrices.",
    "Lots of linear algebra for graph related matrices. Some useful applications and techniques beyond gen scope of undergrad linear algebra.",
    "I learned about advanced proof techniques in linear algebra, as well as gaining intuitions for alternative frameworks to understand graph theory.",
    "Deep dive into graph theory in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The most interesting parts of the course for me were when we analyzed conductances, resistances and random walks, since these can be extended to real-world applications. A large part of the course also focuses on expander graphs, and while the math is pretty it can be unintuitive at times. This course can also help you get a decent working knowledge of linear algebra, which Yales actual lin alg courses (222 & 225) will unfortunately not do.",
    "I learnt a lot on spectral properties of graph, and some math (mainly linear algebra) associated with attacking problems on it.",
    "Spectral graph theory.",
    "This course was an excellent further exploration of questions in graph theory. I have a much stronger intuition of eigenvectors\/values and other spectral analysis methods, and I was challenged to write more concise and clear proofs.",
    "A deeply theoretical view of spectral graph theory, and more generally, linear algebra.",
    "More mathematical rigor in graphs and linear algerbra",
    "I learned about the basic theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric, positive semidefinite real-valued matrices, and their applications to various graph algorithms. More generally, I gained experience working with advanced topics in linear algebra and applying them to computational settings.",
    "At the core, it's a class that really strengthens your familiarity with linear algebra, graph theory, and analytic inequalities. A lot of cool topics are covered on the way, but I think the proof techniques seen in class and in the homework are what I will take away from this course.",
    "Basic concepts and interesting properties of graph representations",
    "Enhanced theoretical knowledge on Spectral Graph theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I found that the homework were extremely challenging and I wish there were other resources for the courses, than the (amazing) lectures notes from Professor Spielman. But since he's one of the creators of that field, it makes sense that only his notes were available for the class. I enjoyed working with my classmates on this class, I also learned a lot from them. Chris Harshaw was also an excellent TA for the course, giving us perspectives and insights on understanding the homework questions. Also, I usually spent between 25 and 30 hours on each of the homework and was never able to fully solve them.",
    "Strengths: the lectures and homework are really good. I felt the Professor's discussions on \"what are important\" and \"history of this field\" where very valuable. Course is very well organized. The lecture notes are very good. Weakness: I think I would have appreciated slightly more homework related to the spectral theorem, but this is a bit of pre-req so I'm not sure if it's appropriate. I would have appreciated more time on generating bounds by comparing to the complete graph, I felt that this section woudl actually have benefited from a \"worse proof\" (one that takes longer) if we could get more insight from the professor as we talked about the problem. This is a REALLY good course, it's hard to come up with a weakness.",
    "Strengths are: interesting material, excellent lectures, challenging\/fun problems. Only real weakness I can think of is that since we covered a lot of material without any review, it's hard to remember what we covered.",
    "Wonderful course!!!!! Could not be improved!",
    "Dan is a wonderful lecturer. He tends to give the intuition behind what we will spend the class doing at the beginning and then outlines the proof as he goes. However, sometimes the pieces aren't fully connected for me and I tend to get lost partway through class (around the 45 minute mark normally). This may be more my weakness than anything, however some additional connective tissue to motivate lemmas could be useful.",
    "The course is extremely well-taught and organized, and the homeworks are hard - but just the right level that they're possible to solve, and satisfying when you do. Professor Spielman is an excellent lecturer, who clearly put a lot of time and thought into picking topics and how exactly to describe them. He does so in a way that's intuitive and tries to show how researchers developed their ideas. It is difficult to think of any criticisms, except that perhaps the topics weren't always very coherent - in some cases, earlier parts of the course tied together with later courses, and Professor Spielman was very good about previewing\/highlighting these, but other topics felt pretty unrelated from all the others and were more like (disconnected) components. There wasn't necessarily a clear trajectory of building towards the topics at the end of the course, but that may just be the nature of the field: in the end, we did still get to talk about a lot of different, interesting topics.",
    "It is tough, but fair. If there was an \"official\" TA, instead of Chris who did not get paid, that would be great I think.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and well organized and the psets were challenging but rewarding.",
    "Problem sets are set at an appropriate level of difficulty - they are challenging enough for you to be forced to review the material, yet not so difficult as to be undo able. Dan goes a little too fast in class, so it's hard to know what's going on if you zone out for a even a minute.",
    "Professor Spielman was a great lecturer, but I wish that one of the problem sets involved implementing the concepts we learned in a simple way -- it would've been nice to see the applications of spectral graph theory to other fields.",
    "The rigor of this course was great, as was the general choice and sequence of topics covered. Sometimes problems on the problemsets were set up such that one little formula\/ neat trick from the lecture notes was all it took to solve it, which could be a little underwhelming. But overall Dan did a good job of making clear why the problems are worth solving.",
    "I think this is a very good course...but I do notice Dan loses half of students' attention when he tries to explain something very difficult, but I don't see a way other than students work harder to solve this problem.",
    "Pros: -beautiful material -taught by THE reference in the field -lecture notes are very good -content is well organized, following on a frequently-updated schedule available online, which really facilitates study Cons: -at least for my own taste, a bit too much math-oriented, focusing almost exclusively on proving theorems; I would like to have seen a least a few lectures on more concrete applications of SGT. -because the lecture notes are already so good, there's not a lot to be gained in class; prof. Spielman follows his notes almost to the letter, which means he usually skips the exact same details that are skipped in the notes. Therefore you need to come very prepared for class in order to follow everything and be able to ask good questions.",
    "I think the course is extremely strong. Dan's notes are invaluable, and I'm not sure that I could have done the class without them. I don't have much criticism.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Spielman. He was just incredible. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated a bit more emphasis on the applications (e.g. in machine learning), but given the amount of material we covered, it makes sense that it was not included.",
    "Dan Spielman is an amazing teacher. He speaks slowly and clearly, and his lectures and notes synthesize recent research in a way that is just simple enough to be accessible to students without glossing over important details. The only criticism I have is that I didn't really understand the big picture of what exactly the topics we learned about are used for, though I think that can be clarified with more experience in this field.",
    "Strengths are that it introduces graph from very basic concepts to complex properties, where you can get a deep understanding of it. Weaknesses are that at later stages of the course a better background of number theory, graph theory are required.",
    "Could improve theoretical knowledge"

   "comments": [
    "This course is a graduate course, hence particularly challenging. Professor Spielman goes pretty fast and there's a lot of personal work to understand everything that's covered. The homework are also pretty challenging. I would recommend it to grad students or advanced undergrads, because this is a much greater intellectual challenge and much greater workload than the other classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes I would. I'd warn them that this is not easy, but it is worth it. This is sort of a once in a lifetime chance for me, and I learned many topics I've always wanted to know. It really was one of the best courses I've ever taken.",
    "Fantastic class covering some beautiful material. Some of the problems are quite hard,",
    "Take this because you like Spielman and want to see some beautiful math. But be prepared to dump whole weekends into problem sets and work for hours at a time with little to show for it. At the end, once I'd solved it, I thought it was satisfying; ask yourself if you'll feel the same way. Definitely take with a friend.",
    "Only if you are willing to do the problem sets. They are your entire grade and they do take a LOT of time and energy, but very much worth it if you are interested in the material.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work and are ok being lost some of the time, do it. It's much better if you have friends or can make friends to collaborate on with psets. I found most of the psets quite rewarding, even if they destroyed my sleep schedule.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Spielman is an excellent lecturer, who puts a TON of thought into the topics he presents and how he presents them. The material is interesting and interdisciplinary, and the proof techniques you hone seem pretty broadly applicable. The problem sets are often difficult and will require time, effort, and creativity, but are SO worthwhile to do - it's a thrill to get the solution, and they really reinforce understanding of the lecture material.",
    "Yes, but you should have some proof based math background, especially in things like discrete math.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Professor Spielman is an incredible lecturer and the content of this class was very interesting. Many of the topics covered relate closely to his own areas of research which made the course all the better as he is very passionate about the material.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who would like to learn some advanced linear algebra and is very comfortable with proofs and working on difficult math problems - the problem sets will be challenging and enjoyable to anyone who appreciates mathematics.",
    "Definitely more work than undergrad class but worthwhile If you out the time in",
    "I would recommend the course if you have a strong foundation in linear algebra and there's some reason that you're interested in graph theory!",
    "Yes. The material is extremely interesting if you have an inclination towards pure math. Dan Spielman is also an amazing professor and is very clear in his lectures.",
    "Yes, take it if you like pretty math + graph theory, and if youre tired of taking poorly structured CS classes. Especially recommende if you have friends taking it with you, as its always easier to work in groups.",
    "Definitely yes. Dan is a great instructor.",
    "If you are really into math and theory, with a strong math background on linear algebra, you should definitely take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in furthering their understanding of topics in linear algebra or graph theory.",
    "Yes. Very interesting material for those who would like to learn more about it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student working with algorithms based on linear algebra, especially those in machine learning and scientific computing. Although my own research doesn't involve graph algorithms, this course gave me a lot of practice with mathematical techniques relevant to computational applications in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to take a challenging math class, but perhaps on material that is easier to motivate (and more relevant to hot topics like learning theory) than other advanced pure math courses. Dan is also an awesome lecturer, definitely worth the 3 year wait!",
    "Yes, if he needs relevant training and knowledge.",
    "Yes"
