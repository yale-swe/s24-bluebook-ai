    "Useful course for thinking about how the process of writing articles for publication. Strengthened my writing and my understanding of what goes into a strong article.",
    "Wrote a research paper alongside peers. Learned about how to present work as going through the research process, and thought more deeply about what it meant to write a history article.",
    "Writing a research paper, techniques",
    "How to write a research paper and publish it.",
    "This class will teach you how to write a publishable, graduate level research paper.",
    "I learned how to wrangle a body of research into an academic article draft in a relatively short amount of time, a valuable skill that I know will serve me well in the future. I also learned about the peer-review historical publication process - practical information we don't often get in graduate school - which demystified submissions and gave me the confidence to submit my work. I can't thank Professor Meyerowitz enough for crafting a terrific syllabus and leading the class toward exciting new historical work.",

   "comments": [
    "Useful breakdown of articles, helpful to focus so much on our own writing. Could use more advice on types of journals.",
    "It was perfect!",
    "I think it would be positive to reduce the number of articles we read and to either spend fewer weeks reading articles or read fewer articles each week. It was really helpful, but it felt like we did reach a point of diminishing returns.",
    "My only suggestion to tweak the syllabus is to have slightly less assigned reading in the first several weeks, when students are trying to establish paper topics. I found it very useful to discuss craft and style, but it wasn't clear that we needed to read fresh articles each week to be able to have a discussion about different elements of writing a successful article.",
    "This course was a fantastic overview of how to strategically approach writing a paper. Professor Meyerowitz offered a lot of feedback and did so in a timely way-- it enabled us to turn over multiple drafts. Very helpful."
