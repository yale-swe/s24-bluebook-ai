    "Take this course to learn about how schools shape housing choices, how some families do have CHOICE in the school shopping process while others do not, and to learn about the beautiful educational backgrounds of each of your peers in the class.",
    "Would recommend this course to anybody and everybody! Yale needs more professors like Mira Debs!",
    "This class is super interesting, and very different. In the future, it will probably be a great class to take. Right now, content is somewhat compromised by an overly structured syllabus. If assignments are reorganized a bit, I would not hesitate to recommend this class to any student interested in doing more contemporary studies situated in and beyond New Haven.",
    "A class that is really relevant to a lot of debate in education right now -- there are a lot of small assignments, and in some ways it can be nice to spread work out over the semester, but at other times it can be frustrating. I like how Mira has us work in small groups but some other strategies can feel very high school. That's fine, it's just good to know going in. Mira is really caring and thoughtful, and good to get to know outside of class!",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale, and I'm saying that as a second-semester senior. As one of the few students in the class who wasn't an education-studies scholar, the class helped me meet other students with similar passions for education. I've left the class with an incredibly strong desire to pursue teaching in some way, shape, or form after I graduate. (Admittedly, I went into the class with a desire to teach, but the class has certainly strengthened this desire.) My knowledge of the issues facing the American education system was very limited at the beginning of the semester. I now have a much deeper, nuanced understanding of the issues. I left every class with food for thought and shared these thoughts with my friends (who weren't in this class) on a regular basis. Similarly, after the readings (which I did all of -- gasp!), I had thoughts, thoughts that I wanted to share. I was able to tie so many of the ideas in the class to my own experiences. Personal experiences frequently came up during class discussions. I've often been frustrated by the distance between academia and everyday experience; this class totally avoided that distance. Mira was also just a wonderful professor. A few moments stand out in my head. At one point, I signed up for a 20-minute office hour slot to talk about my final project. Mira stayed for twice that time, both giving me resources to work with and getting to know me better. At another point during one of our classes, she described her own experience as a teacher, specifically noting a mistake that she had made. I found this to be very courageous. Finally, she invited us all to her house for dinner at the end of the semester! This actually happens! I always thought this only happened in books. Long story short, take this class if you're passionate about education and especially if you haven't taken an ed-studies class before!",
    "Cities, Suburbs and School Choice is a seminar that discusses what it means for one to choose schools. School choice, this class explores, isn't just about choosing magnet or charter schools but can be tracked historically by residential patterns and legal decisions. This course looks at the multitude of school choice options, including the concept of choosing a school by choosing a neighborhood, and efforts to use school choice to integrate schools. I would definitely recommend this course -- while 2016 was Professor Debs' first time teaching it, I know she and the class will only get better once she works out the kinks.",
    "Maybe. If you are really interested in the subject matter, definitely. A general interest in education, I might wait a year or so until Mira has a bit more experience. The assignments are kind of a lot of work and class discussion wasn't run really well. Mira is really nice and honestly I think she will get better with more experience, she is very open to feedback and suggestions. As is though, I would say its only worth it if you are actually interested in the politics and issues of race, schools, and school choice.",
    "This is SUCH A GOOD CLASS. The readings are not too heavy (most weeks are fewer than 100 pages) and soooo good. You get to learn a lot about New Haven and Hartford, and conduct a field observation in New Haven that's really cool. Most of all, this class deals with pressing problems of educational inequality and the possibilities\/problems for race and class integration. I consider myself fairly well-versed about education policy, but so much that I learned in this class was new to me and really shaped the way I think about public schools. The focus on race and class is really excellent, and the instructor encourages the use of personal experience in a constructive, discussion-fostering way. Our class grew close as a result. I really really really recommend this class - this material is so important and Mira Debs teaches it very well.",
    "This course is a good overview of school choice and the problems and benefits associated with each type of school choice. It offers perspectives on school choice from families both within and outside of the city and the suburbs."
