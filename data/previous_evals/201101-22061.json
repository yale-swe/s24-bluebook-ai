    "Huge time commitment, but good payoff. It was fun, and is probably the reason I got an internship at Fog Creek this summer. The coding is excellent practice, and the OS itself is great to talk to interviewers about. Just choose your teammates wisely for the group work.",
    "Definitely recommend this if you love programming and want to learn a lot about operating systems (not just windows and unix). Bryan Ford is an excellent professor and you will enjoy the class. It is very time consuming though, but if you have a good team, you won't even notice it.",
    "I highly recommend OSes. I think it should be a required course. I learned so much about how a computer actually works, and also about programming. Take it! It's worth the amount of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in OS hacking, has an extensive programming background and 30 hours per week for a single class.",
    "This course is extremely time consuming and incredibly worthwhile.Don't expect to get much other programming done in the same semester, however."
