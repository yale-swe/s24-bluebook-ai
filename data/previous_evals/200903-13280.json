    "If you want to learn German, do it!",
    "It's a good intro to German; you really do learn a lot at a pretty quick pace. Our section was pretty stress-free, but I think that some of the other classes might have been a little bit more intense.",
    "German 110 is a lot of fun. And we cover a lot of stuff within a semester. Definitely take it if you want to learn German.",
    "If you're interested in German, definitely take it. It's an extremely fun language, and the department is relatively small and more relaxed than other language departments.",
    "You definitely learn German grammar and vocabulary quickly, but you have to do a lot of the learning on your own.",
    "Yes, but I would warn them we don't speak that much and that you have to learn the grammar on your own."
