   "comments": [
    "An interesting class for those unfamiliar with the material. Not terribly structured, so you will only get out of it as much as you put into it. That can be very little or a fairly good amount. This could be a good extra class (not too demanding in workload).",
    "Awesome course. Take it, if you want to open your mind to different expressions of spiritualityor to a different approach to Medieval History. Everything in the course, from the readings, to the lectures, to the section, was thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend Christian Mysticism to another student - especially if they are interested in religious studies.",
    "A sweeping introduction to realm of Christian mystical thought, these days a much overlooked component of Christianity. The class is worthwhile mostly because Carlos Eire is so fine a teacher and so kind a professor, but also for the grains of brilliance among the readings, which can tend toward dryness at times.",
    "If you have any interest in religious history at all, I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Eire is wonderful and the readings are really interesting. However, I would warn that although it is cross-listed, THIS IS NOT A HISTORY COURSE. The main focus of the class is the theology of the mystics and the midterm and final are both entirely text based. Also bear in mind that there will be a fair amount of super catholics in this class and if you misinterpret the text in section they might get very upset and think you are a heretic. Overall though, you get to learn about some crazy people and listen to good lectures and the class is not too much work.",
    "I honestly cannot recommend Christian Mysticism to another student unless the syllabus were to change quite drastically. I think the amount of reading should be reduced at least by a little bit so that, rather than trying to finish a work in time, we would be able to really engage with the parts of the work we have been assigned. Similarly, the lectures should be more focused on the works we are reading: providing specific information about the context in which they were written and helping us to understand these difficult texts within that context. That being said, I did enjoy going to lecture and enjoy doing the readings.",
    "Where to start? This class is something of a whirlwind tour of Christian mystical writings since the 4th century (contrary to the title). Each week you will have a different primary source text to read (from the Life of St. Anthony by St. Athanasius to St. Teresa of Avila's Interior Castle); lectures and sections follow along. There is far, far too much to absorb in that amount of time. As a result, lectures center primarily on the historical, rather than theological, aspects of the different authors. Section tries to go further in depth, but in my opinion ultimately failed to do so in a meaningful way because there was just too much, that many of us understood very poorly, and often could not realistically have finished reading. There is a paper (8-12 pages) due before Thanksgiving on a topic of your choice, in which you may choose to delve into someone's theology if you so desire. Prof. Eire is a very good lecturer, but there is so much more than can be fit into two 50-minute periods per week. Also, you should know that a sizable number of students take this class for their own personal reasons (i.e., they are Catholic and these writers, many saints, are important to them), and if this describes you, you may find it difficult to shift into an academic mindset. According to Prof. Eire (himself presumably a Catholic, but he doesn't say so), he only teaches this every three years or so because the books make him feel so inadequate (you will understand if and when you have read them) - so if you want to take this and it's being offered, take it, as it's probably worthwhile even with its flaws.",
    "The material's really interesting, and definitely accessible even if you don't have a religious studies background. Workload is ok--a final and a midterm (both pretty straightforward and ~an hr long) with a 10p paper and section. Lectures were interesting but not directly related to the bulk of the theological information, which you have to understand from the readings.",
    "I was rather disappointed in this course. Lectures were often rambling and only tangential to the reading we were supposed to complete for that week, even though the course was explicitly described as a primary source-driven class. Professor Eire rarely explained the readings, either, even though medieval religious texts are rather difficult to read and require some explanation. I often felt lost, and he did little in lecture to help. The exams were ridiculous as well: we had less than an hour to complete two ID's and an essay, and the grading was largely based on the argumentative strength of the essay. The exams became more an exercise in timed-writing ability than in knowledge of the material or ability to argue effectively, as the time limits he placed were absurd. And he tries to bill the course as equally accessible to non-Catholics, but Catholics have a distinct advantage over non-Catholic students in terms of understanding Catholic theology (which is crucial to our understanding to these mysticsbut surprisingly under-discussed given Eire's background), Catholic terminology, Catholic history, and even name-recognition of other saints. The final essay question, which concerned how mystics related to Catholic orthodoxy, was far less accesible to non-Catholics (and even my fallen Catholic friends) who don't really have much of an idea of what constitutes \"orthodoxy\" beyond the scattered and largely unexplained references in our readings. (I mean, I was having trouble and am an Episcopalian, which really isn't that far off.)In summary, take something else. You'll be happier. I've heard good things about Eire's other classes, so just wait a little and take those.",
    "Amazing teacher but the topic was not as interesting as I'd hope. Also, this is NOT a history class. It's cross listed as one, but it's far more Religious Studies than History. And the lectures don't always have a whole lot to do with the specific readings or what will be on the test. If you REALLY like the topic, then take it.",
    "The subject is wonderful and I would definitely recommend the class if you have a lot of time to devote to the readings. While the lecture was engaging, it left something to be desired as far as real explanation of the readings, or substantial points about the context of the works. Because the subject is difficult, simplifying it to the point of loosing some of the richness was what this class aimed to do. That being said, the midterm paper was really interesting to write and gave me a chance to delve more into the subject in a way that the class was sadly lacking."
