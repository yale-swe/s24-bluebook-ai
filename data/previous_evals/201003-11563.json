   "comments": [
    "The combination of problem sets, facility reports and client consultation was too much. I think the problem sets or one of the reports should be eliminated so students can focus more on the client project.",
    "The field trips were very interesting but having them every other week for six weeks was tiresome, especially considering the effort involved in the facility visit reports.I don't think that having four faculty teach this course worked very well. It essentially made the class low on all of their priority lists. Feedback and assistance for the term project was slow in coming.",
    "Q6,7,9,10: Some of the classes themselves were slow, but there was a good amount of work resulting from the facility visits. The visits were very useful, and mostly well organized. The initial visit (Wheelebrator) was lacking in that the environmental professional there was not available when we visited unfortunately.",
    "Overall, the course seemed to lack a cohesive focus, although this is to be expected somewhat considering the broad range of industries, processes and disciplines being considered. Marian's lectures were incredibly informative and well-presented. Much of Tom's lectures were rehashes of the reading material. Julie's lectures were droll and uninspired. Bill Ellis' guest lecture would be better served at the end of the class to tie in the cost\/benefit capacity of structuring greening financial investments.",
    "Question 4: The course load was a bit heavier but this corresponded to a 4-credit class.Question 5: The instructors were receptive to requests by the full class to move around deadlines. Otherwise, the sheer number of instructors made delivering concepts difficult.Question 6: The course was sometimes a bit slow, particularly when the material was essentially common knowledge.Question 7: I think four professors are too many to team-teach this course. The number of instructors and the differences across their styles and perceptions of the course left the overall class feeling discombobulated and less comprehensive than expected.Question 9: Many of the field trips involved very complicated information, which we weren\u0092t versed on, but were expected to understand for the related assignments. As I would like to have a thorough understanding of these business operations, it was frustrating to continue to bump into these information gaps in the basic infrastructure and engineering of the various facilities we visited."

    "Field trips and client project",
    "The field trips were great, and while I didn't enjoy writing the facility reports, I actually learned a fair bit from them. I would have loved to shadow an actual sustainability consultant in a facility walk-through and get more access to concrete quantitative tools to analyze energy and water usage of facilities. More case studies and less general overview information would have been useful. In fact, I think grounding every lecture with the in-depth case study of a specific company would make the lectures significantly more useful. In lectures we reviewed what we read in the book--so I eventually stopped doing the readings. I wasn't getting much additional learning from doing both simultaneously.",
    "The facility visits were all very interesting and gave great insights into the manufacturing sector, which few of us have had any exposure to.",

   "comments": [
    "amount of work and problem sets",
    "This course needs to address the lack of data provided by the facilities we visited and the companies we worked with for our final projects. Company representatives frequently didn't have answers to simple questions like \"how much energy does this facility use in a year?\" or \"what are your major emissions constraints?\" it would be helpful in future to have them prepare some basic facts and figures prior to the class visits. Without some of these data, the facility visit reports wound up being pretty weak.",
    "Facility Reports- The facility reports became redundant. I think the would be more valuable if they allowed for creativity in the way the report was structured. It was unclear who the audience of the facility reports was supposed to be (Admittedly, I neglected to ask). It would likely be valuable to modify the facility report assignments so that students produce a report similar to what they might be expected to do as a consultant or other professional. Exposure to different ways of reporting on the visits would be valuable.Problem Sets- The problem sets were very simple, and so contributed little to the learning experience. The Simapro problem is an exception, but I would have liked some a \"dust-off\" of some sort regarding the Simapro exercise. After submitting the assignment, it would be helpful to review how someone trained in Simapro would have done the assessment.Because our exposure to SLCA was limited to the Environmentally Responsible Product Matrix, most students assumed that the ERPM is synonymous with SLCA. If SLCA is a topic of the next class, I think that discussion should include comparison of other methods besides the ERPM.",
    "Lectures could have had more substance",
    "Need more feedback and discussion following assignments. It seemed like we were would hand something in and then immediately move on to the next topic",
    "Professor Zimmerman's slides were very cluttered and resulted in a lot of reading verbatim from the instructor. This is something that most of us have been instructed to avoid in our own presentations, including in this class. So the opportunity exists to teach by example in this case.",
    "-It would be great to have real experts talk about supply chains, EMS who know this stuff. Pulling some text from a website of a corporation engaged in CSR is not the same as what is really going on in the field.-Zimmerman talks too fast-There were way to many field trip reports that it became very redundant and didn't encourage further learning-There were inconsistencies between the syllabus and actual grading; the TAs graded the assignments differently, sometimes too harshly-Bad communication between students, TAs, and professors-Course lectures didn't cover the readings at all and were extremely general",
    "Somewhat beyond the control of the instructors - facility personnel giving tours of the grounds could have provided more pertinent information that was more relevant to our report writing.",
    "The lectures somehow needed to engage more with the excitement of the projects and trips. I think more case studies might be a part of this.",
    "Better direction and more through guidance on the group term projects",
    "More use of environmental accounting. Weight problem sets more evenly with the effort required. Make students participate more, don't let us get away with being lazy and not discussing things or not answering questions.",
    "the slow pace of in-class learning and the lack of direct connection between what happens out of the classroom with what happens in the classroom"

I think preparing students, at least for the first facility visit, with a long list of examples of the types of questions a sustainability expert would ask to generate a report, would have been helpful.",
    "Yes, but just too much work to do.",
    "Not really. I expected to gain quantitative skills for assessing corporate environmental performance. In the end it seemed like everything we did was rooted in questionable assumptions.",

It's challenging when every group member has different priorities and a different level of commitment to the project, but all in all, we worked well together.",
    "the group assigned to our project was very cumbersome. There were eight people working on largely separate tasks and coordination was a challenge. It felt like we spent more time meeting and trying to establish plans for work than actually working.",
    "Advantages: Problem solving in real life typically involves group work, so this was good practice. Helps expose you to the different knowledge bases and skill sets of peers. Creates accountability to do quality work.Disadvantages: Not everyone is willing to do same amount of work. Sometimes have to compromise the way you think something should be done (this is both good and bad).",

    "It was good to work in groups and share the workload of the client projects",
    "Allowed us to really engage with the GBO tools and methods in an applied capacity.",
    "The group work held the promise of being a great, interactive project for a real company, but the very short timeline and limited information left us wanting more out of it.",
    "Group work was difficult due to the insufficient guidance we received. I appreciated hearing my peers' perspectives.",

   "comments": [
    "My foremost criticism about the class was the overall lack of data. A consistent theme was finding ways of improving business processes from an environmental impact standpoint. However, at many of the facilities we visited the management was not forthcoming with the information necessary to establish what their baseline environmental performance was. Our group project was to conduct a life cycle assessment for a major manufacturer, whose representatives didn't give us the data necessary to even understand some of the more obscure processes. Inevitably we had to make assumptions in order to circumvent these problems, which I knew would happen occasionally when the curriculum was outlined, but it happened so frequently that I didn't feel like we got any experience producing justifiable environmental analyses of business processes.",
    "Ask the instructors ahead of time what kind of questions to ask at the facility visits. After the first one or two, you start to learn this on your own, but it will be helpful for your first report(s) if you already have the mindset of an environmental professional. Also, participate in the give&take of the everyday class with comments\/questions, or you may feel bored.",
    "Choose a client project that excites you. Try to be innovative in applying what is learned in the class to the project.",
    "Choose a topic that you really enjoy for the group assignment and choose your team mates well (if possible)",
    "Try to get as much detail out of the field trips as possible, because getting more of a sense (in order of magnitude estimates) of where the biggest environmental impacts are would be helpful, because all too often this class can get into vagaries.",
    "Carefully evaluate whether the facility visited scheduled are to places\/industries of interest to you, rather than just whether the course as a whole looks relevant to your career aspirations.",
    "Write out a skeleton of your facility report before going on the visit. The headings and sections can all be written beforehand by looking at the book's examples, also, most of the introduction information for the facility can be found online before going to the site.",
    "class attendance and reading is, unfortunately, optional",
    "This is an important if you are interested in environmental management and industrial ecology. The Prof. are excellent and the field trips are very educative. However, this has a heavy course work including five field trips and a project work."
