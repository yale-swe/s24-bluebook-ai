    "Turner's studio is always a great practice to perceive space and concepts as well as realistic considerations.",
    "So many skills! I really felt encouraged to learn to work with new materials, for example, I had never really been in the woodshop until this term. I learned how to weld and improved my drawing skills. I also learned a lot about a way of approaching architecture that is unique to Turner Brooks-- one that is very tactile and grounded and that appreciates the beauty in every day architecture as well as famous buildings.",
    "Self-direction, internal motivation, self-encouraged exploration.",
    "Newfound appreciation for the vernacular. Close care to detail. Consideration of the experience.",
    "This studio does wonders for your creative process, but only if you let go and just go with the flow of things. I felt that I learnt a lot about my own design priorities when left to my own devices, but still remaining somehow tethered to the given assignment."

    "I would hope Turner can make more suggestions.",
    "I LOVED this course in comparison to Junior Studio fall and spring. Having an instructor who was encouraging but not stifling was such a change, and to feel like they wanted us to succeed was really wonderful. Rather than being scared of reviews, I was excited, happy to show my work and push myself to produce more and better models and drawings instead of feeling that I would be yelled at if I didn't. I thought we could have had a few more in-studio pin ups, without critics, because I would have liked the opportunity to hone my presentation skills. But overall this class was such a wonderful experience, 10\/10. I'm glad I didn't give up last year.",
    "This studio could use a little more intensity for the third project. It was great that we were allowed self-guidance and individual evaluation of the amount of work we wanted to produce, but I felt like my project stagnated for good few weeks after I established the initial workings of it without the consistent class-wide pin-ups or more insistent probing from Turner or Katie.",
    "At times more challenging criticism during desk crits may have been nice.",
    "I loved that the studio was given so much leeway to interpret and steer the given assignment. There are no quick and fast rules or formulaic answers in this studio, but rather an open, spontaneous, meaningful and absolutely fun exploration of space, and in our particular studio, important social problems as it relates to architecture."

   "comments": [
    "Since you have to take it, I will offer some suggestions. Tell Turner all your ideas, be honest to him. The more you say and show him at dest critics, the more you learn from him.",
    "OF COURSE. If you've survived Junior Year, you will be so pleasantly surprised at the positive attitude Turner has to architecture and that he curates in the studio culture. This class will make you remember why you love studio and the major.",
    "You know the drill by now."
