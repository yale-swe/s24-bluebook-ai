    "Great class. Learn the basics. Helps a lot if you are somewhat of a musician beforehand.",
    "I thought this class would be my 'easier' course of the semester, and it was. But, this does not mean that I enjoyed it. I actually kind of despised going to this class, as I felt the \"problem sets\" (which took forever) were a waste of time and that I emerged from the course with nothing. But, if you're looking for a pain-in-the-a** class to take to get another credit that's relatively easy, I guess this is it. Still, I do not recommend this. So many more classes that are interesting and actually beneficial. Don't waste a Yale credit on this class. Also, I have no musical background, whereas most other students did; this made the class extremely frustrating, as I was 'learning' everything for the first time while everyone else glided through the course with ease.",
    "If you have no music background, this is the class for you. If you have some musical background, but not enough to take 205, then this class will feel like not enough of a challenge. There is a lot of homework that can sometimes get tedious. Still, the grading makes up for it.",
    "Great first music theory course, work is spread out across semester. You have to do work, but it's not too bad. I'd recommend, a good fifth class.",
    "Absolutely necessary class if you play any instrument but don't know how to read music or music theory. You will get an excellent foundation on the basics of harmony that will make you such more confident with your instrument. Plus, you got to listen to the Beatles and Beethoven and \"Be My Baby\" in class! Jennifer was a great teacher (has great taste in music too), always ready to answer questions and always willing to help you.",
    "This class is a lot of work (though if you do the work, you'll get a good grade on the class), but you definitely learn a lot.",
    "Yes, especially if you play any instruments but don't know the theory behind things. Basically anyone who is interested in music should know the fundamentals and this is a good class to do that with."
