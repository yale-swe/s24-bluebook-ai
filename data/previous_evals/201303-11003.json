    "Why are you even reading this? Take it if you must. The sad thing about this class is that the material is actually really interesting, it's taught superbly (both Simon and Koelle are amazing, clear, and engaging, which is rare), and could be a gem of a class and nothing people complained about. If only it wasn't crawling with gunner premeds and exams and reward such gunners. You have to know details (which is not the professors' fault, just biochemistry's) and prepared to compete with a top quintile (i.e., \"A\") that gets>90 every exam. If you're not working in this class, then someone else is. Really hard. Good luck.",
    "take this if required for your major. it's a good class, but not gut",
    "Absolutely. This class is hard but it doesn't matter. I don't care if a class takes work.Classes live and die by how well they are organized. This class was organized. Everything was straightforward. The professors tell you exactly what you should be studying. I did not mind putting forth hours and hours of studying to succeed in this class because the material taught was well chosen, tactfully put together, and presented logically. Very few classes at Yale live up to this standard. The material is not hard, but the other kids in the class will absolutely DESTROY the midterms so you have to be on your game around midterm time. The psets take literally 25 minutes to complete per week, and the lecture course (Michael Koelle's portion especially) is so exceptionally well taught you will stay awake every time. Take this class over MCDB. You will actually learn something.",
    "Yes, I would recommend MB&B300 to other students. It was a very challenging, but worthwhile class.",
    "Take it over the MCDB course. Biochem will always be a lot of work, but this class breaks it up into manageable chunks and minimizes the amount of memorization you have to do. This class is full to the brim with premeds scrambling for the A at the end of the tunnel and only 20% get one. It's like the Hunger Games. I'd recommend you don't get caught up in the madness and try to actually learn a few things so your picture doesn't light up the night sky over heroic music. I'm just glad there won't be a Quarter Quell for a while yet.",
    "It's overall a decent course, though it's hard to do really well in because of all the premeds. The material in the first half is all facts and mechanisms of proteins (but presented in an interesting way, not in aboring memorize this fact and that fact way). The second half is much more integrative, covering the different pathways of metabolism. This last half includes much more of the medicine side of biochemistry, or at least the homework does. The course really isn't that hard, it's just that there is a lot of material to cover and they go through it really quickly. If you keep up, you'll do just fine. And from what I've heard, this course is much better than the one offered by the MCDB department.",
    "You probably have to take this for your major, but you'll probably also like it! Totally worth it and so relevant to medicine and science in general.",
    "This was probably\u00e2\u0080\u0094scratch that\u00e2\u0080\u0094this was the best science lecture course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale. The lecturers, Matt Simon and Michael Koelle, were amazing. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re passionate, knowledgeable, well-spoken, and well-organized\u00e2\u0080\u0094all at the same time. The TAs were hit or miss.. some were brilliant; others, not so much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There was a pset a week: about 3 questions, one of which is actually graded. Two quizzes, two midterms, and a final. The course makes you know very specific details and makes you extrapolate ideas based off of what is taught.Matt Simon was brilliant. I believe this was his first time teaching a class at Yale, and he was fabulous. At the beginning, you could tell he was a little nervous, but his lectures were great. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-organized, knowledgeable\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little soft-spoken, but you can see that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passionate about the material and really cares that his students take something away from lecture.Michael Koelle was great! This was my second time having him as a lecturer, and he has a way with teaching. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enthusiastic, knowledgeable, well-versed, and well-prepared.Section was kind of useful? They would go over the last pset and last couple of lectures, hitting key points. My particular TA was lackluster\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been more well-prepared and confident. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very comforting when you go to section and your TA actually states that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I ended up going to other sections.",
    "It's a really good class, but I wish they wouldn't say \"don't focus on the details\" or \"don't memorize\" in the beginning of the semester. I felt like I truly had a good understanding of the metabolism\/many of the processes that we covered, but it didn't show in the exams unless I had spent time memorizing all of the tiny details.",
    "I haven't taken MCDB biochem, but this is a great option! As far as science classes go, this one is great!",
    "Fantastic course, best one I've taken at Yale so far, quitepossibly the best class I've ever had in terms of content. That being said, I was going in very excited to learn the material, and if you don't care about the chemistry of how living things work, you won't be interested and probably won't like it. But if you are even vaguely curious about how your body works on the atomic and molecular level, it is truly amazing. The weekly problem sets were manageable, and the lectures were taught in a very clear way. I loved it and even though there is a lot of material to learn by the end for the final, I really came away feeling like I learned a tremendous amount and have a much greater appreciation for the living world.",
    "Totally would recommend if you like science obviously",
    "Take it if you are premed, it will be very very useful for the MCAT. It's also a fascinating class.",
    "difficult class (when it comes to exams), but worth it in the end. whenstudying for the final and taking it, i realized how much i learned and i can honestly say this is probably the class at yale that i learned the most.watch out for the curve. crazy premeds...",
    "Absolutely",
    "This class presents some very useful, interesting material, and I really feel that I have learned something. That being said, the lectures did get quite boring and you may find yourself sleeping frequently. Also, the weekly work is not much (a problem set every week), but the tests require a lot of studying (much of which is just raw memorization of details in slides).",
    "Difficult course. You are probably only taking it because you need it for your major and premed. Also there is really not a curve since there are a lot of intense MB&B and premed students in this class - so you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really relay on that grade wise. There were moments I hated it and moments I thought that material was fascinating. If you are interested and willing to work you will probably find it rewarding.",
    "This class was really well taught! It was probably one of the most relevant and interesting biology courses I have taken at Yale. The problem sets are short, so they don't take a long time to complete. The TAs are informative and helpful. The biggest struggle with the course is keeping up with the sheer amount of information. You will surely learn a lot in this course. There are two midterms, two quizzes, and a final. All of them were fair. Just make sure to allot enough time to study for the final, because there is a lot of stuff to know.",
    "If you're taking it, it's probably because you have to. It's generally a good course without too much work, but prepare for tests with very hard curves.",
    "A good class overall, with proficient professors who supplement in-class material with extra material (a 15-minute \"supplement\" each class) about how biochemistry is applied in modern scientific and medical fields. The course requires a lot of memorization, and to do well on exams you will have to know every single detail that is posted on the lecture slides (yes, even insignificant, seemingly trivial facts that were barely even mentioned in lecture). If you have a basic understanding of biology and organic chemistry you won't have any trouble understanding the concepts. Curve is generous, with top 20% getting A's, next 20% A-'s, etc. You don't need to read the book to do well, you simply need to know everything on the slides. However the book can help. Section is mostly unhelpful unless you really don't understand something.",
    "one of the best science courses at yale. it takes some time investment but its worth it.",
    "Yes! It is a difficult course to do well in and is a lot of work, but the material is very interesting. This was one class where do not regret taking even if I don't get an A.",
    "In terms of the quality of the lecturers, it's a great class, and the material is quite interesting. However, I would caution any student considering taking this not to underestimate the workload.... if you try to put off studying until a few days before the midterms, as I did, it can be so overwhelming to learn all the material, because there is just so much of it. They claim that they want you to understand the \"principles\" but they end up testing you on many small details. Try to take this when you have time to keep up with it as you go along. I thought the tests were very difficult, and unfortunately grading tended to be very picky. It's one of those classes in which it's very difficult to get a solid A, but almost impossible to get below a B-. I would recommend it, but it is definitely a very competitive class.",
    "If you want to learn a TON, take this class. If you are confident in your memorization skills, even better. I'd recommend this class to anybody who cares about how the body works, and isn't afraid of a big bad stack of flashcards.",
    "The professors are really great lecturers, the material is a LOT but interesting. The curve in this class is wild. The material is just as hard as orgo I think with 80-95 being the averages on the exams. Proceed with caution, especially if you're not MB&B and are MCDB, other, etc. The class is very well organized, and you really need to keep up with it especially during metabolism. You learn a lot, probably more than the MCDB counterpart, but the curve is ridiculous. Most of the lower half drops out after the first midterm, tightening up the curve for the other exam.",
    "well taught class, seemingly straight-forward info, and relatively hard exams",
    "Most of the time you have to take this for your major\/pre-med requirement. It's not really that exciting due to the amount of memorization but it's definitely true that they taught us a lot of things that you need to know to understand biochemistry. It's definitely informative and some of the concepts are pretty beautiful.",
    "Life is beautiful",
    "Excellent overall - some of the material towards the beginning is a bit dry and detail-oriented (e.g. memorize certain carbohydrate structures for the 2nd midterm), but the second half is mostly geared towards understanding different fundamental pathways and how they interact. As Prof. Koelle likes to say, biochemistry is intellectually satisfying because it answers big questions (how does our body deal with starvation?) on a molecular level.Psets take only about an hour a week - meant to be like 3-4 test questions. Two midterms based on lecture slides. They highly encourage reading the textbook, but it isn't strictly necessary to do well if you go through the lecture notes very carefully. I'm sure it would have helped cementmaterial over time, but there's just a lot of reading and it's hard to keep up. Textbook reading also makes the difference between this being a very time-consuming class and an average time-consuming class. The final requires a lot of studying, so make sure it isn't your third final in a row.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Everything miraculously comes together by the end of the course. This is the first science class I've taken at Yale where the material is taught so well that it makes sense and everything we've learned just falls perfectly into place. The class does really well overall so it's a hard curve but it's definitely worth it to take. I've gained a completely new appreciation for biochem and still can't get over how amazing the material\/this science is. I learned so much about metabolism, it's incredible.",
    "Beware the crazy pre-meds in this class. The class was actually pretty interesting and well-taught. But the curve in this class made me more worried about doing well on the tests than about actually learning the material for the sake of learning. Lots of work, memorization, and hard exams. You will learn a lot, just be prepared to work very hard.",
    "One of the best taught sciences classes I've taken at Yale. Tough, tough curve, especially with all the pre-medical students. A lot of memorization, but in the end, you will have learned so much about the building blocks of life and gained an appreciable glimpse into metabolism and how it functions to keep us alive.",
    "This is a very challenging, but rewarding course. Strengths include the material and how they were presented\/explained. Weakness is the tests, I felt they were often pretty abstract and despite the fact that there was a lot of material to cover they didn't always test some of the most important material. Also I was told I would only need to memorize important details and I did not find that to be true- lots of picky detail memorization was required for the exams.",
    "This isn't bad! It was my easiest class this semester, so maybe I'm skewed. I found the final harder than the midterms, but still reasonable. The psets are nice and easy. There are two memorisation quizzes, but they count for little and mainly serve as a grade boost. You don't need the textbook. I recommend instead that you sit towards the front with your handout of the slides. Pay attention and fill things in on the slides. Also, record the lectures. Before exams, play them all back at double speed (it sounds normal after 30s, I promise) while looking at the corresponding slides. You'll do a lot of skipping since much of the stuff will have come up before and you don't need to listen to examples if you remember them. Every once in a while there will be a fact you need to memorize. They will usually point this out in lecture if it isn't obvious. Memorize these as they go. Each will only take a minute or two of your walk to lunch after class. Presto, A.",
    "HARD AS BALLS BUT IT'S PRETTY WELL TAUGHT AND IT'S PRETTY NICE WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS WELL ENOUGH TO APPLY TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS.",
    "I learned a lot of material during this course about a wide range of biochemistry topics including proteins, lipids, and metabolism. I would definitely recommend this course for students willing to put in a lot of studying.",
    "lot of material, hard to stay interested during lectures, rewarding at the end",
    "Indifferent",
    "This class does a remarkable job of teaching the concepts behind metabolism. Taking it along with physiology is very nice, as there is overlap and interplay between the two classes, which allows for greater understanding of many topics.The exams are still a bit too memorization-heavy for my tastes, but they are pretty fair. Section is good if you want to go over the homework with others, and briefly go over the lectures, but in my opinion, the time is better spent on other things, especially during midterm weeks (as section doesn't do anything special for those).If you're planning to do anything related to medicine at all, I'd say it's important to take this class.",
    "It's a good, well-organized course. The material you learn from it is really rewarding",
    "Pretty tough class but interesting and you learn a ton!",
    "Take it. Really well taught. The class is structured and well organized. Yes, you'll have to study a lot to do well because of all the premeds, but the stuff you learn is super interesting.",
    "If you are to choose between the two biochemistry classes offered here at Yale, I highly recommend this one. The lecturers are amazing, and I believe that having a great professor is vital to understanding such complex systems and pathways like metabolism. The material is challenging, and there is a lot. However, I also believe it is completely manageable if you put in the time and keep up with the material as best as you can. The curve can be difficult to deal with as often the best and brightest students are taking the class right alongside you. But as long as you come to lecture and take good notes, you should be well off in this class!",
    "This is a very very difficult class, so pay attention during every lecture and keep up with lectures as they go. There is a lot of memorization, so if you're not into that, just be aware.",
    "A huge step up from orgo in terms of quality. You do have to memorize hundreds of slides (there was a section on the final called Total Recall) but overall I think it's worth it. The grading is broken down into quintiles (top 20% gets an A, next 20% gets an A-, etc), which in a class full of angsty premeds can be kind of stressful. But if you put in the time, I think you'll do fine.",
    "This course is a lot of fun. It's high-volume, and you have to stay on top of it, but there's nothing so complicated that it's going to shatter your brain. Pay attention in lectures, skim the readings, and you'll do alright. Don't be afraid to use piazza as well - the teaching staff is very active on it, and they do a good job of getting back to you.Also, don't be one of those people who leave at the start of the supplement. It's a dick move, it's a really nice thing for the teaching staff to put together and you can stand to just sit there and zone out for 10 minutes if you're really disinterested. The stuff is always cool anyways so you may as well pay attention anyways.",
    "A good class! Definitely a lot of material, so I recommend going over your lectures as the semester goes on. The problem sets and exams focused on a lot of \"thinking\" questions rather than fact regurgitation, which was nice.",
    "Recommended. Take the class if you want to come out knowing a whole lot more about metabolism than you thought you ever could.",
    "Consensus on campus is that this course is better taught and has more fair tests compared to MCDB biochemistry, so I would recommend this course if you do need to take it.",
    "Sure, you will learn a lot by memorizing a lot",
    "I started out not liking this course at all due to the substantial amount of memorization required, but after the first midterm I began to appreciate the material more for having done the work. I think it can be improved by shifting more emphasis to problem sets, since I felt like I could have used more feedback as the course went on. Most people take this because they have to, and the curve is pretty intense since the course is packed with premeds.",
    "I would recommend this class over MCDB biochem. You end up learning a lot in this class, and it very well taught. The only thing to be careful about is how much material there actually is, and that you need to prepare well in advance for the final and midterms.",
    "This is a really solid class. It's organized really well, moving from the small and individual (how a single receptor works, general ideas of how proteins are structured) to the broader (individual pathways of metabolism) to the systemic (how metabolic pathways interact). The class is not too much work. It is mainly memorization based, but each of the things you have to memorize is meant to exemplify a whole category of things that work in the same way; they're not making you memorize irrelevant details. I'm a premed HSHM major, for context.",
    "This class is an awesome biochemistry class. We go over a lot from important monomers of biological molecules, to protein folding, and then cover metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid synthesis and beta oxidation, glycogen biosynthesis and breakdown). We focus a lot on getting the idea of the main picture rather than gritty little details that we will forget. This class has quite a bit of memorizing, but I think what the professors want us to take away from this course is a big picture of everything. I would recommend this class to other students who are interested in biochem or biology in general. However, I wouldtell them that it is quite a lot of material to memorize and understand, and that they should always keep up with the material. Also, everyone in the class is pretty smart, so the average is pretty high, but other than that the class was very interesting and fun!",
    "A surprisingly excellent science lecture course. The professors are great, and the work is interesting and manageable.",
    "It's a lot of material. Not too bad tho, the tests aren't the most fair but take it.",
    "Very difficult curve. But interesting material!",
    "A great class but very memorization intensive! Prof. Koelle says in the beginning that the point of MB&B 300 is to have you gather an understanding of the principles of biochemistry, not the details, but this is not quite the case on the tests. More than half the questions were asking for specific details.",
    "MBB 300 is tough because there's so much stuff to learn and the competition is high. But the stuff you learn here will definitely be applicable to research in any biological field or in practicing medicine.",
    "Biochem is a hard course with a lot of complicated information. If you study hard and keep up, it is manageable. The book readings were not necessary, and pay good attention in lecture because lecture is invaluable.",
    "Most people who take this course need to take it anyway, whether they actually love biochem or not, so this review probably has little bearing to you. That said, this was a pretty solid science course. All of the tested material came from the rather well-organized lectures but because the lectures were so dense, this still meant a fair amount of rote memorization, particularly since there's always one section of the exams that is essentially fill-in-the-blanks. IMO, Koelle's lectures were much denser than Simon's.In terms of grading, the quintile distribution is rather a nice reassurance although the curve on exams can be pretty competitive. Two quizzes that are rote memorization but which weren't that hard. The p-sets aren't all that hard either, although sometimes that can give you a false sense of security.",
    "I would recommend you take it only if required or if you are premed. It is a great course, but not easy by any means. You really need to do a lot of work to keep up.",
    "Overall, a very good overview of protein biochemistry and metabolism. Also requires a lot of conceptual understanding over rote memorization. Different from traditional first-semester intro biochem courses because of this. Simon and Koelle are both great, clear professors that love the material and try to keep you interested. I'd definitely recommend this course!",
    "don't take this class unless you need to",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course!",
    "Excellent class. One of the best science lectures I've taken. It's refreshing to see that a large class can still be run well and graciously by professors. Matt simon was impressive, given that this was his first lecturing experience! Lectures were informative and the supplements were engaging. Michael koelle is incredibly knowledgable and patient. This course is a well-oiled machine. Not an easy class but definitely manageable.",
    "Yes! You learn SO MUCH in this class. The midterms and final were a pain to study for (so much material), but fair overall. Easy homework assignments. The teaching is fantastic. Matt Simon is absolutely AMAZING and Michael Koelle is also great. I'm very happy I took this class!",
    "A well taught class, but difficult. Obviously don't know my grade yet, but if the curve is what it claims to be (top 20% = A, next 20% = A-, etc.) I sorta find it difficult to complain about the grade (although clearly I'm not one of those psycho must-get-A-premeds). Weekly problem sets, 2 quizzes, 2 midterms, 1 final....spent by FAR the majority of my time studying\/trying to synthesize + retain all the info.",
    "Yes it is a good survey of proteins, membrane lipids, and metabolic pathways like glycolysis, Krebs Cycle, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Ketogenesis, Fatty Acid Biosynthesis, and B-oxidation",
    "It is definitely a great way to learn a ton of biochemistry, but the course was very competitive. If you take this, be sure to memorize every detail of the PowerPoints. It's almost useless to go to class because they out every PowerPoint on classesv2.",
    "Although I have only shopped the MCDB biochem, I believe this one was much better taught. Everything, for the most part, was clear and concise, although don't be fooled, there's a ton of information, maybe even more than Cell Bio. The one caveat I have to add is that everything counts in the course: two midterms, two quizzes, ten psets and a final. So nothing is dropped, even bad psets, which can either help or hinder you (I preferred this to the MCDB class that only had 3 midterms). Overall, Matt Simon and Michael Koelle are great professors, who obviously care that their students both learn the material and get excited by it.",
    "Definitely my favorite science class at Yale! Work onthe problem sets with other people - sometimes they can be very tricky. There are a TON of slides and lots of information to know for each midterm. Try your best to keep up with the material. Make sure you attend all of the lectures as the textbook is not too helpful - everything you need to know comes straight from the lecture slides and supplementary material said by the professors in class. The textbook is mostly useful when you're confused about a topic. The second midterm and the final were very much conceptual, so this class isn't just memorization like a lot of people say it is. In that way, it is pretty difficult and the distribution is pretty rough (lots of grades on the higher end). Overall I learned a lot and I'm glad I took it. Good luck!",
    "If you take this class, then just remember that you will have to remember all the details that were taught in lecture. It is good to understand the concepts, but it is necessary for the exams to know as many details as given in the slides.",
    "The course does a great job of establishing the foundations of understanding biochemistry and emphasizing the integration of individual molecules and pathways. It's a lot of work as the exams are quite detail-oriented, but you feel you've truly gained an understanding of it at the end and that it was worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class. I'm a chemistry major, and I took this class because I thought that I ought to have a better understanding of how chemistry can be applied in important ways. I'm glad to have done that. It does come at the cost of a lot of work, however.",
    "If you are MB&B you need to take this for your major. If you are pre-med this course does go over a lot of useful material. BUT I don't recommend taking this if you are already taking 1 or 2 other SC\/QR courses. There is a lot of material and you can get overwhelmed if not careful. Both Prof. Koelle and Prof. Simon are great and know what they are teaching.",
    "Enjoyable and interesting class but the final was a huge curveball and nothing like what Koelle said it would be. Despite what he says a hundred times about not memorizing names of little details, you might as well memorize the name of every single thing on the slides or get really screwed on the final.",
    "a fast-paced course in which you will come away with a strong foundation in biochem. just be prepared for lots of memorization.",
    "This was a great class. I learned a lot in this course and the questions and concepts are all very interesting.",
    "Biochem is a fascinating into biochemistry course. The material is intriguing, the professors are engaging, and you will get so much out of the course. However, be warned, the curve is difficult, so make sure you have a really solid grasp of the material as you go, and study hard for the exams. The professors and TAs are great resources--use them!",
    "Really interesting stuff, but if you're taking this junior or senior year, you probably will just be too busy to devote the time you need to it. Sigh. It also is frustrating that you have to memorize a billion facts for the tests, and you know you won't remember them. Understanding big concepts is what you get (hopefully) and what they claim they want you to get, but the tests are so specific. I never knew if I had done well until after I had gotten the test back. Plus, the curve was just awful. Very well taught!! If you care about learning and not grade grubbing, take this over the MCDB version.",
    "Biggest issue I had with this course was that they kept saying \"Oh we want to emphasize concepts.\" BUT you have to memorize SUPER SPECIFIC DETAILS to do well on both the fill in the blank parts of the tests AND short answer portions. (Like how fart is the distance between two oxygens in waters that are H-bonded to each other, and which side of the membrane is isoprenylated proteins on). If you can memorize those details, you're fine. Otherwise, ok course.",
    "This class is a lot of work but if you are willing to put the time in, you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes, most definitely, though I would only see people taking it as a requirement under a major, simply because of how detailed it is and how much background in other classes would help with this class.",
    "An interesting course. Professor Koelle likened the learning style of this course to \"drinking from a firehose\" - none of the material is particularly hard (and it's all very interesting) but there really is a lot of material to learn. This reality is especially apparent while studying for tests, so I would recommend not putting off the studying - it would be a feat to cram the night before for one of these tests! The weekly problem sets are very reasonable, and the lectures are engaging. I would recommend this course, but just be sure to study a decent amount ahead of time!",
    "MB&B 300 is a very time consuming class, but the time pays off. It is really nice coming out of a class with a real understanding in biological pathways. It applies nicely to all the other premed classes I have taken and is kindof like a bow on the top.",
    "Good course. Definitely recommend. Intimidating curve though, especially as a non-premed. Just memorize the slides was the best advice that I got for this course. Find a study group, that was essential for me.",
    "Overall, this course is well-taught, especially when Koelle teaches. However, be aware that it requires a lot of memorization of tedious details, despite the instructors' insistence that it is concept-oriented. It does become more conceptual and integrative toward the end of the course, which was welcome.",
    "MB&B 300 teaches exactly what it says it does: PRINCIPLES of biochemistry. You will have to memorize some facts but in general, it emphasizes concepts rather than details. Don't fret about too much all of the information it seems you will need to memorize because if you keep up over the semester, it is very manageable.One of the strengths of this class is being able to understand metabolism in the body and being able to say \"Oh this is what is happening in my body when I don't eat!\"",
    "I would recommend it if they are willing to do the work and be at the mercy of the curve.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biological sciences! Both of the professors are extremely good. I learned a lot in this class, and it was very exciting to learn about how the body is integrated. However, the exams require a lot of studying and memorizing. Everything you need to know for the exams are on the lecture slides, so it's not too bad if you get the time to really go over the slides. Reading the book is not necessary, but it might help you to understand the lectures.",
    "This is a very well-taught class. Both Matt Simon and Michael Koelle are great lecturers and make going to class very worthwhile. They explain concepts very well and for the most part make it very clear what is expected of the class to know for the exams. The psets are very easy, and the midterms were pretty fair. The final was killer. Overall a great class, only difficult because of the intense pre-meds who take this class.",
    "Great course, definitely take it if you want to learn more about biochemistry and synthesize a lot of information. Tests are hard but fair, so make sure you have the time to put into the class.",
    "You probably have to take the course anyway. It covers a lot of material to keeping up with the lecture is important. Reading the text helps a lot.",
    "I loved the course, but I know I am in the minority on that one. If you love molecular biology (as I do) and chemistry, you'll love the course too. Of course, a bunch of crazy pre-meds are taking it, so you'll have to work hard to get the grade you probably want, so be ready to put a lot of time in to studying and memorizing. You need to do the readings and memorize all the little things on the slides, which is unfortunate time wise, but actually incredibly interesting if you give yourself the time to dive in to the material. On second thought, I probably should have been an MB&B major (too late, I'm a senior), but regardless - take this class. You'll learn so many interesting things. Just ignore the pre-meds (even if you are one) and learn to learn, not to compete with them. The grading is on a pretty strict curve, but if you study enough, you should be able to get a B+ or higher. The professors are good and the material is better. There are weekly, very short problem sets, as well as two midterms and a final (all pretty hard). It's a lot, but it's a lot of good.",
    "You probably need to take this class. I had no choice. I was generally disinterested.",
    "It's a cool course",
    "It's definitely a tough class but if you stay on top of the homework\/lectures then you will do just fine. The professors are awesome and extremely helpful! It's a good introductory course for biochemistry and this knowledge definitely helped me in other science classes.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "Itis an advanced, mostly thought\/conceptual based version of biochemistry. Lots of memorization is involved.",
    "The course was structured well. The professors were good at conveying information to the class and their slides were helpful. It was definitely possible to do well if you were willing to put in the work. The tests were fair. I would recommend taking this class.",
    "MB&B 300 can actually be pretty cool-- as in the material itself is interesting, but this class kinda sucks. The premedy atmosphere is super annoying, and the tests are horrible-- they do NOT test concepts, they test super nit-picky details, which ruins the whole experience of the class. I felt like I learned a lot and studied a lot, but my grades did not reflect that which is always disappointing. I would not recommend this class. But you probably are taking this for a requirement, so good luck. Try to study as you go. There is too much material (in that they test every little detail) to cram!",
    "I think this was a terrific class and terrific introduction to biochemistry. I learned an enormous amount of fascinating material and concepts about the molecules and chemical reactions of life in a great amount of detail, as well as a good deal about biochemical research, both standard techniques and current frontiers of research. I also greatly enjoyed the supplementary material presented at the end of each lecture; I found it to be fun and interesting and a really nice way to enjoy learning biochemistry purely for learning's sake. I also found Professor Simon and Professor Koelle to be fantastic lecturers. I would highly recommend this class to anyone with a genuine interest in science and a curiosity about how chemistry and physics operate within living systems to make life possible. I was extremely pleased with what I took away from this class.",
    "Much better than MCDB, but trades being interesting for being wicked hard. The curve will kill you, and the only way to do well is to review each lecture for 2+ hours every night, which few people have time to do. If you have to take biochem, take this, but may God have mercy on your GPA. That being said, I did learn something.",
    "You learn alot, but its tough, and the curve is tough.",
    "Definitely take this rather than the spring course with MCDB. It was pretty easy - you've probably learned all the basic concepts in pieces from your prior courses. Assessments were likewise straightforward. Just need to do a bit of memorization.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student; it's the first science class at Yale where I did not feel like I was bored\/always looking at the clock. The material was always presented in a very organized and coherent manner, and the supplements were very relevant and informative.",
    "This class is super interesting, and the lectures are engaging. The weekly problem sets are pretty quick, and taken from old exams. The exams are hard, but if you study what was covered in lecture and do the practice exams you'll do fine.",
    "A very rigorous course. Great professors but the exams are near impossible. You will understand the underlying principles as explained in class but you're on your own to memorize the tiny details you will be tested on.",
    "You've probably heard it - lots and lots of memorization and work. The professors will try to tell you they don't emphasize memorization - don't believe them. But besides the exams, biochemistry is a really interesting field and topic.",
    "Lots of memorization, but do-able. Make sure you take notes on the slides that are printed out (don't just sit there). The little explanations you write will help make each slide clearer when you go back and study a few weeks later. You do NOT need to buy the textbook - I never used it and did well.",
    "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in biochemistry and enjoyed organic chemistry, I strongly recommend you take MB&B 300. Much more than BIOL 101, MB&B 300 emphasizes a chemical and mechanistic understanding of life processes, meaning that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn not only what happens in organisms but also how and why. As you may already know, this course is the first in a yearlong biochemistry sequence and covers protein structure and function, enzyme kinetics, membranes, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and biochemical regulation. Succeeding in this course requires attention to detail, and you should know absolutely everything on the slides for exams. Even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a prerequisite for the course, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d encourage you to complete two semesters of organic chemistry before taking MB&B 300. A strong background in organic chemistry will better enable you to understand the course material and will make it more intellectually satisfying. MB&B 300 asks a lot of you as a student, but if you love the material and work hard, it will be one of your most rewarding courses at Yale.",
    "Heavy on memorization, as with all science classes. If you have time to read the book, do it to get the whole story. While tests cover technically only the slides, you have to read the book to get the full picture. Otherwise you're stuck just memorizing details. I spent around 40-50 hours the week before the final memorizing details since I never read the book.. don't do what I did, and keep up. That being said, it's always a trade-off. Sleep, social life, etc. you get what you put in, because if you don't invest the extra five hours every week, someone else will.",
    "Ugh. If you know you have to take this, get it over with. Get out the flashcards and prepare for rote memorization. I honestly don't know how else you could possibly prepare for these exams, because they are rough.",
    "Good class. Matt Simon was a good professor."
