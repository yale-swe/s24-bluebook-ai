    "Meeting a variety of forestry professionals.",
    "The field trip provides an invaluable opportunity to meet and learn from the southern forestry industry",
    "The experience... So many positive moments wrapped up into such a short amount of time.",
    "The field trips. It gave me the opportunity as an international student to learn about the Southern forestry and how different it is from New England and from my home country. It was a rich learning experience for me.",
    "This course is all about hands-on and first-hand exposure. It was essential for me to take in conjunction with Intro to Silviculture and helped me understand how concepts from that course are applied in the real world. As a neophyte, this gave me the opportunity to see for the first time many of the operations we talked about in my other courses. I also appreciated how the professors balanced the kinds of stops we made on this field trip course - we visited places with many different silvicultural goals, and that was especially helpful for contextualizing what we'd learned.",

    "A little bit more down time - and a bit more forest ecology - and could have done without the tour of the biomass plant! - and no need to drive over to TX.",
    "Trip was really great, but felt a little disorganized. It should not be the responsibility of the students to be worried about the food budget constantly. More attention should be paid to meal planning in advance of departure.",
    "Staying in the woods would be better than staying in chain motels.",
    "Fewer big hotels next to the highway.",
    "Organizational hiccups were encountered, but it didn't ruin the trip.",
    "While it's hard to say because it potentially implies more work, it would have been great to have one or two assigned readings (articles perhaps). It was good that we all broke off pieces of what we needed to learn and taught each other, but I still felt I was ill-prepared to discuss any of the other topics presented. It would have been nice to have one or two other articles recommended to me (as a group) that would have broadened what I felt comfortable discussing with those we met. This is difficult on the short timeline, though, I recognize.",

    "It provided me with a whole new perspective on how forestry is practiced.This fits well with my interest in forest resources management as the trip gave me the opportunity to witness some useful forest resources operations and management regimes of companies we visited.",
