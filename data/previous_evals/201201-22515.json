    "In WaO, you'll write a series of personal essays on a set of themes, but that's only the foundation for a course that explores and delves into countless writers' concerns, the work of exemplary authors, and the creative process in general. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Intimate and demanding, Writing about Oneself will make you a better reader and writer and - I really do think this - a better person. If you are good enough to get in, you will write more deftly, read more sharply, and feel more sensitively when you come out. By that time, Anne also will have revealed what aposiopesis and Fat Chef Syndrome are, and she will have paid you more attention than your shrink. Writing about Oneself is not the Eleusinian Mysteries, nor Anne the Second Coming of the Messiah, but Writing about Oneself is about as good as you'll get on earth."
