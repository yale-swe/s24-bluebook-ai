    "I felt like this was really Matt's course rather than being co-taught. His enthusiasm in the classroom was great for getting people engaged.I think that the material could be brought up a notch. What we go over in class is on target but maybe a bit more simplistic than it needs to be - even for the undergrads. The homework takes awhile but I didn't feel like it was challenging in a way that would help me grow. Maybe use more real examples about what people are doing and what the trade-offs and opportunities are?",
    "It overlaps a bit with classes like Greening Business Operations, but learning how design\/engineering frameworks are approached and utilized is very useful.",
    "I liked this course very much. Even though I am not engineer, it is a very course to understand the environmental and health implications behind any product.",
    "Regarding course difficulty, I think that this course can be a little more technical\/quantitative than it is.",

    "It offers an opportunity to be creative in a way that I haven't had in other classes since coming to FES. In that way this class is refreshing. It sparked a resurgence in my creative side.",
    "The more interactive format; not always just sitting&listening to lectures",
    "The final project was very good process, great opportunity for creativity and using the concepts and resources from class.",
    "The design project that ran nearly all semester was one of the more useful experiences that I have had at F&ES in my first year. I really enjoyed doing this - in part, because I had a great team of people to work with, and we were all very passionate about our objective. But also, because this experience really matched the tenor and feel of working - in my mind, the more applied the MEM program can become, the better. This class did this.",
    "Working on a final project that may actually turn out to be marketable",
    "The group projects.",
    "Interesting final project.",
    "The group design project was fun and a great way to explore the design process from start to finish, at least in a simple way. The course also taught the basics of certain design principles and green design strategies.",
    "The introduction of Green Design concepts, and Matt Eckleman - he was very clear about concepts and responsive to students."

   "comments": [
    "At times it's a bit slow and maybe too easy. Many of the lectures could have been more challenging.",
    "Some of the Chemistry\/Risk lectures were not clearly presented- too much information\/clutter on the slides, etc, it was hard to tell which points were most pertinent.",
    "I really felt that the pace of the class was much too slow. I appreciated the sensitivity to the the interdisciplinary nature of the course and the diversity of skill sets in the room, but to me, it would have been great to speed up the lectures and pack in more content. I would have loved to have seen more attention dedicated to the prototyping phase of green design as this was a required part of our final project, but wasn't really part of the formal teaching period. In retrospect, a final exam would have helped keep me focused as well.",
    "Clarity on the process of generating ideas- capturing ideas, then organizing them coherently. During one exercise we were given post- its without much explanation as to what and how we were supposed to use them.",
    "This is very specific, but the student evaluation sheets for final group projects were essentially meaningless. Because each design problem was so distinct, a fixed rubric for how well teams addressed their problem did not seem very helpful. I would encourage designing an evaluation sheet that was somehow more flexible--at least allowed a bit of space to explain how judgments are made.",
    "More quantitative focus, I felt the course was a little too fluffy. I wish it had forced us to learn engineering concepts, even if we have no engineering background.",
    "The course was far too superficial and did not delve deep enough into any of the topics it covered. It is really a survey course about green design. It also had a slow pace, lacked much assigned reading, and the homework assignments often did not have much to did with what we were learning in class. The assignments were sometimes tedious and completely unrelated to anything I would need to learn to be successful in green design. I would have liked to learn more in depth about actual design processes.",
    "The team-taught nature of the class. Matt and Julie's styles were different so it was hard to go between them both."

    "I took this course hoping to gain a basic understanding in green design because I'd like to go into the field of corporate sustainability and thought it would be important to understand some green products and marketing efforts going on today. It was a good introduction to this but could have been a more thorough course.",

    "No, but that's not a bad thing. I expected it to be an engineering class. However, the engineering topics were all quite simple, and the class was more focused on design. I enjoyed the unexpected design focus and the opportunity to get creative.",
    "Sometimes there were gems that popped through - things I didn't know before that were really interesting. But for the most part, it was too basic.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the course was a very good approach about the green aspects of product and service design and gave me great knowledge about it.",
    "Not really. I'm starting to find that with many courses at F&ES I don't always feel like I am learning a ton along the way; however, at the end of the course, it is apparent to me that I have learned quite a bit. It would be the same with this course. However, it just seems to me that there could be a lot more added to the class to challenge students as designers.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",

    "yes",
    "No - it was hard to follow along and it seemed like it was poorly structured in terms of sequence sometimes."

    "Group work is always challenging, but that in itself is a learning opportunity. My group meshed very well. Some advantages are the chance to learn from others' perspectives and learn how to humble yourself to let your own ideas go if someone else has a better idea. Unlike other group projects I've been a part of, everyone in my group put in an equal amount of work.",
    "There was some structure around the deliverables, with a progress report before the final presentation. That was good. I liked that it was a creative assignment and let us run in any direction we wanted.It was a good idea to get a diversity of backgrounds in the teams as well, though it was challenging to align schedules between our graduate and undergraduate students.",
    "For these design problems, group work is a necessity, so it was good to have a group project. There were challenges, in that some people didn't seem to get the process as well, but working through that made the experience more worthwhile I believe",
    "Great advantages for working in a team, gathering opinions, setting up tasks and come up with innovative ideas.Great opportunity to integrate with classmates and apply class concepts.",
    "Group work advantages: As I mentioned above, I found the design project to be the real value of this course, and as much as I wish the course would have been paced a bit differently, it was nice that Matt and Julie prioritized the design project throughout the semester - giving us the time and space to work on it with honest dedication. I learned a lot from my peers as a result of the group work, I also was able to return to a working person's skill set (project management, team dynamics), and I also had a lot of fun.Group work disadvantages: Design project was perhaps a little too much of the focus of the course - would have loved to have had more to complement this great aspect of it.",
    "I thought we were going to evaluate our individual teammates for grading, which did not happen. Our group definitely had one person who hardly contributed a thought.",
    "We had various expertise within our group, which was essential to designing an effective and interesting product in response to our challenge. This project makes clear the need for group work--despite the challenges, the outcome is far superior than independent work.",
    "The group work was very valuable because it allowed you to work with undergraduate students who had actual engineering experience\/focus as well as other graduations students who were experts in design. This was great to see what it would be like to work with a real design team through the whole process. Disadvantages are the usual - scheduling meetings was challenging as well as working to have everyone pull their weight.",
    "I worked with great team mates, I learned the Asian way of doing things, and I liked it.",
    "Because the class is so mixed with undergrads and grads from different schools, it was difficult to work in a group because schedules varied quite a bit."

   "comments": [
    "This is a fun class. It's a little on the easy side, and less of an engineering class than a design class.",
    "Meet with your design group every week and try to accomplish something every week. For the HW's, don;t leave them until last minute because they are fairly long.",
    "Like most courses at F&ES, this class is what you make of it. The lectures will be interesting and are complemented with small group ideation sessions that break things up and add some creative thinking to your school week. There were very few reading assignments as part of this course, and the homework and midterm were very doable. Going off of the way this course was taught this semester, you might be bored at times.The most important piece of advice that I have is that the design project will be what makes this course valuable or not valuable to you - so be strategic about the objective you pick and the group that you work with, go for something you are passionate about it and if you know individuals in the class who are great thinkers, ask to work with them.",
    "Be very clear about due dates and responsibilities within your groups.",
    "I would only take this course if you want a survey course in green design. This course is slow-paced, and I would not recommend that graduate students take it, unless you want to learn the very basics of green design and do a neat group project."
