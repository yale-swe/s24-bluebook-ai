   "comments": [
    "I improved a great number of skills, including the way I think about language as a whole, how sound works, and my analysis of linguistic phenomena in general. As to specific knowledge, I learned about the rich discipline of phonology, including articulatory phonetics, rules-based phonology, phonotactics, optimality theory, and constraint-based phonology.",
    "Phonology I covers a broad introduction to phonology (in the words of the instructor, everything you should know to be able to follow a phonology talk without being entirely lost). We covered the basis of articulatory phonology, natural classes, rule formation, types of contrast, phonetic vs phonemic sounds, positional neutralization, assimilation, analysis neutral interpretations of data, phonological derivations of morphological alternation, autosegmental representations of tone, and a bit of optimality theory,",
    "In this course, we gained an understanding of the basics of phonology, morphology, and linguistics fieldwork.",
    "I learned more about meaning and mouth noises",
    "An introduction to phonological methods and concepts, plus a little bit of morphology.",
    "I learned the basics of phonological analysis, as it was promised I would.",
    "This class taught us how to think critically in the ways needed for phonological analysis (and linguistic analysis in general, for those who haven't really done linguistics before). We stuck closely to the textbook, supplemented with worksheets we did together in class, and learned many different frameworks of analysis. So by the time of the final project, we had a lot of different methods of analysis to choose from.",
    "I learned a ton of phonology! We spent a lot of time on rule-based phonology, but we also learned different frameworks\/theories that helped us tackle different areas: autosegmental phonology for tone as well as optimality theory as a totally different paradigm that works better than rules in a lot of ways.",
    "The fundamentals of Phonological analysis, how to identify the phoneme inventory for a language, how to develop phonological rules using natural features, autosegmental features, language modality, and optimality theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned copious amounts of material, which turned out to be very interesting even as someone who went in not having any experience with it nor liking it very much. However, while the course was an excellent introduction to phonology, a lot of theories were covered that are really no longer used. One of the most common phrases said by the prof was \"This is a sweet, sweet lie\", because more recent research had basically debunked what we learned. I am not sure if a better way to approach the field exists, but it might be something worth considering in the future.",
    "Strengths: The amount of material covered is very reasonable. Expectations were clear and there weren't any \"surprises,\" so to speak. Natalie is an excellent teacher, and they made every effort to present material in different ways so that we could understand it. Both the professor and the TF (Sammy) were very open to questions and were very willing to put in time to make sure we understood things. Weaknesses: Much of the coursework feels a bit like \"busywork,\" or at least that is my impression of the grading. The course is not particularly hard, but the problem sets were often graded in a way which emphasized minutia over conceptual understanding of the material. Additionally, if you don't find phonology as interesting as other fields of linguistics, you may not be as engaged with the class. Probably my biggest problem with the course is the attitude towards what grades ought to mean. The psets, quizzes, and tests are very much written with the midset of \"if everyone get's an A, then something went wrong.\" I think that this is a poor way to grade work which ostensibly has a \"correct\" answer, and it can be demoralizing for little gain. There is a lot of work (not an unreasonable amount, but more than most linguistics classes that I have taken), so any individual assignment isn't worth too much though, which is a relief.",
    "The flipped classroom worked beautifully for this course. When we came to class, we already had a working knowledge of what we were doing in that week, and we worked through sample problems together to help enhance our understanding (rather than just being lectured at about concepts). The only weakness I can think of is that we often got off on tangents due to persistent \"what if\" questions from students -- usually, that was fine, but that occasionally led to us not knowing the material needed to complete the problem sets.",
    "This course involved a lot of classroom discussion, which was great for building a sense of collaboration among all the students. It built a lot of concrete skills for linguistic analysis and problem-solving in general.",
    "Strengths: the flipped classroom format worked really well -- doing the readings outside of class meant that everyone came to class prepared to discuss whatever new idea we were talking about that day, and the discussion format revolving around example problems meant that whatever problem-solving technique we were learning was really solidified for us. Weaknesses: though the discussion format is great in a lot of ways, it felt like it sometimes got out of hand and we'd get way off topic. Whether this is a weakness depends on whether or not it caused us to miss out on material though, and I can't really say that. Regardless, it would have been nice if the discussions were less protracted occasionally, since it sometimes felt like we were just spinning our wheels and getting nowhere.",
    "Struck a great balance between depth and breadth, lecture and group discussion. Everything was very engaging and I felt like I learned a lot without there being unnecessary busywork. The only potential improvement that comes to mind is perhaps a bit more structured guidance for the end-of-term paper if it going to coexist with a final exam."

   "comments": [
    "Highly. For anyone within the linguistics discipline, this course is required, as it should be. For anyone outside of linguistics, this is a great mid-level course for someone who is interested in how we analyze sounds in language.",
    "If you are a linguistics major then yes! I mean, you have to take it unless you can find a way around it but don't do that! It's fun and not too challenging, and if you are taking it with Natalie and Sammy then you'll have a lot of fun and learn a lot. If you are not a linguistics major, maybe think about why you want to take it. It's not a bad course, but if you're not interested in phonology then you won't have. good time. I know of a few people who took the class who weren't Ling majors. They took it Credit-D and did fine, though that's not a requirement.",
    "Absolutely. The course covers a great deal of material, but remains engaging the entire time.",
    "Yeah. You like making strange mouth noises when you think there's no one around (and even when there is)? Then this might be the course for you",
    "Yes! I may be biased because this is very much my field of study, but I thought that this was a perfect introduction to the field of phonology. For majors it's required, of course, and for non-majors I may not recommend it over the intro survey (although if you don't like syntax I might!), but overall I would definitely recommend this course. (And if you're bummed about the requirement, don't be!)",
    "Yes! This is a great course for anyone interested in language sounds, linguistics in general, critical thinking, or problem-solving. I think it's pretty friendly to any level of experience, from zero to wherever, though there is also Phonology II for more advanced topics. The class really built concepts step by step, so as long as you make sure you understand each homework assignment (there's lots of support from the professor and TA, and you can ask questions during classroom discussion, section, and office hours), you should be totally fine for the final. I know every professor says that, but in this case it's actually true :0!",
    "Yes, absolutely, especially if Natalie is teaching it! You may think you have to be interested in linguistics for the class to be interesting to you, but really the class is about problem-solving and working out patterns. The patterns happen to take the shape of languages, which just makes them even more interesting if you like linguistics. The discussion format makes it fun to come to class every day, and Natalie will make sure that you'll learn a lot through that discussion.",
    "Yes, learning about phonology gives a lot of insight into what makes languages feel distinct, and will assist in learning a foreign language with proper pronunciation. For linguistics majors this is obviously a must-take, literally and figuratively."
