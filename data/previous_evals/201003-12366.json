   "comments": [
    "It's a solid class. P-set every week, and 2 midterms and a final. You can drop 1 midterm and have your final count for double. Not the greatest teacher - slightly eccentric and spends a lot of time deriving equations as opposed to teaching how to use them, but that's what you have the textbook for. Tests are open-note, so that's nice. I would encourage you to go meet with Professor Easther, because he's actually a very nice guy.",
    "Only take it if you have to, and if you do, try your best to avoid Easther. Check out Physics 200, especially if Shankar is teaching it. Easther spends the whole class doing derivations no one understands without showing how to apply the equations he derives.",
    "If you don't have to take physics 180, then stay as far away from this class as you can. This was a poorly taught class. The material wasn't that hard to master on my own, but the professor actually made it harder for me to comprehend what I was studying. He had some magic way of completely disorganizing my thoughts and nullifying the studying I had done the day before. During the ninth week of classes, he actually stood up in the middle of class and yelled at us for writing him emails, informing him that we couldn't understand the math he was using to derive formulas. \"You are supposed to have had Differential Equations and some exposure to Analysis to take this course\" he said, to an introductory physics class mind you. The class quickly corrected him, showing him the syllabus that HE had passed out nine weeks before which clearly stated that we were supposed to take Math 115 (single-variable calc) together with his physics class. Moral of the story, Professor Easther is a poor professor of Physics 180. It's unfortunate that he turned so many interested students away from the physics path.",
    "This class is fine if you have a solid base in physics and can pretty much work on your own. You'll do fine in it, no doubt, but if you are learning any new material, you'll be better off getting a tutor as a much-needed supplement.",
    "This class is an intro physics class with a problem set every week of about 7-8 questions. There were 2 mid-terms and clicker questions during every class. The material was not difficult to learn, but the lectures were dry and somewhat pointless to go to. I would only take this class if you had to, if you like physics, then you should take one of the harder (but from what I hear, more interesting) classes.",
    "Yes but if you haven't had any physics before it will be very difficult because the lectures aren't really that helpful in learning the material",
    "Do everything you can to not take this class. it's terrible. The professor makes easy material unbearable. the grading is harsh. LEctures are really boring. disaster. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.",
    "Not too stressful, but the problem sets can be annoying. The nice part though is that the tests are not nearly as bad as the problems he assigns.",
    "This class is a solid class for science credit. But don't expect to enjoy it.",
    "This class has the potential to be good. Unfortunately, while Richard Easther is teaching it, there is no hope. His teaching style seemed to be Algebra Stream Of Consciousness: He would stand at the blackboard rambling about how to move variables around while neglecting to ever explain what the variables stood for orhow they related to physical concepts. I learned more from reading the textbook than I ever did in class.When taught by Richard Easther, I would not recommend this course to another student. For any student who has no choice but to take the course, I would strongly recommend figuring out (early) some way to learn the material rather than just plowing the PSet as best as possible, and learning as you go.",
    "Most students take Physics 180 because it is a required course for their major so it is something you have to take. It is a good introduction but moves pretty quickly.",
    "I would not recommend taking 180. If possible, I'd recommend taking 200 if you have a strong enough math background, or 170.",
    "Easther can be an annoying lecturer, but tests are open note which is nice.",
    "Challenging class that (in my opinion) requires prior knowledge if you dont plan on getting a tutor. Covers a lot of material.",
    "Coming out of high school this course is very similar to AP Physics (Mechanics with calculus) with an extra 7-10 chapters depending on what you did in high school. Just be prepared for more difficult tests",
    "Terrible course. The professor spent more time (most days) working on derivations of the formulas than actually teaching us the material. Halfway during class, most people would be in WTF-mode, as they had no clue what he was doing. We have study time with TAs a few days during the week (optional), though only one is worth going to: Ross. This course has made me question even staying in the sciences, I may just become a blasted humanities major now... If this is not required for your major, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. If it is required for your major, consider changing majors. Or take a different physics level with a different professor. Clicker-questions, which account for 10% of your grade, ensure that you attend every useless class.PSETs are long and take extra time, considering you have to teach yourself the material in the book. I resorted to MIT OpenCourseWare (Classical Mechanics w\/ Walter Lewin). Learned more there than in the physical class. The only thing I looked forward to for this class is the end of it. And this evaluation. Take it as it is.",
    "If richard easther is teaching it, then you are going to have to teach it to yourself. If you have the chance take another level of physics you should, if he is the only professor teaching 180. Be forewarned that he does not teach all of the material that you need to know in order to do well.",
    "This course is pretty good. It's not that hard, considering it's calculus based. Prof. Easther can be unclear--use the book well.",
    "If you've taken AP Physics C before, you need not take this class unless you want an easy A - seriously. This class is for people who haven't learned Physics ever before (yes, PHYS180 is easier than PHYS170). Weekly problem sets and 2 midterms and 1 final, nothing crazy.",
    "I was not particularly a fan of this course. It was basically the same thing that I did in AP Phyiscs B. It was not very difficult, but lecture was extremely boring. If you have to take physics for premed, then it gets the job done, but you might want to challenge yourself with a higher level course that is actually interesting.",
    "This class had a considerable amount of homework--the problem sets got harder as the class went on, and the 1-3 warmup questions before each class added up. Grading policy was good; location in Davies beats other intro classes. Lecture was sometimes helpful but often focused too heavily on derivations. I'm not a crazy physics genius, and I took this class after AP Physics B in high school and found it to be not as hard as most people made it sound. Don't be worried about the calc, as it barely comes up.Also, definitely form a study group and do the warmup together.",
    "If Easther is teaching, avoid at all costs. He is an awful teacher and just plain mean. You will learn literally nothing from him. If you don't need the class for your major, do not take it.",
    "If you have to take this class, sorry... Not a good class overall. Open note structure of midterms and final is nice, but you really don't learn much physics. If you can handle 200, take that, because 180 is NOT GOOD when Easther is teaching it.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. If you need a year of physics I guess take this and not 170, but still this class isn't like yay physics, its like oh god another bitchy problem set...",
    "No way. Take 200 where you'll actually learn something. You'll learn less than a good AP course, struggle the whole way.",
    "Do not take unless you absolutely have to. Trust me. I find physics interesting, but this class was simply painful. But really... do NOT take it. Especially not with Easther. Worst. Professor. Ever.",
    "Take it if you need to. It's not the worst physics class, but it's definitely not the best.",
    "I am pre-med and took this course because I thought I would actually be able to learn something new in Physics since I had covered some of the material before. I would have been better off in 170. Don't take this class if you don't have to. 170 is at least easier if you must do physics at all.",
    "I would summarize physics 180 as an introduction to most of the basic physics topics. I would recommend it to those students who need it for their major.",
    "It's a nice course, but my experience (and my love for physics) was partially ruined by the professor.",
    "I've been dreaming about writing this review for months. Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT TAKE this class. Just don't. Physics 180 was by far the worst class I have ever taken not just in college, but in my life I was really looking forward to taking physics for the first time in my life, and then Prof. Easther just failed to meet all my expectations. First of all, his lectures were completely useless and incomprehensible. He would just stand there and derive equations, which is cool, but while doing so, he would forget to mention key ideas. The textbook was fine, but the sample problems that it presented were often too simple compared to the questions Prof. Easther would ask in his problem sets. Problem sets were a pain because, like I said, he wouldn't teach. Seriously. The only reason why students go to class it's because we have to click, otherwise, only about 20 people would go out of a 130 people class. I would recommend going to a higher level physics if you had had ANY exposure whatsoever in physics. I regret enormously not having taken physics before because then I got stuck with this pathetic excuse for a class. Also, even though sometimes poor lectures can be nice or whatever, that was definitely not the case with Prof. Easther. If you had a question about losing random points in your problem set, he would rudely dismiss you. Anyways, if you want to learn absolutely nothing for a whole semester, while at the same time struggle through poorly written problem sets, then I guess this is the class for you.",
    "Physics 180 is basic physics concepts. It is not particularly difficult material if you sit down and teach it to yourself (I recommend going carefully through the sample problems in the book, which reinforce the concepts well), but the class and lectures are not particularly helpful (I attended every one, and I can honestly say that). I think that everyone should take physics and understand it, but if you can do it in a way that's not this class (or this instructor), go for it!Also, form study groups. They will save you. And don't forget the online quizzes or they will come back to bite you at the end of the semester when you get your grade.",
    "If the student still needs to solidify his or her physics background, I wouldrecommend this course provided that the student is willing to choose this course as his or her one difficult course. The problem sets definitely demand great attention and time, and the short warm-up quizzes are usually difficult puzzles. But these short quizzes do prepare the students for the next lectures.It is also important to note that the student will probably need to consult the professor after each lecture because his passion for the subject sometimes eclipses his awareness of his audience, which engenders rushed explanations for his students. The student must be sure to leave plenty of time after each lecture to ask Professor Easther to clarify his explanations.",
    "My high school did not offer AP Physics so I was lost from the beginning. I felt like most of the other students had already had a good knowledge of physics. I failed both midterms and had to study for three straight weeks in order to not fail the class. So if you haven't taken a good physics class before you might want to take 170 or be prepared to work hard or fail.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is not all that difficult, but it is also incredibly boring and made me hate physics. If you like physics, go for PHYS 200 instead, because it will teach you a lot more and be more engaging. If not- good luck.",
    "If you like physics this a good course. The problem sets are challenging but the extra help sessions are really good and you can usually finish them there.",
    "It is a okay class if you have to take it, but it will not make you love physics and I would not suggest someone take it to see whether they are interested in pursuing the field.",
    "Well, its most likely a required class so take it. don't expect to get much out of the lecture, but studying with people and going to the help sessions are really helpful. Ross's help session is the best.",
    "Take this if you want a easy science credit and don't mind going to classes and doing problem sets (big portion of your grade)",
    "Physics 180 is the first half of an introductory college physics class. It is most likely going to be exactly what you expect it to be: problem sets once a week, a lot of lectures and physics, etc. It was by far my least favorite class of the semester; yet, if one is pursuing a major in physics or engineering then this class would be an important one to take.",
    "Physics 180 is your basic intro physics course. You'll have seen a lot of the material before if you took a decent high school physics class. The problem sets are hard, but the TAs hold office hours for three nights a week preceding the due date, thus, if you commit to going to one of those sessions, it is pretty hard to do poorly on them. Easther organizes the course to try to get you to do work as the semester progresses rather than skip class and cram for the final. So you end up having to attend lecture to answer clicker questions, at least skim the reading to answer some pre-class questions online, and due weekly problem sets. Basically, you'll have to work decently hard to get all the daily assignments done for this class, but as a result, you'll probably know the material better, and if you do the work, you'll do fine on the exams.",
    "It's physics. The open-note tests save a heck of a lot of time studying so if you need to get through the requirement, you might as well take this one. It's not a good course, and Easther is really lazy, but it's tolerable more or less.",
    "PHYS180 gives you a good, solid foundation in physics. If you put in the time, you'll do well. It's neither an easy class nor extremely taxing.",
    "I enjoyed the subject, but not really the class. Take it if you're interested in Physics or you have to.",
    "This class covers general physics, but I don't recommend it unless necessary as a prerequisite. The grading is fair, but most of material must be self taught. The lectures were not helpful.",
    "Physics 180 was a disappointing class. Professor Easther is ineffective - he teaches you derivations you don't need to know but doesn't teach you the application you need to solve problems. He writes ambiguous problem sets, did not answer my emails, and did not know what kind of math was a prerequisite for the course.Definitely go to the to review sessions - some of the TAs are very helpful.Take it if you have to, but try out 200 or 170 first if you can.",
    "This is a mediocre class. Take 200 if you have the math. The class has almost no correlation to anything on the tests, problems sets, etc. and no one would come if they didn't have the clickers. Easther is a niceguy, and smart, but forgets the level of a physics 180 class. The midterms are either reasonable or insane, and there is not enough time. Overall, take the class if you have to, but not anything to rave about.",
    "Yes",
    "I'd give this a neutral grade--sometimes boring, sometimes interesting, this class has a medium amount of work. Bad professor.",
    "Take it, but just try and make sure that you don't get Easther. That, or be prepared to do a lot of self-teaching. It's not overly difficult though. Still a fun course in my opinion. (Also, whining about Easther creates bonding time between classmates)",
    "Phys 180 was a pain, don't take it unless it's a requirement or you really love physics.",
    "If one has a more intellectual curiosity in Physics the 200 level might be more appropriate.",
    "Physics 180 is a good course for a student who does not necessarily have the strongest background in physics. If you do not have a strong physics background, you might be better off taking this course as opposed to Physics 200. You can switch levels during the semester, but you might want to be able to take the first exam in 180 since he drops one exam grade.",
    "i had to take this for requirements, but hope easther isnt teaching. i took ap physics c, this is the same course. but easthers terrible and will actually confuse you more",
    "I should preface this evaluation with saying that I love science. When I took gen chem, I enjoyed doing the problem sets. Reading for bio was fun! And when I took physics in high school, I thought that it was so interesting! HOWEVER, this course was actually TERRIBLE. I guess the textbook was alright, but the problem sets sometimes had questions that were really poorly written and the pre-lecture quizzes were usually a hassle. It's sort of ironic that \"pset\" and \"pest\" are almost spelled the same. The clicker questions were the main motivation to attend lecture. Otherwise, I would have been better off spending 50 minutes of my own time three days a week just teaching myself physics. To make matters worse, the grading on the psets was not consistent between TAs. If you work with people and have the same answers as them, you would get a different grade anyway.As for Professor Easther, he's definitely my least favorite professor of my three semesters at Yale. It was often hard to read his handwriting, and you didn't even know the takeaway message of what he was deriving (I'm not against derivations, I just feel like you should know what you're actually deriving). Also, he was extremely against office hours, and when you waited on the long line at the end of class to speak to him about psets, he was never really receptive to your requests about making the grading fairer. For example, he said not to box in your answers because that just establishes a \"typographical code\" for the TAs to understand. I was always under the impression that boxing in your answers on psets was sort of akin to how waving to someone universally means \"hello\" or \"goodbye.\"",
    "I would not take this course unless you absolutely have to for your major or pre-med requirement. I don't feel that I learned a single thing from lecture and became rather irritated with thegrading. You learn exclusively from the book. This course is definitely accessible to people who have both take AP Physics and just basic high school physics. We didn't do any challenging math.",
    "Physics 180 01 is basically AP Physics C. This class covers common physics topics like projectile motion, fluids, entropy, forces and torques.",
    "Hard, painful, not terribly interesting to most people, and a lot of self-teaching. Nevertheless, we can't expect all (or even very many) physics professors to be Walter Lewin of MIT. It was a tough experience and will be made manageable by finding some people to help study with.",
    "Miserable. Take 200. Take 170. Take anything but this class. You will learn nothing in lecture and then be reminded of how little you've learned during exams. The class might have gotten infinitely better during the last month and a half or so. I honestly wouldn't know since I finally managed to completely tune him out by then and just do other things in class. Helpful hint: Your time would be better spent listening to another school's physics courses online or just reading the book during lecture. Unfortunately you can't straight up skip because of clicker questions, but don't waste your time trying to understand what he's saying. Also, 5% of your grade comes from pre-lecture quizzes on material that you haven't learned yet, so have fun with that one. Make friends in the class and alternate submitting first so you don't get 0\/10 every week.",
    "It is an introductory physics course. It covers kinematics, force, momentum, energy, gravitation, fluids, simple harmonic motion, waves, gases, and entropy.",
    "The material is not taught well. And the book for the course is not a good book. You really have to put a lot of time and effort into understanding the concepts if you want to do really well.",
    "The material covered is relatively interesting, and will certainly provide a useful physical foundation for anyone planning on majoring in an engineering or science. This isn't a course I would recommend to someone who is simply \"curious\" about the material, however. Richard Easther is an awful professor, and really quite ruins the class. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Expect to work hard in this class. The tests are very difficult and if you have not taken physics in high school then you will most likely struggle in this class.",
    "PHYS180 is the right fit for you if you came out of high school taking AP Physics B (which is what I did). There is only a little calculus required (MATH115 is fine), and the problems are just a bit more advanced than AP Physics but reasonable in most cases. Professor Easther's pset questions are awkwardly worded - what made most questions difficult was not the physics but determining what exactly he was talking about in the first place. Otherwise they're at about the right physics level. Definitely confer with other people in your class on psets because they are a big part of your grade (which I found unfair, since it rewarded people who had the right answer instead of people who had the right methodology but the wrong answer). There are study halls that are probably useful too.",
    "I would recommend this only to students who are very interested and are math\/science majors or premed. I also recommend students to take this right after high school when they still remember everything they learned in high school physics, etc, otherwise it can be a challenging course. or take it credit\/D, but it is a lot of work for just a credit.",
    "Oh dear, I'd rather not open the floodgates of my disapproval. As someone who has already mastered classical physics and was taking the course simply for the credit, I must say that you're better off learning the class by yourself from MIT's OpenCourseWare (OCW). If Richard Easther is teaching the class, I strongly recommend you teach yourself physics by watching Walter Lewin's lectures on OCW. The material they cover is identical (as is all classes on classical mechanics), so you will far outstrip your peers who don't heed this piece of advice.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Its not fun and its badly taught. I pretty much taught myself the material.",
    "Not a very good physics class.",
    "NO. As someone who did very \"well\" in the class, I strongly recommend another class or professor. Easther does not spend time writing clearly worded questions and was often wrong in class or on a tangent. The only reason I went to class was so I could collect the clicker points, otherwise I would have just read the textbook, as it was a much more effective way of learning. No one in class had a clue what was happening while he was teaching.",
    "Take it if you have to. Shop other physics courses, (I think like 170 and 200) to see if they're better taught.",
    "It's not a very hard class, and it's not a whole lot of work. I can't say I got a whole lot out of the class, so it might be more life-changing to take Physics 200 or 260, but if you have a really heavy workload with your other classes (like I did) then this might be the class for you.",
    "Phys 180 is a good intro course. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of physics and that you start to understand what is happening in the world around you. Prof. Berry is good at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I recommend taking this course.",
    "Lectures are awful, and the material is poorly taught. Read the book and do practice problems if you want to learn anything worthwhile. I only went to class for the clickers.",
    "Easther sucks, but it's good old intro physics, and not too difficult.",
    "Its a bad class but an easy one.",
    "I would not reccomend this class unless it is required for your major or you have a strong background in physics already.",
    "Physics 180 is your standard physics class. The professor is not great, so if you can handle physics 200 I would recommend taking that (though be wary that, unless you have taken AP physics and multi-variable calculus, it will be a struggle). There were some good things to this class that help you stay on top of the material, and I felt that the problem sets were tough, but actually helpful and not obnoxious. Overall, you are probably reading this if you have to take the course. Take it, READ THE BOOK, do problem sets with your friends, and you'll be fine.",
    "If Professor Easther is teaching this class, carefully shop it. There is a lot of work in this class and it is sometime hard to understand the concepts.",
    "Consider taking this class only if you already have a decent physics background and are required to take a physics class. The workload is pretty light, the exams are open-note and I found the book to be quite good. That being said, Richard Easter is probably the worst teacher I have had at Yale. His lectures are usually incomprehensible and he spends the entire time doing elaborate derivations that are not really helpful for anything. He does not seem to be very prepared for class and his scrawl is often illegible. Lecture notes alone do nothing to help you attempt the problem sets so going to class is actually pointless. The use of clickers forces you to go but going to class is so terrible that I would recommend getting someone else to click for you or taking the deduction. Instead, just read the book for 15 minutes and you would have gained more from 50 minutes of lecture. Problems on problem sets and exams are not difficult but they are sometimes so confusing that they are impossible to even attempt even for students in 200 and 260. The material's pretty interesting so learning from the book might make this class worthwhile but attending lecture was definitely the worst part of my week.",
    "Most people take this class because it is a requirement for their major. It is not hard if you took high school physics. This first half is mechanics focused with some waves and thermodynamics. You have a problem set a week and then online questions to answer before every lecture which are a little annoying to remember.Advice: Go to the TA homework help sessions, even if its just to check your pset answers.",
    "I was not a huge fan of this course. Easther was not a very helpful professor, his lectures were unclear, he has an annoying accent, and he often comes across arrogant. However, the grading was fair, and the tests and homework were reasonable.",
    "Do problem sets with friends, get a tutor early if you need it, and don't rely on the lecture or professor for help. Unfortunately, from what I've heard all of the intro physics classes are pretty poorly taught.",
    "The class has several weaknesses. First, the lectures focus too much on the derivation of formulas, instead of on application of these formulas. With plenty of elbow grease, students will achieve a deeper understanding of physics (this is coming from someone who took physics in high school). So, put the time in on your own because the lecture itself will not be as helpful as you will hope it will be.",
    "If you want to actually learn university physics, take this over 170 if that's the question you're facing (and probably struggling with). You gain a much more relevant understanding of general physics without delving into probability theory and diffusion and stuff. The course is fairly straightforward, and the professor is quite helpful out of class. The tests are not too bad, but be prepared to have to do some math without the aid of a calculator. Problem sets are not that hard either. I did not shop 200, but I have heard that may be the introductory physics sequence to take if you have enough confidence in your physics background.",
    "This class was pretty terribly taught, honestly. I learned what I needed to out of the book and the problem sets. The before class quizzes were a pain but the in class clicker questions were helpful. Easther is not the best lecturer as he over emphasizes proofs and doesn't focus on actually teaching the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain a solid understanding of General Physics.",
    "Physics 180 teaches you to use formulas to answer word problems, but you will not understand the concepts unless you use the textbook to teach yourself. I would recommend this course if it were necessary to a student's requirements.",
    "A decent class. My AP Physics class was a joke so I decided to take 180, and I feel like I learned everything pretty well that I was supposed to have learned in AP but didn't. You basically don't need any calculus for this class so don't let that affect your decision. The class itself isn't too bad; the problem sets are very doable, with a few trickier questions later in the semester. Exams are open-note and pretty straightforward. Overall I guess I was satisfied with the class but I almost wish I had taken 200 to put my math skills to use on some more interesting and deeper physics.",
    "This was a good, reasonably paced class with fair expectations. I would recommend it to anybody with the proper math background and the patience to keep up with the tri-weekly quizzes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in an intro class to physics.",
    "It is an excellent course that really emphasizes the important concepts and information that you really should know about the way the natural world works. I love that about the course. I hope that it stays that way and doesn't become too abstract or too involved with equations and numbers. Learning the concepts was my favorite part and even if you've taken physics before, this course will teach you new concepts and solidifiy old ones. All in all, a rather good course at yale. the problem sets are slightly difficult but the exams are fair.",
    "By all means.",
    "Take it if you absolutely have to. The lectures are not helpful. You basically have to learn the material on your own.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to work hard and learn mechanics.",
    "good course",
    "Everything about this class made it miserable at best. The textbook is very disorganized, often with similar topics appearing sporadically over a span of chapters, making studying a single concept very difficult. The problem sets were only vaguely related to the topics we covered in lecture, and the example problems Professor Easther presented in class were either overly simplistic or unnecessarily difficult (ie. using partial differential equations and writing out proofs that are only covered extensively in MATH246, not calculus). Professor Easther was as disorganized in his lectures as he was difficult to comprehend, and he rarely took time to explain anything thoroughly. There are a lot of things I found disagreeable about Professor Easther beyond his teaching ability that I am inclined to believe that the majority of the class would've supported, but I will not discuss them in this evaluation. I would only recommend this course if you absolutely HAVE to take it, and even then try to find a friend to take it with to make it a little more bearable. I strongly believe that the only reason the majority of the class actually attended lectures was because of the clickers, as the lectures were hardly productive ever.",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably because you have to, so for goodness sake please BE PROACTIVE about speaking up in lecture when you \/ your discussion group don't understand something. So many times half the lecture would be looking at each other in total confusion, but nobody would dare to speak up. Prof. Easter won't bite, even if his explanations are often less satisfactory than just reading the textbook -- try to make the best of this course! Also, don't start the psets only the night before.",
    "Don't take this class if you can avoid it at all. Take the next hardest level instead. Switch your major to economics or political science. Switch to a school whose administration doesn't treat science majors like second-class citizens, if you want to take physics that badly. This class is awful.The lectures are boring and impossible to understand, but you have to attend because \"clicking in\" is part of your grade. The problem sets are hard and long (and often poorly worded), and in addition to the problem sets, there's an online quiz before every lecture (which is also part of your grade). And the exams will make you want to cry. Seriously, run while you still can."
