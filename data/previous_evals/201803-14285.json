    "A bit on melodic minor modes and Afro-Cuban rhythms.",
    "Improved understanding of Afro-Cuban relevance to jazz. Improved understanding of the logic of bebop through pivoting exercises and bebop scales. Goal: learn a lot of blues, rhythm changes, and bebop heads to learn the language. Transcribe solos you find interesting. Prefer to do a couple of bars."

    "Strengths: Wayne is an incredible player and has much to impart. Weaknesses: This course was not organized in a way that taught much of anything effectively. The class size was too large for students to play enough and make progress on their jazz improvisation. Also, we had a mix of students with no jazz experience and others with a lot of experience. I'm not sure if either got much out of the class. Maybe this course could be made into a full-credit course with half the number of students, and target itself at a certain still level (i.e. intro, intermediate, or advanced, but not all of the above). There should also be a clear syllabus that details what will be taught and when it will be covered. Also, Wayne missed five classes. For a seminar that meets once a week, that's a large chunk of the course.",
    "A major problem was that it felt like a number of disjointed lectures, often from different lecturers, so there was a lack of cohesiveness between weeks. Afro-Cuban rhythms, for instance, were barely touched on after the guest lecturer. Perhaps we could have looked for claves in jazz songs. Also, it appeared that Ben Williams didn't understand the level of musicianship nor had a lecture planned. There could be better communication between Wayne Escofferey and the guest lecturers. I also feel like though we touched on many aspects of jazz theory, we never really learned to improvize per se. More call and response and attempts at making people solo in class would have helped significantly. This class could be called a guest lecture series in jazz rather than a course on jazz improvisation."

   "comments": [
    "Not as it currently exists. There was not much direction or structure to the class. The class consisted of mostly school of music students who were of course technically proficient but had no jazz experience. The remaining student students were intermediate to advanced players. I don't think either group got much out of the course. I walked away feeling like I didn't acquire any meaningful skills, and I didn't think Wayne ever got an impression of my level. Wayne was gone for five classes. He got other jazz musicians\/educators to cover for him, but their classes were aimless and boiled down to vague advice about jazz. In fairness to them, we were an unwieldy class with a mix of experience, so we couldn't exactly \"play some changes\" together; we weren't a seasoned combo ready for a masterclass. Unfortunately, the only takeaway I got from our guest lecturers is that great players are often mediocre teachers. When Wayne was around, classes dragged on and didn't have nearly enough material to justify the class's 2 hour length. All this being said, I'm glad that Yale is starting to offer jazz courses. I think that with some major restructuring this could be a decent course. As of now, it feels like it's a half-baked course that exists so that Yale can point its finger at it and claim to offer jazz.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone truly interested in improving their improvisation. However, they would need a solid grounding in the language already in order to grasp and make use of the concepts covered. They would have to know how to use their ear and improvise on a basic level before enrolling. The concepts provide lots for improvement, but this will come from practicing it beyond the duration of the course. The benefits won't be immediate."
