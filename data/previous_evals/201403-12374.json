   "comments": [
    "This course is good if you want a basic intro to a lot of math. I took it right out of 120 and didn't feel out of place. It could do with a little less time on multi-variable, since every person in the class had taken it before -- the time would have been better spent on eigenvectors\/eigenvalues\/diff eq's as those are more commonly seen in subsequent physics courses.",
    "A whirlwind survey of multivariable calculus, linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, and differential equations. One of the most fun classes I've taken (though the psets sometimes get frustratingly tedious). Prof. Padmanabhan is an amazing teacher - both clear and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend.",
    "Good course. Moves at a reasonable pace if you have some familiarity with most of the topics. Definitely not a waste of time, even having taken Linear Algebra before-- learned a lot of really important applications to physics. Workload isn't terrible -- psets took usually more than 5 hours and less than 10. Exams were relatively difficult but fair.",
    "It is not a super fun class, but you learn very useful mathematical techniques, and most people who are considering taking it are probably required to take it anyway. Take the course, just be ready to put a lot of hours in.",
    "This is an excellent class, but it moves quickly through a lot of different subjects. Don't expect a lot of depth in any one thing, but it's very good if you want to solidify subjects you've already studied, get a brief intro to new subjects, or some combination of the two. And though it is focused on problem-solving rather than theory, it is definitely a math class.",
    "You should definitely take this class if you are a physics major - it puts mathematics in a physics perspective and helps you understand why and how you do most of the most of the math that you need for physics.",
    "An excellent course if you are hoping to get to advanced physics classes more quickly. But will definitely make you want to take more math courses at Yale.",
    "Only take if you are required to for your major.",
    "This class covers a ton of topics in a short time. Padmanabhan is a great prof, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The textbook is pretty useless and hard to read but class teaches you pretty much enough. Problem sets are hard and need work but prepare you well for exams."
