    "I'm sort of meh. It was definitely cool to work with grad students and take a class that broke away from the traditional undergrad lecture format. Professor Fischer is very nice and also very smart, an I appreciated her willingness to work with students and offer help whenever they asked. My main complaint is that except for during the first few weeks, this felt more like a series of unorganized presentations than a class. I generally learned very little from the student paper presentations \/ astro ph club, and the guest lectures were similarly haphazard. In short, I know Professor Fischer is an incredible resource, and I wish we would have used her more. I like to hear smart professors lecturing. Mediocre grad students, not so much. Oh, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this class is laughably easy. There were five problem sets, each about 5 hours long. I think everyone got all the points on problem sets, because Professor Fischer tended to give us points even when our answers were wrong. She gave us a copy of the midterm \"to study from\" the weekend before the in-class midterm, so basically anyone with even a few brain cells got 100%. No final. We were also supposed to be being graded on a class project that we did throughout the term. But the grad students basically shouldered all the actual work and the undergrads looked on idly. Oh, that's another thing. I don't think there should be a class project. Just assign everyone an individual project. Telling 15 people with different levels of experience, different preferred coding languages, and generally different ways of approaching problems to work together is a recipe for disaster.",
    "I found this class very interesting. Because of the mix of undergrads and grad students, it was different than other classes I have taken. The material is very interesting and the problem sets were challenging but reasonable. Professor Fischer is also a really good teacher and wants to make sure that you understand the material.",
    "If you're looking at ASTR 491 on ClassesV2 and see a review that looks like it should be for Exoplanets, well, that was me. ANYWAY: Exoplanets is a fantastic course! The material was extremely fascinating, and Debra Fischer is nothing short of wonderful. Two complaints: I wish we had spent more time on the astrobiology unit, which had to be shortened to make room for the final project. I also didn't like the final project format because the graduate students mainly took it over for the sake of time. As an undergraduate, I felt like I didn't contribute much. But Prof. Fischer is thinking of changing the final project format.",
    "The material is SO COOL, and this course kept me interested the entire semester. The professor is upbeat, and the class is very informal and involved--there are a lot of open discussions, presentations each week of the latest research papers, and group projects. The only thing is that it's listed as a graduate course as well, so it was half astronomy grad students, which means it was a lot of work for the undergrads to keep up. Overall, the class was a ton of work and pretty difficult at times, but completely worth it.",
    "Astr 375 is a fascinating investigation into the creation and evolution of planets, and a solid survey of our investigations of extrasolar systems. The format of the course - several problem sets, an in-class midterm, and a final class project (that extended through the last half of the semester and culminated in final presentations), in my view provided an nice balance of workload and diversity of types of work through the semester. The course may be tweaked in future years, e.g. in the structure of the final project, but I have found Professor Fischer to be a remarkably in-tune and adaptable professor, so I feel confident this class - already a great experience when I took it - will only continue to improve."
