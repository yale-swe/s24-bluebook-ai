    "Fascinating readings and big ideas. There's a good art theory component. Since there aren't assignments to keep you engaged throughout (one final paper and weekly ungraded reading responses), you have to self-motivate to take things from the class. Or, you can not self-motivate and just hang out. Your call. Gilmore is helpful and flexible, and will do everything he can to help you take the most from the class. He tends to lecture at times, but generally says interesting things, so no real complaints there.",
    "Freedom of Expression examines the crossover between philosophy of art and philosophy of law, considering the ways that expression, artistic or otherwise, are subject to first amendment protection. This is an incredibly thought-provoking subject if you are interested in law, philosophy, or art. The reading consists of different angles and arguments on major free expression subjects from obscenity and pornography to public sculpture. I definitely recommend the class for a collection of interesting reading and good discussions. Because most of the grade is a self-directed paper at the end of the class, really putting in time and energy with this paper makes this class rewarding.",
