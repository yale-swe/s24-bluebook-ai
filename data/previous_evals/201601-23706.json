   "comments": [
    "Even if you want a low-stress senior seminar, the quality of discussion was low and was often painful to sit through. On the other hand, some people will sit in silence for the entire semester. Especially if you have taken ConLaw or any law-related classes, I would see who else is taking it before you choose this as one of your last classes.",
    "I am sure everyone has read the reviews saying that the course is easy and not worth much. And this is true. But, as someone interested in the subject matter from multiple angles (both the law in general part and discrimination in particular), I had hoped that this was one of those courses that you could get something out of if you tried to, despite the option of doing nothing and skating by. Unfortunately, it's not one of those courses. Even if you do the readings and are interested, it's not a worthwhile course. Most of the students are entirely disengaged, and the professor's expertise is much more in discrimination matters related to economics than in anything having to do with the law. He caricatures the various theories of interpreting legal texts in a way that would embarrass most first-year law students, and some fourth-year undergrads. (These caricatures make it easier to sell the blatant bias in favor of certain schools of thought that are not just present, but dominant, throughout the course.) He really shouldn't teach a law course on discrimination, but a course on discrimination from some other angle. So yes, this class is incredibly easy and if that's the kind of senior spring you're looking for, maybe it's for you. But it's also disappointing and useless, so if you're one of the couple dozen people who can't get in but were hoping to take the class in order to actually learn something, not getting into it is a blessing in disguise.",
    "Don't take this course. Grading is too uncertain, you literally don't learn or do anything and you could have an A or C going into this review, regardless of whether you're getting Latin honors or just scraping by. Take a different econ seminar where you'll learn anything and at least have a ballpark for your grade",
    "This class was a major letdown to me. The workload is very easy but the class was just disappointing. The professor seemed checked out every morning and didn't really contribute a lot to class discussions at all. A nice class to take as a senior with only a little work, but there are far more rewarding options out there.",
    "The only pro to this class is that there's a light workload. Jaynes doesn't appear to be an easy grader though, so if you're absolutely certain you want an A, maybe avoid this. There's only one class on cases of gender discrimination, which I think can definitely be improved. This was also the only class where Jaynes brought up sympathizing for discriminators, which I found unnerving.",
    "Highly recommended. You don't have to do the readings, at all, but you will most likely end up doing them because it's actually interesting stuff. Seriously lol I never thought I'd say that, but this is the only class I've done every reading for."
