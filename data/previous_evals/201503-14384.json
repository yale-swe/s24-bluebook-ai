    "Take it, you won't regret it at all.",
    "Very interesting HSHM seminar with interesting and not too heavy reading loads. I learned a lot and enjoyed the discussion each week.",
    "Pretty solid class mates. *insert dank meme",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any Yale student. I thoroughly enjoyed the weekly seminar and the readings. I am not an HSHM student, but the course engaged me in many thought-provoking discussions that are pertinent to any major. The course also teaches you how to explore all of the amazing resources that Yale offers. The professor is also incredible, making this a class you don't want to miss!",
    "Class on the history of the body.",
    "Take this class! Or anything taught by Courtney, really. The class covered a wide range of topics and was extremely interesting. Courtney leads discussion well and provides good feedback for papers.",
    "History of the Body is a great overview of how the body's perception has changed throughout history and how it has been used as a tool to achieve specific purposes. A great class to take if you are interested in the body and its implications in the real world.",
    "I really liked this class. It's very historical, and starts off a bit slow but is enjoyable. For those of you more interested in recent information, only the second half is going to be interesting to you, but you learn a lot of valuable information in this class. I would definitely recommend. Do the readings.",
    "Yes! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Lots of really interesting readings and Courtney is awesome."
