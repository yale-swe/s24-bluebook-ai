    "Yes",
    "Not really. Beecroft is a pretty boring and uninspiring teacher. If you love philosophy and want a survey of classic philosophy, then the course is a good opportunity to be exposed to it, but overall it was not an incredible experience.",
    "I would not give a wholehearted recommendation of any DS course because not every student is suited to DS.",
    "Yes, I would. It is the perfect survey course with just enough depth to get people interested in pursuing philosophy further. I was thinking about majoring in Philosophy, and this course has given me greater impetus to do so. The workload, which substantial, isn't all that bad. It's also really important stuff to think about regardless of your academic interests. I think all Yale students ought to think about how to live well before thinking about what to do with their life. This course provokes just that kind of thought.",
    "Philosophy is probably the hardest section in Directed Studies; fortunately, it's also the one in which the faculty do the most to help your understanding. Do the reading, engage in section, and you'll be amazed at how comprehensible Aristotle can be.",
    "Directed studies philosophy is an excellent introduction to a field of writing that usually remains unvisited during high school -- it is a must.",
    "I would recommend this class because I think it's important to read these works and doingso in this setting really helps you understand the different ideas.",
    "DS is great if you're willing to put in the time and if you don't mind lots of reading. Just know what you are getting into. Philosophy will probably be completely different from anything you've done before, but at the end, you will have learned a lot. With Plato and Aristotle, try not to get behind on the first readings in particular, because they will be helpful to understanding the later readings. Prof. Beecroft is very relaxed, which is nice, but class can be a little disorganized at times."
