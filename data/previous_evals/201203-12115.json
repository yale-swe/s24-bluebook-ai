   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course! Great for students in any science, or even those with only a tangential interest in science.",
    "This course is definitely a lot of work, but if you have a genuine interest in medicine, and especially if you plan on going to medical school, this course is immensely useful. You will learn some incredibly important concepts that seemingly go unnoticed in current medical practice and that may be exceptionally important for future directions in both treatment and prevention of disease.",
    "This is an absolutely amazing class. I would urge anybody interested in evolution or medicine to take it. It is so useful to understand medical issues that we are facing today and how they may have arisen in the past and what precautions we must take in our current medical system in order to prevent future medical emergencies. Stearns is an absolutely amazing professor. He is a giant in his field, but remains incredibly accessible and friendly.",
    "Definitely take this if it is offered again! Professor Stearns is a brilliant professor - he is both a great lecturer and a great discussion leader. You read a lot of interesting papers (~4-5 a week, roughly), and learn a lot of interesting concepts. There are two midterms and a 3500-4000 word paper, but the work is enjoyable so it's easy to keep up.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. One of the most engaging, challenging, and interesting science classes here at Yale!! Only take it if you have a background, any background, in statistics. Professor Stearns is great and really cares about his students' learning. He's an expert in the field and has met a lot of the authors of the works we read. The paper is not too hard if you space it out, but the midterms are tough.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned a lot from it, and it's a refreshing change from the structure of many science lecture courses, which are focused on memorizing content more than thinking. Be aware that it is a lot of class time and a lot of work, however.",
    "Definitely would recommend, but again, make sure you are prepared to do copious amounts of reading."
