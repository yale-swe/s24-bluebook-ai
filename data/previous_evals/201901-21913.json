    "Chinese oral, written and reading skills.",
    "I learned about Chinese culture and language.",
    "This course taught me to better converse, listen, read and write in Chinese. The vocabulary we acquired is highly applicable for everyday conversations to be able to make our way around a Chinese city and get to know someone in Chinese. We learned grammatical structures, expressions, and the origins of the characters we learn to gain an appreciation for the Chinese language and culture.",
    "Taking the two semesters of Chinese brought me to a basic level of fluency in Chinese to have simple conversations on a range of subjects. I think I have also learned enough grammar that continuing to learn the language on my own after college will also be easier.",
    "I learned a lot more Chinese."

    "I think this classes is designed very well with it's emphasis on practicing every day, however I think there should be more focus on the characters (their radicals, and the connections between them, so that it is easier and more logical to memorize them). I think we only spent one day fully focused on characters, and that was probably my favorite class. Also I really enjoyed the character quizlet competition we had.",
    "Strengths - oral Weakness - written and reading characters; tones",
    "A lot of one-on-one instructions. Dedicated professors. Really a great class. Very hard though",
    "This course is probably the best taught class I have taken at Yale. The rigor with daily written and oral homeworks, character practice and quizzes allows us to acquire the material progressively through practice and repetition. Class is engaging both in its teaching and conversation, and all the Chinese teachers are remarkable - I loved Li Laoshis class.",
    "The regular assignments and in-class practice of the material allows for good understanding."

    "Yes, if they are ready to commit to high effort and intensive courses.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is motivated to learn Chinese and has the time do the homework and practice regularly."
