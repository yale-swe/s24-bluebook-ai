    "L3 Spanish is basically a review of L1 and L2; there's a few minor grammar topics that are new, and some L2 topics aren't covered until L4. If you feel up to it and are really serious about becoming fluent in Spanish, you might want to consider doing the intensive L3\/L4 course etc., otherwise L3 might end up feeling like a waste of time.If you do take L3, Rosamaria Leon is a great professor. She structures the class in a way that really emphasizes developing conversational skills, which is important especially because you don't learn much else new in this class. She may seem tough (in terms of making you study vocabulary beforehand to prepare for possible quizzes, etc.) but when it comes to exams and compositions she grades pretty fairly, and doesn't take off huge numbers of points for really minor errors like some professors do.",
    "its a requirement, but i liked it..",
    "Recommend.",
    "It is a good class, like AP spanish. It is a good recap if you are rusty.",
    "I enjoyed this class. Spanish 130 is your basic, solid Spanish class. For me, it was not very different from high school- except without the busy work so that's nice. Getting an A is pretty easy as long as you take your time on the homework and study for the tests. The homework is not time consuming- it's just tempting to give it less time than you should. Working in partners for everything gets annoying, but all around, this class helped me learn more Spanish so it was worth it and definitely beneficial. It was not stressful, and I enjoyed it. My class was really fun and it became a great, non-stressful class and a nice wayto ease into the day. Rosamaria is very nice although explanations can be confusing at times. Enfoques is a great textbook.",
    "definitely",
    "Level 3 Spanish is a good, basic language class. If you took Spanish in high school and need to fulfill a requirement, then Spanish is a good language to take. After taking both L1 and L2 Spanish, L3 requires much more work to achieve a good grade, but if you put significant time and effort into the course it's not that hard. You wont come out of the course speaking fluent Spanish (which is to be expected), but you wont even be comprehensible if you don't put some time and effort into it. Overall, it's not fantastic, but it's a good course. Take it if you need to fulfill a requirement. If you really want to learn how to speak Spanish, then take a study abroad course."
