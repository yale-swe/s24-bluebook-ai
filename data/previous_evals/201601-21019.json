   "comments": [
    "The expectations in this class are very manageable- the reading load isn't too much, and there are 4 short essays (1-2 pages). As a non-native speaker, I enjoyed reading some familiar short stories in the original Russian. The class is mixed non-native and native speakers, which can be a bit challenging at times in terms of varying comprehension levels, but you won't be over your head in this class. I would definitely recommend it for those who have taken 4th year Russian (RUSS 160\/161).",
    "RUSS 178 is a complicated class. If you're not a native Russian speaker, the whole affair can be quite intimidating. It doesn't exactly feel like a seminar, but Yulia is really encouraging and the reading is interesting and manageable!",
    "Yulia is amazing, and the readings are a wonderful introduction into Russian literature. Unfortunately, the class is unrigorous and definitely doesn't push you to expand your language ability. Very easy, which is nice, but not the most fulfilling academic experience.",
    "A very solid class. Julia Titus is very passionate about literature. You will read essential classical short stories and learn a lot about the most renowned Russian authors. Coursework is very manageable and consists of weekly readings and classroom discussions, four 2 page essays, and one presentation. Discussions are very engaging (often focusing on connection between history and literature), and essays are quite fun to write. Would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it. Can't say for non-heritage speakers, but for native speakers it is an easy class, pretty interesting discussions and a good way to get language\/humanities credit",
    "I would recommend RUSS 178 to any student of Russian who is interested in practicing their reading and writing skills in Russian, and is looking to read works by some of the most influential writers in Russia. The readings are very manageable and are just enough to truly practice Russian, but are not too long such that they are overwhelming and unable to be completed."
