    "Each week you read some texts and watch a film or two. That's pretty much the only way to describe this course. Let's just say that the prompt for final paper proposals encouraged us to write about issues or problems of the course, which included: \"character and how character is presented; about description of setting and of action; about \u00e2\u0080\u0098imagery\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098figures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that derive from narration; about narrative voice and its relation to\u00e2\u0080\u0094and sometimes mixture of\u00e2\u0080\u0094tense, mood, and person (1st or 3rd, direct or indirect); the evocation of nearly immaterial phenomena (ghosts, ethics, rhythm, atmosphere); the quite material facts of writing, filmmaking, authorship, acting, and the historical circumstances of the production and subsequent reception of stories, novels, and films.\" So, basically, this course covered anything and everything about film and fiction, according to the whims of the professors. (Who were amazing, and had the kind of incredible and ribbing and even tender dynamic that cannot possibly be expressed in mere words.)In some ways, this course felt like a book club, each week bringing a new selection which may or may not connect with the others--there was no obvious progression from one week to the next. But it'll be the best book club you will ever be in. If it's offered again, take it.",
    "\u00e2\u0080\u009cFilm and Fiction\u00e2\u0080\u009d was an exercise either in generosity or in self-indulgence - your call - on the part of two men of formidable scholarly repute, two men who share a keen intellectual and occasionally flirtatious fondness for each other and who will probably not teach this class again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur insights and enthusiasms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bromwich to Andrew some time ago, but probably not too long ago, maybe you know during the tender early days of the Obama presidency, \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely, are too insightful and enthusiastic, too good, too utterly goddamn wonderful to perish unheard but to your ears and mine, each the instant after its birth, tossed into the waning flicker of a living-room fireplace or across the lounge in 451 College over coffee in the bitter morning minutes before yet another tawdry curricular meeting. We should--nay we must--share them with the underclass! I mean, the undergraduates! On your filmic ground and through our shared fictional kingdom we shall romp and roam. What is the course about? Hah. As Edmund Burke surely must have said at one time or another, who the f cares?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which Andrew replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he laughed a breathy little laugh as if it were all both very obvious and almost poignantly amusing, like the early Truffaut at its best, a laugh that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been meaning to say but you are more eloquent and ebullient than I am and more... not obnoxious but well yes obnoxious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he paused and looked straight ahead and said nothing for a moment and then looked up, over his glasses, at Bromwich, and smiled a tentative smile, and it glimmered with all the wanderlust and all the homey Midwestern deference of Iowa City and in that moment he was an ivory-tower James Gatz holding Daisy in his arms on a Louisville sidewalk and, in that moment, a seminar of ineffable gaudiness unfolded itself in his brain: so Film and Fiction was born.",
    "If this course is taught again, take it. You'll read great books and watch great movies and talk about them with great professors, which if you're into that sort of thing is kind of the point of college, right?",
    "This course isn't really a study of adaptation even though it seems that way. It's more a comparative study of independent texts in each week. Nevertheless, the course was informative, the films and stories are fascinating, and the seminar discussion brought up interesting insights. I would recommend this for Film and Literature students, maybe not for English majors without prior interest in the topic.",
    "This was the first semester that this course was offered, and it was astonishing--the best of my semester by far. Professors Andrew and Bromwich are both joys to be around and some of the smartest at Yale; they are experts in their field, and yet facilitate incredible discussions. Every single seminar was full of twists and turns and had a palpable intellectual arc. Watching a film a week, especially with this group of students, made each week feel fuller, more savory. If you like reading, if you like film, if you like art, if you like talking about and thinking about art--take this class. Don't hesitate.The syllabus is fantastic--Godard, Truffaut, Hitchcock, Welles, Rohmer, Visconti, Bertolucci, Kubrick, and that's not all! But this won't be your standard Intro to Film syllabus, because each film is appreciated not just on its own merits but as a particular way of telling a story that might exist outside of the film. This way of thinking about art blows up distinctions between mediums and allows for discussions to get at the heart of what film--and literature--really is, and what kinds of things each can do. It exceeded my sky-high expectations.",
    "Excellent course if you're interested how literature and film come together.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The screenings are an introduction to the canonical films. Having two professors, one an expert in literature and the other in film, made the discussions fascinating. The questions of the class (what makes a novel novelistic and a film cinematic, how does film reveal a character's thoughts, is everything adaptable) permanently changed the way I watch films.",
    "Highly recommended. Bromwich and Andrew are a brilliant pair."
