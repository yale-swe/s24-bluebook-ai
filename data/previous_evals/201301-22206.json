   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking to learn about music! It might be helpful if you can read music just to better understand some of the terms used in class and to be able to describe the music better.",
    "I took this course as a musician who didn't know enough about classical music (and as a Yalie looking for a fifth class). This was a good course for my purposes. Unfortunately we rarely studied more than one piece by a composer, which often gave an incorrect impression of that composer--for example, we studied Tchaikovsky only in the realm of ballet, when in reality he was *so* much more than that. And if you're a musician you might find some of the class discussion a little juvenile. But overall, this class was stressless and pretty interesting. The listening exercises really did help me think about music and form in new ways. I'm glad I did this.",
    "There are two ways to take this class: to be a good student and do the readings or to do the minimal amount of work. I think there were about 3 good students in my class of 30. I was not one of them. But learning about Chopin was great. Minimalism, atonal music, chance music, less so. You'll learn a lot in this class. If you play music, it's a great way to complement everything you've learned. But it's not a guaranteed A. I felt that grading, especially on exams, was a little subjective. But overall I do not deny that it was fair.",
    "more work than you think and it is a long class",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale. It teaches you things that will stay with your for the rest of your life.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! I feel like I got so much out of it and it was definitely the most enjoyable class in my schedule this semester!!!",
    "take it if gundula is teaching it",
    "Yes. The workload is very manageable and the music on the syllabus is a joy to listen to.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend MUSI 131 for anyone who has a musical background or interest.",
    "MUSI 131 is a great way to fulfill a HU credit for anyone who has performed music and is interested in learning more about the background of what they play. This however might be a more difficult for someone who has never played music, since the writing assignments are listening-based and it's a lot easier when you understand the different parameters that go into making music (dynamics, instrumentation, accents, meter, etc.) Professor Kreuzer was an engaging professor, and the 75 minutes each class fly by rather quickly. The workload was fairly low - just 4 2-page listening assignments that are based on a 1-minute to 4-minute piece. As long as you address each aspect of the prompt, it's not that hard to get an A on them. Go to class and make sure you take good notes. The midterm and final is based on how detailed you can get with the answers. Part of the final was also listening identification, so that might be difficult if you've played music before since about 50-60% of the pieces we cover are well-known among musicians.",
    "only if you are truly interested in music would I recommend teh course",
    "This is a great course for non-majors who want to learn about some great classical music. Prof. Kreuzer is absolute a great lecturer, and she conducts each lecture extremely well - giving people with and without music experience a poetic survey through music of the past 200 years or so. Definitely one of my favorite classes this semester. Even having three classes in a row before this one, I still didn't feel like time in the class was ever dragging. It's a class that you don't want to skip.If you want to listen to some great music, or want to understand people like Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Schoenberg, Adams - TAKE THIS course.Exams were a crunch for time and your hand will practically die afterwards, but other than that work consists of weekly reading and four 2-page listening assignments\/essays.",
    "This class was very interesting, but depends greatly on your musical knowledge and that of the rest of the class. The professor adjusts so that the majority of the class will not feel like class is too dumbed down, meaning those less experienced students may feel lost at times. However, the readings and optional discussion sections help catch up anyone that may feel lost.",
    "THIS CLASS IS GREAT! It is not a ton of work, but you learn so so much. If you're looking for a Hu credit, look no further. Such a rewarding class.",
    "This course will teach a large amount of information, but with consistent work, it is easy to handle. The knowledge is interesting and relevant, especially to musicians. Definitely recommended!",
    "So much beautiful information, not enough time to really appreciate and study the material. I took it as a fifth class, definitely do able but the long 1.5 lectures and mandatory attendance (sign in sheet every class) sometimes were too much after a long day. You really learn if you listen to the pieces before and the readings. Don't skip this, unless you just want to listen to nice music and call it a day. It's worth more than that. Plus, you'll struggle on the midterms and final. Both involved 8-10 short essay questions that really explore the different transitions of music genres. Lovely course, lovely professor.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in classical music at all! It's actually fun to attend, and you learn a lot.",
    "Only take this if you have some background in music, or a good ear. Otherwise it is hard to understand what is going on. Also, lectures can be a bit dry. Overall a decent course though",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class for students with some or even no music background.",
    "YES YES YES--absolutely take this! This was the most beautiful course I have taken, and the BEST class I have taken during my two years at Yale. Never have history, music theory, the visual arts, philosophy, and literature been integrated and presented in such a beautiful way. Every single lecture was brilliantly crafted, every word Professor Kreuzer (make sure you take this class with her) was beautiful. I am still listening to the songs from the syllabus and gushing about them to my friends and family today. Every song on the syllabus, from Beethoven to Italian opera to modern pieces, has been incredible--even the atonal stuff I have begun to enjoy\/appreciate after learning about the thought behind the pieces. Take this course for the most interesting perspective, and simply to delight your senses. Music is something that everyone enjoys--learn more about what makes it so accessible to everyone.",
    "A hidden gem in Yale's departments. Not too much work, and one of the most interesting courses I have taken. Most people aren't music majors (and I'm not, although I play instruments), and you walk away from each class with lots of interesting information.The reading isn't entirely necessary, although it is interesting.",
    "see first question. yes i would recommend this course to anyone",
    "Yes. Pretty easy class, on the whole. You should probably know how to read music, but that's about it.",
    "YES!!! Take it !!",
    "I thought that this would be a pretty easy Hu credit, but apparently it is not as easy as I had thought. They say you need no musical experience, but everyone who stayed in the class had many years of musical background.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to get a better grasp on music history! It's a survey class so you don't dive into great depth with any one composer, but you get a great general understanding of trends in music history and the most influential composers.Professor Kreuzer is a great lecturer, very knowledgeable and approachable. I looked forward to her lectures. This was my 5th class, and was definitely manageable on top of heavy work for other classes. However, if you have no musical background at all, you might struggle more, especially with the 4 homework assignments.",
    "This course introduces you to music history ad listening analysis, and will enhance your understanding and enjoyment of music for the rest of your life. A must-take!"
