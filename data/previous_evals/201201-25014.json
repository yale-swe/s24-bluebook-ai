    "Take it if you're interested in systems of oppression.",
    "It's a junior history seminar. There is a ton of reading, but it only meets once a week. You definitely can't come to class having no idea what we read that week. That said, I'm pretty sure having at least read some of the book will help you get through a two hour seminar.",
    "Great class, interesting books, nicest\/coolest professor ever, take it!",
    "Racial Violence is your typical seminar - a book per week on a different subject of racial violence in America. There are no reading responses, instead a pair of students lead the class discussion each week. Professor Feimster is a good discussion moderated but does make her views very well known. It was a very solid class. I would recommend it.",
    "You read one book a week, usually focusing on the the experiences with violence of a single racial group. Over the course of the semester you also read two other full books: James Scott's \"Domination and the Arts of Resistance,\" which gives a good theoretical framework for a lot of the concrete material the main book discusses, and Ronald Takaki's \"A Different Mirror.\" There is one two-hour discussion a week, always led by one or two class members who have prepared a summary of the book and its arguments and a list of discussion questions. There was a Community Based Learning option for us. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who can commit to it! It requires a lot of work and focus, not just for you to get something out of it, but also for your classmates to get something out of you!",
    "I would say that it's a good class with a great professor and interesting subject matter. There needs to be more of a weekly work structure to ensure that people are doing the reading and coming to class prepared to discuss.",
    "Highly recommended, not least because Professor Feimster is such an excellent personal resource. Few take the time to care about their students as much. Be prepared to do all the reading, so if the syllabus doesn't interest you, think twice."
