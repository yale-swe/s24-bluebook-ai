    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are so interesting, the teacher is great, the workload is manageable. It is a class that will change the way you thing. It has added a lot of knowledge for me but it has also changed me as a person, as cliched as that sounds. TAKE IT TAKE IT!!",
    "It's very much what you make of it--you can decide how much of the readings to do and how much to think about each one--but obviously, the more you read, the more you will get out of it. The discussions are also very stimulating, but they do depend largely on the composition of your class. It was the first WGSS\/AMST class that I took at Yale, and I would recommend it to anyone else who is in that situation, looking for a class to try out. You can write about anything that you want on your papers. The only thing is that several dense readings may pile up in a week, so watch out for that.",
    "AMAZING CLASS! YOU SHOULD TAKE IT! DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES IF'VE TAKEN AT YALE.",
    "Just take it. You won't regret it.",
    "absolutely take this course.",
    "Great class! Take it for sure. Prof Chanda will make you question and challenge your understanding of your life and identity every class."
