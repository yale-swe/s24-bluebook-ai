    "Add my voice to the chorus of students praising JBS and his seminars. I highly recommend Public Schools and Public Policy - you get the chance to actually think about and try your hand at policymaking, and it's a great change from the usual seminar style of professor-led comments followed by everyone in the group taking a turn to speak. You get to know your classmates really well - everyone is incredibly smart, eloquent and engaged - and you also get to challenge yourself to speak up, defend your ideas, and think creatively. JBS is smart, knowledgeable, engaged, and fair.The work: weekly casebooks (articles on a specific topic, like charter schools), study group meetings, reading response drafts, revised reading responses (which you can keep revising), oral midterm, final research paper (or senior thesis - he's a great advisor).",
    "Best class you'll take at Yale - hands down. JBS is a god among men, and if you're lucky enough to get in, you'll find yourself in the most rewarding, interesting, and productive academic environment of your life.",
    "This course epitomizes what a good Yale class should be. I could not recommend it more highly. One of those 'must take at Yale' classes.PLSC 240 draws some of the brightest minds at Yale to think and collaborate about the daunting challenges that face America's public education system. Whether or not you're interested in that topic, this course is an opportunity to hone your leadership skills, practice critical thinking, and work as a team with interesting and engaged people. Plus, Professor Starr ('JBS') puts so much preparation into every seminar that it makes all your other seminar professors seem lackluster.",
    "Yes important issues and great professor",
    "This class has fantastic reviews, and I definitely think most people would find it to be an excellent course. I would make one comment, though: the course is taught in a very particular way, so make sure you like the teaching style before signing up. Every week, there's a casebook of about 200 words and a reading response that you can edit at any point before the end of the class. You spend class doing group work - pretending to be charter management organization, say, or debating the merits of different forms of student accountability measures. For most people, this is new and invigorating, and if it sounds like it to you, I wholeheartedly encourage you to take it. You also make friends with your class and bond over drinks and food. It's a one-of-a-kind experience, and if you're up for it,do it!",
    "The most academically stimulating course I have taken at Yale. The workload (200+ pages of reading per week, weekly essay, oral interview midterm, research paper, mandatory study group, extended class session) is significant. This course assembles some of the most impressive and academically accomplished upperclassmen at Yale, which can make it feel intimidating at the beginning. However, the class environment quickly transforms the class into a genuine, incredibly productive community of learners - and perhaps more impressively, a group of friends. The way the course is conducted is unique and an incredible improvement over more typical models of Yale seminars. Professor Starr is a truly wonderful teacher, and very much deserves his cult following. Not to be missed.",
    "YES. If you can get into this class, take it. It was the most worthwhile experience I've ever gotten from a yale class. It is a duate bit of work, but you will gain so much from doing it.absolutely take this class.",
    "Great course, definitely take it. It provides an in depth introduction to policy and practice in schools in America-- if you are like me, with very little background in this, you will learn SO MUCH! You go case by case through different school-related topics and have small seminar discussions that are extremely carefully and well-structured by JBS. Oh, and you have study groups which meet once a week at places like Miyas, the donuts diner, and Vivas.TAKE IT!",
    "An absolutely wonderful experience. The main thing for you to know about this course is that it will be unlike any other seminar you've ever taken. You will be actively engaged during nearly every minute of each seminar due to the unique small-group discussion format that proceeds in various \"rounds\" according to the meticulously designed protocols distributed before each class session. It's a treat to be in class with a group of students who have been hand-selected for the seminar, and over the course of the semester a \"community of learners\" truly forms. We all know each other's names and get to know each other's backgrounds and personal styles of thinking, which is really cool, and all this is reinforced by the weekly study groups. The course runs so perfectly due to the man behind the curtain: JBS. JBS puts extraordinary care into all aspects of the course, as I'm sure other evaluations will describe in detail. His commitment to teaching and learning is worthy of our deepest respect, and his teaching award this year was beyond deserved. This course should serve as a model for all seminars at Yale to strive for. Public Schools For Life!!",
    "If you're interested in Public Schools and Public Policy, apply early in your Yale career and often, and hopefully eventually you'll get in. And if you get in, take it, of course, and also plan to make it one of your main priorities. The class requires a ton of time and thinking every week, along with a 200-page casebook (with few, if any, extraneous articles) and a 500-word response paper, as well as a 1-hour study group meeting with four other students in the class. All the work is absolutely worth it, however, because it forces you to really engage with the material and think through the complex policy questions on the table each week. DON'T take this class if you don't have the time to adequately invest in it, because I think that would probably make you miserable. Otherwise--if you're lucky enough to get in, take it, take it, take it, take it. It will be the best class you take at Yale.",
    "This is one of those classes at Yale that you might be tempted to apply to even if you're not sure of your interest level in the subject matter or whether you're a PoliSci person. A few pieces of advice: 1) don't assume you can't get in. I was very surprised that I did. So make the decision to apply assuming that you will get in, not that you won't. 2) Think about the big picture of your schedule and your semester as you're deciding whether to apply. This class is great, but it's a lot of work and takes a big chunk of time, and the work can't easily be compressed into a smaller amount of time because there's so much small group work in class that you have to be prepared all the time. This is one of the great things about the class, but you have to take it into account as you're applying. I guess my overall advice is just to treat this class a little more the way you would any other in deciding whether to apply for it, and not to be drawn in solely by the hype. That said, if you're looking for a well-taught and rigorous class on education policy, this is definitely it. I learned a ton, and that was because of both my classmates and Professor Starr. I came away feeling really satisfied with the work I put in and the knowledge I got out.",
    "Yes, if you have the time to put in the work you will learn a lot. I also enjoyed the relationships with other students that are built in the class. Though perhaps not all it is hyped up to be, it is still a very good course well worth taking.",
    "If you get in, take it."
