    "Using theory to think about and analyze contemporary issues in sexuality and social justice. You never thought Rawls could be this useful.",
    "I would summarize the course as a look at the intersection between sexual and political theories and an opportunity to test those theories in the real-world. I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I expanded the way I think about issues of gender and sexuality in society in ways that have meaning for the other work I do in WGSS.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in women's, gender, and sexuality studies, both ones who are more theoretically oriented and those who are policy-oriented.",
    "Very interesting approach and readings. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, i would definitely recommend this course!"

   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a much-needed theoretical framework within which to explore issues of gender and sexuality. It informs the other, more concrete historical work that I do in gender and sexuality studies by allowing me to look at the socio-political motivations behind historical events rather than simply the events themselves.",
    "I had not read many ofthe theorists we studied. It was great to read them all at once and be able to draw connections among them.",
    "This course energized, informed and invigorated my passion!"
