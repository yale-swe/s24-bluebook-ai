The writing of script drafts and the analyzing of other's work refined my approach to writing and the lectures on the process of story development and on how to enter the industry will be very helpful for me going forward. I feel like my abilities as both a writer and critic of film have increased significantly as a result of this course. This work has prepared me for working in the field.",
    "A continuation of Introduction to Screenwriting. You continue to develop your abilities to create characters, write believable dialogue, and form a good narrative.",
    "You definitely learn a lot by reading other people's screenplays and getting a feel for what works and what doesn't when it's spoken out loud.",

He gives substantive feedback and criticism that helps the student improve their writing, while at the same time remaining encouraging. I can't really think of too many criticisms at this point. The course felt very well put together.",
    "This is an excellent course, and as long as you keep up with the work and listen to advice from your professor and classmates, it really couldn't be improved.",
    "The strengths were Marc, and the final script we write. We get helpful feedback from classmates and Marc. However, a weakness is that the class isn't very structured sometimes."

    "Absolutely take this class! Marc is amazing! He cares about our screenplays, and his students. It was great having guest speakers as well. If you're interested in delving further into screenwriting, then this is the class for you!"
