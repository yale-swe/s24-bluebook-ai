    "Excellent course. Strengths of the course were Professor Boorman and the e-mail installments he sent out to accompany the readings and class discussion. I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Keep up with the readings and attend lecture. Professor Boorman is extremely knowledgeable and you will learn a lot from listening to his lectures (which are very organized). Just note that your grade in the class is the final exam so stay on top of the work.",
    "A great course if you're interested in the art of learning and curious about how society and networks are structured"
