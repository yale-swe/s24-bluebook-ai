    "Taught by Dan Goldberg extremely extremely well Weaknesses: some nights the homework took FOREVER. On average, the assignments took about 2 hours. Sometimes, that could be as high as 5 hours. I heard some other sections don't have homework. I'm glad we did, because it forced me to learn the material, but hearing that my friends had significantly less work proved frustrating at times. Also, I found the singing exercises to be totally pointless, unfun, and a deterrent to learning the music",
    "I thought it was already a well structured course, and covered the material well.",
    "The homework was at times strenuous and I felt like the mid and final exams weren't necessary for the learning process of the course."

    "Absolute take. Your specific enjoyment will depend on your instructor and who's in your class, but if you want to quickly learn to read and understand music, take this. Be warned: this is not a gut by any means. Probably my hardest class of the year, in fact. The course moves much, much faster than most at Yale. Worse, some students clearly have a background and can keep up with the intense pace and difficulty better than others. (If you already can read music or seriously play an instrument, take a higher level music theory course, please!) Still, I loved this class and am grateful for how much I learned",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has little\/no background in music theory, and wants to learn all the necessary fundamentals in music theory. It is focused on western, Classical style music.",
    "Definitely"
