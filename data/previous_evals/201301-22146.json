   "comments": [
    "Not that easy, only take it if you have a sincere interest.",
    "The class is more math-y and technical than you probably expect.",
    "As far as Econ lectures go, this is one of the more manageable and interesting ones out there.... but it's still a lecture.",
    "Great intro to trade. You learn a lot of models that are interesting and applicable. I recommend it.",
    "Take the class Cr\/D\/F. The outcome\/curve of the midterm is unpredictable and could leave you scrambling at the last minute. Overall, good class, and you learn how to analyze international trade flows in the context of modern economic models.",
    "It's an interesting and very informative class. The power point slides are very detailed. The professor is great.",
    "I would recommend Econ 184 to any student that wants to learn more about globalization and trade theory. The class isn't too overwhelming and Peter Schott is a really cool professor, who is very well established in his field. He organizes the class very well and makes sure to provide real world applications. Also, he's the most skilled user of powerpoint I've ever seen. You don't even need to take notes because the slides are so good. Seriously.",
    "Econ 184 is a very good overview of classical to modern trade models. The course is mixed between theory and real life examples of the models. Professor Schott is very good and always available to help. I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes. The class is not very easy but it is extremely interesting and the professor is awesome. Take it if you are an econ major it is one of the better courses in the department.",
    "This class is amazing and difficult. I have learned more from this class than I have from any Econ class--maybe any class--here at Yale. It goes through the trade models, but the (very engaging) professor always ties the models to data and challenges them. The tests are extremely difficult, but it's very worth it. If you decide against this class because you're afraid of a bad grade, you're just not doing college right. Or life, for that matter.",
    "It's a very interesting and relevant subject to study, but a little too model- heavy for my taste. If you think models are interesting, definitely take it. If you are more interested in the applications, this might not be for you.",
    "A must-take for econ majors, especially because of how interconnected the world has become. It's only an introduction into international trade, but it's a great starting point. Definitely got me interested in the topic and I plan on taking other relevant classes. Professor is awesome and lectures are fun.",
    "Exams are pretty hard as its mostly application. But interesting in learning the models and psets are manageable.",
    "ECON 184 is a great class - challenging, but not too difficult, and always enjoyable. The lectures are great and Professor Schott's slides are excellent, which makes studying for exams and doing problem sets a breeze. Take this course (and don't bother buying the textbook, it's a waste of money).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This was easily the best Economics course I've taken at Yale if not one of the best classes I've ever taken. Professor Schott clearly understands how to give lectures and he was also an understanding professor who understood that Yale students have other priorities. This class is a must take.",
    "if you want to take it",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for econ majors. I'm not sure, though, if it should really be cross-listed as a GLBL course, as it's very reliant on theoretical economics majors.",
    "This is a pretty interesting course covering basic international economic models. It's pretty enjoyable, but also difficult. You can do the problemsets with a partner, making them a bit easier. It seems like the course material is pretty applicable to the real world, so if that sounds appealing, take it.",
    "Maybe",
    "Take it if you liked working with graphs in Intro Micro.",
    "Great class, but harder than most people think. P-Sets can be tricky, and the midterm + final are not easy at all.",
    "An introductory course on trade, which you should definitely take if you're an econ major. While I didn't find myself raving about the class, I do think the material is important. Prof Schott is used to teaching MBA students and I think he stressed the real-world applications of the trade models a bit too much, but the models themselves were interesting.",
    "This course is an example of an excellent economics class. You build up from very simple models into models that are able to capture the real world. You will build upon simple models in order to understand the complex ways that globalization and trade between countries works. It's a great class to understand the world, but also to understand how economics works (building and refining models to continue understanding how the world works).Schott is a great professor who really cares about *teaching* you the material. He also frequently brings in real world applications to show you how all of itis very relevant today.The class is challenging, but the first two psets take some getting used to, but don't drop because of that.",
    "Overall, this course was a nice introduction to ways of thinking of international trade. You basically learn a bunch of different models that explain why certain types of trade occur. Professor Schott is a good professor who is extremely enthusiastic about trade. He's funny and cheerful in lectures, teaches fairly well and you can tell he clearly puts a lot of effort into the lecture slides, when there are that detailed and visually-pleasing.However, the midterm and final exams are really strange, so be prepared. A lot of it is True\/False, which makes it a little bit difficult to answer. Also, some of the conclusions of the model were a little bit \"flimsy\" sometimes just because we basically ONLY use graphs - there are no equations in the class for the most part. Professor Schott LOVES graphs.This is also one of the better taught economics courses at Yale, and if you are even marginally interested in the topic or need another course for the major, take this course.I'm still not passionate about international trade, but I can now appreciate\/understand things like FDI and development paths a lot better, which is helpful to think about.",
    "Definitely take this class! By far, the best economics class that I have taken at Yale. Professor Schott is a dynamic lecturer who does a fantastic job at combining theoretical models with real world applications. In addition, this class forces you to link like an economist as opposed to just memorizing facts and equations. Although the tests can be a bit tricky (they are all true\/false), the workload is rather low. If you have the chance, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "It's a difficult economics course but I've realized the merits of it since I've finished. Can be interesting at times but during the course of the semester it became difficult to keep up-- you need to be pretty active in the class to learn it effectively. I'm apprehensive about suggesting only because the midterm and final were very hard. Good luck!",
    "It is important to have either great attention or a great TA for this class. I was fortunate enough to have the latter. While Prof Schott is wonderful in explaining the models, I found it easier to understand the material independently by looking at his beautiful slides because some of the explanations are just too tedious for a large lecture.I would definitely recommend taking the lecture if you're willing to put in the effort. The tests are tricky - you have to analyze each true\/false question very carefully. PSets are very manageable and well-structured.",
    "Good course with a great prof (and amazing lecture slides). The models might not be useful outside of the class but if you go into government or econ policy as a career you'll probably find yourself remembering this course.",
    "Very good class. Decent blend of models and real-world applications, but still pretty heavy on the theory. Perhaps I was expecting more of the financial and macro realities that impact trade among countries. But Schott is a fantastic instructor. He engages the class very well which, coupled with his fantastically detailed yet comprehensible slides, makes people actually want to go to class.",
    "Great Econ class!",
    "Take it. Absolute must take.",
    "I would recommend this class. I definitely learned really interesting new ways of thinking of globalization and trade. Beware of the exams, and the psets (except for the first one) are pretty good and non-extremly consuming.",
    "Take it. Peter is a fantastic professor who has so much knowledge about the fiend you cannot help but learn a lot.",
    "The best econ course I've taken at Yale - and I've taken quite a few already.",
    "Nice and entertaining survey level look at trade theory and how it has evolved over time. Don't expect any deep looks into math behind models, but expect a lot of practical applications and broad concepts that are pretty cool.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student interested in economics and trade specifically. But they need to be aware that they will need to put the work in.",
    "Interesting material that is relevant. Not quantitative at all, but some prefer that more than others.",
    "Awesome Econ elective where you actually learn things that are useful in the real world. It's a must take of you're an Econ major or just someone interested in the news and the modern economic and global world",
    "This is a good course to take. However, if you are interested in the more mathematical parts of the models covered in this class this is probably not the class to take. Although the class is very model based, there is little focus on the mathematical aspects of the models covered, even though they are fundamentally math based. That being said, this opens up the door for people who aren't as mathematically inclined to take the course and enjoy it.Professor Schott clearly cares about making sure the students understand the material being covered. I would have wished he had put more emphasis on that more mathy aspects of the class, but I understand that he wanted to make the class as accessible as possible for people of all different backgrounds, which I think he succeeds at.A final point: The exams are a bit of a joke. There is little math or model\/problem solving involved in the models. They generally work on a true\/false\/uncertain basis, which is definitely a bad way of structuring exams, and involve almost no quantitative problem solving, for better or worse. In that sense, this class is much closer to a political science class in that the exam grades are determined by how well you answer the question, with multiple possible \"correct\" answers, rather than on your ability to solve equations or anything like that. Take that into account when deciding to take this course.Overall, it was a good course where you will learn a lot is definitely worth taking. Just don't expect to be very mathematically rigorous ifthat is your cup of tea.",
    "This is one of my favorite economics classes that I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Schott is very good. The class is very interesting. I learned a lot about international trade and globalization. Professor Schott's lectures and lectures slides are very clear. He first teaches a theoretical model and then provides current-day examples of the model in the news and current events. After taking this class, I feel a lot more comfortable reading articles in the Economist or other news sources concerning globalization or international trade. The workload is standard with a pset every week and a half or so and then a midterm and final. The exams are difficult as they are comprised of true\/false\/uncertain questions and current events applications. Overall, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Great course! This class reminded me why I love econ! If you're more interested in the qualitative than quantitative, then this class is for you. You learn about the history behind international trade and see how the models developed. You apply the models to the real world and think about and analyze trade from an economics perspective. Professor Schott is terrific - interesting and accessible and genuinely interested in teaching and interacting with students. Problem sets are challenging but get easier as you start to grasp the material and the midterm and final are challenging, so study a lot! Take this course!",
    "It is a great course for learning the economic theories behind trade. I would definitely recommand the class to another student, because the course was not too challenging, and it offered a lot of interesting ideas.",
    "Terrible and hard!!",
    "Introduction to trade models, very straight forward.",
    "Good practical introduction to international trade",
    "YES! TAKE IT!",
    "Definitely take this class if you are an econ major, or just someone who has a general interest in how exchange works on an international level and why it occurs in the manner that it does.",
    "Really interesting class. The lecture is interactive and does a good job of combining models with real world examples.",
    "This class gives students Interesting frameworks to think about international economics. This was very helpful, as it was very conceptual, many thought experiments. Unfortunately, the professor would make people think of extreme cases that would never apply in the real world.The class also has no textbook reading (textbook is of no help), so you are reliant on his slides. His slides are good, but not perfect. Tough class because of it. Also, professor schott does will not explain things into detail (like how to sum import demand, pset 1). So get ready to be frustrated with every problem set.",
    "Definitely!!!! It's an interesting class. Learned a lot about trade models. Professor Schott is great!",
    "Hard but rewarding. Would very much recommend it. This course has validated and stimulated my interest in economics, whereas the theory classes (e.g. Intermediate Micro) have come so close to extinguishing any positive emotions for economics altogether. Do yourself a favor and take this class.",
    "Absolutely! This class rocks! It will broaden your mind to see the world in terms of trade models.It is a class that is applicable to international affairs and development. Anyone interested in develpment economics should take this class for basic knowledge and model analysis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I loved the way the class was taught. I now feel like I understand a lot more about not only trade issues, but also global economy. The only thing is that the way exams are conducted should be improved - true\/false\/uncertain questions can be really confusing.Overall, a good class without too much work.",
    "I'd recommend it for the material.The course teaches you the basic important models in trade economics that you can use after the course To evaluate news and real life examples.Prof Schott is overrated, but still not a bad professor. Go to first couple of classes and see if his voice is too monotonous for you.",
    "For an econ major, this call is a must take. It summarizes many basic econ models in terms of real-world applicable models and gives a first hand account of how economics can me applied to the real world. for a non-econ major, I only want to warn you of how much model building and graphing the first part of this class entails. After that section, the rest of this class is applicable to all, especially given Peter Schotts teaching abilities.",
    "It's a basic intro to international trade class. You don't need anything beyond intro micro\/macro to understand the course, although I imagine higher levels would give you a greater insight into the course. The subject matter is itself interested, and Professor Schott does a great job of pulling in real world examples, articles, and case studies that exemplify the concepts you're learning. If you can fit this into your schedule and have any interest in trade or international issues, you have to take this class.",
    "This is not a difficult economics class to take. However, you will hardly get a lot of things from it.",
    "Definitely if you want\/need foundational knowledge in international trade theories, and yes if you want an intellectually engaging economics class that will give you the tools for a specific set of insights into the world.",
    "Very interesting class and different from most other Economics classes at Yale. Professor Schott is great",
    "must-take class. see the world of international trade through different models, starting from ricardian all the way through new trade theory.",
    "Phenomenal class -- my favorite in the economics department by far. Professor Schott clearly cares a lot about his students and that makes the class so much more enjoyable. The material is very interesting and Professor Schott's clear enthusiasm for the subject makes it that much more fun to learn from him. His slides are meticulously written and he is so well prepared. Great class!",
    "It's a very interesting course and everything is presented very well.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in learning about Trade and global economics. But be prepared to work hard. This is not an easy one."
