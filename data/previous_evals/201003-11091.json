    "A broad overview course that nonetheless familiarizes students in significant detail with the major debates and issues, as well as the historiography. Professor Bushkovitch makes sure to contextualize the topics under discussion, making the class relevant even for non-specialists.",
    "This is a great seminar to learn about medieval and early modern Russian history and think about how it relates to Western Europe in this period.",
    "You'll read a lot, but as introductions to this little-covered side of medieval history go, this one is thorough, captivatingly taught, and will bring you up to speed on both the history itself and the major historiographical trends. Go for it."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the challenge thiscourse presented in teaching me to question many of the assumptions that I often make, specializing in the modern history of the region. Professor Bushkovitch made sure to emphasize in the first meeting of this class that modern Russian history couldn't be grasped fully without a robust understanding of the pre-modern period, and this class made that point effectively on a regular basis."
