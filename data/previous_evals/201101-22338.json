    "Turkish L2 is basically the same as L1, with even more grammar.",
    "This is a continuing language class and it's not very different from Turkish 110. Same teacher, same textbook, same routine. I certainly liked it. The language gets more interesting, too, especially when you get into adverbial constructions of time, like -(y)ken and -(y)ncE. Make sure you take the class seriously (it's easy not to) and ask Etem questions about Turkish culture and history (especially Ottoman stuff).",
    "A fun language class, and an interesting language. Professor Erol is great. Definitely take it."
