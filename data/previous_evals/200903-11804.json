    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes, take this class.",
    "A gentle overview of the African-American poetic tradition. Prof. Stepto is very kind and engages the poetry from all sorts of different perspectives -- art, visits to the Beineke, etc.",
    "Survey of AfAm poetry....read about a book of poetry a week and discuss it, with 2 big (15 pg) papers on whatever topic you want.take it!",
    "This class is wonderful! Don't worry if you don't have much background in the subject; Stepto is a fantastic teacher and really makes it accessible. You'll enjoy going to class every week. Take it!",
    "This class provided an overview of modern (not contemporary) African-American poetry. Much class time was devoted to reading selected poems aloud, but this experience proved surprisingly valuable, a way of acknowledging the oral roots of some poems and the sheer pathos of others. Discussions were relaxed but rigorous.Professor Stepto is a wonderful teacher--passionate about African-American poetry, with a wealth of personal connections to the material that enriched and enlivened our discussions. He is exceptionally kind, attentive and sincere, and he leads consistently productive conversations about the poems.",
    "I would recommend this course for lovers of poetry. Be ready to spend time with the poems outside of class or you won't get much out of class time. Since much of the class is devoted to observation and reaction, the student looking for a class that teaches how to craft good poems should probably look elsewhere.",
    "I feel like the class was overall a cultural celebration-- a way to understand people and history through poetry. The reading is quite light and the teaching of poetic technical aspects is low, but the influence of art and music and other aspects of American culture is quite enjoyable to explore."
