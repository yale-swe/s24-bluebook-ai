    "We learned: Newton's Laws illustrated by Oscillator Motion in 2 dimensions, polar coordinates Law of Conservation of energy d=1 Conservation of energy in d>1, conservative forces Planetary motion Many bodies, center of mass, collisions Rigid bodies and rotations Langrangian Mechanics Hamiltonian Mechanics Relativity (in some detail) Basics of Thermodynamics, Laws I and II Entropy",
    "Understanding relativity, a deeper understanding of classical mechanics (especially in polar coordinates Er and e_theta), Langrangian and Hamiltonian equations, deeper understanding of concepts that I knew about previously but didn't fully understand (like why engines cannot be more efficient than carnot engine)",
    "Basically covers the same as an introductory physics course just in more depth, plus some complex analysis, Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, more relativity, and stat mech.",
    "This is a fantastic overview of classical mechanics, special relativity, and thermodynamics. The problem-solving skills and techniques you utizilize in this class definitely exceed other classes because Prof. Shankar encourages us to think critically about a problem as opposed to understanding at a surface level how to solve them.",
    "I learned an advanced approach to solving classical mechanics with a strong emphasis on mathematical methods. Shankar is a phenomenal lecturer. He makes every subject easier to understand, and I learned a lot about how to solve difficult problems.",
    "This course provides a very good overview of classical mechanics. Particularly, the sections on Lagrangian\/Hamiltonian mechanics and relativity were very good. The problem sets, especially during the first half of the class, were very informative.",
    "I gained a higher level understanding of mechanics",
    "This class gave me a solid foundation in Classical Mechanics. Shankar is not only a great scientist but a great teacher and managed to complicated topics with very straight forward methods."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were well thought out and organized as Shankar has been doing this for years. The structure of the class also seemed logical. I did not like that it didn't follow a single textbook directly. That was unfortunate because it made it really hard to know what to go back and review if you didn't understand what was going on in class. However, the parts of his class that were taped and uploaded to Open Yale Courses were almost exactly word for word his lectures which made reviewing material very nice.",
    "Very organized, and there was a lot of good concepts. Homework and psets are fun (though some of the questions are recycled from previous years)",
    "I was very happy with this class overall. As an enginerring and physics double major, I often find that it's difficult to find the right balance of application and theory all in one class. This class allowed me both by allowing us to truly understand the material but also do lots of important and relevant problems. The professor is wildly knowledgeable, so definitely keeping someone equally as brilliant and able to teach the material is integral.",
    "This is a very tough course. Be prepared to put in a lot of work to understand the material. The midterm and final were hard, and homeworks were fairly time consuming (not too bad but still a decent amount of work). This class is a great advanced physics course and teaches you a lot about classical mechanics. I highly recommend this course with Shankar to anyone interested in learning physics.",
    "Shankar can sometimes be an unclear lecturer. It seems like",
    "The course could be improved by being more structured. There was not much cohesion between the lecture, psets, and the exams.",
    "My one dissapointment with the class is that it overlaps a lot of material covered in the 200 physics course. I think the class could be more like 410 and less like 200. Very well paced.",
    "I think this class was great. Professor Shankar was always super helpful in office hours. I found it a little confusing to keep track of all the topics in the beginning but once I got used to Professor Shankar's style this wasn't a problem."

   "comments": [
    "I really loved this class. I also loved the people in it -- especially for a woman in physics it helps to be surrounded by supportive people. What I like about 401 as opposed to 410 is that they are both difficult courses, but because most people in 401 are physics related majors (ie astro or mech E or applied math) and not intensive physics majors like in 410, the atmosphere is much much more collaborative and helpful than from what I've heard about in 410. I truly appreciate that. You cover a lot of material, and I feel that I have a much more solid understanding of physics concepts. All of the material was quite new to me, but I felt it moved at a pace that was manageable for me to succeed.",
    "Take it! It's a really great class. Don't let the number fool you, it's actually rather similar to physics 200 (you can refer to Shankar's lectures online, some of the psets are also the same). But it's definitely more in depth, and you get better at math and understanding.",
    "Would recommend, come out of it with really solid understanding and appreciation of the beauty of classical mechanics",
    "Absolutely recommend this course! It's pretty much the exact same structure as Physics 200 plus some Lagrangians and Hamiltonians. I actually found this course easier than 200 because Prof. Shankar has amazing command of the material and really is able to fill students' gaps in knowledge, which is not something I experienced in 200. Then again, it wasn't a flipped classroom back then so I don't know, maybe that class has improved. It's not easy but it's well worth your time.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student interested in learning advanced physics.",
    "This isn't a very fun course, but it does provide a very good overview of essential physics concepts. Coming from PHYS180\/181, the math can be pretty challenging, but definitely informative.",
    "The class was not as bad as I expected. One of my hesitation going in was that I didn't have enough math, but the course is doable with just knowledge of multi",
    "I took 401 over 410 simply for Shankar. It's just a continuation of 200. I think it's easier than 410, but not by a crazy amount.",
    "This class is an incredible introduction to more advanced topics in physics: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics, Special Relativity, and Thermodynamics. Prof. Shankar is an amazing professor who is funny, patient, caring, and helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student and think that it engages students regardless of their previous physics experience."
