   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course -- it was a melding together of Philosophy and Economics, which I loved (and which is a fairly rare practice in academia). I appreciate Prof Roemer's clear arguments and teaching (esp when he went through the math in class -- super clear). I like how the entire course was a linear progression through Prof Roemer's own thinking about the subject matter. It felt like we were taught and able to contextualise each of the different thinkers we read, and saw how they pieced together eventually in Prof Roemer's paper \"On Socialism Revised\". Prof Roemer is a briliant and caring (though intimidating at the outset) professor and instructor. It was a joy to learn from him.",
    "In this course I learned to approach economic inequality and egalitarianism from the perspectives of philosophy, econometrics, and some political science. Doing problem sets I reviewed the skills I learned in intermediate microeconomics and applied them to rigorously consider the economic implications of egalitarian philosophy. The course also included three short papers which helped me grow as an analytic and philosophical thinker.",
    "Great political philosophy class. The class attempts to bring mathematical rigour to political philosophy and largely succeeds."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the readings were great -- loved how the readings were arranged such that we were taking a journey through the intellectual development of distributive equality. We may have spent a bit too much time on Piketty though, and that was the less engaging part of the course. I also really appreciated the mixture of work in assignments -- 3 philosophical papers and 3 problem sets. The problem sets were challenging for me (because I am not very econ-inclined), but Prof Roemer is super helpful if you approach him for help. (I also benefited from asking for help from students who took the class previously). Weakness: It wasn't clear whether we were supposed to actively discuss in class like a typical seminar - sometimes we did, sometimes we didn't. Perhaps the lecture and discussion segments of each class could be clearly delineated. There were also too few students in class. Don't be intimidated by the math in the first class! It'd be great to have more students and more robust discussions. Also, we had A LOT of reading. However, we didn't really engage in careful textual analysis during class -- which I wish we did, as it would give rise to more productive & fruitful discussion. Lastly, our papers are graded by a TA...... I wish Prof Roemer graded our papers himself.",
    "This course is ambitious in its scope but Roemer takes on the task wonderfully. His notes on the material proved extremely helpful and let me keep up with the large amount of course material. One way I would improve the course is to provide more direction for the short essays.",
    "The philosophy component is incredible - you will read and learn about some great egalitarian thinkers. The reading list is phenomenal, and I really wish i had more time this semester to engage with these texts more deeply. The economics component is slightly boring though. And class time itself is a little dull because there is not much discussion."

    "Yes, definitely. Do not be intimidated by the math\/econ parts if that's not your strong suit -- it is manageable, learnable, and pretty cool once you learn the techniques and intuition. I really think analytical philosophy has benefited from the clear and incisive economic thinking behind Prof Roemer's (and others') work. Prof Roemer is a sharp thinker who has a lot of insights to share. He is also unashamed about things he doesn't know, and he just says it straightforwardly in class when he doesn't know the answer to questions people ask -- which I find refreshing; a breath of fresh air from the intellectual snobbery seen in many professors.",
    "This course is an ambitious tackling of economic inequality from the perspectives of egalitarian philosophy and economics. Roemer is a genius that is at the academic center of this conversation. Taking this course will make you feel that you are a learning directly from a pivotal socialist\/egalitarian academic tradition. It is hard work and the writing prompts are not very specific but this class is worth it.",
    "Take it you are willing to put time into the readings. I did not have this luxury and so did not get as much as I could have from the course. But it is an incredible intellectual experience, even if class time itself isn't exciting."
