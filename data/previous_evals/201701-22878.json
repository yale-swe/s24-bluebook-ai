    "The basis of different neurological diseases.",
    "I learned a lot of introductory knowledge on an array of neurological disorders- all the way from genetic causes to some molecular mechanisms about the diseases. I learned how to come up with engaging questions even in areas that weren't in an area of expertise",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I love the format wherein a diverse, broad set of fantastic MD's and PHD's came and talked about there respective fields at large and then honed in on the details of the cutting edge research they take part in. As an undergrad it made me think like a scientist, present like a scientist, and towards the end of the class write like a scientist. It was definitely challenge but worth it.",
    "I developed a large amount of knowledge on the mechanisms of many neurological diseases.",
    "I learned a lot about the various mechanisms of neurological disease, straight from the most distinguished experts in their field at Yale. I learned also how to draft a good analysis and criticism of current research in various neurological fields of interest, as well as write a news and views and ideas for the next biggest experiment in the field.",
    "By taking this course I gained insight into the underlying mechanisms of numerous neurological diseases and disorders."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: covers different types of neurological diseases.",
    "I thought the mid term and final assignments were well suited for the course- good practice to critically analyze literature and come up with follow up experimentation to answer insightful questions. I felt as though there was sometimes too much pressure for students to ask questions which led to more clarification questions that just wasted time- this often times caused the lecturer to skip slides that would have been useful. I think in the future stressing to the students the quality of question and types of questions that you are looking for will minimize the amount of nonsense questions. More commentary on the mid term also would maybe help guide students for the types of things you are looking for in the assignments when writing the final- points were taken off in some sections but it was unclear what was even being graded in the first place.",
    "The class is very interesting and well organized, but as an undergrad it can be at times stressful to not fully gauge the performance throughout the course. Participation points seemed a tad arbitrary and basing a grade off of 2 assignments can be stressful. As a senior I am so grateful to learn the amount I did and I feel more prepared to tackle grad school after this class.",
    "The strengths of this course is its reasonable workload, its amazing lecturers, the two professors that run it are friendly, and the small size of the class. The weakness of this course has got to be the grading mechanism. Participation is COUNTED, which is a bit silly I believe because I would see people come in with a list of three prepared questions, ask them, then do other things on their laptops for the remainder of the class. There are never any tests, so knowledge of the diseases is not really tested. I like the two paper format even though the first was a bit weird (News and Views format) and no feedback on how we were graded was given.",
    "The course is very very well organized. We get the privilege of learning about neurological disease from the experts in the field. Professor Chandra and Cafferty spend a lot of effort organizing the class and it's really such a shame we didn't get more undergraduates in the class this semester!"

    "This course is very useful in learning about neurological diseases.",
    "I thought this was a great course for me- coming from a biochemical background and starting thesis work in a lab that has neuroscience focused projects it introduced me to common terminology that is used in the field, some neuroanatomy and common experimental techniques that are often employed. This may be less useful for someone with a strong neuroscience background but if the student is looking to learn about an array of neurologic diseases outside of their concentrated field then i thought it was great!",

    "Yes take it. Just be on time, ask questions and write two good papers.",
    "Please take this course!!! We get the privilege of learning about neurological disease from the experts in the field. Professor Chandra and Cafferty spend a lot of effort organizing the class and it's really such a shame we didn't get more undergraduates in the class this semester! The grades are based on your participation (asking thoughtful questions at each of the lectures), midterm assignment (report written in the format of Nature's news and views), and final paper (report on what the next biggest experiment). The day to day lectures are pretty chill, and overall the workload is not tremendous. You really learn so much by getting the chance to listen to and meet with the biggest name professors at the Yale School of Medicine."
