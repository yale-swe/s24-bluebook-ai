    "Yeah, I would recommend it.",
    "If you are an independently motivated writer, definitely take it! It will be as good as what you put into it.",
    "If youre considering this class, it likely means youre considering writing a screenplay for your film thesis. In that case, you have to take it. But even so, its a good one. Marc is fun as ever (presumably you took intro with him) and has tons of insight and helpful feedback for scripts of all sorts. You have to come up with loglines on day one and have a summary ready on day two, so be prepared to dive into the process. A 20-30 page script is a bit of an awkward length, but youll make it work. Be sure to brush up on your formatting beforehand so you dont face Marcs wrath. And also meet deadlines! Theyre pretty generous, considering how you have several weeks to work between workshops, so dont put your edits off until right before. Take advantage of having a group of thoughtful peers who also have excellent advice to provide. Youll get assigned groups like in intro, so meet with yours. And please read everyone else's scripts when they submit them so you can positively contribute. Youll work hard, youll grow as a writer, and youll end up with an imperfect script of a strange length and hopefully the drive to write a feature length one next year.",
    "Self motivated work -- it's up to you to keep up with the work and not fall behind. If you leave everything to the last minute, this definitely won't be a fun class because it is hard. If you work consistently it is a phenomenal class.",
    "You took intro and liked it? Take this.",
    "I would say that it's a great class if you're looking to have your screenplay workshopped and critiqued. Really helpful for aspiring screenwriters.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone... if one can get into (it is pretty hard to get into since many students want to take it)"
