    "Music! You spend a semester tracing the rise and fall of the Western Art Music Project, from Beethoven to (?). On the last day of class, Prof. Hepokoski plays Chuck Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven.\" He looked like he was about to cry. Rest in Peace, WAMP.",
    "If you have any interest at all in the history of western music, TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Hepokoski is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale, and I learned so much from him. But if you don't have to take it for your major, I would highly recommend taking this Credit\/D\/Fail (which I did), as the listening quizzes are INCREDIBLY difficult, and it's more fun to enjoy the lectures and the music and learn what you can without stressing about a grade.",
    "Yes, full recommendation. A great class for musicians and non-musicians alike. I just wish there were an equivalent course that included jazz and black art forms...",
    "A summary of everything that happened in Western Music from 1800 to 1950. The listening quizzes are hard. The tests are hard. If you're taking it for a grade, be ready. That being said, you will learn A LOT.",
    "Strongly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about classical music. You can have listening parties with your friends to prepare for the quizzes. It's great.",
    "Most engaging lecture I've attended at Yale. Hepo is a great lecturer and really gets a ton of information across in a short period of time. I took the class credit\/d and didn't do all the reading, but still got the impression that there is not quite as much work as people let on. I really recommend the class, though. One of the best I've taken.",
    "It's a lot of work, particularly if you're taking it as a music major, but it's well worth the time. The more effort you put in, the more you'll get out of it! And everything you get out of it is worthwhile!",
    "This course is what it is. Things to love and things to hate. If it makes you angry take it as a learning experience.",
    "Take it! 351 and 352 are two of the best classes at Yale, and the lectures are amazing. For non-music majors, take it Credit\/D if you have room!",
    "To non-music students (music students have to take it): you'll want this course. It's a decent amount of work, but absolutely worth it.",
    "Take it!",
    "Music 352 is an amazing course, but only take it if you have time to put in the work. Professor Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturer - dynamic and high-energy. I learned so much from the course. However, I took it Credit\/D\/Fail, and was glad I did. I still did a ton of work, but I would have been super stressed about the workload otherwise.",
    "Great cr\/d for non-majors. Readings not all that necessary, lectures engaging. Be sure to have some pre-existing knowledge or experience playing a musical instrument.",
    "Best Credit D Class ever. Lectures are 75 minutes and spellbinding. I came in with very little knowledge of the classical canon and music theory knowledge only up through 205 and got so so much joy and learning out of it. Credit D allows you to ignore readings and sections and take it easier on midterms and papers. Still need to study up for those listening quizzes though, but those have the benefit that you will learn these songs seriously well. Music Theory background enriches your experience greatly, take 205 first if you aren't a music major for the best experience. You actually have to do work even if you do Credit D, but the flip-side of that coin is that you also get a tremendous amount out of the course. If you are interested in gaining a very solid cultural knowledge of an amazing body of music (that makes you seem super fancy and cultured) this is an easy recommendation.",
    "Only take this course for credit if you are a music major. Otherwise, take it credit-d because the stress of studying for the quizzes and tests is not worth it. It's an awesome lecture, but just be warned.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Especially if you already know a lot of the music in this era. MUSI 352 probably has been my favorite music class at Yale so far. If it's even possible, this class has made me love music even more. I have been exposed such great music. Learning the background of these pieces and their composers was also super interesting. I actually enjoyed reading the Taruskin. It was a privilege to be in this class. The TAs were also very helpful and of course, Prof Hepokoski was amazing, engaging, and attentive to students. The only thing I'd say is I would have really appreciated it if the slides were released before each class for ease of taking notes. Same for the terms and concepts.",
    "Great if you want to know more about the music you get to play in YSO",
    "An overview of classical music history from Beethoven to \"the present\" (really around 1950). I would absolutely recommend.",
    "Take it if you're considering it. Take it if you're not considering it. Take it even if you hate music. Take it even if you hate history. Just take it. It will change your life.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yalehas the most intelligently-organized through-line, and all lectures are very thought-provoking. I was kind of dreading music historyneeded it for the major but figured it would be a boring reviewand it ended up being my favorite class.",
    "MUSI352 was one of the two best courses I took while at Yale (the other being Donald Kagans Athenian Imperial Democracy). Hepokoski lectures with verve and fluidity, as he weaves a compelling narrative of history, philosophy, politics, and music theory. In particular, I enjoyed his lectures on Beethoven, Wagner, and Stravinsky (if anything, attend the Beethoven lectures during shopping period; his second lecture was the first time I have ever seen students applaud a professor before the end of the semester of a course). The workload is fairly reasonable: the three written exams test only the material emphasized in the lectures, the listening quizzes are manageable if you stick with the schedule (and use Spring\/Fall Break to catch up on the longer second section), and the final paper is fairly straightforward (although the prompt on music historicity is a bit unusual\/unexpected). It is helpful to have a bit of a theory background, but not necessary (I was a non-music major who had only previously taken MUSI205). Overall, any student remotely interested in classical music ought to take this class - I now have a much richer appreciation and understanding of music because of Hepokoski.",
    "Music 352 is a lecture encompassing European and American composition and music in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I would recommend Music 352 to those students interested in familiarizing themselves with past musical channels, influences, and schools of thought on a deep level.",
    "This class is good for students who have decent music background. You don't need too much technical theory to know what's going on. Hepokoski is a great lecturer"
