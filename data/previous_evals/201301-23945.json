    "This course for me was primarily a way of acquiring a particular skill that I can bring to bear in other aspects of me research. To some extent I was unprepared then for how independently interesting I think the material is: I'd definitely like to learn more in the future. It was very satisfying to go to a talk by a visiting linguist at the end of the semester and found I understood far more of the talk than I would have had I not taken the course. That experience confirmed for me how much I had picked up through taking the course.",
    "It is a great foundational course for anyone who is interested in philosophy of language or semantics, and Ben taught an excellent course."
