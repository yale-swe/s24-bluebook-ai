    "LAST 357 is an in-depth exploration of Cuban history post-1959, with a particular focus on narratives arising from within the island and exile community abroad, rather than U.S. or Soviet, Cold War narratives. Cultural, social, and political issues were most prominent.",
    "Its a great course if you're interested in Cuban and latin American history, within a global context. I would take it if you're a history major, great way to get a seminar credit out of the way.",
    "If you're interested in Cuba or the Cold War or just want to be taught by a really cool professor with great taste in coffee, take this class!",
    "This is a great course if you want to understand the last 60 years of world history. You'll understand the Caribbean from the Cuban Revolution through present day, and you can't understand it or US foreign policy in Latin America without knowing Cuba. Also super important for the Cold War, AKA global history for the past 60 years. Cuba's role went far beyond Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. They were essential in the US-Soviet relationship and they also sent troops across the world, from Angola to Bolivia. Really great course to comment intelligently on a variety of global issues from the past half century and also on current events.",
    "Take it! It's great.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class! I've taken lots of history courses at Yale, but Cuba's history is by far THE most interesting country I have ever studied. Bustamante is a fantastic seminar leader, incorporating films, music, and a trip to the Cuban Mission to the UN into the course. Highly recommended!",
    "If this class is offered again, take it! The topic is fascinating and Michael Bustamante genuinely cares about his students and makes the class engaging and fun. The reading load is a bit heavy but the visual media components more than make it for it."
