    "Professor Shiller is a leader of a school of though in economics that is growing in influence and is particularly relevant in light of the recent financial crisis, so it is interesting to read his book with George Akerloff and hear him lecture. The reading list is a little scattershot, though, basically consisting of studies that have drawn his attention or he has cited in his own books over time, rather than a coherent survey of a field. Pieces that take a fairly long time to read will end up being covered in one or two slides and a couple of minutes in his lecture. Shiller is also a little bit disorganized as a lecture, can go off on tangents, repeat himself, etc. However, he is refreshing, creative mind at work in the economics profession and hearing his thoughts on the state of contemporary economics, drawing on associated science and social science disciplines, can be quite fascinating. If you are interested in law and economics but think there might be some serious limits to neoclassical economics taken too literally, this remains a very worthwhile class.",
    "Shiller is great at telling stories that hold your attention in class. However, his lectures are incredibly disorganized and trying to understand what arguments he is trying to make and what evidence he is trying to marshal for those arguments is extremely difficult. I found it very useful to learn about behavioral economics because I now have arguments in my arsenal to counter classical economics arguments. However, if there were a more law-focused behavioral economics class, I would recommend taking that instead.",
    "This was a very interesting class and complemented more traditional law classes well. I'd particularly recommend it for students interested in public policy, since it provides a lot of useful ways of looking at why policies succeed or fail."
