   "comments": [
    "This is such an incredible opportunity of a class. Take it.",
    "You will probably get more out of this class if you are a person of faith than otherwise, but all poetry enthusiasts will have a blast.",
    "If you have the chance, TAKE THIS CLASS! It provides an incredible blend of critical engagement with modern and older poetry and a personal look at what religion and poetry mean for you. Even if you are not religious, this class gives you the platform from which to examine why you are not religious. The combination of other students in the class was one of the most varied and fascinating I've encountered at Yale in my three years here. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes definitely, it will expand your knowledge of poetry and there are great discussions",
    "An excellent course in modern poetry. This is not all religious poetry, but rather poetry that deals with faith or the problems that faith faces. The reader of poems that professor Wiman puts together is astoundingly good. The readings are short, but you are expected to reread and reread and to write a number of pages of response each week, which can take quite a bit of time. Professor Wiman is a treat, and a commanding leader of the seminar. This class makes you engage with your own ideas of faith more than any other at Yale. This class is definitely easier if you read modern poetry outside of class; you are asked to call on poems outside the reader often for assignments.",
    "If you get in, take it. It's that simple. Before taking the course, I would have been aptly described as non-religious, non-Jewish, just non; after taking the course, I am finding both faithlessness and detachment from my Jewish heritage to be untenable positions (for myself). I am not saying that everyone who takes the course will have a similar experience but that the course is that good. Wiman is awesome, thoughtful, and interested - and his poetry selections for the course reader are on point. As an English major, it was refreshing to discuss poetry critically in a manner that does not insist on the separation between the personal and the analytical, i.e. that our readings are staked in ourselves (and visa versa). The reading journal is one of the best assignments for a class I've ever had (the coursework on the whole is super engaging). If you want to do a lot of good, hard thinking and read a lot of good poetry, take the course.",
    "It's not just a phenomenal course; it's a deeply meaningful experience. The syllabus is AMAZING, for one thing--mostly poems from the last hundred years, many from the last decade. Many are in translation, making this one of the rare opportunities to explore international poetry in a Yale English course. Professor Wiman is great. He knows poetry inside and out, and he brings in the thinking of countless theologians, poets, and philosophers, too. The most amazing part of his teaching, I think, is how adamant he is that students engage with texts on not just a critical, but also a personal level. We weren't reading just for literary technique, we were living with these poems, feeling them, and questioning what they mean to us, or to the world.",
    "One of the brilliant opportunities of Yale, to learn from Professor Wiman as an undergraduate. His selection of poems for the course packet was phenomenal, and not much reading every week (though the weekly reading response took a while, maybe because I was intimidated by him). Discussions were never boring. The only disappointment really was the students' inclination to windbaggery and self-interest... which is to be expected, maybe, when you trust young overintellectuals to discuss something like their own takes on faith and poetry. One 10-page final paper on a topic of your choice. CW meets with every student to get to know them, offers feedback on all the writing, and really is a wonderfully thoughtful person, if a little unimpressed in class.",
    "A thought-provoking class that's about faith, but equally about reading and appreciating poetry. It can be as much or as little about religion as you want it to be. If you like beautiful words and you've ever pondered your own existence you will like this class.",
    "You would really have to think quite deeply about the poems, and be ready to speak up about what you read. More than doing the readings is to actually come to your own understanding of them - you cannot get by with just glossing over. I would recommend the class if you want to hear all kinds of varied ways through which faith and religion are a part of poetry.",
    "Weekly thematic reading combining both poetry and religious ideas. I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "Take it if you get in. The course will make you think hard about existential issues, and it will make you a more sensitive person. Also a fabulous introduction to poetry. People in this class were very smart and profound and I learned a lot out of them.",
    "Take the class if you can get in, you will learn and grow a lot. One thing to know is that previous experience with poetry might not be required, it might be helpful just for your own peace of mind. Know also that the poetry really is modern poetry, which is a bit of a different ball game than you might be expecting."
