   "comments": [
    "YES, especially if you have even the slightest interest in law. This is an extremely accessible and rewarding Spanish L5 course. Mercedes Carreras is one of the most encouraging professors out there.",
    "great 5th class. not like regular language classes. only meets twice a week and mercedes is awesome. one page writing assignments per week and a midterm and presentation. final paper is long but not bad once you have been writing all semester. not a lot of work. participation is optional",
    "If you know enough spanish to get into L5, take this class. Carrerras is the best professor. The work is minimal, the midterm is a breeze, and the material is actually interesting. This class provides you with a basic working knowledge of a wide range of legal topics while allowing you to practice and\/or maintain your spanish. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "SUPER CHILL class. Prof Carreras is like a mother to you, she is super nice and understanding and she always has a smile on. She is very enthusiastic and doesn't force you to speak, while at the same time encouraging conversation.Do be warned that the material of the class is quite boring at times and I found myself falling asleep at times when she would talk about the death penalty or what not. If the material is better though, this class would be perfect.as for work load:1 page responses due each class (easy)1 midterm, simple as long as you pay attention when she reviews the material for you1 group presentation (fun)1 final essay (on whatever you want)",
    "Legal spanish was an interesting, fairly easy class. If you're looking for a class to practice speaking in, this is not the class. However, it's a great way to learn legal terms in spanish and it's not too much work. There's usually an assignment for each class, about a page of writing answering a question about the course material. Midterm and a final paper (10 pages).",
    "YES! Take this class. It's one of Yale's hidden gems. It's a great way to keep up with Spanish and discuss the philosophy of law, especially as it relates to the Spanish-speaking world. The work is totally manageable--one page paper due for each class, basically no readings, one midterm, final essay, no final exam. Prof. Carreras is wonderful! This is sooooo good! Take it before everyone realizes it's too good and Yale begins to cap it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Legal Spanish to another student. If you need an enjoyable 5th class, this is the one for you. Not too much work: one page reflection before each class (two a week), one in-class midterm, one group presentation, and a final essay (no exam).This class helped reinforce my interest in attending law school. To me, the biggest indication that the class was worth taking is that I actually looked forward to waking up early to go to a 9 am class.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It's a good L5 Spanish class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Legal Spanish if you are looking for a not very intensive L5 Spanish class that is still really interesting. You learn a lot about law, especially in Spanish speaking countries, but in a very low-stress environment and without an overwhelming amount of work. Professor Carreras is also great, always willing to help out if you need it, super knowledgeable about law, and she has a sense of humor.",
    "Legal Spanish is known for its light workload and grading, but here are several caveats with that: 1. The mid-term, though manageable, requires a fair bit of review. Make sure you include lots of details you gleaned from the class and from the workbook. Most got an A-, but I think the ones who got As on the midterms were those who paid a lot of attention to the detail. 2. The oral presentation isn't too difficult, but again make sure you go into a fair amount of detail in the project. The presentations, from what I heard, are getting better. Take it seriously. 3. Homework is not graded harshly, but it requires at least an hour of your time every other day of your weekdays. Try to get them out of the way before you do readings for your other classes.",
    "It's a great course and I would recommend it if you would like to gain a better understanding of the justice system."
