    "For anyone slightly interested in French, this is a great way to be introduced to the language. I don't know that I'm going to go that far in French, but I think I'll get a ton of use out of what I already know. Warning: most classes speak only French from day one, so be prepared to be a bit confused for a week or so.",
    "I did not want to take this class but it is a requirement. After having one semester, I have to say that this is the most organized and best taught language class I could have hoped for. Professor Burton is a good teacher, friendly, funny, and professional.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel like I have learned so much over the semester. For many students, language courses in high school are not actually sufficient, and you never really feel like you get anything out of them. A student may spend three years taking the same language and not get very far. However, I feel so accomplished after taking this course. I could definitely carry out a conversation in French, and I feel like I am on my way to speaking fluently.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class if you're interested in learning a language at a pretty rapid pace. So much information is covered within the one semester, so it's important not to get behind, but one makes up for that by learning a lot of French within a relatively short time.",
    "Take this course! I had already fulfilled my foreign language requirement with Spanish L5 first semester freshman year but I wanted to learn French and so, as a Junior, I came back and I am so thankful that I have. Take it particularly with Madame Burton because she is fantastic and also be prepared to have a hell of a monday.",
    "Good introduction to French but don't take it unless your willing to put in the work. Weekly tests, quizzes and compositions so you need to keep up. Professor Burton leads a strong section.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class, especially with Madame Burton. She is really sweet and makes learning French a lot more fun. However, be aware that there is a lot of homework and that you need to put in the work to learn the language proficiently. The weekly tests and quizzes are also a lot to handle, especially with the oral section, but the way French is taught allows you to learn it in a helpful and unique way.",
    "Yes, and especially if you've taken Spanish previously."
