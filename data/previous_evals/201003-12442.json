   "comments": [
    "You'll take it if you have to.",
    "in depth analysis of fluid mechanics. would recommend to mechE majors",
    "Yes, it's the most worthwhile engineering credit i have taken so far.",
    "Smooke is awesome. Livens class up with all kinds of real life examples. While the derivations are tedious and thorough, they really help with understanding. Perhaps the most exhausting lecture i have ever sat through occurred in this class, but because Smooke does such a good job of making sure people are following along, it became second nature by the end of the class. That being said, this was probably the hardest final i have ever sat through.",
    "Good intro to many aspects of fluid mechanics. Workload not bad and tests were reasonably challenging.",
    "Very useful. Good mix of theory and applications. Overlapped with my class on the physics of weather and climate. Problem sets are doable and midterms were very fair, however, the final was not on par with the midterm. It was much longer, 4 hours long, and even the \"straight-forward\" seemed tricky.",
    "Honestly, I probably would not reccomend it unless you need it for your major.",
    "You likely have to take this class. However, I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's not a repeat of diff eq, and the conceptual material can be very interesting. The problem sets aren't bad at all.",
    "This course can actually be fun. As long as you do the homework on your own and come to class, it's not too bad. But make sure that you're doing the homework on your own because it's very easy to feel that you understand everything because it all makes sense once you see the solution. it's coming up with the solution by yourself that's challenging.",
    "Thought I was never going to make it to the end of the course, but it got easier (or at least less scary) by the end.",
    "It is a tough but fundamental course in engineering... I would recommend it for anyone with the necessary background.",
    "If you're required to take the class, it definitely won't be as awful as some of your other requirements.",
    "You're either going to love this class, or you're going to hate it. And that decision will be based purely on whether or not you enjoy the material. Class can be difficult to sit through, but it can also be pretty interesting. The workload is exactly what you would expect in any other engineering course, so the labor input shouldn't come as much of a shock. Smooke's exams are tricky, as usual, but some of the problems come straight out of example problems in the text (though they're sometimes from sections we don't cover in class). I personally liked the class, so I'd definitely recommend taking it, especially if you're more interested in the macroscale, physical side of engineering.",
    "If you find this kind of material interesting i recommend it. Also, if you've taken a class with Smooke before you know exactly how it is. 2 midterms, 1 final, and weekly problem sets, not too much work. But grading is a little harsh.",
    "Ignore those other entries about how you'll have to take this course either way, because I didn't. I'm not an engineer, I just find this sort of thing interesting. Professor Smooke is a fantastic lecturer - more engaging than some humanities professors I've had. The course is on useful material, and frees you up for aerodynamics and\/or propulsion later on (they rotate).And don't be scared, regardless of program or major - youcan totally do this course on multivariable and no higher math (although if you can take Diff Eq with Smooke, go for that, too).And anybody reading this who, like me, isn't an engineer: go for it, it's a way more satisfying science credit than Chemistry in the Popular Novel.",
    "If you liked Smooke in ENAS 194, you'll love him in this class. He really seems at home teaching engineering stuff, and brings up really cool applications of the material (make sure you secure your rocket appropriately when testing it!). The workload is more manageable--problem sets have 6-8 problems instead of 20, and there's only 2 midterms. Some of the topics are difficult but you should be alright if you read the book, review your notes, etc. to make sure you're keeping up with understanding the lectures. The class is really useful, not only for engineering but also for the sciences (the Navier-Stokes equations, boundary layers, etc. seem to show up very often in geophysics problems, for example) so I'd definitely recommend taking this class if you're majoring in a subject where it might be useful.",
    "The material covered was fascinating, I just wish it were covered better. Smooke is a good guy, though somewhat overrated as a professor. His lectures are almost exclusively derivations, so be prepared to spend a long time going through the book learning how to do the problems on the psets because you won't in class. This can be tough unfortunately since the book is kind of horrible. It contains way more stuff then we actually use and different formulas from the ones we learn in class making it a struggle to pick out the useful information that we actually need. That said, the stuff you learn is really interesting, and the exams are very fair.",
    "Very math intensive, no nearly as much explanation. I put a lot of work in outside of class just to understand what was going on (like reading the textbook several times). Chances are if you are thinking about it, you have to take it. If you don't then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. I really gained nothing from this class, but I guess I can't complain since I devoted about 72 hours over the course of the entire semester to the course. Still, I don't feel like I could have gotten more out of the class even if I had put a lot more into it. The lectures gave no added value, so I quit going during shopping period. This class seemed to fall into the trap of focusing on the equations, rather than understanding the concepts of fluid mechanics. There was a severe disconnect between the lectures and the problem sets and a disconnect between the problem sets and the exams. But if you learned the equations (even if you didn't understand them), you'd be fine. All in all, it seemed painfully obvious that Prof. Smooke just didn't care about the course at all, which made it hard for me to care either.",
    "Yes! It is a good class, prof. Smooke is an amazing lecturer and the material is interesting.",
    "The class uses many concepts from multivariable calculus and applies them for fluids. It is a fast-paced class where you often have to spend lots of time figuring out what a problem wants. The lectures have a lot of derivations, which don't immediately connect with what is asked for on the problem sets and exams. Despite what is said on the course description, differential equations and linear algebra aren't needed to understand this class.",
    "Fluids is a pretty challenging engineering class. Professor Smooke is a great professor, so definitely try to take it with him. If you stay on top of the class throughout, the workload never gets too bad.",
    "Interesting subject matter, if the class is a little dry. Problem sets are usually pretty manageable and the tests were surprisingly easy, save the final. Large parts of the book are skipped, so studying from the book is hard sometimes. Studying from the equation sheets is really helpful.",
    "Take this if you are seriously interested or if you really have to",
    "This is an excellent course. The material is very interesting and Smooke has great stories, pictures, and video clips to share in lecture which makes the 9AM class actually enjoyable to go to. Homework is rather light - much lighter than the homework for Diff Eqs if you took that with him. An all-around great course.",
    "A run of the mill engineering course that is very math heavy. I would recommend either working in groups or finding an old textbook's solutions manual to follow this class.",
    "Take it if you have to.. Not too much work over the semester but the final is really really hard. Be careful.",
    "You're taught interesting material but it becomes tedious in the classroom. Also, the book is horrible so figuring stuff out on your own is more challenging than with other courses. Add in a 9am timeslot and I would only take this course if necessary for your major.",
    "Necessary course for Mech E's, but otherwise wouldn't take",
    "A fun course overall.If you were a fan of Enas 194 with Smooke you will be a fan of this."
