    "Overview of different types of renewable energies and the technology\/geology surrounding them",
    "Knowledge of the physics behind renewable energy resources as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each",
    "I gained a basic understanding of all renewable energy technologies.",
    "Science, technology, and applications for each type of renewable energy",
    "Good understanding of Energy Systems, Wind, Hydro, Solar, Nuclear, and all of the renewables",
    "I felt like I learned about the different energy resources and technology, as well as the \"big picture\" of how they fit into makeup the global energy budget.",
    "Physics and chemistry behind many of the energy sources currently used in the world's mix. Understanding the technologies, how they work and their characteristics, is important in considering personal residential development, financial investments, and policy.",
    "The class was an amazing course for gaining knowledge about all kinds of renewable energy. I learned so much about the way these energies work, the problems associated with each, and how practically every one has its pros and cons. It was a very interesting class that has opened my eyes to energy production and why the world is the way it is.",
    "Thought it was a good course that helped me to think about fossil fuels and renewables not from a moral perspective, but from a resource based perspective and I think those facts can get lost nowadays.",
    "An overview of the environmental, economic and engineering factors that govern the viability of a number of renewable energy systems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: topics are generally really interesting; professors have a lot of professional experiences in the field to draw on and discuss; get a good mix of perspective, from hard science to the economics of renewable energy Weaknesses: exams are essentially p-sets in one sitting which is rather annoying, not all lectures super engaging (though most are), kind of weird classroom vibe because you have grad students who might have professional experience in the field and undergrads who've never done college science in the same room",
    "Great course but less focus on specific renewable statistics as those can get monotonous",
    "The content was very interesting and presented well, with lots of in-lecture interaction. The workload was manageable and the instructors were very good. I think that the lectures could have easily been 50 minutes.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, professors and TAs were open to answering questions during study sessions Weaknesses: exams tested on minute details and emphasized a lot of rote memorization of such details. Problem sets involved a lot of busy work.",
    "This class covers a TON of material, sometimes too quickly. The field trips are a great idea, but I was never able to attend them due to my campus job hours. The problem sets were reasonable and fair. However, I thought both the midterm and the final were unlike previous problems we had done. They both were too long for the time allotted and the questions pulled from minor details from the lectures rather than the big picture perspective that I felt the lectures focused on. I think the class worked best when it tied all the specifics into energy trends and broader ideas, and was disappointed that the final did not reflect that.",
    "Great course, wish that there had been practice midterm\/ final questions.",
    "One of the constant struggles of this course was working with converting watts to kilowatt hours, and this course could have used a 30 minute block of time at the beginning of the semester to make sure everyone understood properly how to do that. Otherwise, a wonderful course!",
    "The course was extremely interesting, well taught, and informative. It was probably my favorite course of the semester. The workload is low and doable but still gives you a great understanding of what you're learning. My only negative was the first few classes were a bit intimidating, but eventually the lectures got much easier. Overall, no real negatives.",
    "I personally prefer classes that only have one professor so that you get good consistency throughout the year.",
    "This course is well taught as a lecture that asks for student input, because the wide range of student backgrounds (undergraduate, FES, etc.) tied in a larger understanding of each topic."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are confident you want to get a survey of renewable energy and if you want a science credit that isn't super science\/math heavy, but still requires significant science exploration.",
    "Yes I greatly enjoyed it.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this is a great science credit about an essentially relevant topic that everyone should study.",
    "If you are interested in renewable energy and down for a decent time commitment",
    "Yes, I absolutely loved this class and I think that not only people interested in working in the field should take it but also everyone that wants to have a good understanding of the world around us and energy.",
    "This class will cover a lot of material and it's pretty interesting to learn both about energy technology and how it fits into trends in usage, development. etc. The lectures are fast-paced and you should attend as often as possible--it's hard to keep up with the material just by looking at the slides afterward. Psets were fair and reasonable, but exams are way harder and longer so be prepared. It's a pretty good class; I think you get out of it what you put in",
    "Yes, great class with information applicable to many industry careers as well as important information that every person should understand since we face impending global crises related to these issues.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone. Just to learn about what is going on on our planet that is causing the changes we see today. This class opened my eyes to how energy is produced, and why we are so dependent on fossil fuels and struggling to shift away. I think one of the challenges is the lack of knowledge people have about renewable energy.",
    "I would recommend this class to another because it offered some unique perspectives to some modern issues.",
    "This course is a great science credit, and would be pertinent for students interested in environmental science, energy policy or energy economics."
