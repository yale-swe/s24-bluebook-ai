    "Better focus on balancing narrative, synthesis, presentism, and historical writing. AN understanding of where the field of American 19th century history stems. A host of challenging questions that the field has not solved.",
    "- developed the skill of paying closer attention to the assumptions historians bring to their work - a helpful exposure to the historiographical debates in C19 scholarship - an appreciation for the various styles of historical writing",
    "This course opened American history up to an era which I was largely unfamiliar with and provided excellent readings and discussions on its complex themes and knotted moments. I appreciated that the course was so thoughtful about historiography and that our work was attentive to not only the present scholarship, but how historians arrived at it over time - the memory alongside the history, I suppose. I became a better and more patient reader of the \"big books,\" so to speak. I also learned a great deal about the diversity of historical method.",
    "In this class I learned about 19th century United States history, In particular the abundance of scholarship that has been completed on the Civil war and how that scholarship has changed over time. It was interesting to learn that scholars are still asking the question of whether the Civil War was worth it or would a compromise have been better."

   "comments": [
    "The course readings included some of the seminal works in the field. This was an excellent opportunity to be introduced to the thought leaders and shapers of the field.",
    "Although I thought the course was very strong - and here is the paradox on that note - I do wish it was smaller. Naturally, such a popular course will have a big draw, but I found sometimes that our discussions failed to slip beyond the surface because there were so many voices to hear from and so many backgrounds to reconcile. We often ran out of time just as we were getting to the pith of things.",
    "I enjoyed the range of perspectives that were brought to the class from the students with different specialty. I think including more readings like Tya Miles or Drew Faust could improve the class. I would also limit the number of people in the class, sometimes the number of students could feel like too much."

    "Yes, very much. Should be required, at least for Americanists.",
    "Yes I would. I thought this class was a great introduction to United States 19th century history."
