    "Surprisingly good course. I took it for the pre-1800 requirement, but it became my favorite course all semester. I really liked having a small seminar format, and class discussion was much more interesting than I imagined it to be. This class confirmed my love for theater, and it was rewarding to examine Christianity from an academic perspective rather than from the church pews.If you aren't too keen on Middle English, there are also a lot of great modern works examined in the course, including various plays, movies, and videos of contemporary stage productions. Of course, we read our fair share of Middle English medieval plays, but it was much less Middle English than I expected.Overall a great course, and an enjoyable pre-1800 seminar."
