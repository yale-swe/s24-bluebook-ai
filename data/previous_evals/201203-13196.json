   "comments": [
    "The course is essentially a discussion series of topics related to violence, including how to define violence and its effects. I would certainly recommend this course, thanks mainly to Professor Darwall's great discussion style and the course content.",
    "I definitely wouldn't recommend this class to non-philosophy majors. It was okay. The professor is really nice, but that is not a good enough reason to take the class. There are better classes at Yale that are more structured and that you learn more in. If you're on the fence between this and another class - take the other class.",
    "Amazing reading list and Darwall is a wonderful person to study with and from. Interdisciplinary classes are dangerous though, and it's a real crapshoot as to who ends up being in the class with you and whether or not it becomes super annoying.",
    "Are you a cognitive science major interested in examining violence through the lense of your major? Then don't take this course. This is the most typical of the frustrating philosophy courses--hours of seemingly pointless and boring debates over definitions and very little focus on meaningful consequences. I don't like philosophy, and I didn't like this course. But I'm pretty sure a lot of people who do like philosophy also didn't like this course. And there's little to no legitimate CogSci content, in that we rarely take an interdisciplinary look into anything--it's just straight philosophy. That said, it's possible I'm just not a philosophy major and so I'm just not used to classes like this.",
    "Yes, the topics are fascinating and the discussions can be challenging in very entertaining ways. This is a great class to learn about violence both in a theoretical and philosophical sense as well as from a sociological standpoint.",
    "This was probably the class I was most excited about this semester, and I have to say, if I had it to do over, I definitely wouldn't take it again. Darwall is a great guy, but he's a philosopher trying to teach a class he's billed as \"interdisciplinary\" which ends up instead just feeling very confused. He seemed very poorly equipped to teach the social scientific material we covered and on top of that, classes were incredibly poorly organized. Ultimately, ended up feeling like a waste of time and credits.",
    "A lot of people in the class seemed unhappy with the interaction between the philosophy and the cogsci. I was too, at first, because I couldn't really see how the cogsci material fit into philosophy. It just seemed... too empirical... and class discussion constantly flirted inappropriately with the fact\/value distinction. After a while though, I stopped dismissing the cogsci stuff and tried earnestly to figure out what cogsci could contribute to value theory, and I found some interesting connections. Most of the interesting-connections-finding happened on my own, though. Granted, I tried to address the cogsci literature as minimally as possible in my final paper. Overall the seminar was a good one, if you don't let promiscuous methodology wear you down. Prof. Darwall runs one of the best seminars I've ever seen, seamlessly integrating the response papers with the readings with class discussion. He's also incredibly accessible, really nice, and really helpful. I'm glad I took this class, even if it was a bit of a struggle to appreciate Stephen Pinker.",
    "Yep! See above.",
    "Terrible course. If you're interested in hearing about Darwall's work on the second-person standpoint or reading the works that allowed him to construct his ideas, I'd suggest just reading his book and skipping this class entirely. Everything, even Pinker, was tied into his thesis, and anything that didn't fit it - that is, all of cognitive science - was blatantly ignored. Class discussions were absolutely terrible. Darwall had no structure nor goal for the seminar sessions, so the 90 minutes were dominated by the scattered and occasionally petty comments of a few really obnoxious kids who fought for dominance. It's a joke that this class was cross-listed. Only take if you're reeeeeallly interested in ethical philosophy."
