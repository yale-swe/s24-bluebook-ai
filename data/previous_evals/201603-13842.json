    "some of the reading material was long, but that may be because my production workload this semester was large",
    "It seemed like it didn't matter how much or how little time I put into preparing for each class. No matter what, I was incorrect in whatever I submitted, but we found our way to the correct answer as a group in class. It was useful putting time into thinking about the case and analyzing each one, but I was never able to correctly do so on my own.",
    "I WISH it could be less, but I realize the work load for this course is ultimately required.",
    "There was a lot of reading, but it never got overwhelming.",
    "Workload seemed entirely appropriate to the course.",
    "The weekly assignments sometimes seem difficult to keep up with, but the reading material is usually not heavy. Ed also doesn't expect long pieces of writing each week, which is helpful."

    "everything was great. some of the resource material wasn't easy to obtain or clunky to obtain.",
    "I came into this course incredibly frustrated, feeling as if any idea I had was shot down as idiotic. I left this course feeling much the same, but more respected than when I started. I learned more than I would have imagined, and once I got used to the structure I didn't find each class nearly as frustrating. I prefer courses with yes or no answers, but I certainly learned a lot.",
    "It's a very well conceived and orchestrated course. It brings the uninitiated along just as well as the familiar, and, ultimately informs the students to new outlooks they likely haven't had before - unless they're theater managers.",
    "It was difficult as a TD&P to access some of the content on the theatre management database. Help was provided by classmates, but potentially that could be outlined in advance in the syllabus. Or a TM student could be deemed the designated person to circulate those documents.",
    "Organization makes sense for the layout of this course."

    "If anything I wish we had MORE time available with Ed. The knowledge and mastery he displayed made me wish for more time getting to understand the concepts he so clearly familiarizes us with.",
    "I could easily have written excellent in all those boxes.",
    "It is a pleasure to take Ed Martenson's class. He is a dynamic instructor with a wealth of knowledge and experience to share. He strikes a wonderful balance in his approach to encouraging and challenging his students -- he pushes everyone to think in new and critical ways.",
    "I enjoy the manner in which the instructor teaches the course, but I feel like I got little feedback on our actual work."

    "i didn't know anything about analysis before coming into this course and know I see the results of business analysis everywhere.",
    "This was the most informative and enjoyable class of my semester. I love applying what I've learned in this class to my work, which happens much more often than I thought it would!",
    "I think I will use these skills most in deciding where I want to work. That is, if a company seems to be well placed I will be more able to recognize it, or if a company seems stagnant and won't provide growth, I will be able to recognize that too. It will allow me to better find organizations to work at that are growing and will provide growth opportunities.",
    "As I said earlier, I wish we had more time with Ed and the material. However, I feel learning something completely foreign to oneself will always cause the student to desire more time with the material. Luckily we have an entire other semester!",
    "This course provided a shift in worldview that I apply now in small ways almost every day.",
    "I appreciate that the instructor was encouraging in regards to our absorption of the material. If anything, the course helped to push me to think critically about leadership. However, I don't know if I necessarily feel like my understanding of the material increased throughout the semester."
