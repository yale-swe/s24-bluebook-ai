    "definitely a good mix of actual philosophy and intellectual history. a rare course that let me see and EXPLORE the overlap academically. ie it was not just a phil class with vague references to history; and not a history class in which u learn about philosophy but dont do any).",
    "I learned about different conceptualizations of forgiveness within the Western tradition and over time, including different versions practiced by the ancient Greeks and Romans, by practitioners of ancient and contemporary Judaism and Christianity, and in more modern interpretations and political forgiveness. Ultimately, this is highly relevant to my interest in civil religion, both for the military and for our legal system. By looking at other conceptualizations of forgiveness, it becomes clearer what is a Christian interpretation and how Christianity underpins what appears to be secular decisions; while this was not the focus of the class, it was my focus and I was able to pursue it by thinking about the readings and coursework in conversation with my other academic and pre-professional work. For me, the course was very valuable.",
    "Reading dense texts, making concise arguments, disciplining an entire paper with one thesis.",
    "General knowledge of forgiveness as a topic in intellectual history, as well as different types of forgiveness and related topics",
    "I learned how to engage with writings on philosophy. I learned how to write with critical distance."

   "comments": [
    "interesting material and seminar was DEF the right format for this content. could've been a bit more structure around papers\/presentations. the presentations were a bit hit or miss esp; an in person meeting\/talk-through with prof. forsyth (rather than just an email) should probably be encouraged.",
    "I thought the class was solid; I only wish we had more time to cover more, discuss more, etc. I also would love an additional or complementary course about forgiveness in other traditions, not just the western tradition. The presentations were fantastic because each of us was able to share how we applied these topics and highly academic readings to contemporary situations or things we were personally interested in. It gave the course more depth and complexity than just an academic analysis.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was Professor Forsyth's immense responsiveness to student feedback. At multiple points throughout the term, he solicited student input concerning which activities and readings were helpful or weren't. This meant that any brief weaknesses were quickly resolved. He was also always available to meet during office hours and understanding about extenuating circumstances affecting deadlines.",
    "A major strength was that it is very well organised and designed. However, the course seems very limited in applicability.",
    "well organized syllabus, interesting readings, topics relevant to personal life and contemporary politics. class time is often too short to cover all the topics or readings."

    "yes. its a nice intro to some cool concepts without requiring any background. though I would actually recommend taking this course AFTER a couple other ethics\/phil classes. it's much easier to see the connections that are evident between the different readings if you've been exposed to some of that stuff.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Forsyth was very organized - the syllabus was arranged by clear topics with supporting readings that were relevant to each other and to that topic. We would go on to discuss them in class, and he would walk the seminar discussion through the key points. The presentations that each of us did added to the course and made it more dynamic. The topic and the material overall, for both the presentations and the course, is such that it can be applied to many different interestsministry, law, inter-personal relationships, politics, war & warfare, economics even, Disney, film, pop culture, and more. I was able to pursue my own interests in the material constantly even though we were all engaging with the same material. Also, the reading for most weeks was lighter than most courses in terms of length, but often denser; Professor Forsyth is very conscious of how long readings are and tries to minimize length in favor of selecting the best content for that week.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. The extreme depth of coverage over a narrow topic is rare. Great primer to philosophy in general. All the assignments were also thoughtfully curated. The topic is also very relevant and ubiquitous in day-to-day life.",
    "Yes if forgiveness interests you",
    "yes! this is a great chance to think critically about what it means to apologize or forgive.",
    "Yes! Valuable to a variety if disciplines in the social sciences and humanities as well as tot he general human experience."
