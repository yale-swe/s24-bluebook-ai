   "comments": [
    "My writing improved impeccably and undeniably. I learned to approach epic and long-form poetry with a more persistent interest and I also started approaching poetry with a more academic and contextual understanding.",
    "I honed my skills of analysis of poems. I improved my writing thanks to the Professor's focus to both matters of form and content.",
    "This course was challenging but structured in a way that encouraged students to step out of the bounds of what they may have been used to in academic writing. The assignments were largely geared toward expanding and communicating thought rather than simply selecting arguments put forth. Students will develop stronger insight into classic writing and interpreting them.",
    "I derived a deeper knowledge of literature, but also of the essential human emotions and states of being that literature represents, as well as an understanding of the poetic tradition traced through the centuries since Milton."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Brisman will facilitate very, very intelligent discussion that will draw from material and context studied and experienced well out of ENGL 126. His justifications will almost always be convincing and his criticism and remarks on the papers are intricate and fastidious. However, he can be a bit stand-offish towards your interpretation of the poem if it does not agree with his own. He is harsh but only kindly so and you will never feel like he is being unfair to you. All of his rules and regulations seem a bit strict at first but are very logically and reasonably driven. Your write will infinitely improve and you will become a much better reader than you thought could exist. Professor Brisman is passionate about the poets we read and I left several classes with tears in my eyes due to the poetry we read in class. Be prepared to kill your ego though because you're not going to be getting the grades you think you deserve but you are going to understand why each time you read through his comments.",
    "Close, extended reading of few authors allows deep reflection. I feel that such reflection would be aided by a brief introduction of each poet's context and characteristics.",
    "The atmosphere of the course was very much that of a celebration of the works rather than an obligatory teaching of them. The proffessor was much more concerned with understanding the works in depth and discussing the ideas put forth with in as they related to one another rather than structuring the whole course around assignments. This was challenging but also a good experience and insight into academia. This did sometimes get confusing, especially to students who did have much of a background in classics. Sometimes the conversation would go over the heads of some students such that it was hard to jump in and speak. It also felt a bit daunting to do the papers since so little structure was put in place, though I feel this probably presented an appropriate challenge for students to meet. Lots of reading, lots of writing.",
    "The course is vital to understanding both English literature and the progression of literature from author to author. It is an extremely important and moving course, and it shows the dialogue between various poets, from various eras, all trying to make sense of the same questions about life and the world."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a hard and rigorous course to take but I think that everyone who wants to justify their Yale education should take this very challenging but equally rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend it to students who already know they enjoy poems and writing, since it is a rather intense course on the reading and elaborating front.",
    "Absolutely -- it's both fantastic and important to read these wonderful poets in sequence, and to linger on them."
