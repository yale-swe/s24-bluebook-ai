   "comments": [
    "You learn about all aspects of the Middle East by taking this class. Every member is assigned a country in the Middle East and you really get to live through what is happening through the weekly presentations and news updates. Professor Sky facilitates the discussions and you get to learn as much from your classmates and the presentations they deliver. This is the perfect class to take for anyone who is curious about what is happening in this important region.",
    "Gained exposure to major issues concerning the Middle East with probably more nuance than would be gleaned in another similar course.",
    "This course makes sure that you are updated on what is happening in the Middle East in real-time, challenges you through dynamic conversations, and propels you to think more deeply about complicated geopolitical questions.",
    "This course provided me a wholistic and much more profound understanding of topics pertaining to the Middle East today.",
    "Survey course of the Middle East. Not much else.",
    "We studied important themes and events in the Middle East, like the creation of the modern Middle East, the role of several states, like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey, and conflicts, like Israel-Palestine, the Iraq War and Syria.",
    "Current trends in Middle East Politics and an increased ability to read and understand the news.",
    "This class was an ongoing, in-depth dialogue about current events, problems, and conflicts in the Middle East. The class is competitive and capped, and students selected all brought fascinating and unique experiences and perspectives to the table. Very few people agreed on anything, but dialogue remained respectful, organized, and fun. Emma Sky was a truly lovely Professor. She never impressed a certain ideology, but rather facilitated conversation between students. She helped moderate discussions, and brought in extremely well-respected and notable guests to our class to speak and answer questions about their experiences. The workload was low, but the learning was very high. This was an extremely worthwhile class that helped me to develop a far more moderate, empathetic, understanding approach to politics both in the Middle East and beyond.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding on multiple countries in the middle east and got a front-row seat to a lot of prominent figures lectures and opinions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You get to cover a wide variety of topics ranging from what is currently happening in Syria and Libya, to what happened in Iraq, to climate change. Every seminar is exactly like a different episode of a series and by the end of the semester, you will be able to put the pieces together and formulate a clear perspective into what is happening around the region.",
    "Strengths: The student perspectives in the class were enjoyable for me. This being my first class with a regional focus on MENA, I found that the other students in the class had very well thought out opinions about the issues we discussed which was enjoyable to witness in a discussion space. I also enjoyed the guest speakers we had. Weaknesses: Students in the past advertised this class as an opportunity to spend time with Prof. Sky who has extensive experience working in the Middle East, but I felt that we didn't get to hear very many anecdotes from her and the classes were mostly dominated by student discussion. I also didn't feel that I go clear feedback on my assignments. My midterm feedback was a sentences and I didn't receive any feedback from my presentation.",
    "I think this is a really strong course that has interesting assignments, terrific discussion, an incredible professor, and engaging readings. I think my only suggestion would be that the weeks with guest speakers were not very engaging as we just asked questions rather than discussed anything\/disagreed at all with each other, and I think the class discussions are the best part of the class.",
    "This course was among the best I have taken at Yale. In addition to the quality and depth of knowledge which students offered, Professor Sky was a phenomenal teacher. The course's readings and the speakers that Professor Sky brought further facilitated meaningful discussion. My only suggestion for improvement would be to consider including Pakistan and Afghanistan into the syllabus. While I understand that these are not technically Middle Eastern countries, they play an important role in shaping American foreign policy. For example, it is difficult to have a substantive discussion about the war on terror without covering either of these two countries.",
    "This class was great. I liked the format of news updates followed by weekly presenters and topics. I would have liked to hear more of Professor Sky's own opinions and expertise, especially regarding Iraq.",
    "the course was interactive as every student is assigned a country to follow, the writing assignments were very pleasant to work and complete. Professor Sky simply wants students to follow their passions which makes that class such an enjoyable experience."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you have any interest in the Middle East or if you are even curious. Professor Sky usually has a very diverse class and people who are even from countries in the region. You get to learn a lot in a stress-free environment since you are not directly tested on the content covered every week. By the end of the course, you get a wholesome picture of the region and it encourages you to learn more about it and breaks a lot of the stereotypes people might have.",
    "Not sure if I would take this course again. The motivation for me is that I know nothing about the Middle East, so while I gained exposure to the issues concerning the region, I could have done this on my own by reading some books and articles. The discussions were typically dominated by a few students who have strong opinions about the issues and the conversations were so specific that it was difficult to glean more about the larger political issues in the region. If studying the Middle East is your thing, you should probably take the course. If you haven't taken a MENA course and are admitted but have an equally interesting course that would depend your study in an area familiar to you already that you are considering, I would probably take the latter.",
    "Yes! This is a great course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a genuine and profound desire to understand the middle east",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This class is a wonderful forum to learn from your peers and listen to their varied perspectives. Professor Sky served as a mediator in our discussions and always allowed us to express our views. She has so much knowledge on the region, and it was lovely learning from someone who cares about its future.",
    "Definitely. If you can get in, take this class. It's challenging and interesting and completely engaging. Professor Sky challenges students to think critically about what you read in the news and this class has definitely helped increase my understanding of the Middle East as a region and its culture and politics.",
    "Yes! I recommend this class without any reservations! I met so many people with views and experiences diametrically opposed to me, and we still become friends. This class helped me to build connections that will keep for the rest of my life. I have no doubt my classmates will become the most prominent politicians, executives, military leaders, public servants, and thinkers of their respective countries. In this class, I was forced to challenge my opinions and preconceptions, and ultimate became a better person because of it.",
    "If you have a passion for the middle east and the beauty of its complexity in terms of politics, religion, and social issues, then this is the class to take."
