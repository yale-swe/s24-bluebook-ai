    "This class is the best class I've taken in my four years at Yale. It's also the single class I've taken that will actually be relevant to my career (nice try, Yale Econ). It's a phenomenal course. It's a business school course taught via cases that are often the professor's prior investments. The workload exceeds 20 hours of work the first few weeks, but after that it lowers significantly. Be prepared to spend many hours each week wallowing aimlessly in a few-hundred-page prospectus because he doesn't give you much direction in how to proceed. If you don't know how to model, don't take this course. You must know basic accounting and modeling to survive. If you are full-time recruiting at the same time, don't take this course. The material you're expected to learn is enormously abundant, difficult, and fascinating. It's quite comprehensive and covers all facets of PE Investing, from bankruptcy law to venture capital to raising your own PE fund. The professor is a HUGE boss and actually very committed to his students learning the material. It's an honor learning from someone so accomplished in the field. He's snarky and will be ruthless in calling you out so be prepared to defend yourself. An interesting caveat is that he tries to stick in a few how-to-live-life lessons \/ philosophy lessons. He obviously knows that he's teaching a crop of bushy-tailed to-be investment bankers whose sole goal is PE without really knowing why or what it entails. It takes a certain type of person who's willing to stomach the course, but if you come in prepared and stick with it, the rewards are substantial.",
    "Basically a primer for what it's like to be a first year PE analyst. The weekly readings are usually class notes he's prepared, sometimes articles, and always case(s) that we have to do some work with. Sometimes it's just a case with questions and a model\/term sheet to build, sometimes it's a team exercise where each of the teams are PE sponsors, banks, or target companies and we stage an LBO or something like that.",
    "Take it. There is a reputation that it grades really hard\u00e2\u0080\u0094and maybe it does\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you'll learn a lot. Take it credit\/D if grades are really important to you.",
    "Self-explanatory course name.",
    "Tough course that requires a lot of work and preparation, but you will get a ton out of it - and more than just knowledge about finance and private equity. I had no finance experience, and I felt behind most of my classmates. If you take this class, don't be afraid to be wrong; you may get grilled, but you'll get a lot more out of the experience if you put your pride aside. Learn how to model early on; while it's not a course in modeling, it is required to understand some of the cases, and you'll be better off if you can get a solid understanding of balance, income, and sources and uses statements early on.",
    "Great class, whether you're interested in going into finance or not. In some ways I think as someone who's not planning to go into finance I found it especially useful since I learned topics I otherwise might not have come into contact with. Professor Schmertzler himself is a great guy and always chooses interesting cases where you really have to think outside the box. I would suggest that if you don't know financial accounting going in, spend the first week or two of the semester really teaching yourself those fundamentals, either through his pre-class 1 guide or through another resource. Also, participate--this class is just about 100% participation, since most of the work you do outside of class will go unrecognized unless you put yourself out there and defend your findings.",
    "This is a beautiful and inspirational course that anyone serious about or interested in business& investment should take. Schmertzler is an amazing person and a great teacher. He'll call students on the spot sometimes and keep everyone on their toes throughout the class, which really forces you to understand everything and stay aware\/awake, great thing for a senior year class.",
    "Amazing seminar, a must take. Only practical knowledge I've gained at Yale so far. The work hits you like a semi truck so come prepared, MS does not play around. Class may seem uptight and cut throat at first but mostly everyone is in the same position so try not to be too intimidated.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are willing to put in the necessary time each week to tackle the considerable workload. I learnt something new and interesting every week.",
    "Very interesting class. I think it is great that the Econ department offers something that is more applicable to a professional career. Prof. Schmertzler is clearly well-established in his field and knows a lot, however the class felt unorganized at times. There was no syllabus, so the students had no sense of where the course was going or how we would be evaluated. There was also not a lot of direction on the assignments--I felt very lost with the homework, although there was some clarification in class (by that point, however, we moved on to the next topic). We didn't know we were having a midterm until he decided to have it (this was not mentioned on the first day of class). It was also unclear about the final--it was \"optional\", but we were all very uncertain with where we stood in the class, besides the one evaluation from the midterm."
