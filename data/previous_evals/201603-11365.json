    "I learned to better express my musical intentions through conducting",
    "Fantastic introduction to conducting. I went from having zero experience conducting whatsoever to being able to accurately guide a small orchestra through a few fairly difficult movements of music. You start from the very basics of baton technique, add the left hand for additional expression, and learn how to navigate difficult rhythms and time signatures.",
    "Introduction to Conducting taught me the use of the baton, the studious investigation of the music score, and the translation of both ones concept and musical technique across the orchestra. At the beginning of the semester, I learned the techniques that make up a conductors arsenal of movements. From the downbeat motion expressing the beginning of a measure to the upbeat preparation signaling the measures end (and the start of the following measure), I learned to count appropriately with the baton in the 4\/4, 3\/4, 2\/4, and 5\/8 time signatures. Once I encountered the warm-ups and stretches inherent in the conductors training I realized the importance of flexibility, but not too much flexibility, in order to count time with expressive motion. The motions that communicated volume were based on the length from the joint of the conductors arm while those that communicated speed also depended on this joint-length as well as the lead-velocity toward the ictus. Musical qualities such as tenuto, staccato, and legato were dictated by important visuals like stiffness and bounce. As we were introduced to music scores I found these motions useful for interpretation, however it became clear soon that the true test of the conductor was to define and shape his own music using these techniques. To me, the main theme of the course was finding ones concept. This idea, concept, relating everything one knew about music and feeling, was applied to every piece we studied. From Beethovens 5th Symphony I began my knowledge of concept, studying the scores first four notes and adding a diminuendo to taper the short phrase. With such little additions and some alterations the use of note-taking and annotation became important for us. To consecrate the ideas in our mind required writing and memorization, understanding of the voices, and realizing ones perfect piece, so to speak. As I interpreted and carefully studied over the semester, I was able to test and develop my concept in front of the orchestra. Between the orchestra and the conductor, I noticed significant differences. The conductors primary role was to facilitate his musical concept while keep time unaffected and undisrupted. The orchestra had the difficult jobs of playing the piece and simultaneously paying attention to one another and to the conductor. This course was able to teach me the true challenge of directing music because of the holistic approach toward the experience, and that the experience is dependent on the quality of study and quality of musicianship that one presents to the group."

   "comments": [
    "A lot of it tends to be sitting around watching others conduct. Perhaps we could split into two groups...maybe",
    "Strength: The masterclass format works quite well in class - you learn from your own turn and from watching others conduct. Toshi expresses himself clearly and succinctly, and the class is run quite efficiently. Weakness: I never thought I'd ever say this about any class, but I honestly think this class needs to have more homework. Granted, preparing the small score excerpts for the class does take some time if you want really do it well. But for a full credit class, it's entirely reasonable (and perhaps even desirable) for Toshi to give us small video-watching and\/or writing assignments as well so that more learning takes place outside of the classroom. One can theoretically do those things on one's own, but having a professor's guidance on how to improve independently is to be expected in a university course. Designing and grading those assignments would be slightly more work for Toshi, to be sure, but it would only be commensurate to the amount of work other professors put into their classes.",
    "MUSI 210s greatest strength is the opportunity to conduct a small orchestra since the chance to do this elsewhere is small. It allows students to truly conduct a group of instrumentalists, which is inherent in all band and orchestra music experiences. By learning to conduct a group, one demonstrates the highly applicable skills that are taught in the course and used in the aforementioned experiences. Another strength is the chance to perform pieces if one plays an instrument for the class orchestra. This not only provides time to play the works of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, but it also teaches a new reverse perspective to the player where one studies the score well enough to recognize the entrances and parts of the other voices in the orchestra. This surround-realization trains the musician in ways no other course can. One weakness I find in this course is the lack of diverse styles of music. Though the major works in classical music provide fruitful challenges for the conductor, as well as some exciting chances to live in the moment of the work, pieces in different styles, and made by other composers, could diversify our exposure to music. This could enable a more resilient conductor, who is at least introduced with syncopated rhythms, awkward dynamics, and interesting instrumentation."

    "If you're comfortable with conducting, do it",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it to any student even vaguely interested in conducting. It's incredibly rare to find a class with so little work and such high reward. Toshi is honestly such an admirable and knowledgeable conductor and such an efficient teacher. Although you only get about 5-7 minutes of individual attention per class, you get a lot out of those few minutes. You also learn from watching others and hearing Toshi's critique of them. Even though I think there are some ways the class can be improved (e.g. a little more homework...seriously), none of those issues are serious enough to be a reason not to take this class. I mean, really, at what other non-conservatory institution could you get your very first introduction to conducting under the instruction of a student of Bernstein??? It was my favorite class - perhaps it'll be yours too!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. MUSI 323 provides an experience like no other for music courses at Yale. The students are introduced to the art of conducting and are allowed to play in a class orchestra. This allows the musician to develop the mindset of being within a group of voices, or instrumentalists, and to not take for granted his part in relation to others. If the student feels compelled to take this course to understand the techniques of conducting, the course will clarify that the experience is more about the concept and the use of techniques to accomplish the concept, not about the techniques themselves."
