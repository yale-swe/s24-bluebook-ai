   "comments": [
    "Violence: State and Society is a seminar about civil war. The discussion tends to become repetitive quickly, but I also learned valuable things.",
    "Great class if you really want to delve deep into the theoretical nitty-gritty of civil conflict studies.",
    "GLBL 361 was definitely the best academic decision I made this semester. The course takes the topic of civil war violence to an impressive depth without getting repetitive\/going in circles, the reading list was extensive but also tightly assembled, such that they all wound together in coherent narratives that let us keep track of our evolving understanding of key themes,and the assignments were sufficiently open-ended such that we had room to develop our own unique appreciation of the material. For a seminar that used to be a graduate-level course, the workload is very reasonable - the reading load especially was pleasantly manageable, and the written assignments (four reading responses and one final paper) were well spread out across the semester. Prof. Kocher is also an absolutely swell guy, and found the nifty balance between light-heartedness and intensity, such that classes were both very insightful and lots of fun.Take this course!!",
    "Examination of violence perpetrated by substate actors. Lots on insurgency and civil war. Reasonable reading load, reading responses, and one 12 page paper at end of course. Kocher is funny and personable. The class is enjoyable. Would recommend to any poli sci major or anyone who is curious about the topic.",
    "absolutely.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone particularly interested in the subject matter, or anyone looking for a course with more methodological rigor than you might find in your average political science seminar. Professor Kocher is great - he's very responsive in discussion, provides a lot of feedback on reading responses, and keeps the workload completely manageable. However, if you're looking for a class to build up positive knowledge or draw clean conclusions about the subject matter, you should probably look elsewhere, as his approach means that a solid portion of the literature we read is debunked in some way. Personally, I found this useful, but it depends on what you're looking for in a class."
