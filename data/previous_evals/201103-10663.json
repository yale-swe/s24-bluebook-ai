    "Highly recommended to any student of philosophy.",
    "It's a course that covers much of Hume's body of work, though it largely leaves untouched his discussion of the passions and moral psychology. I would recommend this course to any student who was interested in Hume or early modern philosophy more generally.",
    "It is a survey of the main components of Hume's philosophy, focused mostly on the Treatise and Enquiry. Attention is paid to his empiricism, naturalism, skepticism, and the relationships between these. Thus, his philosophic project as a whole is studied, along with crucial individual components (e.g. inductive skepticism, theory of ideas, etc...) which are studied more in depth throughout.I would, without hesitation or qualification recommend this course to any student interested in philosophy, especially those interested in its historical background."

   "comments": [
    "Linked not just to historical issues but to contemporary questions.",
    "This course was central to building a foundational knowledge of the history of philosophy.",
    "This course has, of course, seriously improved my knowledge of Hume and his philosophy, and so given me important background and context for the rest of the philosophy that I read. In particular, understanding Hume's philosophic project broadly has been helpful, as it serves as an example for how theoretic systems need to cohere, and the problems that can arise from the pursuit of a comprehensive system."
