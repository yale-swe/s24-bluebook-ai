   "comments": [
    "Understanding inequalities in the US and how policies perpetuate or alleviate them.",
    "The course considers the rise of inequality, primarily in the United States, since the 1960s and a series of policy areas that are partly responsible. To a lesser extent, the course examines the connection between inequality and political competition. These are very important topics that are especially timely at the moment, and the course is very instructive. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend the course to another student interested in distributional and\/or democratic politics. I would emphasize the unique blend of academic and applied political discourse in addition to the more generally-interdisciplinary nature of this course.",
    "A very good overview of policy-focused questions relating to inequality (mostly) in America. Listed as a theory class, but relatively light on theory (which was fine by me, but should be noted as people try to balance their schedules among different subfields)."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a policy-focused perspective that differs from what is available in many other political science courses. I imagine the course will contribute to my research by helping to ground it more concretely.",
    "In terms of subject matter, it's hard to imagine a course more suited than this one to my dissertation\/research interest in the politics of American social policy and inequality. More broadly, this course provides a unique opportunity to sort through open questions at the intersection of academic and applied politics. However uncommon, I believe such an intellectual exercise would be incredibly beneficial for graduate students in the political science department and social sciences more generally.",
    "This class provided ample opportunities to think about questions of theory and practice, qualitative versus quantitative method, politics versus economics, etc, which is useful."
