    "I think Ru has a great grasp on the amount of workload for us and the class is well-organized and well thought out, and the level set so that those with less experience or talent can also learn something.",
    "I was surprised that we started with a carving but I later realized how valuable it was to learn how to see the 3D object within the square block of foam and then how to use the tools available to reveal it. We used these skills in our painting as well. You are forced to see the painting\/research image, break down its different elements and then use the tools available to recreate it on a canvas. I enjoyed that Ru encouraged us to think outside of our own paintings and connect how scene painting fits within the entire production. He asked us to pay attention to how many hours it takes us to do each section of the painting and relate that to the budgeting process. This is valuable and something I will carry with me throughout my career."

    "We should be given 24\/7 access to paint brushes.",
    "I am not sure if this is possible, but more time in class on the clouds would have been helpful and then maybe a chance to try again after the critique. A chance to improve and use what you learned from other people's paintings. Maybe if the clouds paintings were smaller we could work on improving them."

    "I truly appreciated that Ru took the time to demonstrate each technique more than once. As someone who is knew to painting and scene painting, I often needed more than one example or demonstration and Ru was patient with me and offered deeper explanations when I needed it. I now have a way of carrying the color wheel with me wherever I go! Thanks Ru!"
