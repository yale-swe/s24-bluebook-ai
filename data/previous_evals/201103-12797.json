   "comments": [
    "This is a class which is very relevant to today. Basically, we discuss the history of medicine in America from the colonial period up to today. We looked at how diseases are socially constructed and how the responsibility of the doctor, the government, and the individual with respect to health have changed. The workload is completely reasonable, and the readings are interesting. The readings which are longer than typical are always the easier and faster to read ones. The class is also a good introduction to historical research and writing.",
    "Only if you enjoy learning about the history of medicine. The material was boring to me.",
    "no",
    "It's a really great class for history lovers and science\/medicine lovers. So I feel like it's a class that most people would enjoy.",
    "This freshman seminar was a small discussion-based writing course. Short \"completion\" reading responses were due before every class and we wrote three essays (2 five-page papers and 1 ten-page research paper). There was a lot of reading, but it was easy to keep up with. Near the end of the semester, we read two popular novels (\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" and \"My Own Country\"). They were both very good.I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student who is interested in taking the pre-med track. We spent a lot of time examining the history of the doctor-patient relationship and how medicine is affected by social and political factors. I am not pre-med, but I still think this course is worthwhile if you are interested in the topics mentioned earlier.",
    "This class was a wonderful class to gain background info to better understand present public health issues and medical dilemmas. As someone who wants to study global health, I thought it was helpful to learn about the past in order to better understand the present and to make connections between what issues the US faced to what other countries are facing. I would recommend this course to other students who are either interested in medicine or public health, or who wish to gain a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of health issues and societal changes.",
    "The texts for this class are really interesting, but the in-class discussions can be very dry, despite the exciting nature of the material. Overall it was an interesting class, especially given that I got a new perspective on medicine through the years.",
    "It was an interesting course about the history of medicine. It focused a lot on really old 18th century medicine, which was interesting, but can be bland at times.",
    "While the course was good for me to take, I would not recommend it to another student unless this was the only class on medical history in the United States. I think its a good topic of study and worthwhile, but the class needs to be improved.",
    "In this course we covered the role of physicians throughout history, from the power of midwives during colonial times to the current medical issues we have in modern times. We read several, great books. It's a really chill class. There are only two short papers and one final paper. The rest of the class is readings, discussion, and online reading responses due the day before class. I would recommend this course ONLY if you are genuinely interested in the history of medicine in America or if you want some background in the role of physicians during history.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have a strong interest in the topic at hand. I took it to improve my writing and found that it did not improve much over the course of the semester.",
    "This is a great way to get a writing credit if you don't want to do that much writing. The course is informative but not stressful in the least; there are two short papers which are easy to write, and although the 10 page research paper at the end is more work, there is a lot of time to do it. The readings are largely interesting, although some of the textbook sections can get tedious sometimes. I should mention that a good amount of students seemed to skip the readings routinely and get away with it, although I think that was unfortunate as they missed a lot of interesting material. Professor Tannenbaum is great; I found her to be very friendly and accessible. It was also clear that she was very knowledgeable, although she didn't really participate that much in discussions. Overall, a positive experience.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this course. However, be prepared to do A LOT of reading. The papers are interesting and the material is also very interesting, as long as you like medicine or history in general. I wouldn't recommend this to students who don't like speaking up in class, because that is what most of the class consists of. However, this class can be very enjoyable if you put the effort and time into it."
