   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to someone with background on the European Union and who is very interested in the topic, as the readings can be a bit arid.",
    "European Union is the best class I've taken this semester. The content is interesting, the class has a lot of European students who can contribute their first-hand knowledge to the discussion, Prof. Cameron is a great seminar leader. If you are interested in the EU at all, take this class.The workload is completely manageable, too.",
    "Professor Cameron is a brilliant section leader, very understanding and the Yale professor I always wanted to take a small seminar with. Take this class: it's very relevant, and the paper gives you the opportunity to think deeply and explore a topic that interest you related to the European Union. Getting into this seminar is possible for non-Political Science majors: don't miss this opportunity!",
    "The class-time was very interesting, but the readings could be quite long and dry. There are 1-page reading responses, but I quickly learned that that meant 1 page single-spaced, or an informal two-page essay each week. The class was interesting partly because Prof. Cameron knew which questions to hone in on, but also because we had a ton of Europeans with lots of different and often strongly-held beliefs. Without them, the class wouldn't have been the same.",
    "A theoretical overview of the EU. A lot of the discussion gravitated around current issues in the EU, despite readings covering a range of historical developments.",
    "The basics of EU institutional structure, the development of the modern EU, and current issues and topics of the EU such as the radical right, european identities, and the Eurozone crisis.",
    "If you find European politics interesting, then this is a class you should definitely take. You get to work with an accomplished professor and overall the workload is healthy.",
    "A weekly look into various aspects of the European Union's formation and development. Not every week will necessarily be interesting (at least for me this was so), but some weeks are particularly engaging. Readings are good and Professor Cameron is very knowledgeable. Requires however particular energy to enter the conversation.Recommend if interested in getting into the nitty gritty of the EU -- if not, then would not recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they have an interest in European politics. It can be challenging if you have never addressed the topic before, but it is an extremely rewarding class. Professor Cameron is wonderful. Definitely take it.",
    "It is a good overview of the EU. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject and does not know this political system well. Although I would not recommend it to someone who is already somewhat acquainted with this topic, because the class does not really go in depth into any one topic besides the final paper, in which you can thoroughly research a specific topic.",
    "It's a great overview of the EU and its challenges from one of the experts in the field. Just keep in mind that there's a little more of the professor talking and a little less discussion than in other such seminars, and that you won't get too much guidance on the long research paper at the end. Also don't expect to learn a huge amount new about the EU--it's a great overview, but certainly not an advanced level study of it."
