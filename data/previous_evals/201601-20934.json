    "Taking Hindi is a great class to take for a second language. Professors Khurana and Sharma make the class a lot of fun. You won't regret taking this class. The professor really put in the time to make sure all of their students do well.",
    "Taking Hindi was one of the best decisions of my freshman year. I was also considering French, but I opted for Hindi to avoid the notoriously obnoxious workload of L1 French and to study a language that would allow me to more deeply appreciate my Indian heritage. On both counts, this course has not disappointed. Without being overwhelmingly demanding, the class has taught me great deal of Hindi and I've fallen in love with the language. The teachers are warm, engaging and patient. But I do have some criticisms. Other reviews probably complain about the lack of structure in the class, and they do have a point - I do think that the lectures (especially Seemaji's) can be sort of random sometimes because new grammar concepts and vocabulary are introduced but never revisited, so students forget. Overall, the teachers can be a bit too relaxed sometimes, and sometimes students slack off because they knew they'll get a decent grade anyway. Ultimately, this slows down the progress of the class as a whole. On the other hand, if you listen to the songs, memorize the poems, and read the stories they tell you to, you'll learn a lot of Hindi even though you're not using a textbook and the assignments seem a little random. If you put in the work, you'll get a lot out of this class. But I think a firmer structure and a more systematic grading system would make the class even more fruitful for everyone.",
    "Hindi 120 is a fine class to further one's elementary language skills in Hindi through textbook assessments, exams, songs, fables, and cultural lessons.",
    "Hindi 120 is a continuation of L1 Hindi. It is about the same difficulty level. I would recommend the class to someone who wanted to keep learning different aspects of Hindi, including both speaking and writing.",
    "My conversation skills definitely picked up this semester. I really feel everything started to synthesize a little. My immediate decision making skills could be better but that'll just come with speaking more. The teachers really make themselves readily available preventing you from getting stuck on any speed bumps. All in all happy I took the course, and as an added bonus I feel very close to my classmates and also my teachers."
