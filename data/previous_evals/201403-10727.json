   "comments": [
    "\"What is literary criticism for ancient texts?\" The course sets out to question many of the categories that we take for granted when we study ancient texts. In questioning these categories, it helps push us as students to know what we are meaning when we talk about authors, texts, works, commentaries etc... I would recommend the class to others, with a caveat. The caveat is that some weeks are going to be incredible, class discussion will be incredibly engaging, the questions that are asked will feel pertinent for your own work, and the texts that your looking at are engaging or interesting for various reasons. Because of the diversity of the topic covered in the class that isn't likely to be one's experience every week. Some weeks the questions just might not feel interesting, or the answers that we attempt, either as students or professors, might not seem satisfying. I don't think this is a bad thing really, a) it's not avoidable in any class, and b) it means that your doing thing that are pushing your own interests.",
    "This course is a great way to engage in literary theory about canon, readership, and authorship. The classes did assume a certain basic knowledge of literary theory, and I would recommend that any student have at least a brief background in order to get the most out of the course and discussion. I would recommend this course to any student who is looking for new ways to approach her discipline.",
    "Very knowledgable. Very interested in students' ideas.",
    "CLSS 363 is a class for students who wish to increase the ways they are able to interrogate the texts of their fields."

    "This course has given me the forum to think about many questions that I think are central to my own research interests.",
    "This course helped me find new ways to think about familiar material and encouraged me to think about texts that I hadn't dealt with before. I am not sure how this course will contribute to my dissertation, but I have already enjoyed applying concepts we explored in other courses."
