    "Yes. I learned a lot in this course.",
    "German for reading is a course for students who want to learn how to read German quickly and do not necessarily need to know how to speak it or how to engage in casual conversation. It is best oriented towards academic reading. I would recommend it because it does a good job fulfilling that role, and German is a really important language for a lot of students. Not only is it helpful in preparing to pass the German exam for doctoral students, but it actually prepares us to use German in our research.",
    "A very fast paced German course for those who want a crash introduction to grammar. I recommend this to those who actually have some (not much) German knowledge over those who have none at all. However, extreme dedication and time will work in one's favor when trying to master the subject.",
    "Go into this course with the right expectations: your speaking skills will improve little if at all, but your understanding of grammar will improve exponentially. Because of the nature of the course, you get out of it what you put into it: the more time you spend reviewing grammar and building vocabulary useful for you, the better of you'll be",
    "I would recommend this class for other students."
