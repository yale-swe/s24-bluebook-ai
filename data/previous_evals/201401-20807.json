    "If you took 110, you have to take this. Rest assured that it's just as good as L1. The difficulty level, at least for me, rose this semester -- you really have to put the work in.",
    "A lot of work but it really helped me improve",
    "SUPER hard to get an A...SUPER hard to get LESS THAN a B+. Take it. Japanese program at Yale is one of the strongest in the country along with Mandarin and French. Your life will change after this class in a good way--it'll never be the same again...ever.",
    "I couldn't recommend this course enough. Great teachers, challenging but manageable content, and an interesting perspective into a different culture."
