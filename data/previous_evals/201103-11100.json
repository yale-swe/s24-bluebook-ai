    "If the student wishes to have a good grounding in International Relations theory, this is the proper course to take. I cannot say that it would be the same without the same professor, however, as it involved a lot of lecture.",
    "Overview of theory. Yes.",
    "Yes; highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students to obtain a more solid understanding of IR theory",
    "I highly recommend it.",
    "This course focuses on IR theory in relation to the Great Powers and nukes. So take the course if that interests you.",
    "IR 651 is an advanced survey course of international relations theory. The readings presented are quite advanced and even arcane, but you don't necessarily have to even do them because the professor does not particularly challenge his students to ensure that they did the readings or understand the ideas presented within. The readings are often not directly relevant to the homework memos either.Be warned, this is not a general survey course. Most of the readings presented are much more advanced. If you have little familiarity with the general theories of international relations to begin with, this course may not be the correct choice to deepen your knowledge.In short, I would avoid this course unless you have a particular affinity for international relations.",
    "A great course if you are interested in great power politics and something a bit more applicable to IR across the board. A great foundational course that will serve as a basis for all your other classes in IR. Highly recommended. But the course will require work and is more demanding than other IR courses offered at Jackson--but well worth it.",
    "My advice to fellow IR student: Take this class. You need this theory, and this class is non-painful (even enjoyable at times!) way to get that knowledge. Caution, though -- reading is hefty."

   "comments": [
    "This course has given me the fundamental knowledge that I need if I choose to further focus on theory. It has made me at the very least familiar with most of the major academic thought in the field.",
    "Very helpful in gaining better understanding",
    "This course gave me good exposure to some of the major theories in IR.",
    "This course prepares me with better understanding of major IR theories. As a non-IR major during my undergrad, this is extremely helpful.",
    "I think this course did little to enhance my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "Yes--the course deepened my understanding of IR as a academic field but as a practical profession as well. I regret not taking the course earlier (though it was not offered). I think it would've been a great course for my first year and invaluable as a foundational core for all my other classes in IR."
