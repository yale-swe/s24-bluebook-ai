   "comments": [
    "Go for it. Recommended to all majors. You will learn a lot.",
    "CHEM 562 is a good class for learning instrument basics. I would certainly recommend the class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn how to work in a machine shop. It is totally hands-on and totally fun. It is one of the hidden gems of Yale. No prior experience is necessary, yet you will learn a lot and have fun doing it. It is appropriately paced, and since the whole class is focused on working in the shop, there is no work outside of class. Dave is also one of the coolest teachers you will have atYale.",
    "totally recommend it",
    "I will strongly recommend to fellow students",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes. You build a working steam engine from scratch. Let me say that again: you build a working steam engine from scratch. There are other great things about the class, but they should be a surprise on the first day. Go early to sign up, or you might not get a slot.",
    "This is a baller course. No homework, just lots of experience in the machine shop. You'll walk out with a good understanding of the machines and a really sweet little steam engine.",
    "This class is magnificant. You spend four hours a week learning to build a steam engine, and then you do. I don't think I need to say much more than that. Now that I've taken this class, I'm allowed free run of the machine class. How much better can it get?",
    "The class teaches the milling machine and metalworking lathe. Each student makes a small steam engine. Parts are made by translating drawings with precise measurements. I recommend the class for anyone interested in precision metalworking."

   "comments": [
    "Machine shop working is vital for the instruments I use for my research. This is very helpful for the design and actual fabrication of these components.",
    "I am not a graduate student but an undergraduate engineering major. I believe that hands-on classes like this one are vital to the education of an engineer and should be required. While engineers learn how to design things on paper, the hands-on, practical experience gained from this class was invaluable and further deepened my understanding of the materials and processes involved in any projects that I might be designing.",
    "I am physics major interested in experimental physics. Working in machine shop will be useful for me in the future when I go to grad school and work on my senior thesis.",
    "very helpful in instrument design",
    "N\/A",
    "I'm hoping to apply what I learned in this course to my Biomedical Engineering Major. Hopefully my senior project will include building something - so this should help a lot.",
    "Not applicable. I took this course purely for pleasure.",
    "I am an MFA student in the Sculpture department. It is important for me to learn to manipulate material in different ways. Getting outside my comfort zone is crucial to my growth as an artist. Since I am not used to working with precise measurements, this class is very helpful to me."
