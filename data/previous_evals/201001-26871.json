    "Enviro Studies 250 is a good summary of a bunch of different anthropological works, and offers a good discussion of them in class. Personally, I wouldn't recommend in because I found the discussions hard to get into, as they were often quite philosophical and on topics which I didn't hold strong opinions.",
    "The course is NOT A LECTURE. Tons of discussion, minimal actual teaching. Some of the readings were very interesting, but often times very long\/dense. If you are interested in the anthropological side of this class, you will enjoy it very much, but if you are taking it as an environmental studies course, it leaves much to be desired. Though you do discuss some environmental issues, the topics discussed became very theoretical and hard to follow.",
    "Very interesting material. A blend of seminar discussion and lecturing. I would recommend it if the material looks good to you.",
    "This class was frustrating in that there was clearly interesting content to explore, but it was hard to prepare for class since we didn't know what type of class to expect.",
    "I really liked this class. I though the readings were really interesting, and the class discussions were often helpful as well. Professor Hebert is a good discussion leader. There is a lot of reading, but it's good reading, and if you've taken similar classes, chances are you've read some of it. If you don't know anything about globalization or neoliberalism, and you're more of an environmentalist than an economist, take it.",
    "This is a fantastic class. I would highly recommend it to any student who is interested in environmental or development policy (I am a graduating political science major who is pursuing a master's in environmental policy and management next year), or in social justice as it relates to the environment. It brings a critical, anthropological\/sociological perspective to issues that tend to be monopolized by political science or hard science discourses. The class is genuinely thought-provoking. It made me think deeply about, and challenge, many of my assumptions about the environment and how environmental and development policy is made and implemented. Professor H\u00e9bert is a fantastic teacher. The class is ostensibly a lecture, but this semester it was sufficiently small that she chose to run it as a large seminar. She is a skilled discussion leader: very respectful of participants' opinions, but adept at preventing anyone from monopolizing the conversation and moving it in in an interesting direction. I recommend taking this class when you will have the time and motivation to do the reading. The readings are substantial but very manageable, and very interesting and well written. Professor H\u00e9bert integrates the readings into class discussion more than almost any other class I've had at Yale, including seminars, and you'll enjoy the class much more if you've done them. There are also several reading responses throughout the term. Professor H\u00e9bert and the TA (who was Dana Graef this year - I don't know who it will be in the future) give very thoughtful feedback on them, so you'll benefit from doing a good job on those, too. The final paper is great opportunity to do some research on a topic you'd like to learn more about, but it's not too intense - only 8 to 12 pages. This is a fantastic class.",
    "Stay away, the class is boring and unfocused to the extreme. The many readings are long and mostly fluff while the classes themselves are \"discussions\" that are only a chance for people to say something in order to get participation points. The class has no connection with nature or the environment and deals almost exclusively on the theories of globalization. The class could be good, but give it at least another year to work the kinks out.",
    "If you are at all grounded in practical knowledge, dont take this course. all of the discussions were \"i feel....\" or \"i think...\" without any thought to the practicality of those statements and if they could actually be implemented",
    "Take this class. Might be a good credit\/d option but the class is quite simply fascinating.",
    "Interesting discussion, but if you have already thought about the issues of globalization and environmental degradation, this class may be a review for you."
