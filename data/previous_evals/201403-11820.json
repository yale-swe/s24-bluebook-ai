    "It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The readings and assigned viewings were not as interesting as I'd anticipated, and we didn't get any grades back all semester, which was frustrating. Dean B is good at leading discussion, and the final project was an interesting assignment, but the class had a lot of potential and ultimately felt a little lackluster. Perhaps it was mostly the syllabus this year, which just wasn't as great as it seems to have been in years past. It needs some refocusing, but it could be a great class in the future.",
    "Public Humanities is a really cool course in theorydefinitely unlike anything else I've taken at Yale. The discipline of public humanities really interested me at first but unfortunately I have to say that I grew less interested in it as the course wore on. The readings were good at the beginning of the semester but then began to feel disjointed and confusing. Professor B is an awesome guyreally nice and smartbut clearly didn't have enough time to run a course like this, which I think it part of why I lost the thread of what exactly were were doing week to week. We pulled off the group project at the end of the semester but this experience felt a little strange and disconnected from the rest of the course. It's a cool and pretty easy class if you're interested in the discipline, but be prepared for a kind of scattered experience that you'll have to pull together yourself."
