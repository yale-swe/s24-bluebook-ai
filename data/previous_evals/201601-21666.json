   "comments": [
    "ENGL 114 08 is great, and most probably a means to fulfil a writing requirement. It's definitely worth it though, and with this course you have a great opportunity to hone your skills as a writer.",
    "I highly recommend the course, the readings and discussions were really interesting and Professor Kreiner was wonderful. the class is not easy however and does require significant time, but it was well worth it.",
    "Fantastic, take it.",
    "Fun class where you touch upon relevant and controversial subjects. Also very helpful when it comes to learning how craft essays.",
    "A really insightful class into the inequality in America - gender, racial, economic - and their intersectional nature. Discussions are very engaging, and the class helps to build a more complex understanding of inequality, as well as the need and limitations to solve it.",
    "I would not recommend the class to a student with a general interest in learning 'how to write'. I would only recommend it to students that are interested in the material that we cover in class."
