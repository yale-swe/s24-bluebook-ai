    "My German skills improved so so much in just one semester.",
    "This course was a fantastic addition to the German department at Yale, focused on the 800,000 to 1 million people in Germany of Afro-German descent and the resultant diaspora of the group in the last sixty or so years. Centered on May Ayim's seminal \"Farbe Bekennen: Afro-Deustche Frauen auf den Spuren Ihrer Geschichte,\" GMAN 163 uses sociological academic texts, music, art and literature to analyze the history and nuances of blackness in Germany.",
    "German language skills and analytical skills.",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to what it means to be black in Germany. Having known absolutely nothing about the topic beforehand, all of the content was relevant and insightful. I cannot say enough to commend the content of this course.",
    "My reading and comprehension skills improved drastically, as did my ability to research and find German primary and secondary sources."

   "comments": [
    "I liked that we had discussions pretty much every day. If the course continued to be conversation based and not lecture based it'll stay great",
    "The small group sometimes made it difficult for a diversity of opinion, but it was overall a very successful course, and Theresa is fantastic.",
    "AMAZING PROFESSOR and a lot of resources.",
    "This course presented information in a variety of media, which I loved. This included biographies, documentaries, academic articles, and much more. My ability to read German was much improved as a result.",
    "Could not think of a single weakness if I had to. The syllabus, readings, and other course materials were extremely well selected and presented."

   "comments": [
    "Yea, this material is something you can't get anywhere else at Yale. It's amazing how little we know about German history outside of our AP Euro textbooks. If your German isn't that strong, I would still recommend taking the class, however, I would get your German up to par by the end of the year. The last assignment is a 10 page paper and I'm not going to lie, it was incredibly hard.",
    "Yes! The class gives great insight into an often-understudied group of Germany, and offers a much more diverse range of readings and discussion than the other more white-oriented German courses.",
    "Absolutely! It was so interesting and is taught very well!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. As with all of Theresa's courses, the material was thought-provoking and insightful. The topic of this course is too important to not be discussed.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. I did not expect to find the subject material particularly interesting, but this history was a fascinating case study. Theresa Schenker is an unbelievably charismatic, effective, and understanding instructor and any course she teaches is absolutely worth taking."
