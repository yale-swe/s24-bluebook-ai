    "This is a great course for improving German speaking, reading, and vocabulary. I definitely recommend the course. The professor is very engaging and the material is interesting.",
    "Interesting class, great readings not such a great instructor.",
    "If you want to take German 150 you should. It's a very reasonable course load compared to many other language classes. The course is mostly reading and discussing the reading. You will also write about 6 essays. Make sure your German is good enough to begin with, though. I found the range of the different students' proficiency to be quite large.",
    "Good for people who want to do literature",
    "Yes. Especially if you are looking to improve your German in a non-stressful way."
