   "comments": [
    "I think that the course material is incredibly relevant for the field of Public Health. I believe that one of the greatest weaknesses is it needs a bit more structure within each system. For example, if that day the system covered is the GI, a few minutes should be spend rudimentary explaining the system itself, then specific physiological functions of the GI and how they bridge with public health concern, and finally a discussion or student participation in course.I wish we had more group-solving problems and projects rather than discussions. We could even have more student led presentations. Instead of leaving them all at the end, we could assign one every other lecture or once a month.Even though the course is somewhat structured this way, I feel like it lacked defined specific goals, and rather than gaining knowledge on specific issues of relevance, I feel I obtained minimal understanding of physiological phenomenon and Public Health relevance.The write-ups are an excellent idea, but they should be narrowed down to allow for better discussions among students. The topics were so diverse that it was hard to comment on each. Maybe specific subtopics can be assigned within the topic.I also think that a midterm would be a good idea to force students to review material covered in class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, especially the fact that we combined physiological concepts with public health. If there was a weakness, I felt like we covered a lot of material in less depth. Maybe it would have been a better idea to go into fewer concepts more in depth.",
    "The course helped orient me about the body's specific systems and how it functions altogether via its vast dependency and similarities to one another. I learned a lot and the 2-page summaries were excellent supplemental devices to enhance and reinforce this learning. The freedom to investigate a topic relative to the specific body system being studied allowed me to satiate my intellectual curiosity and learn the topic better as opposed to discrete and limited topic choices. Dr. Yeckel is a highly effective presenter on the topics. The ability to interact with classmates and intellectually enhance our various perspectives in the material helped to bring about new ideas and make the learning atmosphere much more open\/friendly. This is also demonstrated by the willingness to share our knowledge with the public via wikipedia, which helps to promote scientific transparency--a valiant and necessary aspect to aid public health and research!To improve the course, I would recommend that the syllabus entail that a student will be assessed by 3 exams. Slightly clearer communication during class about assignments and future expectations would help too. The possibility of approaching the 2-page summaries differently (e.g. powerpoint presentation, debate?) week-by-week to provide different perspectives and approaches would help break the monotony a bit and allow one to understand the clear discrepancies between the physiological, financial, and public health components of a subject. Someone who has had little physiology or biology will have difficulty in grasping concepts, but with determination and extra help, one can overcome this.",
    "The course is comprehensive, yet tailored to students' specific interests, especially in the public health arena",
    "Excellent course! Highly interesting, and learned a lot about physiological basis for chronic disease, microbial disease, etc.",
    "This class was very interesting in that incorporated both basic science and public health applications. I really enjoyed the scope of every lecture. The primary strength of this class is the range of perspectives (from microscopic to epidemiological) in which health was taught.I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the nervous system and public health. It might have also been interesting to have had more direction for our weekly assignments (such as current events, controversies, etc.). I agree with Professor Yeckel's original criteria of having the course for second-year MPH students in the future to allow for more in-depth discussion of epidemiological considerations of the concepts discussed.",
    "very interactive class.",
    "",
    "With this class I was hoping for a more broad overview of physiology and how the body works. The class focuses on small in-depth aspects of physiology rather than broad concepts. The weekly writings, while time-consuming, were helpful in learning about things I was interested in regarding physiology and public health. There were Wiki assignments which seemed like an after-thought and took focus away from the class itself.",
    "This was an excellent course for students with different levels of ohysiology background.",
    "Learning about how physiology and public health relate is a very interesting topic. Dr. Yeckel is an excellent and very passionate instructor and she tailors the lectures and discussion sessions according to the students' interests. It seems like second year students would benefit more from this class than first year students as knowledge on epidemiology is important for this class. The midterm and final exam pose thought-provoking questions that are applicable to the current public health issues in the real world. And the weekly write-ups were a great opportunity to explore an area of interest. We also had wiki projects. The concept was an interesting one, however, I did not get much out of these assignments.",
    "Great topic for public health.",
    "Energetic professor but the material is poorly organized.Did not like the forced weekly discussion."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is incredibly encouraging. She is a wonderful physiologist and is incredibly knowledgeable in the field. She is incredibly approachable and willing to meet each of her students needs. I am really humbled by her passion for her students, and her time for us. Her passion for the body and population health is so evident in her lectures. It was great to get to know her.Perhaps the only recommendation would be to define a bit more specific goals for each lecture so the students can better understand and focus on key important aspects of the system and relevance in public health.",

    "This course was really fun. I learned a lot of interesting things about the body and how they pertain to current issues in public health.",
    "I would recommend this course for students interested in understanding the human body and its various functions to form a single organism. Everything is cutting edge in the science and certainly, Dr. Yeckel has knowledge of or is participating in research investigating a new discovery in the subject matter!Having a TA is helpful to supplement discussions and provide additional nuances on the science behind topics.Again, students without any biological or physiological knowledge prior to taking the class will definitely have difficulty in accomplishing assignments or at least require more time catered to understanding it.",
    "The course is relevant for students interested in physiology, especially those interested in working in the public health field. The instructor is open-minded and flexible with her approach to the material. Overall, an exemplary public health course.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course! Readings\/materials before lecture were helpful, and weekly paper assignments followed by group discussion made the class very interactive. Lecture organized very well..overall very applicable. Encouraged students to think beyond physiology to public health interventions, and how we can use our knowledge in real-world settings.",
    "This course covers both basic science (physiology) and more global public health approaches to human health. I would recommend it to both classmates who do and do not have a biology background for a unique perspective to public health.",
    "none",
    "",
    "This is not exactly a typical physiology course so if you are looking to get a good grasp of physiology I would not recommend it. It is an interesting class though with the write-ups every week.",
    "See above",
    "Good for people with a little biological background.",
    "Good course with heavy biology as the name suggested. Much work compared to other classes, can be stressful at times."
