   "comments": [
    "A heavily quantitative intermediate economics course masked as an introductory course. Be prepared to read the textbook completely through and study the graphs a lot on your own. If you've taken AP before, you'll be fine. If you want an easier curve and less math, take the lecture version.",
    "Basic Micro--nothing special. Foundation of modern economics, I guess. Worth taking, though Steven Barry's not bad either.",
    "The material is not very well taught, and is especially confusing for students with no background in economics.",
    "The class has a decent workload, make sure you take Tolga and not Katerina.",
    "The course is recommended to an Economics major only; not to a person seeking to explore a field for fun, not to a person who might major in Economics\/EPE and lastly not to a person who's seeking to complete a QR requirement.",
    "I would recommend microecon to somebody who has no previous knowledge of the disciple and wants to get a feel of the subject.",
    "You learn significantly more than the lecture course, which makes it worthwhile in retrospect, but it may not have been worth during the semester. A lot of kids far worse at econ got much higher grades in the lecture, and I don't know yet whether or not the additional knowledge offsets that.",
    "Thisclass is exactly what it says on the tin, but honestly looking back, I can't figure out what I got out of this class that I wouldn't have gotten out of the lecture. The sections were basically lecture-format anyway and Professor Simons didn't seem to like answering our questions very much. The homework is a little tedious and a little long but manageable and the tests stick pretty close to the material assuming a decent amount of studying. I might have had a little bit of a sticky experience because most of the vocal people in the class tended to be libertarians and it was a little off-putting, but I guess that's par for the course in intro econ regardless.",
    "Difficulty of the midterms aren't that hard. but the final sneaks up on you b\/c of all the material crunched together. Teachers are alright- and often quite humorous- but a serious problem is that they tend to either over-complicate or confuse things when teaching. (this cost me quite a bit on the second mid-term)",
    "I would say its a good way to learn micro if you like micro and need it for the econ major requirement. Its probably harder than the lecture but not too unmanagable"
