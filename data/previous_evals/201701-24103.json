   "comments": [
    "It was an incredible interdisciplinary class, and I developed a lot of different skills that would be valuable in biotech - from valuation to discussing challenging questions faced by past companies.",
    "This was a fun seminar class about the drug development and the biotechnology companies. I gained a better understanding of the FDA approval process as well as the economics of medicine.",
    "I learned how to think like a a biotech analyst. I felt like I developed skills to make judgments on biotech companies and drugs that could possibly be released.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the world of biotech companies, and I learned a lot about both the science and business behind the companies we evaluated.",
    "This course is a completely unique opportunity to learn about biotechnology from both a science and business perspective. It is unlike any other course taught at Yale in that it involves multiple disciplines and also has a clear professional application. I learned so much in this course and hope that it will continue to be taught in the future!",
    "The basics of the pharmaceutical business. How to forecast sales for a new drug and value a biotech company. A crucial course for anyone interested in healthcare\/biotech investing and consulting.",
    "I gained a wide breadth of knowledge about pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including how products are made, how they undergo clinical development, how they are filed with the USPTO, FDA, and SEC, and how the economics behind these products work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was very balanced and no one topic got boring because we learned a lot about various aspects of biotech.",
    "Strengths: Very interactive Interesting lecture material and guests Assignments manageable Weaknesses: More support needed for the business side (I would have liked to have seen resources on canvas for doing valuation, for example)",
    "Strengths - interactive activities, the professors' enthusiasm",
    "Great class overall, but I thought at times the science was diluted a little bit. Additionally, I thought professors Raskin and Dash could have done a better job covering the economic side of things, as this was very confusing and made it difficult to write the final paper.",
    "This was truly one of the most fulfilling and interesting courses I have taken at Yale. The material is unique and relevant, and challenges you to evaluate questions from various disciplines and angles. The structure of the course was clear and effective--I enjoyed the assignments, case studies and midterm\/final papers because they forced you to apply what we learned in class\/in readings and think about these topics critically. I am really not sure how this course could be improved!",
    "Very few improvements needed. Loved the guest speakers, thought they brought an interesting and unique perspective to the class. Thought the cases were all very interesting. I even enjoyed doing the midterm and final, which is something that I have never said before in my life. Only thing I will say is that the professors definitely misjudged the amount of work that was needed for the final project and more time to work on it would have been helpful. That being said, considering it was the professors first time teaching a course, I have no qualms there, and I think they did an overwhelmingly fantastic job on everything else.",
    "We did not have many grades in the class (3 reading assignments, 1 midterm paper, and 1 final paper), but it was also unclear what constituted the best responses to the prompts we were given. In particular, we were left hanging during the final paper to write what eventually became a 30 page paper (a 15 single spaced initiation report + data tables and market forecasts). The class is a cross section between science classes and business courses, and the level of analysis expected from us in these two areas for our papers and responses was not clear. It would have helped if we had access to the lecture notes after class, but they were not available either. That said, the class is still great to learn about this material. Having taken it Cr\/D\/Fail, I learned a lot from it and am very glad I took it. The professors are both very fun and well connected\/versed in their fields. We got to analyze case studies from Harvard Business School on how biotech\/pharma companies handle complex problems that may sink their company. We had numerous CEOs of biotech firms come to speak with us in the class, and even had an international phone call with a scientists who invented a drug which made over $2B in sales during its peak years. There are a lot of cool experiences to be had in the class."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended! The professors are very interesting, there are great guests and you learn a ton about business\/medicine. Very accessible to science and non-science majors alike.",
    "This is a fun class if you are interested in medicine, but want a slightly different take. Workload is manageable (readings, a few written assignments, a midterm paper, and a final paper). Make sure to take notes on the financial portion.",
    "Definitely take this! You aren't going to get a course like this anywhere else at Yale. This is especially interesting if you want to see other career fields in healthcare. The professors are so enthusiastic and funny and brought in great speakers, i.e. CEOs of biotech companies, analysts, etc. This was my favorite class at Yale since I'm interested in healthcare. Learning about the business and financial side of medicine was a new and exciting opportunity.",
    "If you can get in to it, absolutely take this class. Professors Raskin and Dash are awesome, super knowledgable, and bring in some unbelievable speakers that really give a lot of insight into biotech. Highly recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students at Yale who are remotely interested in learning about biotechnology. The professors make the material accessible to students from all backgrounds, and it is hard to believe how much I learned in just one semester.",
    "Absolutely, no hesitation. Regardless of whether you're pre-med, pre-business, or just interested in the pharmaceutical space, this class is extremely interesting and informative. I am so glad I got into this class. It was literally my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Yeah do it. Take it cr\/d\/fail to not worry about the class for grades which always seem unclear, or meet with the professors whenever you can to grasp the economic or scientific principles that are not clearly stated during lecture."
