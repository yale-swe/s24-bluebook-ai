    "This was a wonderful introduction to religion and politics. However, I wish the PowerPoints had been distributed online or even in person at each class, as I found myself struggling to type all of the information, which detracted from my ability to really pay attention and follow the lecture.Also, the distribution of grades (30% for the midterm and 70% for the final) put a lot of pressure on students at the end.",
    "pretty good classnot a bad a idea to take",
    "not as interesting as i thought it could be but only one mid term and a final that is 70% of your grade",
    "anti-class attendance",
    "DON'T DO IT. NOT WORTH IT. tests are easy, only 2 tests and that's the ENTIRE course, reading is unnecessary but it's the least engaging course imaginable.",
    "Take this.",
    "So boring. Not even worth taking as a gut.",
    "The Reformation changed a lot of stuff, Islam is different because it's political, the world may become more secular (or not, who knows really), religion influences politics a lot but it depends on where and which religion.That's about all you need to know to get an A.If you know some basic knowledge about religion and politics then you may not need this class. If you want to build that knowledge up, this is a pretty good class but don't expect to learn anything groundbreaking.",
    "Not unless you need to. It's interesting enough, but you don't learn that much more than you do just by following current events, and it's only easy if you actually take detailed notes and pay attention.",
    "Presented many interesting connections between religion and modern political engagements.",
    "Yes, very good for a Credit\/D\/Fail class. Interesting subject and not too hard with only a midterm and final, no papers.",
    "It is a good political science course that discusses the role of religion in policy shaping. I would recommend it as it is interesting and not much work at all, just two tests.",
    "I did not do any of the reading for this course and got an A on the midterm. The final was considerably more difficult (and worth much more)than the midterm, however, so I'm not sure if you would call this a gut class or not. Professor Kahl is not the best lecturer as you will soon discover, but the material is actually quite interesting (not so much during lecture but later on when you read over your notes you'll see what I mean). My advice is to copy the powerpoints word for word and study those for the exams. She does not post the powerpoints online so it's important to come to class. Listening to the professor's additional comments isn't really necessary but what she says can be insightful. The class has an optional discussion section. Don't do it. It's unnecessary and you won't need to do the reading anyway.",
    "Perfect 5th class\/ or C\/D. Easy Midterm and Final but still not completely boring.",
    "Really easy gut - midterm and a final, questions are all covered in the lecture slides. Don't need to do the readings, Professor Kahl covers all the important authors and their arguments. Great 5th class to take.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a class that doesn't require a lot of work. You definitely learn a lot about religion and politics from a comparative point of you. My only complaint is that it was a lecture. I think it would have been much better as a seminar.",
    "Good overview of religion's role in modern western governance.",
    "The course had interesting material, but it was poorly presented. It could have had the potential to be a great class, but the professor was not able to present it in a way that did justice to the subject of religion and politics. Overall, a pretty easy course, interesting points, and a gut.",
    "Yes",
    "Don't take it.",
    "very easy, lots of interesting information, can get boring at times, but definitely worth it",
    "This is a joke of a class.",
    "yes! Take it ! it's great. Interesting material and easy tests! You can't go wrong.",
    "You don't have to do any reading, but get some notes before the mid-term and final.",
    "take it if you're interested in religion&politics in Europe and the US. can get very boring",
    "Definitely..it is interesting and not much work",
    "overview of the role of religion in politics",
    "I would not recommend this course. It was poorly taught and the material was often hard to follow. Professor Kahl and the TA's were also not very receptive to students' questions.",
    "I would recommend this class. Not too difficult-- only two assignments, but you'll like going to class. The material is interesting, and the reading is pretty light.",
    "This is good as a fifth class, but perhaps not one of the main four. Just shop it.",
    "This is an ok class. You will not have to do any of the readings because the professor summarizes them in class. You do have to attend class and pay attention. Although lectures are dry the material is very interesting and relevant to current events so I would recommend the class.",
    "No. It was easy, but really not worth it. Didn't learn all that much. There were some topics that we covered that were self-explanatory, and some topics that were really interesting that we just scratched the surface of.",
    "Interesting material and not too much of it. Probably very easy if you have background in both subjects.",
    "Very easy class with very little work, but it basically all comes down to the final so you have to be careful. The course can be interesting but feels very basic and repetitive much of the time.",
    "Easy. The readings aren't necessary, as long as you attend lecture and take notes and pay attention, you will be fine. Make sure you study a bit before the final though because it is worth MUCH more than the midterm. It is a very easy fifth class, though, and gives relevant (while basic) information about religion and politics that I, as a freshman, did not know previously.",
    "An interesting look into religion, politics, and how the two interact. Recommended for its great professor, light coursework, manageable exams, and general awesomeness.",
    "Yes would recommend it. Lectures are interesting at times, but can get a little boring at other times. Overall though, not too bad and pretty interesting.",
    "I wouldn't. It's a gut class pure and simple. If you're very good at memorizing notes (lots of notes), you'll get an A. If you don't well you'll be at the other end of the curve",
    "Take it if you want a not-too-difficult basic PLSC class. Not to hard to do well but some studying required for the final. Attend lectures at least.",
    "Yes, its not that much work and very straight forward.",
    "yes..its important to know",
    "I loved this class. Many people will tell you it's a gut; I don't know why the exams are made so easily. In any case, even if it weren't a gut, I'd recommend you take it. the subject material was supremely interesting and relevant. Professor Kahl, though sometimes repetitive, puts forth fascinating theories and ideas that she organizes exceedingly well, for easy understanding and studying. Take the class! And pay attention during lecture; you'll get much more out of it. A lot of people zone out, but if you make the effort to pay attention, despite the redundant lows, you'll end up learning a lot.",
    "Interesting lectures, manageable courseload. It's a solid class, but can get a bit repetitive sometimes.",
    "A survey course on religion and politics, centered on the schisms within Christianity.",
    "One midterm, one final -- both of which you can study for the night before. Don't need to do ANY of the readings, as the tests are only based on the lecture.",
    "The overall material was interesting and easy to follow. The class was not a lot of work but you learned a lot about a fascinating topic without having to do a lot of tedious busy-work. The course name would be better served by Christianity and Western Politics as the course focuses almost entirely on this angle of religion and politics.",
    "Good class if you're interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class to another political science major students. If you are taking a regular political science road (not an intensive major), then this is a great way to fulfill the political philosophy fulfillment.",
    "Sure why not. It's not a difficult class, has very little work, and is more interesting than most other easy classes. Watch out for an extremely heavily weighted final (70%) though."
