    "take it if you are interested. don't think about grades too much.",
    "For anyone interested in the history of Islamic Empires up to the 15th century should take this course. There is less focus on Islam as a religion and more on the expansion, culture and tradition of the Islamic dynasties. The grade for the course is based on a midterm exam, a final exam and a 15 page term paper. Prof. Bowering hands out a list of relevant terms and dates for the midterm and final exams which makes it easy to study for the exams. Prof. Bowering has been teaching about Islam for a long time; he has traveled around the Islamic world and has knowledge of Arabic and Urdu languages. In addition to teaching this course, he can be a very useful resource for anyone interested in learning about Islam.",
    "It's overall a solid course. A lot of information, but the exams are not that difficult, the paper is fine if you start it early. The class itself can have an..interesting dynamic...",
    "Yes. It's a great overview of an important but forgotten part of the world. Also it gives a decent beginning to anyone who hasn't studied Islam before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone with an interest in Islamic history- it's essentialthat you have this background if you want to understand the Islamic world. The work load can seem daunting but it is definitely manageable and the exams were not incredibly difficult."
