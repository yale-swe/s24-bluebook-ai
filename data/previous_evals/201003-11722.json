   "comments": [
    "Good class, would have liked to focus more on the EPIDEMIOLOGY instead of just the hard science, but I definitely learned a lot!",
    "I thought the class was very interesting. However, I had not taken immunology previously and this was difficult since most other students had. I felt lost a lot because we moved quickly through the material.",
    "The class was very structured. I liked having the Power Point slides, which corresponded well with the textbook and provided a great means of studying for the material. Furthermore the material was basic, yet detailed enough for our purposes. And although the midterms and finals were earlier than other classes, this allowed us to have speakers towards the end of the class without having to worry about an additional exam during finals week.",
    "Very difficult, moves quickly.",
    "Great class in general. First exam was a bit dumbed down considering that we learned essentially every detail for the first half of the text. We are GRAD students, kick our butts a little.",
    "It was a good class to understand the basic immunology.",
    "The course was great- it provided the basis of immunology and also informed my understanding of how real diseases with an immunological basis affect the body. The course also provided exposure to current immunological hot topics, as well as gave the experience of researching diseases in depth.",
    "strengths: two professors and outside lectureres. good cover of topics.weaknesses: discussion seemed a bit redundant",
    "I came in with a fairly extensive background in immunology so it was a bit dry for me but I think Dr. Krause did a great job of explaining the immune system and supplementing the course with various presenters that explained the immune system in the context of specific diseases.",
    "There is a book's worth of information to plow through in a very limited amount of time for this course. This could be a challenging class for someone with a limited immunology background. The powerpoint presentations get boring very quickly but there really is no other efficient means of teaching the subject matter.",
    "Great!",
    "Strengths - good depth and breadth of material. I like the articles each week.Weaknesses - lecture is just a repeat of reading the chapter, but on speed. I wish Dr. Krause would say less, and hit only the true highlights, and therefore have time to say it slower.",
    "Strengths: small class size; articles used in the instructionWeaknesses: Reading off of the slides; lack of real examples; seemed to cater to those with a previous immuno\/molbio background",
    "Perfect amount of attention spent on a very complex and expansive area of science.",
    "The subject matter is manageable, as is the text even for those with a non-science background.I liked the structure of the course, with the final exam early on in the semester and then specialty lectures following. Some of the specialty lectures were beyond my understanding so I appreciated that all of the material covered in exams was only taught by the professors in the class. It provides for more continuity to have all of the main lectures taught by the professors rather than guest lecturers.",
    "Sometimes the class just feels like a lot of drilling. Plus, the readings for section were often lit reviews, so it was impossible to engage with methodology. I'd prefer to sometimes do more investigative work, where we'd try to intuit something about a pathogen by having parts of the immune response to it described or thinking about possible treatments based on fictional diseases or even designed imaginary superbugs focusing on how they would evade an immune response.",
    "It was an overall informative class, but did not make me think \"outside the box\" of regular immunology."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was excellent. He knows the material and presents it well. The course is well structured. His slides\/notes were useful for studying for his exams. He is a fair grader of exams.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was clearly very knowledgable and conveyed information to the class in a clear manner.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was really accessible and extremely nice. I appreciate the time he took to give us feedback and think about our questions and concerns.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Profess Krause is very knowledgeable in immunology. One of his strengths is his willingness and ability to answer students' questions in the classroom so that we better understand the topic at hand. One weakness is that, while the Power Point presentations are very helpful, many times hemay end up reading directly, and very rapidly, over the slides.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Reads from slides, does not engage class well, but clearly he's brilliant.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is excellent. Stand up guy, great sense of humor, literally and expert in immunology. However, I would like to see the material stretched out a bit more so that Dr. Krause doesn't have to READ the slides to us in what seemed like \"fast forward\" on a tape recorder. We are grad students and we don't need to have slides read to us. I would recommend adding as much anecdotal information as possible to supplement the slides. Specifically, I loved hearing about actual cases Dr. Krause had encountered in his alternative life as a clinician. Finally, like I said before, Dr. Krause has a great sense of humor...don't be afraid to break it out. Loved block island running joke.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0He is very knowledgeable and willing always to meet with you if you have questions. Always available. However, I rather have the professor tell us the information, rather that making us guess, like the other instructor did it. Having a second professor teaching the course and also grading us was not so good for me. I think Dr. Krause's lectures and the outside speakers were great.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was a an amzaing teacher- taught the material in an organized fashion and in a clear manner. He was also very approachable so that students would feel comfortable asking him questions if they needed clarification about anything.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0The instructor's lectures are detailed and easy to follow, but the presentation can be improved by adding more interactive things. Right now, the instructor reads off the slides too much.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is probably one of the nicest people I've ever met. I think it would be good if the slides didn't contain all of the information necessary so we were forced to pay attention and take notes. But, with that, i think Dr. Krause gave fair tests and displayed a great knowledge of immunology and its application clinically.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause does the best that he can to answer questions and provide student with feedback. He is very helpful to students outside of class as well.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great instructor. However, I would have liked for him to tie in more case examples from his practice. But still a very great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Lecture needs to slow waaaaaaaaaaay down. Other than that Dr. Krause is very accessible and a good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is a sensitive, well-organized instructor. I wish that he would have used his PPT slides as reminders rather than as a script.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is an excellent professor. I have no suggestions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause and the other professor who co-taught the class were outstanding at teaching. Professor Krause was also great at being available to students outside of class and answered questions almost immediately. They were always prepared for lecture and knowledgeable about their subject matter. Professor Krause is a kind teacher who really cares about helping his students learn. The only thing I would change would be to ask him to slow down during lecture-he talks fast!",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause is a really nice and helpful professor. However, he reads the lecture slides verbatim, making the lectures incredibly dull. I would honestly recommend finding a different immunology professor because as a teacher, professor Krause was very disappointing even if he is clearly a great researcher and brilliant man."

    "Dan Summers was an excellent TA. He was prompt with emailing the class to clarify any ambiguity.",
    "Dan was great!! Very accessible and went above and beyond what he needed to do!",
    "Dan was responsive and helpful. I thought discussion section was just too much for this class. We read a paper, wrote a paper about it, listened to classmates present on it, and then discussed it--overkill. Maybe fewer sections would be better.",
    "Our TA was also very knowledgeable in immunology and the articles that he selected for discussion in the course. He was also very responsive to questions both in and outside the classroom.",
    "Great TA",
    "Dan did a great job. Not much more to say here.",
    "He was great, and provided great feedback. Thanks!",
    "Dan Summers was a great TA- he was very knowledgeable about immunology and explained concepts clearly. Dan was also very approachable and was very much vested in helping studens understand the material.",
    "Dan is very helpful and engaging. The papers we read for the discussion are pertinent to the current topics of study. However, I feel that the discussion format is too redundant.",
    "Dan Summers was awesome at facilitating discussion, providing timely feedback on papers, and making sure we understood the papers we were reading. He did a really great job.",
    "Dan was excellent. Nothing to improve.",
    "Dan Summers was great. He picked awesome articles for discussion, and was very knowledgeable.",
    "Dan was fantastic.",
    "Dan Summers did an excellent job.",
    "Dan Summers did a great job as a TA in this course. He actually ran a discussion section that was interesting and forced us to be learn more by requiring us to write small assignments on the reading each week. He was prepared for class and provided good feedback on our assignments and questions for exams. He ran review sessions for exams that were very helpful.",
    "The TA was really great and made the discussions really interesting. He knew what questions to ask to get the class discussion going and knew when to mediate the class discussion. Overall, he was a very excellent TA."

    "I would recommend it to students in EMD and any other public health student that wants to better understand the immune system and its responses to foreign agents. In fact, people in every field of public health should have an understanding of the immune system.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is a good basis for a lot of the things you learn in EMD.",
    "An overview of immunology. Very informative but fast-paced. Overall, I am glad I have the background in immunology now.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course provides a basic understanding of immunology that is easy to understand such that the information is better retained even after the course is over. This basic knowledge will be helpful in future classes.",
    "Difficult!",
    "Epitomizes the word lecture. Come to class to listen. Don't try to take notes. Read the chapter before class and you will really respect the clarity of lectures.",
    "It was well organized and the lectures + seminars were good.",
    "Immunology was a course that provided background as to how the human immmune system worked. It covered innate and acquired immunity and exposure to current immunological research. Students should take this course to familiarize themselves with the biological basis for how the body responds to disease.",
    "The class gives a detailed introduction to the field of immunology. Although some memorization is necessary, the classes focuses on understanding of the concepts rather than route learning. I would recommend it.",
    "Its a typical introductory immunology course. I highly recommend it for those interested in immunology. However, for those who have already taken an immunology course and feel comfortable with that, I would advise not to take it.",
    "The first half is all the book (which is very interesting in its self), but then the course really gets interesting with various researchers presenting host responses to different pathogens and current research in that field.",
    "A good, straightforward, immunology course. It's required in EMD but many others may find it interesting.",
    "I would recommend it only if the student had a background in immuno or mol bio.",
    "Great class - perfect for an introduction to, or review of immunology.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone interested in Immunology.",
    "I would recommend a student to take adifferent immunology course if at all possible."
