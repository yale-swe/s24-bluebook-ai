    "I'd recommend it. It's accessible to people with any amount of html experience (our class had grad students that were professional web designers and people who had never coded before). Everyone got something out of it.",

    "Intermediate Design with Laurel was deemed \"Interactive Design\" from the start. It's an awesome class that teaches some skills involved in web design while looking through the lens of an artist. At the end of the day the skills you learn are highly dependent on what you choose to make for your projects, but certain (if not most) projects necessitated\/cultivated knowledge of HTMl and CSS. The best part of this class wasn't the technical skills, however, but learning about how artists are using the web as an artistic platform. Laurel posted a lot of helpful links to artists' work\/websites on our class webpage (the best class page ever). Also each student gave a presentation sometime during the semester on an interactive designer\/artist. I recommend this class, especially if you're interested in how technology online can inform an artistic practice."
