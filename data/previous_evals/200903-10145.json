    "Take it only if you are really interested in Buddhism.",
    "This class was awesome. There is a lot of reading, but most of it is fantastic. Professor Quintman is demanding, but working hard pays big dividends. The class is structured so that he talks for the beginning third to half, then students present on the readings, then there is discussion.",
    "It is an interesting window into one form of Buddhism.",
    "It's a toss-up. If you are dedicated to doing the readings, are very interested in the subject, and want to write a 10-12 page research paper, go for it. I would not recommend this as an introduction to Buddhism, even though it has no prerequisite. The readings focus mostly on Tibetan works.",
    "One looks at Buddhist, specifically Tibetan, culture with a relatively narrow focus on theories of mind and meditation, and you will walk away from the course with a surprisingly deep understanding of Buddhism. A great way to spend a semester in the liberal arts.",
    "Yes! Especially if you have an interest in what Buddhism is (as well as finding the key to happiness!)It is a difficult philosophy, but well worth the effort.",
    "Yes, though make sure you're comfortable with the people in your section. That makes or breaks any small, discussion-focused class, especially when you are likely to have a mix of religious studies, psychology, humanities, history, etc. students who will differently attack and interpret the material.",
    "This was a great class and Professor Quintman is a helpful and understanding professor. Take it if you have any interest in Buddhism. He will even possibly hold independent optional meditation practicums for those interested.",
    "If you are interested in learning about Buddhist traditions at large, and about their meditative techniques in general, take it. But be warned that this is a scholarly endeavor -- we study meditation from an outsider's perspective, bringing to it a scholarly lens.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but with one word of caution: it is REALLY helpful to have had some previous coursework in Religious Studies. You can get a bit lost in the reading otherwise.The volume of reading is pretty huge, but is advertised as so (Quintman is very honest and straightforward--he's not one of those professors out to trick you). The nature of the reading is pretty intense, so when allotting time to do the coursework, don't just plan on getting through the page numbers--plan on taking time to digest and to try to understand what the heck is going on.The course discussions tended to be lively, pretty typically so for a small seminar, with dominant personalities and some quieter people. The atmosphere was always respectful, though, and I think everyone found the discussions beneficial."
