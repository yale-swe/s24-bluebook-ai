    "I was extremely excited going into this course, especially since I really wanted to 1) develop a more nuanced musical understanding that wasnt entirely founded in Western music, and 2) explore the intersection between computer science and music. I've developed the skill to think about music more quantitatively but also better abstract it (as theres a fair deal of randomness involved in the computational aspect). I've come to enjoy SuperCollider as a very robust programming language that can do so many cool things, and I've broadened my scope of programming knowledge.",
    "I learned how to program in the SuperCollider language, and how to think about representing musical and acoustic information in a digital environment.",
    "An introduction to coding through supercollider.",
    "I learned massive amounts about the physics of music, electronic music, and electronic music in today's world. Problem solving\/planning skills were honed as with any comp sci class. Very insightful and interesting material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "My one major qualm of this class is that the way its structured draws the focus to breadth far over depth. I really would've enjoyed additional opportunities to further pursue the topics we'd covered (either with readings \/ additional projects \/ other resources at Yale) during the course of the semester. I think this directly correlates with the pacing of the course - too fast at times that it doesnt feel like I'm fully absorbing the material of the previous lesson. Additionally, I think this class could have benefitted from more seminar style learning. For strengths there are many. Professor Petersen is extremely helpful and knows the material inside and out. If you're having a problem he's willing to do all he can to help you solve it.",
    "I wish the course had been more focused. I feel like I've been left with a very basic knowledge of a wide range of topicsa knowledge which probably could have been acquired with a few days of surfing the internet. I would have liked to focus more on a few major topics and arrive at a less superficial understanding.",
    "9AMs are tough, not gonna lie. And the biggest problem is that since coding is hard to teach in class (it's a no-computer class), you have to essentially teach yourself the material from readings.",
    "The early morning was difficult, maybe more hands on learning like the arduino class.",
    "Strengths: Extremely interesting material, especially towards the end of the semester. Very opened ended projects so the music you create in what you want to hear. Satisfying to have your code work. Weaknesses: The only weakness I can find was the class was very slow at the beginning. It took a while to finally get to music coding, and I understand why, but also I wish we could've started sooner."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course if you're interested in the intersection of computer science and musical interaction. It's a super interesting class that covers a ton of material - you come out of it with a very strong understanding of SuperCollider and its ability to produce computer music.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in computer musical experimentation on their own who would benefit from the added structure and motivation of a classroom. I would not recommend it to someone looking for a demanding computer science course, or someone looking to improve their sense of compositional aesthetics.",
    "No, I would not. This course said it had no prerequisites which was completley false. No basic programming skills were covered.",
    "The class gets into the nitty gritty of coding to make sounds using Supercolllider. After the midterm it got to be more creative application versus the drier how to use the program stuff. Early morning sessions were hard to get through but most of the material was interesting even though supercollider was a lot harder to work with than I'd expected.. The projects and psets will take a bit of time if you've never coded before, but most people in the class hadn't anyways. It was cool to make sounds and a bit of music especially for QR credit. I wouldn't say it's a gut though since it requires some dedication to learning how to use the program then how to apply it.",
    "If you have some programming knowledge, I highly suggest taking this course. It's interesting, pretty easy, and something that i am going to continue as a hobby because it was so fun\/satisfying to code."
