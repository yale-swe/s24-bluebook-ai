    "I had a great experience this semester. Of course, it entirely depends on having a good relationship with your advisor and a project that excites you. I put a lot of time into research this semester, but found it less stressful than coursework since there aren't any deadlines or exams. The papers and presentations are not a burden, so definitely take the credit if you're doing research anyway.",
    "RECOMMEND!!!!!",
    "Independent research under supervision of a professor (and possibly a grad student). You get out what you put in. If you are going to do this, make sure you are interested in the topic of research."
