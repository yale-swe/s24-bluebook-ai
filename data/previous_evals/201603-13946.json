    "None - I learned nothing from this course.",

    "Fantastic course. I learned so much. As an architecture major it serves as an invaluable groundwork to learn about the underling issues at stake with architecture.",
    "Incredible introduction to the intersections of philosophy and architecture. Great overview of the thought of prominent philosophers\/thinkers and the varied ways that the different elements of building\/architecture can be approached. Managed to link theory and practice, looking at philosophy but also how to practically apply these theories to our current way of building, sustainability etc."

    "The lectures were exact replicas of the chapters of the book - and he put them online after class, giving us no incentive to attend lecture. His expectations were very unclear, and I don't think I learned anything about how to think philosophically from this course.",
    "Professor Harries gave clear and interesting arguments in the classes, and helpful advices on the assignments in his office hours.",
    "The class could have done with a discussion section. Oftentimes I felt that there was no place to discuss the readings and the class lectures.",
    "Loved this course! No changes needed it's a great course as is, but might be interesting for the future to see how on the philosophy of architecture could be approached in other world-views\/traditions."

   "comments": [
    "This course won't be offered again. That said, try to take something with Harries before he retires. If you want the intellectual output of this class, read his text The Ethical Function of Architecture, and read his stuff since he published that, as his views on technology and environmentalism have matured.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he is particularly interested in architecture. This course is not the typical analytical philosophy course, but it is a very interesting way of argument and using language to see architecture.",
    "Great course relevant to all not only architects.",
    "Take it! Loved this course, one of my favorites at Yale so far. Prof. Harries is incredible and going to lecture was always such a great experience. A very unique interdisciplinary topic that manages to relate architecture (in theory and practice) to philosophy in the most amazing ways. Don't have to be an architecture or philosophy major to enjoy this, would recommend for everyone."
