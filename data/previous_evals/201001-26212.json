    "Good survey course in nonparametric methods. Fair amount of theory, which was useful. Topics could be tied together more coherently, giving the course an overall flow. Many disjoint topics made the course feel less of a \"complete\" experience.The course should be taught in a better room however. Since Dr. Guan uses the board a lot, a sliding board system would be greatly beneficial.",
    "The course provides a thorough introduction to kernel smoothing with full derivations. This was extremely helpful and will definitely be used as a reference.I would like to see some other nonparametric tests covered in this class beside kernel smoothing. Things such as the wilcoxon rank sum test, paired tests, and other non-parametric tests would of been helpful. This was covered briefly during some student presentations but a more detailed treatment would of been helpful.",
    "The course was really interesting. I enjoyed it. The group project work was a bit difficult because half of our group really didn't do any work (they were either not taking the course for credit or were about to graduate so didn't really have extra time). Two of us really got slammed with the bulk -- and it was a lot of work! Not bad work, just a lot, when it should have been more shared among the group. Prof. Guan is really kind and made the course great -- even despite picking up the slack of my group!",
    "More hands-on examples; talking through how we might approach some of these methods in our own research or jobs; discussing statistical software available that may handle some of the discussed techniques"

    "Instructor: Yongtao Guan \u00a0Very enthusiastic and helpful. Knows the material well. Extremely devoted to making sure his students understand the material, and is willing to repeat explanations multiple times to achieve this goal. Very friendly, and easy to approach. Overall an excellent instructor, with a clear desire to guide and educate his students.",
    "Instructor: Yongtao Guan \u00a0Professor Guan is great and always ready to help. He is more than willing to help when students have questions and takes the time to fully address a question.Also he is extremely prepared for class and provides all his own notes.",
    "Instructor: Yongtao Guan \u00a0Prof. Guan is wonderful. I really like his courses. He makes the material fun.",
    "Instructor: Yongtao Guan \u00a0His explanation was very clear. His lecture notes are really helpful. It might have been better to spend less time reviewing last lectures. Overall, he couldn't do a better job.",
    "Instructor: Yongtao Guan \u00a0Responsive, thorough, organized"

    "An introduction to theoretical nonparametric methodology including such topics as kernel estimation, kernel regression, etc."
