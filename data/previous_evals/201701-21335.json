    "Having only learned dead languages (Latin and Ancient Greek) prior to this course, my speaking skills in foreign languages were not as developed as they could be. After this course I find my instant recall has grown tremendously and my ability to infer meaning and understanding has also improved significantly.",
    "A continuation of basic Korean grammar.",
    "A good follow up to KREN 110... A lot more rigorous language training in terms of grammatical structures, vocabulary, speaking and reading comprehensives.",
    "I learned common grammar patterns and vocabulary in the Korean language"

    "I think the course is overall structured very well. The lessons are very clear, and there are very helpful supplementary materials. That being said, accessing some of the websites (like the DLI Gloss) was very difficult for some of us, so I hope there can either be alternatives to that or those can become class exercises.",
    "This course has a slightly overkill workload with exercises\/homework seeming a little redundant and not always necessary\/helpful. With the amount of homework that was given, I would have expected more material to be covered.",
    "Sometimes Professor Choi says things in Korean that I don't understand."

    "If you want to learn Korean, absolutely. The grammatical structures are taught very clearly, and the professors and TAs are very helpful.",
    "Having read evaluations of this course before enrolling, I thought that Korean 120 would be much more difficult than Korean 110. The teaching style is different, but I found the the workload and difficulty to be very similar to 110. Choi Seonsaengnim is very knowledgeable and a good teacher. She is also flexible and often generous in grading. It's important to come to class and keep up with studying, but I found that if I studied for the daily quizzes, I didn't need to study much more for the exams (which covered two lessons). You'll enjoy Korean 120 and learn a lot.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely... It does make you feel a lot more confident with Korean language, especially if you are planning to study abroad in Korea."
