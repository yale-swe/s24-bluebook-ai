   "comments": [
    "Great class to take if you are looking to improve your command of formal Chinese and be able to discuss matters of economic importance. We explore foreign companies in the Chinese market as well as significant current events. You will get valuable practice reading, writing, and speaking over the semester. Chen Laoshi is wonderful.",
    "I would not recommend 168 to another student in its current form.",
    "I loved that this class was more discussion based than the previous introductory level courses were. The workload is manageable. I will say that the material is challenging, and students come in with varying levels of proficiency which can make it tough at times. However, I feel like this class really challenged me, and I come away having learned a lot about Chinese economics, and now also have the vocabulary to speak about it in Mandarin.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but I have to say that students should have some interest in business and economy to fully enjoy the course. However, I believe that any student wishing to expand his or her language skills will be satisfied with this course, as I learned a lot from it.",
    "A wonderful course that takes you through business models of successful firms in China and worldwide, and that arms you with useful vocabulary about business, economics and enterprise."
