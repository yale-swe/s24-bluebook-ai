    "An ok class -- was much easier than people said it would be. Not fabulously taught, but Andre is decent. I think we couldve moved faster earlier on because the material was much easier and should've covered systems of ODEs and more PDEs. Tests were fair if not too easy -- very much like the homework. Often I personally found the TA sessions way more helpful than lecture. Ananda was the best -- I wish he taught the class!!!!! Other TAs were ok. The only thing that irritated me was that Andre didn't write the tests and problem sets -- he made Ananda do it. Really???!! You are the professor. This often led to disconnect between exams\/hw and lecture to the point that Andre didn't even know what was in the homework at times. Nevertheless, Andre is nice so we shouldnt be so hard on him, and I know he is busy but he needs to spend more time teaching if he wants to continue this class. For example- please do not either randomly cancel lecture or send a random person to teach the class and not tell that person what to cover.",
    "Shockingly similar to the plug-and-chug math in high school. Taking diffeq after more theoretical math and statistics classes was a walk in the park. It got a little confusing at the end with PDE's, but the majority of the course was pretty straightforward. Problem sets took a while not because they took a lot of thought but because there were a lot of problems that took a lot of steps. If you're reasonably good at math and won't put off homework until the night before, this could be a 5th\/6th class. Levchenko was okay; it was his first time teaching, so whatever. Everything you learn in diffeq is online anyway, so the professor doesn't make or break your learning.",
    "I can't say much that hasn't been said. You probably have to take this course, and it's going to suck. However, Levchenko is amazing, and it will suck substantially less with him. You can get away without going to class if you put in the hours outside, but it's not worth it because Levchenko is amazing, and his stories are amazing, and those don't go in the lecture notes, so just suck it up for 14 weeks and go to class.",
    "Prepare to do a lot of practice problems. Differential equations is just something that is not easily intuited.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "This is a good introduction to ODEs and PDEs. I would suggest taking this course,especially if Prof. Levchenko is teaching it. I sometimes lost track of what he was saying in class, but his notes were always concise and explanatory and did a good job of clearing everything up.",
    "This class is as good as any differential equations class can be. The professor was a good lecturer and posted clear notes online. Definitely take this class if you want to learn differential equations or need it for your major. Despite not being enthralled by the material, I certainly learned a lot.",
    "i would not. this is the most difficult class i have ever taken. the exams were exponentially more difficult than other work than we did",
    "Take this class. Overall it was still really helpful and taught me a lot about solving differential equations.",
    "I took this class with Andre Levchenko and would definitely recommend it if he's teaching it. The class moves at a pace that isn't too demanding though it gets more challenging towards the end. Andre always posted helpful lecture notes online.",
    "This is a great course! You think it isn't too hard at first but after the first midterm things get tough. The TA's help a lot though and going to the help sessions really pay off to understand concepts and to finish off psets. The professor posts his notes online so that's nice to work through on your own time. It's a totally doable class that I enjoyed.",
    "A good overview of various techniques to solve differential equations. Psets really aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. This semester, the first midterm was pretty easy, which means you really had to be careful about the little computations, cause that's what separated good grades from bad grades. The second midterm was much harder, but that's mostly because of the proofs. And the final seemed pretty fair, aside from short proofs that sometimes just didn't work out. A very useful subject to know!",
    "I would recommend it, though you probably only take it if you have to.",
    "Routine and mechanical class. Not for anyone who enjoys the theory behind the math. You probably have to take it, so just do it; get it over with as soon as you can. The problems sets are easy, but study hard for the tests.",
    "ENAS 194 covers ordinary and partial differential equations, Laplace transforms, Fourier series, and their applications. Prof. Levchenko does an excellent job explaining how to understand real-world phenomena in terms of differential processes and how the methods you learn were originally developed. Completing mathematics through the level of MATH 120\/ENAS 151 should provide sufficient preparation to do well in this course. I would strongly recommend this course to any other student who enjoys calculus and is looking for a challenge. This class seems to have an unfair reputation among engineers as being painful and impossible, but I actually found it to be a lot of fun. If you go into the course with a positive attitude, attend class regularly, and work hard, you should do well and might even enjoy it. If possible, try to take it with Prof. Levchenko, as I thought he was a superb instructor for this course.",
    "not too bad, pretty easy in beginning of semester but gets kind of confusing later on. not many proofs which is nice. basically no one goes to class.",
    "Take it if you have to, but don't expect it to be fun. Just do what you're supposed to do--read the textbook, don't skip lecture, ask questions--and you'll get through fine.",
    "If you're an engineering major you have to take this class, and really your grade comes down to the professor you get. Its one problem set a week and those are pretty fun actually, but with Andre Levchenko the exams were super tough and thus so was the grading. Overall though I learned a lot about differential equations so I would highly recommend this class to anybody interested in advanced math\/engineering. And it sucks taking this class at 9am.",
    "Great course, learned a lot. Levchenko is hands down one of my favorite professors at Yale -- very approachable and knowledgeable. I had started taking this course with Ahn but actually liked Levchenko's teaching style a lot more. Take it! It's a lot of work but you'll learn a ton."
