   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the course if you're interested to discuss the fundamental ideas\/papers behind big directions in cogsci. Writing the big term paper is also a good way to find what you're interested in and maybe get a head start on your senior thesis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is a really nice experience to spend two hours each week talking about interesting cognitive science topics with students who are actually knowledgeable and interested in what they are talking about. Prof. Guglielmo is an excellent professor and runs a fair, well organized class.",
    "This class is great because it is both broad-based and in-depth. Every class touches on a different area of cognitive science, and everybody in the class is active and knowledgable, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This was a really good class. Professor Guglielmo picked great papers and led an interesting but relatively relaxed and fun seminar every week. The assignments aren't overwhelming, and if you have a genuine (and broad) interest in cognitive science, the readings won't be a chore. Definitely recommended if Professor Guglielmo is teaching again.",
    "I think this is a fun and engaging class for cogsci majors.",
    "A broad overview and discussion of more advanced elements of cognitive science than you'll get in the intro lectures. It's a pretty great class for majors, one of my favorite that I took this past semester. Not an enormous amount of work. Also very useful that it counts as a wild card into your 4-3-2-1 setup for the major. I would suggest taking it to any major--especially if Professor Guglielmo teaches it again next year, as he's awesome.",
    "The Junior Seminar in CogSci was a fantastic class. Some of it might be luck--our seminar was composed of very smart, thoughtful people with very different backgrounds. The readings, though long, are all really interesting and class discussions were always energetic and thought-provoking. Highly recommended; Steve's great too.",
    "Depends on your interests -- if you already have a specific interest, it's not as useful",
    "You cover a lot of topics, some that will interest you, some that won't. I imagine the format of the course is largely dependent on the instructor who's teaching it, so there's not much I can say for future students. You do get to meet some other CogSci majors, though, which can be nice--but it might be worth noting that CogSci majors tend to be a rather opinionated bunch.",
    "This course is completely a luck of the draw thing. It completely depends on the professor and the group of students. I really enjoyed this class with Steve Guglielmo. It was one of the only seminars I've taken that were actually completely discussion based! Finally! Basically, the course meets every week and you discuss a set of papers on a different topic in Cogsci each week. Usually you have about 60 or so pages of reading a week, I think, which isn't that bad if you actually spread it out. It can get heavy if you leave it til the last minute. Due the day before class by 6pm you have to write a 300-500 word response on the papers, really chill as long as you do it. And then each class is led by a different student\/pair where they give a powerpoint that is basically a review of the articles and then quotes from people's responses put up for discussion. All in all, the class is not a lot of work. There is one final 15 page paper that you have to write a full draft of before Thanksgiving so it can be peer reviewed (and you can write a peer review of 2 others) and then the final paper is due during reading week. I would definitely recommend this class for cogsci majors (it's like a wild card in your course plan!) if it's with a good professor--SHOP IT FIRST to be sure. It could end up being an awful pulling teeth kind of waste of time if run unsuccessfully...But I thought it was really successful with Steve and had a lot of fun arguing about cogsci stuff for 2 hours every week. Make sure you ask for a break halfway through class!",
    "The class gives a more in-depth look at a selection of topics in the field of cog sci. The syllabus is decided in conjunction with the class, so you get a good amount of say in what you study. Workload is a reading response each week and a final paper. Your classmates are important -- class discussion was lively most weeks, and I attribute that to the interests and participation of other students. Also just generally nice to meet other students in your major and hear how their interests inform the subject matter. And Steve is genuinely a nice guy!",
    "For any aspiring Cognitive Science thinker, absolutely. You simply must investigate the papers and claims that have guided us to our current understanding of the mind. You most do so in interaction with others who are pursuing similar lines of study and will question your superficial understandings, granting everyone a deeper, new perspective.",
    "Very solid class - provides a great, broad, foundational overview of the field of cognitive science. Only thing to note is that most of the papers were relatively old as these were the key papers that created the specific subfield. We managed to get around it by having some weeks with papers from the recent years to see sort of how cognitive science has progressed since. Class definitely hinges a lot on discussion, so that depends on how your cohort is. Workload was very manageable, with only a weekly 500 reading response, culminating in a final paper that includes peer reviews and a final presentation. You also need to lead a discussion section (which also means all sections are lead by students with the prof occasionally jumping in - worked out half the time as some sections dragged on too much). Peer reviews definitely helped ensure you wrote the paper earlier and had more feedback to create a stronger paper. Prof was very approachable and willing to shape the class to the students' wishes.",
    "This was an excellent survey course of the foundational works in the various fields of Cog Sci. In short, exactly what was advertised, delivered in an interesting classroom setting full of discussion and group analysis and critiques of the readings. Especially considering the fact that this course can fit anywhere in your 4-3-2-1 plan in the major, this is a course I would highly recommend to any Cog Sci major. If you're not in the major, but are still interested, I would likely still recommend it. However, interest in the various areas of Cog Sci is a must, given how self-directed and reading-focused the course is."
