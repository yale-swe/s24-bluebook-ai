   "comments": [
    "Great exposure to different topics, but very few were specifically SBS talks.",
    "they should separate it from the SBS and have two individual seminars because many of the SBS presentations were noninformative and irrelevant.",
    "It's very helpful to have a seminar and hear about a broad range of research going on at YSPH. It would have been great if the seminar started at 11:30 since all 1st years had epi until 11:20 - especially since food was served during the second semester. I frequently had to leave a bit early to attend a 1:00 class on the main campus.",
    "Interesting, but not always applicable or useful.",
    "I did not feel that the choice of speakers was relevant to my interests. I think that perhaps SBS students should be able to choose any division seminar to attend for the semester rather than being forced to attend the CDE seminar. I would have been more interested in being a part of the EMD or policy seminars.I also would have liked to have heard more speakers that are practicing public health or implementing various types of programs, as opposed to only having speakers that are career academics and researchers. I feel that this presents a narrow view of the types of work going on in the field of public health.",
    "I appreciate the addition of food to the seminar. This semester had a larger variation in speakers which was nice. It would be great if we could have a seminar that was every week but switched between CDE and SBS and we were only required to go to whichever division we were in but strongly recommended to go to all of the seminars.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar series this past semester for CDE\/SBS. The lectures covered a wide range of topics, and I found all of the lectures to be interesting!",
    "Lecturers are well prepared.",
    "Informative.",
    "My assessment of this course is neutral. Most of the lectures were not directly pertinent to my interests.",
    "Great exposure to ongoing research at Yale",
    "They had good speakers. I enjoyed the food as well, it helped with paying attention.",
    "The course was nice to receive info on what other individuals were studying pertaining to SBS\/CDE.",
    "I wish the seminar was more geared to SBS instead of being a combination of SBS\/CDE. I do like that we had a good variety of speakers, but I wish that it wasn't all research that was being presented I wish people presented more interventions.",
    "I would really like to see a seminar for just SBS students.",
    "The class was a great way to gain insight into the research happening within the department.",
    "It was helpful and informative to have professionals speak about their research areas and interests. I appreciate the opportunity to get an idea of what instructors and public health professionals affiliated with Yale actually do.",
    "I wish it weren't required. Few of the lectures were on SBS-relevant topics.",
    "I enjoyed the speakers this semester. They covered a good variety of fascinating topics.",
    "Great exposure to the research being done at YSPH and the faculty. Could be interesting to have guest speakers from outside of YSPH as well. Also would appreciate it if speakers could talk about how they came about to do the research that they do (their education, career choices, why they are interested in X, etc.)."
