   "comments": [
    "First of all, this course gave me a first rate movie education - I now have seen many classics and consider myself somewhat cultured. But this class also taught me how to think about movies - to step back while watching and consider what is working about the movie and what isn't. I find that it has now changed the way I watch anything for the better, which is really cool.",
    "This class is a wonderful overview of the detective\/mobster\/spy genre. We watched and read all of the classic films in these genres. We also learned how to critically evaluate a film on a variety of components, such as the score, cinematography, as well as the acting and directing.",
    "This course definitely improved the clarity and style of my writing. It gave me an entirely new lens through which to analyze film. As an Applied Math and Econ major, this was definitely a different perspective and provided me with necessary analytical skills I would not get from my major.",
    "This class is a lot of fun, and is a great way to engage with material in a low-pressure way, but it also increased my cultural vocabulary exponentially. I read books and watched films that are iconic to American culture and have a renewed understanding of pop culture today as a result. I understand the progression of filmmaking and narrative in a historical context, and can look back upon works with which I thought I was familiar before with a completely new viewpoint (not to mention I understand WAY more references).",
    "This class was wonderful and engaging. You learn a lot about what characteristics make a hero in film and literature in so many different types of genres. You also look at the evolution of different genres over the years (Sherlock Holmes, Film Noir, Superhero, Gangster, James Bond, Spy, etc.)",
    "Best class ever!! Great opportunities for creative writing. Really expanded my knowledge of literature, character development, narrative, and journalism",
    "I gained extensive knowledge about the history of film in America along with its influences and evolution over time. Along with this background I developed my analytical eye for film as well as my ability to write about themes in film and literature. We extensively discussed characters in many significant masterpieces that are important for everyone to see.",
    "I greatly improved my film study and analysis, research, and writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's strength is the course itself - its interesting, engaging, and enjoyable, so any and every student should like this class. It's weakness is the amount of reading\/viewing assigned per week, which is sometimes too much, forcing students to pick and choose which movies to watch because they simply cannot watch and read all of them.",
    "This course was great in that it involved student discussion while also providing some degree of lecture-based instruction that served as a good starting point for the discussion. I really liked that the class was structured that all the reading\/viewing was done for homework to allow us time to just discuss in class, and I honestly don't know what else could be done to significantly improve the course because it was very well structured already.",
    "My one \"criticism\" of this course is that sometimes the workload was unmanageable. Every week the reading and viewings were incredibly interesting, however there were some weeks when it could not all be completed. While I'm hesitant to say the amount of out of class viewing should be reduced, because every film was integral to our discussions, it was sometimes difficult to complete.",
    "I loved this class and it was definitely a highlight of my Yale experience. That being said, there is a lot to improve. My biggest criticism is that we sacrifice depth by trying to do too much. We are assigned to read books and watch films, which might take 10 hours and then we skip over some of the assignment in discussion. Some films we talk about for no more than 30 seconds. The seminar would be even better if we could do close analyses of a few movies rather than trying to cover an entire spectrum of movies. Furthermore, for assignments, the professor should specify which one's have top priority that we will need to see for discussions. A lot of students only have so much time in the week and to finish every assignment for this class would take upwards of 20 hours each week, including all the film viewing and reading.",
    "The class is a lot of fun and I don't think its structure should be messed with too much. At some points, the sheer number of hours that students are required to sink into coursework each week is staggering because there is no good way to \"skim\" a motion picture. But the class is well-designed and comprehensive, and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is always a plus.",
    "Strengths: taught in an engaging way. Taylored to different kinds of learning styles (watch videos, listen to interviews\/music, reading, discussion) Weaknesses: discussion felt a bit limited at times and the class felt more like a lecture than a seminar",
    "This class was amazing - there is a lot of material and I only wish I had more time to spend on it outside of class. keep teaching this course!!! there is nothing like it at Yale",
    "The strengths of this course are the material and the assignments. The films we viewed for this class and the books we read were engaging and mostly culturally significant. We were excited to do the work for this reason and came to class with a lot to say about the material. Also, the weekly responses were a low pressure way to be sure we had given some thought to the week's viewing and reading. The papers required for the class are fun to write because we essentially have free reign to choose a relevant topic for each. I left this course having given a lot of thought to exciting movies and coming to new understandings about them. The class could potentially benefit from some further organization. PowerPoints could at times be hard to follow with more words on the screen than necessary. I think streamlining this portion of the class could be helpful for taking away key information and themes. However, Professor Friedfeld is endlessly helpful and always willing to continue class discussion and assist in developing writing for papers. His assignment timeline over the course of the semester is also very thoughtful and lends itself to less anxiety and better work.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I wouldn't change anything about it!"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student - if you like watching awesome movies and talking about them then take this course. Also, if for some reason you have been living under a rock and haven't seen many of the classics which are a part of this course, it's time to come out from under that rock and educate yourself. Also Eddy Friedfeld is great.",
    "Amazing would be my one-word description of this class. I'm a STEM major and was just looking for any kind of writing credit when I stumbled across this gem. There's a 5-7, 2-3, and 12-15 page paper, but the topics are super flexible (and fun) and Eddy does an excellent job of working with your schedule and making things due when other classes aren't as busy. Yes, it's a residential college seminar, but don't let that get you down--if you don't get in the first time, definitely email him right away to get a good spot on the waiting list and you'll be very likely to get in. There is a fair amount of reading\/viewing per week, probably 2-3 movies and 1-2 books, but it's all very enjoyable, and you can sometimes even multitask by asking a friend to hang out if they want to watch a movie over the weekend because they're actually that fun--it's a win-win situation for everyone! Eddy is hilarious, and the discussions are great since everyone does most of the homework before class, and he also shows some clips throughout to make the class more interesting and boost discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in film or these genres. It was a wonderful introduction to these subjects and Professor Friedfeld was a wonderful instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It is a great change of pace and I loved all the films that I saw.",
    "Absolutely without a doubt take this course. The profesor is truly special. He makes the classes so much fun. We watch movies and discuss them. Make sure you take this course. This is a must-take course at Yale.",
    "This is a fun addition to any schedule, and will increase your cultural capital simply because you watch\/read SO MUCH that you probably have pretended to have seen or understand, but you haven't gotten around to it. I'd take this if you are a student who has been missing out on film\/literature in your schedule.",
    "Take this class!! I've never had a professor more invested in his students than Eddy. It's a fun class where you get to watch fun movies you'd probably watch on your own or you've already seen. Same goes for the readings. If Batman, Sherlock Holmes, The Godfather, to name a few, are of interest to you, then you absolutely should check this class out!",
    "Absolutely would recommend! This class is SUPER special and you'll never have another chance to engage with so much fabulous material on not only an intellectual level but also an emotional one. Eddy is a fabulous teacher and person, and he constantly encourages you to be creative and speak your mind. I've never had so much fun going to class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you're looking for a fifth class that you will look forward to attending and that won't give you too much stress. Professor Friedfeld is really knowledgable and he is a great resource to take advantage of when he is at Yale. Your writing will improve and you will watch some great films.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!"
