    "You will learn a new medium - the beauty of metalwork. Take this class if you want to turn hunks of metal into a meaningful sculpture. Brent is amazing, and you'll get so much out of this class if you put the time in.",
    "Yes, take the course. The instructor is very helpful and you are free to what what ever you want to do so it's up to you to get what you want out of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Art 120 to any student interested in sculpture. I'm definitely glad that I learned the basic techniques of metal sculpture.",
    "Take it. Amazing class, but you get out what you put in. And take it with Brent if you can hes such a fun teacher.",
    "Yes.",
    "I totally recommend this class. It's amazing.",
    "This is a fun, interesting and exciting Sculpture class, and Brent Howard makes it even better. Metal is a great medium to work with and Brent pushes you to do your best."
