    "It's a simple class and it knows what it is. If you just want to go at night and learn the very basics of accounting and finance, it's perfect.",
    "Good content but too many materials to cover within a short span of time (6 weeks).",
    "Q12: The course is very valuable especially for students who has considerations for Renewable Project Finance Course or Forest Finance as it equips one with the basic concepts of finance.",
    "This class was the worst class I have ever taken at FES. It went far too quickly, the TA's were NOT helpful and the instructor was one of the least engaging educators I have ever experienced. The homework assignments made no sense and trying to seek out help from the TA's was next to impossible. They changed their offie hours every week and then when you would go see them they would say \"well she explained this in the lecture.\" The professor didn't seem to be involved in the grading process and didn't seem to understand that ALOT of people were very confused.",
    "This course is way too much work for a single credit, and the two hour lectures are not conducive to effective teaching\/learning. Given the apparent interests of most of the students in the class (which fall more on the corporate \/ management side) and timing needs, iit should be offered as 1.5 credits for an hour and twenty minutes every other day (like a regular class), and fall neatly into the business school's quarter schedule, so that we can balance it out with a second class at SOM.",
    "The course content is very important to my field; however, I am not walking away with a greater understanding of the material. If anything, I am more confused.",
    "The course provided a good foundation in understanding financial vocabulary. It was hard to get passionate about the topic, but it got the job done and provided some complementary information to other courses I was taking.",
    "The class was very fast-paced and the Professor sped through the concepts, so it is hard to retain much information from the class. However, Professor Burke did a great job of preparing the lectures, reading notes etc. so students had access to helpful material. I think the timing of the class was challenging since it was scheduled in the second half of the semester, which is a busy time of the year and it was hard to make the most of the class.",
    "Question 12: This class is so crucial for students without a finance or quantitative background that it needs to be taught by a good professor. Perhaps the guy that teaches renewable energy project finance.",
    "The lecturer is efficient in delivering the materials. I appreciate how she took the time to learn all our names considering how short but big the class is. The TA's were helpful and easily available.",
    "As previous student reviews noted, this course is *way* to fast paced and covers way too much material in too little time. Maureen is good at explaining financial concepts and I think the course would be useful for students without a financial background who then want to take a more advanced course. But for those really looking for financial notions for environmental practitioners I am not sure all the material cover is appropriate."

    "Great basic financial framework for people new to the subject and a perfect refresher for people like me who's financial skills are a bit rusty. I found the lecturer's method to be effective: repetition, use of same case, homework",

    "Update the slides, dont try and get into the nitty gritty details when the overall topic isnt understood. some people have never learned these things before and this should teach the basics, not abstract pieces.",
    "Pace, make it at least a half-semester.",
    "Pace should be slower\/ should be turned into a full semester(3 credit) course. If kept for 1 credit, it will be more useful if it started earlier in the semester instead of in the middle of the semester.",
    "There is a lot to be covered in a little time.",
    "This should really be a semester long course or the amount of content covered needs to be reduced. I would also suggest more examples be used in class so students could contextualize the assignments. Also, this course focuses exclusively on how for profit financial modeling and doesn't address non profit organizations at all.",
    "Slow down explanations .. Perhaps cover fewer topics and do a bit of a deeper dive to ensure comprehension of non-finance background students",
    "Pacing. The class goes far too quickly to absorb anything, which leaves students struggling to figure out how to just get the answers to the assignments right rather than actually learning how to answer the questions.",
    "We cover way too much content with no depth of understanding. The professor does not pace class time so that we finish all material in an equally timed pace. We always rush\/skip material in the last ten minutes of class.",
    "The course could have benefited from tie-ins to more real-world examples in addition to the Microsoft, Apple, Amazon ones.",
    "To make the most out of this, it needs to be made into a full semester course.",
    "It would be useful to have the class start earlier in the semester and for Professor Burke to slow down in her explanation of the material.",
    "Teaching style. Updated powerpoints. More support on excel for students with little experience on excel",
    "More like a caveat for interested students, you need to apply yourself to fully reap the benefits of the course. It is a short and swift blow. Be ready to spend time to dive into the material out of class.",
    "The pace is way too fast.",
    "I was taking Renewable Energy Project Finance so I had exposure to some finance but still find this class to be too fast. It doesn't help that it's in the second half of the semester when we are so busy with other classes and cannot put much time into this. I'd propose moving this class to the first half of the semester. I would also recommend that the instructor gives students additional resources (textbook, website, online courses, etc., beyond the PDF notes that Maureen gives us) so that we can go and learn more on our own if we need more financial analysis skills."

    "Somewhat.",
    "Yes, for me personally it was what I needed to refresh my practical knowledge of financial concepts. Some of the others struggled more as it was completely new, but I think at the very least the course offers basic financial literacy or language that is necessary for any environmental manager.",
    "yes. I did not come in with high expectations as I knew that based on the previous student reviews and my heavy workload with other classes that I would not be able to get much out of the class, in part because of my schedule, but the fact that it was way too fast paced also contributed to me at times feeling a bit lost.",
    "Yes, given I was warned that the class goes really fast and it's impossible to teach finance\/accounting in a one-credit class. I got some exposure but feel that I still need another course to really understand the foundation of finance & accounting."

    "It offers an effective way of learning basic financial concepts. You'll have to take other courses for more detailed\/in depth examples and explanations. For instance, taking Renewable Energy Project Finance concurrently will provide you more experience with calculating NPV and IRR in a practical sense, while this course offers more explanation of using the tools in broader assessment of financial metrics.",

Work through problem sets yourself first before asking TA's or classmates to help. Take this course, it's an important primer. Environmental managers need to be more financially savvy!",
