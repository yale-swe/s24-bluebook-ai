    "I learned to speak more clearly and with more confidence about my work; Lisa and Jo were very encouraging in pushing us to present ourselves confidently and with our best foot forward.",
    "I learned a lot from my teacher, TA, and more importantly, from my peers.",
    "It helped me to work on my project consistently throughout the semester and feel more comradery with the other people in the major.",
    "I learned to draft a project proposal and carry it out, adapting along the way as problems and changes arose. Learned to make independent, self-motivated work on a schedule I created and take initiative to reach out for feedback. Worked on presentation skills in front of an audience.",
    "This course was more a discussion course than one directed towards senior thesis research. I feel the class did not adequately prepare students for the type of critique the would receive at the end of the year rather than presentations once a semester I feel weekly workshops on addressing how each student's project enters into dialogue with \"Art\" would have been much more helpful.",
    "Great opportunity to do independent work."

   "comments": [
    "I wish we all did our presentations a bit earlier in the semester so people had more time between presentations and thesis install to incorporate feedback. I really loved the workshops, particularly the one where we learned basic tools like making a website and how to shoot our work and such; those skills aren't taught in classes otherwise, and I learned a lot that day.",
    "It's great seeing everybody's work, so I like meeting every week, though I wish there was maybe more time for people who already presented or don't present till later to ask general advice from people that's more structured than having to seek them out outside of class.",
    "It's interesting seeing other students' presentations but I kind of wish we learned more \/ did other things as well.",
    "The class provided sufficient time for students to exchange ideas and great opportunities to learn about life after Yale.",
    "I think the guest speakers were wonderful and extremely helpful, but I only wish I would have experienced them earlier in my Yale career. I think talking about building a website and portfolio would have been really helpful and impactful to learn as a sophomore.",
    "I think that the workshops regarding life after yale and artist statements could have taken place in the first semester to allow more time for presentations and feedback earlier in second semester.",
    "I believe the art major is restrictive, in some cases, in what it describes as \"Art.\" Given our work is evaluated based on the institution's standards for \"Art\" clearly defining this term (\"Art\") as early as possible would have been extremely helpful.",
    "The final critique is extremely subjective. I didn't know any of the panelists except for the DUS who I was sure did not think much of my project. The fact is I was proud of the level of thought and attention to detail I had given to my thesis which had changed drastically over the course of the year. Unfortunately, I misrepresented the aim of my thesis which no doubt affected the outcome. The department should make a short write up of your thesis mandatory for the final decision. It was only after writing about my pieces in detail for an art contest application that i understood my thoughts, goals, and lessons learned during the creation process. If art majors would be allowed a final paper anywhere from 1-5 pages, I think they could 1. present their thesis successfully to the panel and 2. The panel would know more about the artist and their entire journey up to this point. I feel as though the efforts of my entire fall semester were cast aside. Maybe even having a paper for each semester to document the growth in ideas, techniques and focus in one's artistic endeavors.",
    "I wish there had been more accountability for students"
