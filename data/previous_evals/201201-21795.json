    "The class is actually a semiconductors course with some PV applications in mind.The homework and midterms can be overly time consuming at times (like, using excel to extrapolate between points. not actual knowledge gain, but grunt work)The HW's are well thought out in that there is a clear message underlying the problem set, and it is nice to see the mathematics support the theory claims.However, it's slightly disorganized. But Lee really cares about teaching so he's good.",
    "if you like solar, then take it. otherwise, take something else. Larry is a good guy but there isn't a textbook so sometimes you have to rely on grad students for help...",
    "Decent class.",
    "\"Photovoltaic Energy\" covers the fundamentals of solar cell operation in a modern context. Through the study of semiconductors in the dark and their interaction with light, it explains what happens between the electrical contacts of a solar panel, why power can be produced and what the practical and fundamental limitations are.This is a very interesting class. It is great to understand the performance and the performance limitations of different photovoltaic technologies (materials, configuration, ...). Students should be comfortable with physics and materials science, otherwise the course might be too challenging to benefit from it. I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in what's under the hood of solar energy conversion and have some technical background."
