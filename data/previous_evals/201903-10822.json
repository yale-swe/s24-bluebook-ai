   "comments": [
    "The course covers a very large range of content, and I came away from the course with knowledge about the general processes and differences in most of the major organ systems across several different taxa (especially among tetrapods).",
    "I gained an in-depth understanding of physiological processes in humans as well as many other forms of life. This helped me understand significant features of the human body as well as why certain systems and processes are favored evolutionarily.",
    "A detailed look into the differences and similarities among the systems used by organisms we share the world with in order to sustain life. I saw the genius behind the designs and mechanisms perfected over millennia that have mesmerized me as a child while zoos and aquariums.",
    "Comparative Animal Physiology was an in-depth survey of animal organ systems, and how they evolved and operate using different biochemical pathways in different animal orders and families. I enjoyed the ability to learn about the structural morphology and chemical components that make metabolism possible, and it is highly applicable to human health.",
    "I obtained a general knowledge of many physiological systems and their mechanisms, as well as a comparative knowledge of these . systems across many animal phyla",
    "I learned how to think critically about physiological processes, create professional posters, and actually study for physiology!",
    "A great complement to small scale, more molecularity focused classes like biochem. Big, pattern-oriented classes about major physiological capabilities, mostly in animals.",
    "I learned firstly the definition of physiology, and then the different physiological mechanisms of the body in different organisms and how they relate",
    "I developed an understanding of physiology from a holistic, comparative perspective. I also learned of the importance of such a perspective in understanding human physiology and how these evolutionary approaches can be important for the biological sciences.",
    "Physiology of various body systems across different groups of animals."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the greatest strength of the course is that the material is really interesting and was very clearly taught. The greatest weakness of the course is that it is so large in scope (multiple major organ systems across many very different species) that it is difficult to develop an in-depth understanding of any of the various topics covered. There was so much to read in the textbook that it was often difficult to absorb any of the information.",
    "Strengths are the excellent professor Zack, TA Jasmine, and variety of engaging guest lecturers. The in-class assessments were another strength, as it kept me responsible for being engaged and involved in the material each week. This class has been one of my favorites during my time at Yale, and there are very few weaknesses that I saw. My only suggestion for improvement is for the infographic assignments to be focused on particular choices of topics and processes, as it was daunting to figure out what to make mine about considering all the possible options.",
    "The strength was the instructor and his ability to explain concepts and have the perfect personality for teaching. I think its impossible not to like him as a teacher.",
    "The strength of the course is how engaged we were with the material. We had daily quick quizzes which we could collaborate on in small groups, responding to our textbook readings. It was a lot of material and that constant engagement really accelerated learning and made the in-class lecture slides more meaningful. I also really appreciated the guest lectures that Professor Lewis was able to bring to the course. If the course could be changed in anyway, I would break up the textbook readings of some of the largest chapters over multiple sessions if possible, such as the nervous system, muscle structures, and thermophysiology.",
    "The lectures are all pretty well done, and I enjoyed having guest lectures every once in a while. I wasn't a big fan of the in class assessments every class period, which were on the material that was taught that day, which I found made attending lecture superfluous and created quite a bit of reading throughout the week.",
    "The strengths was the weekly quizzes, the lecture style, how approachable the professor and the TA were, the projects, the grade breakdown, and always available help! I cannot think of any weaknesses. Although that weekly quizzes could be stressful during midterm weeks, they helped me with keeping up with the materials.",
    "Having a quiz every class was a lot, more projects would have been beneficial.",
    "The material taught in the lectures was extremely interesting and Dr. Lewis was an exceptional lecturer. However, I think that reducing the amount of reading to just what is relevant would be useful, as sometimes the reading was incredibly long and then the lectures were only focused on a much smaller part. This, combined with the fact that this additional material never even came back for test preparation, made it hard to understand the purpose behind doing the readings. The guest lectures are always incredible!",
    "Strength- course is taught like a broad survey of the various physiological systems and their variations within the animal kingdom. Solid teaching, and good classroom environment. Weakness- not too much time to go into more depth with each system, at times the class felt very rushed."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, the material is fascinating and the small class size allows for more productive conversation and engagement with the lectures and the professor. I am grateful for this as it allowed me to ask more questions and achieve a clear understanding of the material while also building relationships with the professor and TA.",
    "Obviously the subject matter restricts those who aren't already used to basic biology and zoology concepts, but to those who love comparative takes on organismal life, it is a perfect course.",
    "Yes, this is a good course for anyone interested in human and animal health, and is highly compatible for many applications in different health fields.",
    "Not sure how this compares to the other physiology class for non EEB majors. But you definitely learn a lot if you put the time in, so I would recommend if you are just looking for a class to learn a lot about physiology of humans and animals.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It is a great course if you want to learn to study physiology in a non-stressful class. It is also very interesting because you learn about physiological systems in different animals and see why we have our physiological systems set up the way that they are.",
    "Yes I would but the tests are very difficult, so studying and office hours should be taken advantage of when possible.",
    "This is a great core E&EB course! If it is not a requirement, there are probably better classes to take. If it is, then do not feel like it's just going to be one of those courses you just force yourself to take. The guest lectures are almost always incredible, I might honestly just take it for them.",
    "Only if they need it for their major. It was a good experience, but nothing to write home about."
