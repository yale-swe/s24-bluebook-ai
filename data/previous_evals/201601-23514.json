    "I loved this class! It has been one of my favorite classes at YSPH! The class provides a great overview into the techniques of qualitative research. After taking the course, I feel well prepared to use qualitative techniques and conduct my own research.",
    "Strengths: HIDDEN GEM of SBS. The course is so useful for learning a new way to work with participants and get useful information about HOW outcomes happen in the lives of real people. Weaknesses: Literally none. Its an amazing course.",
    "One of the best classes at YSPH - teaches you how to do qualitative research in an engaging way where you have a final project that is thoughtful and publishable",
    "excellent course. covered material very well, and in a hands-on matter. learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely LOVED this course! My favorite course of the whole spring semester by far, and definitely the one I dedicated the most brain power and energy towards. Completely relevant topic, must be kept and more students should take this course. A great methods course that is both systematic and critical, and was really helpful in internship search to have knowledge around as a skill. Wonderful professor and teaching fellow, great experiences in doing group work on a semester-long project that I feel like I really valued and learned a lot from.",
    "The content in this course was very thorough and the assignments were very practical and provided an opportunity to apply the skills learnt in class.",
    "THIS COURSE IS WHERE ITS AT. Probably the most useful course I have taken at Yale.",
    "danya makes this class incredible - also our ability to work on something we are all individually passionate about",
    "Wonderful and practical class",
    "I learned so much in this class and feel like I am already able to utilize some of the concepts in my work. The group project was the best way to integrate the skills we were learning.",
    "Great course!",
    "Great course!! very useful skills, interactive and very well taught",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE IT! At least everyone in SBS, it dispels so many myths about qualitative data and provides a whole side of research skills that the rest of YSPH curriculum fails to elucidate."

    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya Keene is a wonderful professor! She provides thoughtful feedback and insight to help her students best understand the material. She works to facilitate student learning and conveys her passion for qualitative research in the course.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Dr. Keene is amazing. She realy likes what she does and is enthusiastic abut sharing it with us. She was always accessible when we needed help, and really structured the class well so that we have tangible skills coming out. I am writing a Qual thesis and doing an Qual internship this summer because of her.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Excellent instructor that provides thoughtful feedback",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0she's excellent! always provided great instruction and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0DANYA KEENE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL PROFESSOR. She does a great job of creating a warm class environment which is both safe to have challenging discourse, and also fun. Even though class was on a Friday afternoon, I would always make every one because I was interested in the topic and loved this course so much. The way that the course was formatted, readings\/lecture\/group work and other activity time, was an excellent format for a course especially this one. Danya has a great lecture style and introduces excellent reads and other materials and lectures to engage with that are tied to our coursework but also expand our minds in different ways as public health practitioners. I think Danya is the first professor that I have had in my time here that incorporations advocacy, and social justice as an element in her work - a key point that is vital to our place in public health academia that is not touched by other courses or professors. I only have great things to say about Danya and the way this course is. It is a lot of work, but totally worth it and the most valuable course that I personally have felt that I have taken at YSPH so far when applicable to the real world.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Dr. Keene's experience and knowledge of qualitative research provided a very valuable perspective for learning this research methodology.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is a queen.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is incredible. So approachable and understanding. She is a clear and extremely helpful educator.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Wonderful professor; engaging, inspiring, and knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya did an amazing job breaking down complicated topics. I love the way that she facilitates class discussion and takes students' interests seriously. I also really appreciated her commitment to providing fairly detailed feedback on all assignments, even when there were so many people in the class.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is an incredible instructor. The only weakness she has is gaining control of her classroom. The students were so disrespectful during class and interrupted her constantly which interfered with the flow of class, her teaching style, and the learning of fellow students. If she could gain more control of the students, she would have more time to completely deliver her well thought out class.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is such a great instructor!! She is very well versed with the methods and a wonderful teacher. She is also a great guide during the group project.One of my favorite classes so far",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Beyond excellent. True passion for what she does, treats students with respect, adds rigor to the qualitative field-- great structure of the course and appropriate workload each week-- projects build on each other, very intuitive"
