    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT! Best history class at yale - the class you literally have been looking for",
    "An easier class with 3 short papers and a take home. The papers are on interesting and unusual topics, but they were fun yet a little difficult to write. The reading was interesting and easy.",
    "Great! Take it! Especially if you want to sample what the history department is like with relatively low commitment.",
    "Take this class if the topic sounds interesting to you. The lectures are good and there is not that much reading. Also covers a lot of social history that you might not get in other classes.",
    "Yes, it is one of the best history courses I have taken, and the work load is not too bad also.",
    "It was a very interesting class -a multi-faceted look at women's experience. the professor is engaging, and the small class size allows the lecture to be less impersonal. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Women in America from the colonial period to 1900 is a great history class. The topics are clear and easy to follow, the workload is manageable (3 papers and a take-home final), and it's an interesting subject."
