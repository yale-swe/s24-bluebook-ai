   "comments": [
    "Everyone should take this class. The content is so relevant to everyday life and the workload is not bad. Weekly thought questions (think reading response). A final paper and final project.",
    "A must-take if you can get in.",
    "I think PSYC 330 would be better as a smaller class, but covers some interesting material. You get out of it what you put into it, so it's easy to fall behind and not feel that it's very rewarding, but if you keep up with reading you probably won't have that issue.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I learned a great deal about the justice system, including a lot that was not intuitive or that I had never encountered before (and I've taken many law classes). The work is not overwhelming; we have weekly responses but no midterms or anything like that. Aside from the weekly responses, there's just one five-page paper and a take-home final. The take-home final was five four-page essays, so it was extremely time-consuming. Do be aware of what it will do to your reading\/finals period if you take this course and the assignments stay the same, but it was an interesting class with an engaging instructor and I would recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you get the chance--it is really interesting and engaging! Lectures flew by because the topics were incredibly thought-provoking and cohesive. The workload was reasonable, although the final project is quite time-consuming.",
    "Would definitely recommend! As a non-psych major I would also add that it is fairly accessible to those who haven't taken many psychology classes prior to PSYC 330",
    "FUN! Would recommend if you're interested in the two disciplines. Not too much work, except the final paper and final project make the end of the semester a bit rough. Worth it though!",
    "Good course, just be wary of the workload. I made some suggestions on how to reduce the workload and if the workload becomes more manageable, then DEFINITELY take this course. Overall great course, just a bit too much work in my opinion...",
    "I would recommend Psychology and the Law to students. Although this is a capped course and Professor Lockhart usually only admits seniors and junior psychology majors, this course is lecture-style, not seminar-style. Psychology and the Law is a good course that covers the basics of the criminal justice system and how Psychology influences legal outcomes. This is a great class for Psychology students and students interested in law and politics. Professor Lockhart is a good lecturer. The topics for this course, which include jury bias, death penalty decisions, eyewitness testimony, are all extremely interesting and absolutely relevant to events going on today. Lockhart really effectively unveils possible mechanisms underlying the gross injustices of the legal system. Everyone should learn about these topics. The assignments are manageable, yet engaging, with weekly 2-page thought questions concerning the readings, and a 5-page final paper due at the end of the course, and a final project during finals period. However, I would say that one weakness of this course was that it was rather disorganized and time was not equally distributed to the different course topics. I felt that there was a huge downside from dragging on through the material in the beginning, and then quickly skimming through the slides during the end of the course for the sake of time, which causes students to lose focus. With more organized lectures, this could be a really fantastic course.",
    "Interesting course. Gives you an overview of a lot of different issues plaguing our justice system. Definitely a survey course, there aren't deep dives into legislation. We unfortunately don't have much time to discuss the limitations of the studies presented or discuss opposing viewpoints. Weekly reading responses, final 5-page paper & take home final.",
    "If you are interested in psychology and or the law then OMG TAKE THIS CLASS IMMEDIATELY. (Seems obvious but there are so few law classes here outside of polici, so really, if interested in the law TAKE THIS). This class focuses on every aspect of the judicial system from the jury to racial bias to psychopaths to genetics and mindsets of criminals. It's incredibly interesting and so applicable to life. You'll learn things that affect the way you look at the judicial system and even just humanity in general. It's one of those stereotypical college classes that you'll bug all your roommates with because you won't shut up about it. That's how interesting it is. You even get to observe a court case at the end and write about it. (I got to watch a murder trial). Only complaint is that lectures get a bit slow at times and attendance is mandatory (even though the readings, which are fantastic, cover basically all the material). There's a lot of work in that you have a reading response each week, but it's honestly manageable, more quantity than difficulty in workload. Overall, super highly recommend.",
    "Definitely recommend. Even if you're not particularly interested in the law, it will be an eye-opener.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is so fun and interesting!",
    "take it! you will learn a lot about systems and patterns you had no idea existed or the extent to which they are prevalent in the US."
