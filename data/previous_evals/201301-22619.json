    "You are taking this course because you have to. A word of advice: START WRITING EARLY. Even if you don't have your outline figured out (slash if you don't like the outline you were supposed to hand in in December), you will figure out what you are missing when you start writing.",
    "It's the senior essay- you have to do it. Just make sure you have a good advisor! And don't leave all your writing til the end-- you won't feel as good about your final product if you do that.",
    "If you're looking at this, you probably have to take it. But that said, it's really fun. A great way to write your senior essay. So enjoy!",
    "You have to take it so make the best of it.",
    "Make sure to actually do work in the first semester -- it can be a lot to handle if you leave it all to the second semester. Also, write down everything -- make notes and put things in essay form...you think you'll remember your thoughts on an article\/book\/etc, but you won't--write it down! and write early.",
    "If you got this far, you don't really have a choice, do you? Religious Studies does a wonderful job with the thesis- you get a lot of support, it's great meeting and hearing what your classmates are writing about and getting feedback, and you get to create a really nice community"
