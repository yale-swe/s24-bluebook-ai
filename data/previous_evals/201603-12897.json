Having each lecturer join us for discussion was a great way for us to bounce around and test ideas we developed from weekly readings. My favorite course as an INP student so far.",

    "I hope to learn more about computational neurosciences (encoding and decoding) and developmental neurosciences.",
    "Strengths: I absolutely loved the lecture portion of the course. It was a terrific way for us to learn about the state of a particular field from an expert. I also appreciated the requirement that guest lecturers refrain from discussing their own research so that more emphasis could be placed on the status of the field overall rather than the minutia of a single PIs current research interests. Weaknesses: I wish we had more time to discuss our opinions about each paper during weekly discussions, rather that simply summarizing figures and discussing techniques and major findings. It might be useful for each lecturer to pick an exemplary paper along with suboptimal papers they deem substandard. Although the flaws of some papers were glaringly obvious, for some fields to which I had limited or no prior exposure, it would have been helpful to learn what a model paper for that field looks like. Weekly feedback on our papers was mostly helpful but sometimes felt contrived and forced."
