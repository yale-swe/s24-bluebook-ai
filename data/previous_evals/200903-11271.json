   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Robert Reed will treat everybody like an artist, no matter how skilled they are. Expect to work really hard, but also expect to get really good at drawing.",
    "I would recommend it if you have the energy, drive and creativity to really commit yourself. Do not take this class if you think art is supposed to be therapeutic.",
    "Things to know:1. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES YOU WILL EVER TAKE.2. Prof. Reed is crazy at times. He seems to function in his own world, often makes unnecessarily harsh comments, and demands a lot from his students.3. Prof. Reed's method does not make sense until\/unless you give yourself over to it. But at that moment, it is incredible. When I finally began to understand what he really wanted from us, everything clicked and I began to grow so much as a drawer, student, and person.4. So, if you do take the class, really give it your all. You won't get anything out of it if you don't give it everything you have. (For that reason, you are wasting your time if you decide to take it Credit\/D and half-ass the work.)5. Prof. Reed doesn't really care about grades. I still have very little idea how I did in the course. But he gives you constant feedback about your performance, strengths, and weaknesses, and in many ways, that is even more important. (Also, my impression is that he tends to give out pretty reasonable grades).6. The course is not too much work if you are taking 5 classes, but it IS still a lot of work. Be prepared to really throw yourself into it.I THINK EVERYONE AT YALE SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE BASIC DRAWING WITH PROF. REED. IT IS AMAZING.",
    "Professor Reed is arrogant, condescending, and possibly sadistic. On the bright side, he does have interesting ideas about art and teaching, but it is obvious that he seeks to manipulate his students' emotional states by exerting his power as a tenured instructor over them in the most obnoxious ways possible. Although he claims that everything he does is \"for a reason,\" I cannot see a valid reason for his disorganization or lack of attention (By the mid-term, he forbid the TA from answering any student emails.) The drawings that I produced in his class were some of the worst of my life, and only two positive things came from the course: I feel a huge sense of accomplishment now that it's over, and I learned to draw an oval effectively. Granted, I'm sure Professor Reed receives this type of evaluation all of the time, in addition to those asserting that he changes lives for the better. I, however, do not believe this is possible. But perhaps the most upsetting aspect of this course was that Professor Reed allowed anyone interested to enroll in it, creating an environment that was neither conducive to learning nor to producing work. Because of the large class size (26 by the end of the term), most students felt direction-less and did not understand what was even expected of them, much less what they could do to improve.",
    "Fabulous course. Rigorous, challenging. Strengths: it pushes you and pushes you until you think you might break. Weaknesses: at times I felt so demoralized that I would give up and simply not even try any more, since it seemed like nothing I did was ever good enough. Do not take it if you have a heavy courseload, you won't have the time and will end up feeling like you are beating yourself for no reason. Take it if you have any sincere interest in deepening your understanding of art and don't be intimidated if you haven't taken a single art class before.",
    "YES. Definitely take it. It was a challenge, but totally worth it. This should not be missing from your college experience. I also highly recommend going to some critiques, exhibits in the art building, and above all taking Reed and Charlotte to Take Your Professor to Dinner Night.",
    "Definitely recommend. But to reap maximum benefits, I wouldn't take this class if you are taking more than 4 courses.",
    "I would recommend it only to those students who wish to take drawing seriously and actively challenge themselves and push themselves to the limit each and every single week. This is not something that many Yale students can do; if it is something you're interested in, this course may be worth it for you.Piece of advice before you take this class? Develop a thick, thick skin. You'll need it.",
    "If you are someone who \"likes art\" and is looking to take a college art class for leisure Art 114 01 is NOT for you. The workload in this class was greater than any other class I've taken at Yale and many times assignments were unmanageable or even unrealistic (One in particular required a large studio space to complete, which is very difficult for an undergrad non-art major to find). This being said, if you consider yourself an actual \"artist\" and are interested in seeing your skills improve you will definitely see results in this course.",
    "It's a very interesting and thought provoking class but it doesn't necessarily teach you all the basics of drawing. You focus more on learning how to stick with an idea and develop it for a very long time.I recommend the class if you have enough time with your course load.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are able to dedicate a lot of time to it.",
    "You need to make sure you have enough time to spend on this class. You need to have a good attitude.",
    "Basic Drawing is an intense course that requires a lot of work, but all of the hard work definitely pays off in the end. By far one of the best art courses I have taken, I would recommend it to those who take art seriously and really want to improve their own drawing skills.",
    "Art 114 with Robert Reed is demanding, very difficult, and unexpectedly time-consuming. However, you learn more in this course then you would in any other course. If you take this course, you will spend hours drawing the same things, hating what you draw at times perhaps - however if you are determined to learn and improve, you will realize that this course has been an excellent choice and a milestone in your education for visual thinking. If you have the time and the motivation (and motivation is extremely improtant here, especially if you have limited time being an athlete for example), then take this course with Robert Reed and be prepared to wake up at the crack of dawn. Otherwise, it will consume your life and you will not do well - which means that you will not learn a thing. If you want this as an easy course, take it with another teacher.",
    "With Professor Reed, the class is very demanding as far as the number of pieces made. If the student fully trusts the professor and the T.F, he or she will learn a lot about drawing and art-making regardless of the level at which he or she enters. The growth of all students is inevitable if the class is taken with seriousness and blind faith is put in the professor.",
    "It is difficult, but worthwhile. Be prepared to do a lot of work - go into it with a positive attitude. Be thick-skinned, but Professor Reed is a great teacher, for all his prickly demeanor, he is very well-intentioned.",
    "This class was incredibly stressful and a ton of work. Professor Reed never assigned a definitive number of pieces to do for the following week- rather, we were told to create as much as we can, which lead to multiple sleepless nights staying up completing assignments or worrying that you didn't do enough. He quietly criticizes, which is intimidating. I recommend this class only to art majors."
