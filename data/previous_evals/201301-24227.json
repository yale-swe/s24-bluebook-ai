    "I love this course, high-level knowledge, updated cases, and nice teacher",
    "Really interesting course.I enjoyed the range of material that still allowed us to focus on many issues, while always bringing back to a central focus.The course may be improved if the written analyses\/class presentations are staggered more (i.e., written analysis due 1\/4 of the way through, presentation at 1\/2, written at 3\/4, presentation at end of course). Maybe it's just because we're currently in \"finals mode\", but I remember feeling similarly around midterm time...just a ton due for one class at two already busy times in the semester.",
    "Interesting theories with real life case to illustrate",
    "Strengths-very engaging, very brilliant instructorWeaknesses- nilImprovement- International perspectives",
    "The course was an excellent way to use many of the strategies we've learned in other classes and apply them to real world problems. Additionally, Ingrid provided many helpful new strategic frameworks. Overall, while some of the cases were complicated and required a lot of discussion, we rarely got to the slides by the end of each lecture. The class could be improved by doing an overview of the case, going through some of the strategy slides from the readings, and then going back to the case and applying the strategies.",
    "I completed the course evaluation on the SOM website for evaluations. My answers can be found there.",
    "I was probably a little underprepared for this course (as a non-management student) but I learned a great deal. I gained a lot from the course design and the well-crafted assignments\/projects. I found myself engaged weekly - and I can't say that about many other YSPH classes. A great class, quite worthwhile.",
    "This course is very informative and allows us to learn a lot about hospital management. I think this would highly benefit anyone interested in hospital management. I wished we had less small groups breakout sessions.",
    "The course revolves around HBS cases, which helps frame discussion but for the most part just seemed like a slightly deeper evaluation of the cases themselves (rather than including external content). Would be nice to expand on the HBS cases a bit.",
    "This course provided a fantastic insight into the management of all healthcare stakeholders.",
    "The cases are great and class discussion is always lively and engaging. Professor Nembhard does an awesome job getting people to participate, and I always leave class with a deeper insight into the case than when I arrived. As someone without any management background I do wish the frameworks had been taught and emphasized in a clearer way, especially earlier on, to give us more to work with for our case analyses, and I thought the final group assignment was too broad.",
    "I loved reading the cases. The breadth and depth of each course were at a perfect level.",
    "great in cultivating skills in problem solving and strategic thinking.case studies help to provide deeper insight into various scenarios and broaden eyesight, which is very important for innovative thinking."

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Absolutely outstanding. Really understands students - how to engage them, how to make them think critically, level of comprehension, etc. This course had students from a wider range of background than I'm used to and she really made an effort to ensure we were all able to learn and thrive.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Organized lecture. The slides can be more concise.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0One of the smartest instructors at Yale",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was one of the best instructors I've had at Yale. She kept the majority of the class engaged, which is often difficult for an evening course. She provided clear expectations and excellent feedback, which forced us to learn how to do case analyses well.The only weakness of her instruction is that her board notes are a bit disorganized, and it can be hard to follow where we are going with a certain idea. Asking open-ended questions does encourage more class discussion, but it would have been nice to go through the each case as we would approach it for analysis.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Dr. Nembhard was great - one of the maybe 25% of professors I've had at Yale who clearly puts a lot of effort into designing her course and ensuring that students walk away with something valuable. She was super professional, engaging, and an excellent teacher, which I find is also rare here.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was very nice and always available for questions and to provide feedback. She is also a good instructor and makes the class interesting. She is also very engaging and remembered everyone names after the second class. She seemed like she cared about our learning and wanted us to get much as possible out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Absolutely LOVE Ingrid. Engaging and knowledgeable, makes class much more lively. Very approachable, and helpful to students in every way.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Dr. Nembhard is not only extremely knowledgable, but expertly leads informative, thought-provoking discussions.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard is fantastic. I would have enjoyed more opportunities for one-on-one feedback (perhaps cut one group project and add more written case analysis?) to learn from her insight, but she's great about putting the students first during classes and letting discussion drive each session.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is an incredible instructor who knows very well how to engage students, pushing them to delve further into their own thought processes. My only criticism was the rushed nature of going over her slides at the tail end of class. I think less time can be spent on discussion and more time on the slides--her research is really interesting, and I wish we got to hear more about that in her own words vs. just reading the slides in the future. That said, I will certainly be archiving her slides for future reference!",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Excellent instructor, Very knowledgable in health care management and good at conveying complicated information in a very simple way.humorous , passionate and accessible.Lectures are fun and informative."
