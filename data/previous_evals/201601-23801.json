   "comments": [
    "yes, if she modifies the course structure.",
    "Useful class for learning about how to deal with failed states in very practical terms, though doesn't cover much theory.",
    "I would highly recommend this class!!",
    "I think the premise of the course is great, and Professor Lockhart is very insightful, but it is far too unstructured to be valuable. The discussion needs to be more structured, and the guest speakers should be during class time, otherwise they likely conflict with other events.",
    "It's not the worst class, but it's just out of date. The class could have been better with more organization and a better structure. It's a great topic and when Clare talks, it's great. When you have self-interested people talk, it's not.",
    "a very informative class about fragile\/failing states, covering a wide range of topics, with a series of excellent speakers",
    "I might recommend it if you're really interested in the topic of weak states, but otherwise, just get the reading list and read it.",
    "If the subject area interests you, you should take this course - and you then have space and influence to help shape it.",
    "The class was excruciatingly boring at times and goes at a glacial pace. The assignments - policy memos on failed states or recuperating states - are straightforward and easy. Professor Lockhart is a great source of knowledge and experience and very personable but the course itself seems not well organized and a bit random. I would not recommend this course."

    "This course was a good mixture of security and development and will be useful to me as I continue to take classes at Jackson for another year.",
    "The reading list for this course is excellent, I'm sure I will use some of the material for reference in the future.",
    "This course helped develop my perceptions of state-building in post-conflict and other weak state environments.",
    "In both theory and geographic terms, I know more now than I did when I started. It's an area I'm keen to continue learning about and possible one day work in.",
    "I think it outline some good ideas and themes but it did not deepen my knowledge of this discipline."
