   "comments": [
    "Everyone should know at least a little about those bizarre German authors, with their wild hair and walrus mustaches. You read some works by the best modernist authors-- Rilke, Benjamin, Brecht, Kafka. Sussman is lovely, and effusively enthusiastic about the stuff he teaches--though there are times when he pontificates and people kind of lose track of what's going on.",
    "Very good class with a great professor. Prof. Sussman has a very flexible and cross-discipline mind. We mad valuable connections among the works we've read. In class, we continuously generate engaging ideas.Great reading material, especially Kafka, Rilke, Benjamin, Brecht and Bernhard.",
    "A recommendation for or against this class is essentially a recommendation for or against Henry Sussman, who with some accuracy dubbed himself a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmale hysteric\u00e2\u0080\u009d and an \u00e2\u0080\u009caging hippie\u00e2\u0080\u009d during our class sessions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a survey of German-language Modernist literature conducted in translation. As Sussman is not one to tread the beaten path, the texts we read were not necessarily the most obvious ones; Kafka, Freud, Rilke were all represented by works conventionally considered \u00e2\u0080\u009clesser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we read three works from beyond the historical period most often associated with Modernism. Sussman is an able seminar leader, a formidable intellect, a kind and shrewd critic of individual work, and a frequent generator of quotable \u00e2\u0080\u009cgems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thoroughly enjoyed his company for the semester; some might not. No harm in shopping.",
    "A very enjoyable course. Highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend German Modernism to anyone interested in literature of the time period. We read a lot of wonderful works, and Professor Sussman is amazing."
