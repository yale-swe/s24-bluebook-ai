    "Professor Mansur is leaving, which is a big loss for FES--but I hope someone else picks up this class, as it was a great in depth look at how different kinds of organizations manage public and private environmental issues and concerns.",
    "Cases were somewhat dated and repetative with readings in other classes. The last research paper was a good assignment and taught me something in a new field.The teacher was great at lecture... he was not as good at leading discussion on cases. The case discussions were dry as they were just reviewing the information in the case rather than trying to analyze it a level beyond what was in the cases.Homework #2 didn't really teach you much - just took time - was an exercise of plugging in values.",
    "2. Erin sometimes got behind and he went really fast through explanations of challenging concepts, leaving some non-economics and non-business school students befuddled. Other than that, he was usually a really effective teacher of some tough economics material.7b,c. The TA didn't do much. I never talked with her and since she didn't even come to the class I didn't ever feel like she was available. I don't think it is fair to the students or a good idea to let TAs take the job if they can't or don't sit through the class and make themselves more available.",
    "The first part of the course seemed rushed and sometimes the concepts were not clearly explained.",
    "There was one or two too many assignments for this class to have a reasonable workload. For the most part, the assignments were good, but at a certain point in the semester, keeping up with the reading and doing the various assignments became monotonous and was interfering with my workload for other courses."

    "This course offers learning from three perspectives - lectures and quantitative topics, case studies, and finally project work. I found the three way approach was extremely helpful.",
    "Incorporation of economic principles into thinking about the environment.",
    "It was a really great course to expose students to the nexus of environmental policy, business strategy, and economics. I really enjoyed the mix of students from FES and SOM, who contributed to the learning in the class. I felt like it took basic economics, which I took last year, and offered a really fascinating application of those concepts in the sphere of business decision-making and economics.",
    "-loved the text (markets and the environment)-i liked the first half of the course the best - (or better) - the economic concepts, etc.-real cases provide practical experience\/knowledge of how to apply concepts",
    "My comments have been made in the SOM evaluation.",
    "It discussed on the management strategy of some organizations.",
    "The case studies.",
    "The overview of the course subject matter.",
    "Mansur's clear and informative lecture style and the application of broad concepts in economics to case studies. The material was well structured and the class felt neat and organized."

    "Could have had more resources directed towards the basic quantitative econ concepts in the beginning--moved pretty past through that part!",
    "Revamp of readings\/cases that are dated as well as better discussion of cases.",
    "There were times when we were just trying to cover too much material and despite having done the readings to prepare for class I just didn't get what he was talking about because I didn't have the business background. And, because we were time constrained, I never felt like I learned all the concepts that we were forced to rush through. It didn't happen alot, but going more slowly and deliberately through some of those classes would be helpful.",
    "-linking the stuff learned in the first half to the cases - more indepth \/ quantitative analysis of cases rather than summary\/ superficial approach to understanding them.",
    "My comments have been made in the SOM evaluation.",
    "Most organisations discussed were of USA and cases on evolving companies were not discussed.",
    "The initial part of the course was too rushed",
    "An explination of how environmental economic theory is different from classical economic theory, so that the environmental economic tools are better understood.",
    "The workload. Assignments were a bit tedious."

    "Understanding the underlying economic arguments for various environmental policy choices and tradeoffs, and the relationship to business decision-making and participation in the policy-making process is key. This class was a good advanced course in the synthesis and application of economics, business, finance, environmental policy and law.",

    "Excellent. For someone interested in policy analysis and design it is very relevant.",

    "advantages : learn a lot fromothers, different backgrounds (some FES\/some SOM students so very valuable to have different perspectives)disadvantages: always difficult to coordinate, etc but nothing specific to this course that made groupwork particularly disadvantageous",
    "Advantage: A sense of group performance for the well doing of the project. Discussion was worthy.",
    "Advantages: everyone in the group was interested in the proyect. Disadvantages: The guidelines for the final paper were not 100% clear. Because of that, working in a group is hard because people have different expectations. Specially when they are from different schools and they are at different levels in the program.",
    "The advantage was learning from the SOM students in the class, very useful.",
    "The group work was poorly timed at the busiest part of everyones schedule and thru the middle of two breaks (FES and SOM break at different times). Over 4 weeks our team only had the opportunity to meet twice! Coordination was a mess. I think this project could be dropped entirely in favor of a final exam."
