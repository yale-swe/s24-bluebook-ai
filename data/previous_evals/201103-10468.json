    "The course on theory and aesthetics before 1600 is a survey of the most important information and documents in music theory through the Renaissance. I would recommend the course to any student of music theory, because this body of knowledge can be difficult to learn without an instructor, and it constitutes essential background for many conventions of Western art music that we now take for granted.",

    "This course greatly improved my comprehension of many important concepts in the history of theory, such as the Greek system of tetrachords, Guidonian hexachordal solmization, and the practice of musica ficta. Even if I do not draw upon this knowledge in future research, I think every scholar of Western art music should have a solid understanding of it.",
