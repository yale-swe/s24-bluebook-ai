   "comments": [
    "take it!",
    "Yes, absolutely. It is so interesting, and you learn from some of the best immunologists in the world.",
    "Very interesting class. Not too difficult if you have a strong grounding in cell biology and biochemistry concepts, and clinically relevant!",
    "Overall, I'd recommend the course. You learn a lot, the professors are a wealth of information, and the workload is not unreasonable.",
    "Immunobio is an incredible class, one of the best science classes I have taken at Yale. It is a great way to apply many of the scientific concepts from other classes in a very clinically relevant subject, while gaining exposure to some of the most established, knowledgeable professors in the subject. You learn a lot of material at a very quick pace, but for a team-taught class, the lectures flow together pretty well and every single professor is extremely approachable and sincerely wantsyou to learn.",
    "Not an easy course, but you definitely do learn immunology...yeah, there's a lot of material, but for the most part, it does tie together in the end. The lecturers range from quite good to very good. (Oh, and at least this year, best TAs ever: super helpful and knowledgeable.) So yes, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student - a lot of work, but worth it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Hell of a lot of stuff to memorize, but it's so worth it in the end. Not as much as some other equivalent classes, though. Also I've heard that neuro is awful.",
    "Very 'pre-med'. Lots of information - nice to see lots of the bio stuff you've learned come to a practical application. Go to section! Very helpful in deciphering the important aspects of the lectures.",
    "This is an excellent class, one of the best in the MCDB department I've taken so far. It may be a little difficult to get used to the different styles of the eight or so professors that teach the class,but the material is so, so interesting, with a nice span from fundamental cellular biology aspects to vaccines, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and transplant immunology at the end. The TAs were fantastic and helpful - try to get Heather McGee if you can! Lots of material in the class, so it required intense studying; if you keep up with the reading and don't cram last minute, it's not so bad at all. I highly recommend this class - I learned so much and discovered that immunology is so relevant to daily life and medicine!",
    "Really interesting material, but pretty darn hard. The tests are sometimes harder than you think they're going to be, even if you study a ton. But like I said, it is really interesting and complicated material that I think most bio majors would enjoy.",
    "Great class if you're interested in infectious disease or immunology. A LOT of detailed information, so just be prepared for that.",
    "Good Course. Take it if you are curious.",
    "BEST biology class i have taken at yale. TAKE IT. all the professors who teach this class are fabulous and engaging. you learn tremendous amounts from this course. honesty, going to class was fun because the professors and the material were so interesting. never a dry moment in this class. a hidden gem inthe MCDB department.",
    "Excellent course! Highly recommend taking it-great professors, great teaching system, very interesting material etc.."
