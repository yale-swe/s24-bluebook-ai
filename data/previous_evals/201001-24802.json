    "Interesting class where you learn a lot of things about East Asia. You will walk away feeling like you know more about East Asian political economy. Be prepared for harsh grading, and the written assignments have almost nothing to do with what you are learning in class. Make sure you talk to Professor Saito because he's very knowledgeable about this field and likes to have discussions with students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - challenging at times but definitely worthwhile.",
    "Take this class! The professor was engaging and the material was interesting. What more could you ask for? Professor Saito will get you interested in East Asia.",
    "Definitely! It's a lot of information and things to learn--especially if you're not well-versed in political economy or East Asian history--but it's totally worth it. It also helps that the reading is largely unnecessary and you're never tested on anything. Saito is hilarious and wonderful and kind and approachable. Take the class!",
    "Good theory based course that is pretty easy. You can select the readings that interest you; the papers are very self-directed in general. Saito will give you a pretty good general overview of a lot of topics about East Asia, but will assume that you know about basic political economy concepts. I would recommend taking macroeconomics before taking this course.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to those who are interested in East Asia. This course offers a broad picture of modern and contemporary East Asian countries.",
    "entertaining, pretty chill course. great intro to east asia, but might be a bit too broad if you already have a background in large issues.",
    "Despite its title, this course is actually a broad survey of the political economy and recent history of the five countries that make up East Asia, with various basic political science and social science concepts thrown in. It could be a lively seminar for students with basic prior knowledge on the topic, but if not class can quickly become painful. The readings are probably a delight to true political and social scientists, but apart from the first few weeks' I found them extremely esoteric, and (sometimes also because of their age) not as relevant as I would have liked. Fortunately (?), this year's grading system - two essays and a final research paper - was so unrelated to the reading that I only did about two weeks worth of coursework.A final note for EAS majors who aren't quite academic enough to appreciate the readings: it's not all bad news! If you have knowledgeable classmates or are willing to skip now and then, and are semi self-motivated, you can consider this an easy credit and\/or a fantastic opportunity to write an awesome first research paper on an East Asian topic.",
    "if you hold a very strong interest in the subject",
    "East Asian Capitalism is a great discussion of the political economy of Japan, China, DPRK, South Korea, and Taiwan. Its biggest strengths are in the professor and the diverse comparisons drawn between the countries of focus, who all took different paths towardtheir present states. To get the most out of the class, participate as much as possible; Prof. Saito has much to offer when you fully utilize the dynamics of a seminar. Finally, be prepared to write a lot: 2 8 page papers and a long final research paper. Nonetheless, it is not a writing credit.",
    "cool course, I would recommend having taken some history courses on the region, or at least be familiar with it before the course."
