    "There is a lot of daily work but you learn a lot and the teaching is good. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes; the class is a continuation of the previous year and is really rewarding.",
    "Chinese L2 is everything you would expect if you've taken L1. The textbooks stay the same and the structure of the class is essentially the same, except you will learn only 5 characters a day instead of 6 and you will have an added day of review before tests.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it as a great introduction to Chinese. Don't take it if you have too many courses... this will take a LOT of time, so maybe only take 3 or 4 that semester.",
    "Chinese 120 is basically the continuation to 110, using a textbook from the same company and taught in pretty much the same way (two quizzes per dialogue, one oral presentation per lesson, and bi-lesson written tests, with two extra oral tests plus a three-minute presentation at the end of the semester). There's a bit more vocabulary, and the grammar is a little complicated, which means it's more time-consuming than 110, but the topics are a lot more useful and interesting.",
    "Its about equivalent to 110, just the next level.",
    "The format and workload is very much similar to Chinese L1, so if you were doing fine then you should find this course comfortable. I personally felt it was very well-taught and organized.",
    "It's an interesting class but if you have already taken 110 it's not like you have a choice"
