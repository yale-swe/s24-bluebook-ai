   "comments": [
    "It's a class about the history and development of theater. It's not a literature class. It's a history of literature class. It's pretty dry, but it's required for the major. Make friends with the people in your section. Don't take it if you're not looking to major in theater.",
    "The primary reason to take this class is to advance within the THST major. This class is also definitely worthwhile for non-majors, as an opportunity to formally devote time to reading the central works of the theatrical canon, and an overview of foundational performance history. It seems that the quality of the experience mostly depends upon the instructor, and the material is largely the same each year, so for this particularly semester: Prof. Robinson was fine; not superbly engaging, but definitely an adequate instructor to take this with. Choosing a good section leader is also crucial, so I would suggest attending the first meeting of each and trying to stick with whichever you think will best help you through this course.",
    "As a survey course, there will be material that engages you and material that does not. Fortunately, this is the sort of course that you can mold to fit your interests--delve into what catches your attention, and skim the rest enough to get by.",
    "This course exposes you to a lot of old theater, which is awesome. It does go fast and there are lots of plays to read, so make sure to stay on top of that. Overall a great course.",
    "THST 110 is basically a literature class except you only read plays from different time periods and geographical locations. It was a very interesting class. I would only take it if you're really interested in theater or as a requirement for the major as it is a bit time consuming with all the readings you have to do.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in the history of theater or are considering a theater studies major. It is a ton of work and even though I am very interested in theater, I probably spent 60% of the lectures zoned out and waiting for it to end. If you are interested, however, I'm sure it's great; and if you need to take it, you will survive. Just DO NOT put off the readings.",
    "A lot of reading and a pretty dry introduction to Theater Studies, but gives you a good backbone of ancient theatrical knowledge moving forward. I would recommend it if you are interested in pursuing the major.",
    "Yes. It gives you a good overview of theatre history and it is an important prerequisite by other theatre courses.",
    "This is a necessary class to be educated on the history of theater, and if you are interested in acting the syllabus covers plays that are important to the nature of theater as a whole. The final performance project is one of the most valuable parts of the class, as it puts what you have learned into practice.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in theatre. While some students may be put off at first by the lack of acting, ultimately I think the class is very worthwhile to take. It will serve as an excellent foundation for any theatre I perform in or study for the rest of my life.",
    "THST 110 01 is a survey theater course for those interested in learning the history of theater and tying it to theory and specific plays. You must take this course if you are interested in performance-based classes. I would recommend this course only to a student who is willing to put the work into it because there are many readings. You need to have read nearly everything to participate in section.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to anyone and everyone, even if you're not a THST major. Make sure the professor is good because I've heard horror stories before, but 110 is a wonderful introduction to the history of theatre in theory, practice, and literature. Anybody hoping to go into theatre-making needs to take this course! First of all, you'll meet a lot of yale's most active theatre students, but you'll also be exposed to YSD students who TF and professors who really know about this field. With texts from Ancient Greece through late 17th century restoration theory, this class is a lot of work. There is significant reading for each class, plus an 8 page paper, midterm, final, and group performance project. However, the readings are fun (and plays go more quickly than novels in generally so don't compare to a typical English class' reading list!) and fulfilling. This class is a wonderful overview of theory, practice, and legacy of theatre from ancient times to about 1700. Absolutely take it, but expect to do the work if you want to get anything substantial out of it. You will do fine if you don't--but do--later in life you'll be glad you know this stuff!",
    "THST 110 is a comprehensive introduction to theater history and the study of theater, emphasizing breadth over depth in any particular text and culminating in a paper and a performance project based on the content of your individual section.",
    "THST110 is a fantastic course! You start with the Greeks and end with English Restoration. Professor Robinson is a great lecturer, though he can take a while to get to his main point at times. His lectures cover theatre history and what was happening outside the theatre at the time. His lectures are not on passage analysis, instead, when he talks about the plays themselves, he talks about a main theme or two and its relevance to both theatre history and the society in which the playwright wrote. His best lecture was on Richard II You read a play to two plays a week and there's one paper and two tests. You get the most out of this course if you read all the plays, and let's be honest, it's hard to bs your way through passage identifications if you haven't read the plays. ."
