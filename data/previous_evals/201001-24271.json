    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "I would probably not recommend Chem 252 unless it is required or you have a strong interest in inorganic chemistry. The lectures were pretty random and disjointed, so I feel like I just got a glimpse of a bunch of random topics, rather than actually learning anything substantial. Also, the only useful study tool ares the lectureslides, but they are pretty difficult to follow. The grading and tests are quite fair though.",
    "In all, a pretty interesting course. The course information says Orgo isn't needed as a prereq, but it would definitely be helpful for the mechanism problems in the second half of the semester. Also, almost everyone in the class is a Chem major, which makes the curve difficult. Professor Crabtree is very knowledgeable and quirky, but he moves too quickly through information and tries to cover too much. Personally, I wish I'd waited until I had taken more chemistry courses than just Chem118 before going straight to Inorganic.",
    "I took this class for fun. I know that sounds weird but it's true. I didn't need it for my major, I just took it. In retrospect this was a BIG mistake. It is somewhat interesting and as chemistry courses go, really goes into stuff that's not commonly talked about but it's full of chem majors and a little too intense to take unless you're going to take it really seriously. The work load is minimal but the tests are difficult, getting an A requires staying ahead of a tough curve full of some motivated pre-meds.If you need a chemistry course, I HIGHLY recommend this class (especially if you're coming right out of Chem 118) but if you're thinking of taking it just for fun (I know, I'm weird) I would say save your time for a more applicable, less specific course.",
    "This is a good class if you're interested in learning some more qualitative ways to think about chemistry in addition to orgo. Prof. Crabtree is pretty hilarious and you'll learn a lot--just not necessarily what he thinks he's teaching you. The slideshows are absurdly complex but the tests aren't bad. Go to section!",
    "If you have to take it, it's not that bad. It's pretty enjoyable if you're interested in chemistry. Professor Crabtree is a very funny, personable man. The thing is, he's just a little bit disorganized and the topics can seem a bit random at times. It all seems to come together by the end of the course though.",
    "Yes, good class with lots to learn.",
    "If you're interested in the subject material, take it! Very reasonable workload, and the material is cool. Plus Crabtree is great.",
    "Chemistry 252 is an interesting class with many applications, from medicine to green chemistry to many other scientific fields. I think the information taught is something people should know, although sometimes I was a bit frustrated by what seemed to be a lack of accessibility in terms of the TAs and the professor.",
    "It was good, especially after organic chemistry.",
    "Some structure would be nice... Professor Crabtree goes off on many tangents and it is difficult to follow his trains of thought sometimes which makes making notes impossible because when you re-read them they don't make much sense. Interesting material though and Crabtree is a good lecturer, he makes it funny!You have to take it for the chem major - its not bad. Just be warned that it gets alot harder so if you start skipping class at the beginning when all they are learning is Lewis dot structures you will regret it when they start the harder stuff for the second midterm...Exams are not easy. He said it is going to be curved around a B\/B+ which is not great... I don't know how true though.",
    "All in all not too hard. It will be more difficult to take this class before organic chemistry because the last third uses many concepts\/vocab from organic chemistry.",
    "Not a very difficult course, gives a general intro to inorganic chemistry but not super in-depth. Professor Crabtree adjusts the material he covers depending on the experience level of the people in the class. Problem sets are short, and your grade is based on homework and your top two scores from two midterms and a final.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the class. Professor Crabtree is amusing and the materials is not that difficult. What Crabtree covers is also really interesting and very pertinent to current science. The challenging part is that he is not that clear about what he wants and it leaves you a little lost in studying for the exams.",
    "You need it for the Chem major. But please do not take it for an easy A.",
    "If you are a chemistry major and must take the course, read Dr. Crabtree's book. It's a very very good book- really it ought to be a more integral part of the course. In fact, it is the basis for everything you will learn in the course, and will be very helpful. If you are not required to take this course, know that it isn't bad, but is not great. You may want to shop elsewhere.",
    "If you're looking at taking this course, it's probably because you're either a Chemistry major or looking for your second pre-med chemistry requirement. If you fall into one of these two categories, then you probably don't have a lot of options and will need to take this class. If you're not of these two groups though, you should probably stay away. While the material has a lot of potential to be interesting, it's not presented well at all. Professor Crabtree, although apparently brilliant in the field of organometallic chemistry, has a rather peculiar lecture style that's difficult to follow most of the times. The course was made up of 13 topics that he found interesting that were sometimes closely, sometimes tangentially, and sometimes entirely unrelated to one another. Buyer beware.",
    "Interesting, fairly easy, has no textbook.",
    "Good class",
    "This class is a review of inorganic concepts, an intro to coordination chemistry and organometallic chemistry. I would only take it if you have to, as lectures tend to be hard to follow. If you do take it, get Crabtree's textbook right away and start reading up on material as it is presented. Don't let the first few weeks fool you into thinking this class is an easy A, as it gets more challenging later as harder material is presented in a more difficult way.",
    "This is a fun class. Crabtree is hilarious. Be prepared to do a little more studying on some powerpoints that he doesn't cover thoroughly in class.",
    "Chemistry 252 was a fun and informative class and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in building on the fundamentals of general and organic chemistry. This class helped me gain an understanding of coordination chemistry and also of transition metal catalysis, which is very important to the future of green chemistry.",
    "No. This class is very unorganized and random. You learn tidbits here and there, which you can learn by yourself in an afternoon with a textbook and wikipedia. The rest of the class is devoted to random facts about global warming, green chemistry, and tons of names of catalysts and useless other trivia. It's really a waste of time. If you can, just go straight to the more advanced inorganic\/coordination\/organometallic courses.",
    "A good overview of many different aspects of inorganic chemistry. The first part of the class felt like a little too much review of general chemistry. Since this was a survey course of inorganic chemistry, it felt at times like there were too many topics to cover, making studying for the tests kind of difficult. Don't let your guard down too much with this class, you should put effort in and review all the material, especially if the midterms aren't given until after spring break like they were this semester. Professor Crabtree is a very entertaining professor and does a good job of making the material sound interesting. Got to love the accent.",
    "Chem 252 has the reputation for being an easy class, but I think some students took it too lightly. You really have to work to learn the material on your own. Professor Crabtree teaches entirely with powerpoints, so it's easy not to pay attention in class. I'd suggest going through the slides on your own after each class and also reading the pertinent sections in Crabtree's organometallics textbook. The first midterm was a cakewalk and then the second was super hard and people didn't do well. You can drop one score out of the two midterms and the final, so study really hard for the two midterms and you won't have to take the final!",
    "it's fine",
    "Interesting and fun course especially if taught by Crabtree. It's a nice elective that is not too much work and it allows you to take the more advanced inorganic chem courses. Take it if you need a science elective that doesn't require too much work.",
    "This was a fine class, but because Prof. Crabtree only used lecture slides to cover the material, it was sometimes difficult to grasp the concepts.",
    "If you are taking this class, it is probably to fulfill a requirement. That said, there are a lot of interesting topics in this class addressed briefly enough to just catch your attention. While taking it will not result in a huge increase in knowledge of chemical principles, it will teach you about what there is out there to study. Overall, I would recommend this class for the chemically curious, but otherwise it is not worth your time.",
    "This is a required class for many premed or chem majors, but don't take it otherwise. Lecture is terrible and the exams don't test you on what he lectures on."
