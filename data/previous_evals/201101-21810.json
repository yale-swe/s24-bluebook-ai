   "comments": [
    "Sure, just be aware of each teacher's style of teaching the class.",
    "This is a great class for first time and experienced fiction writers alike! It was a very scientific approach to the process of fiction writing, which was useful. However, the class itself is very unstructured. You just have to turn in three stories for the semester whenever you feel like it and get them workshopped by the class. There is no time built in for revisions of stories with Professor Crowley himself, which I would have liked. Other than that, though, I learned so much about fiction writing from this class and feel like I have the tools to produce something of worth in the future.",
    "It's a basic workshop class for fiction writing. There is not much work to do for it, so if you're looking for an easy 5th class, take this one.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. If you're an experienced writer or not, I think it's a terrific class to take to sharpen your writing skills and learn some new techniques you might have otherwise missed. This class is definitely beneficial for writers and non-writers alike, and it's a lot of fun.",
    "The main meat of this class is talking about people's stories. Each person writes 3 6-8 page stories, and 3 stories are discussed each week.There are also lectures on the craft and language of writing stories but it's kind of a hard skill to teach.If you don't want a lot of people talking about your stories or you want fewer comments in more depth I would suggest you look elsewhere. The comments, even for the professor, were quite short and general.Remember to submit an application in advance! Some people didn't.",
    "English 140 is a great beginning fiction workshop. Prof. Crowley takes care to try and select a diverse group of people who can teach each other different things, and who bring different elements to the table. Occasionally, his lessons on plot or point of view seemed a little bit basic, and I wouldn't have minded more in-depth analysis using teaching examples, but ultimately the way that he approached the craft of fiction was really helpful to us, as writers of varying experience. He's extremely insightful and really encouraging and kind. Though workshop experiences are always dependent on the people in it, I'd thoroughly enjoyed and definitely would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to improve their fiction writing skills. I worked really hard on all 3 of my stories, but otherwise there isn't much work for the class. The peer reviews helped a lot so just make sure you get good classmates."
