   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in Parisian history, this is the course for you! Take a seminar with Professor Merriman who is dynamic, engaging and flexible.",
    "Take it if you are aware that Merriman's style is to jump around a lot and tell a lot of stories in the middle of teacher. If you're a type A person then you might not be able to appreciate the incredible amount of info that he knows about France and Paris. He is a very enthusiastic and engaging Professor. Manageable class with interesting historical readings. The only work for the class are the readings + 18-25 page research paper on anything Paris related. start paper early.",
    "Take this class. Professor Merriman is great, and you'll learn a lot from it. The readings are enjoyable, and class discussion goes by super quickly. As a non-history major, I'm happy to say this was my favorite class this semester.",
    "This is a challenging seminar -- take it if you are willing to put it in the work to read and write. It is possible to get by without some reading, but you would be doing yourself a disservice. I would wholeheartedly recommend and would encourage a fellow student to take advantage of John Merriman as a resource. He is constantly available and willing to work with students. Not a typical seminar -- much more time spent listening to interesting stories and historical information -- I really found this to be a great class.",
    "The Emergence of Modern Paris is a great course if you want an overview of Parisian history. You'll learn so much about both Paris and France from Professor Merriman, who is such a great scholar of French history and so fun to be around! The 20-30 page paper isn't too much of an ordeal if you start early enough, and he will always be willing to help you talk through it or point you to resources that can help. Overall, I'd recommend the course to someone who wants to learn more about the city of Paris and what made it into what it is today.",
    "Fun, laid-back, interesting seminar, great class as long as you know what to expect. Professor Merriman is such an interesting person, with many great stories (he loves to share them) and thoughts about Paris, its history, and its virtues and problems today. Aside from showing up having reading, one final paper is really the only assignment.",
    "This class is a treat. Definitely take it. Previous experience with Parisian history or culture is helpful, but not necessary.",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in the history of Paris -- enough to write a 20 page research paper on it.",
    "HIST 223J is a good course if you've been to Paris or are interested at all in Paris or France. The workload is minimal, which was nice because it let you not get bogged down in minor assignments. The class did not have as good of a discussion component as it could have, but Merriman is awesome and I would take it again if I went back."
