   "comments": [
    "It takes you very quickly through how women are represented in Roman art, both literally (actual depictions of women of all social classes and how to interpret them) and figuratively (how to see the less-than-obvious places where women influenced art and culture).Yes, I very much enjoyed the class, and I feel like I learned a lot about Roman society and art in general. I would absolutely recommend it to other students, particularly someone who wanted to take an art history class but was afraid of all the scary memorizing!",
    "Class on Roman art with a focus on women. Midterm and final are highly unusual, but a good change of pace. Subject is hard to research though, as a lot of the material is in French or German, so you will spend a lot more time looking for materials than you expect.",
    "This is hands down one of the best Art History course I've taken so far. Professor Kleiner is \"The Bomb\" and she knows pretty much everything in her field. Also, she is very prompt in replying to emails and can help with obscure bibliographies if you're writing your final project on something not fully explained in Wikipedia.The course sessions are interesting, and you really get to learn how much power women had in Ancient Rome (if you're wondering, the answer is, not much) and the discussions are what made the course worthwhile. There is a midterm paper, and a final exhibition, but it shouldn't be too hard if you're interested in whatever you write about. Get started on them early - that's a must!Also, this course had just three men, compared to about 10 women, so if you're a guy, you should definitely be here ;)",
    "Definitely take this class! This is why you are at Yale. Professor Kleiner is one of the leading scholars in this field, as you will find out when doing research for this class... Many sources are either by her or cite her.Aside from an amazing professor, the subject is so interesting. The final project, to design a museum exhibit on Roman women, is fun to do and will be a nice break from studying for other finals. Though don't let it take up all of your time... You'll want to work on it a lot since it's so fun.",
    "This is a great seminar! You learn a lot about the contributions of Roman women and read some really interesting articles. The class discussions were always engaging and insightful. I also loved the assignments for this course. You learn a lot by writing the midterm paper and doing the final project.",
    "Take this class. Professor Kleiner is the best professor I've had ever. The class is so much fun, you'll learn so much about ancient Roman culture and their art and architecture as well as about their FABULOUS women. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in art\/architecture\/ancient culture. Do NOT take it if you do not want into put in time and energy. The final project is really fun but very time consuming and can really take over your entire life if you let it.",
    "Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Probably better for students with some background, but the teacher makes it accessible to even completely new students like myself."
