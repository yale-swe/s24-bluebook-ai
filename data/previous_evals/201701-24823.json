   "comments": [
    "We learned a lot about Camus specifically and how to read literature in historical context in general.",
    "I developed a whole wealth of knowledge about Camus' life, his philosophy, and the debates surrounding his life. I also learned about post-colonialism as well as its critiques, all of which was very interesting to me.",
    "I developed my writing, close reading, and deliberation skills. There were many disagreements within our class on how we understood Camus's purpose and impact, and under Professor Kaplan's guidance, we could grapple with these issues, both in 1940s French Algeria and 2010s America.",
    "-Getting to know an author in depth, and relate works to the author's experience in personal life and as part of a broader historical and socio-political context.",
    "This course gave me a deep understanding of the life and works of Albert Camus and of the French literary scene from the 1930s-1960s. I learned about Camus' literary, philosophical, and political thoughts and about how they intersected with events in France and in Algeria. This course also improved my skills in writing and literary analysis.",
    "This class exposed me to so much about an author that I had already previously enjoyed. I really liked the combination of analysis that this course encompasses, including reading about historical context, viewing cinematic\/artistic adaptations, and engaging with Camus' written works as well as with the writing of his critics. The trip that we took to New York was such a great experience, and I'm very happy that I was able to take this course!",
    "I was able to explore all the works of a single author, which is a great experience. I learned much about Camus's personal life and his philosophies, which we explored in his writing.",
    "Spending a semester on one person really gives you a chance to learn everything about him\/her, which might make you fed up with the person. Luckily I can still stomach Camus, but just not his convoluted essays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is pretty interesting, and Professor Kaplan is a real expert. The class is very relaxed, perhaps so much that it gets in the way of learning. We often don't open the book that we have read the previous night because we are learning historical context or discussing generalities, which is kind of disappointing.",
    "This course has so many activities, discussions, and covers so much of Camus' works that it's a must-take. However, the discussions in class don't tend to delve into Camus' works a lot, unfortunately.",
    "The course was incredible, accessible to all levels of French language and colonial history as well as experience with critical reading and academic writing. I think the weaknesses of the course were the initial communication blocks between the students that were worked out by the students through socratic discussions.",
    "We engaged some amazing material! One thing that I didn't realize coming in was how difficult it would be to engage the work of one person for an entire semester. The readings get repetitive sometimes, and you've got to really love Camus.",
    "-Great seminar, every student was part of the course, and students took on a major role in how the seminar was run early on. -I can think of no significant weaknesses.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is its narrow scope. Focusing on one man and his thoughts allows for a profound understanding of him. After reading nearly everything that Albert Camus wrote, I feel that I have developed an appreciation, not only for the man, but also for the ideas that he stood for. The only weakness of the course",
    "I liked that this course covered such a large amount of Camus' writing, especially because I've never explored any author in such depth before. I had never previously seen how an author changes and evolves as his or her career progresses, and that was a really interesting experience for me. Camus is such a rich author, and I think that this course really exposed the nuances and complexities of the author. I wouldn't change a thing with this course because taking this course really was a great experience for me!",
    "For someone who does not red particularly fast, there were times when keeping up with the readings was difficult. However, the discussions in class were great and the way the class was structured (with papers and presentations) was good as well.",
    "This is one of those courses where you witness the full might of what is Yale University. You go on a fully-funded field trip to NYC to watch a play and eat an Algerian dinner. You get to go to the film center to watch movies. You get guest speakers and even a chance to Skype with Camus' daughter because the professor is literally America's if not the world's foremost expert on Camus."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a light fifth class or who is really interested in French literature. I must caution, however, that you will not get a chance to work much on your writing or analysis skills. (You're graded on writing, but you don't get much feedback.)",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone and everyone. I think the questions raised in this course are so applicable to modern-day America, to both our internal race relations politics and our external semi-colonial engagement with countries in the Middle East. It's wonderfully taught, engaging and a class I looked forward to each and every week.",
    "-Absolutely! Even if you have only the slightest interest in Camus, take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student without reservation. Spending an entire semester on one man is a rewarding and moving experience, especially when the man studied is one as multi-faceted and conflicted as Albert Camus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course helps to engage its students in so many different ways with the very unique opportunities that it presents to its students and that I know I would have not had the chance to have had in any other context. I can't express how much I appreciated and was in awe of being able to interact with Camus' original manuscripts on multiple occasions, and of being able to gain the opportunity to speak with Catherine Camus. This course was such an immersive, engaging, and unforgettable experience.",
    "I took the class trying to push myself outside of my STEM comfort zone. It was cool to read all the material one author has written. I did not have much of a humanities and philosophical background, which would have allowed me to engage more in discussions. The class though was interesting and I would recommend it to someone trying to explore their intellectual interests.",
    "Yes, because it's a writing credit and not too hard but you also get to do so many things at yale."
