    "The assignments to the course, particularly the journals, were extremely valuable and telling. It was a great exercise that I hope to continue even after the course has ended. The presentations and the paper were also very valuable as it gave me the opportunity to actually try out the framework in a case study of my choice (that I feel familiar with). This really increased my understanding of how to use the topics taught in this class in the real world.",
    "Q 10: Tim frequently explained things that I otherwise couldn't understand from the lectures. I think having a motivated TF is important to making sure these complex concepts are easily understandable for students with limited experience with this subject matter.Q14: This is a course of all environmentalists\/activists\/problem solvers. I don't think that enough people give it serious consideration because it seems focused on land\/wildlife management but it is applicable to anything.",
    "Susan is enigmatic but dedicated, and Tim does a lot of the classroom teaching. Highly recommend talking with them both outside of class.",
    "Very insightful learning experience. Sharing thoughts and ideas with Susan and Tim was a wonderful academic experience.",
    "The main course book was very useful. I felt the papers regarding Podocarpus National Park were very useful for seeing how the policy sciences could be applied, and we would have benefited from more similar 'applied' readings or discussions of those papers."

    "Small groups, open discussions.",
    "Reflection, tolerance from instructors, and subject content and instruction",
    "Our class had amazingly deep, thoughtful, and personal discussions every week and I attribute this to Susan and Tim's ability to create a classroom environment that was safe and encouraged students to be vulnerable. The quality of student involvement was the best I been a part of at FES.More than most other professors, Susan cares deeply about student's learning and their preparation for the future. She is the most accessible professor I've had at FES.",
    "Class discussions and our reflections",
    "The opportunity for self reflection. The space for open conversation and questioning the course created. The weekly discussion group with peers. The openness to student criticism and feedback. This course is unlike anything else you'll take at FES.",
    "Discussed topics that are extremely useful but have never been discussed in other classes. Susan Clark and Tim were extremely approachable and accessible.",
    "This course was incredibly thought-provoking. It challenged me to think critically about everything, especially myself. We so often neglect to ask the fundamental questions about ourselves and our society. This course provided a rare opportunity for exploring them in depth within the comfort of a warm and close-knit community.",
    "Writing the journals every week was very useful to register and analyze our growth process as we moved forward in the class.",

    "I think this course really could be aided by the addition of a more hands-on group project or field trip to apply the policy science framework in a real-life setting. I also feel that a bit more feedback from Professor Clark after our presentations would have helped me know what to work on when writing my final paper on the same topic.",
    "More applied examples.",
    "The actual presentation of the policy sciences material could have been clearer. And I would have appreciated hearing more about cases and applications of the framework, especially Susan's own experiences with it.",
    "It focuses narrowly on on policy process and one theory but I'd like the space to compare others more",
    "The main book for the course isn't particularly compelling in-and-of itself, but in application, which was light on the ground in the course. More guided application of the principles in the book, either in in class-working groups, or a pre-paper homework assignment, would be most helpful.",
    "I think more people should take this course so maybe having the first class of the semester not be so intimidating.",
    "I sometimes felt that the policy sciences were presented as the end-all solution, as if they didn't warrant criticism or critique. I think it would be useful to discuss potential shortcomings or alternative\/hybrid problem-solving frameworks.",
    "Perhaps it would have been useful to work with a case study closely, maybe even having field trips and talking to people to understand environmental problems from a firsthand perspective.",
    "I would have liked more 'applied' discussions of the policy sciences in class. For example, looking at quotes from an article or a transcript to try to tease out perspectives and demands. More case study discussions to further our understanding."

This really enhanced our ability to teach each other, because we each had picked up different things from class. Overall this design I think really enhanced my ability to look at things from multiple perspectives and made my contributions to the course much stronger.",

Overall his presence greatly enhanced what I got out of this course!!",

His lectures were relevant, well-researched and well-executed -- and I dare say, better than some professors in other parts of the school. Tim was also very approachable and available for discussion outside of class.",

    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is a great teacher - enthusiastic, hard working, and thorough. Sometimes he got a little carried away in his excitement over the concepts he was teaching or had been personally mulling over, sometimes he made some pretty biggeneralizations about how people think, sometimes his lectures felt a little bit like pop-psychology, but these were all mild and minor weaknesses, vastly overshadowed by his aptitude and ability to get us to think.",
