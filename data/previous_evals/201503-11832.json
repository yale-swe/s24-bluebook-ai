   "comments": [
    "If you want to go into your next college writing class with a clear idea of how to go about writing a research paper and what makes this kind of academic writing effective, I highly recommend taking this class. It's really more of an intensive writing workshop -- I learned so much, and the content covered in this class is also really applicable to future academic discussions, especially if you're planning on studying international relations\/something related.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend it. The first half was more reading heavy and helped frame the second half of the semester which focused on paper writing and a TED-inspired speech.",
    "I felt that the topic of Acting Globally was indeed very interesting. As a potential Econ major, the second essay that we wrote based on our readings from the texts of Sachs, Banerjee\/Duflo, and Olopade was extremely enlightening and entertaining. If you are interested in learning about the themes of globalization in a writing class, I would recommend the class.",
    "The course was amazing. It greatly improved my writing and taught me a lot about global affairs\/foreign aid through the readings and insightful class discussions. Professor Gosselink is excellent. Her feedback on essays (including many drafts) was the most extensive I have ever received and the most helpful. If you put in the work, especially revising papers (you revise every paper at least once), you will improve your writing immensely. Expect to be held to high standards. If you can take this class with Professor Gosselink you are very luckydo it!!",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. Although difficult at times (seeing as it is a college writing course), the writing process by which we as students are led provides phenomenal support and enables the utmost development as essay writers (and in other fields).",
    "Definitely recommended for an introduction into college-level writing, regardless of previous writing experience and intended major.",
    "I would describe English 114 as a workshop course, perfect for polishing writing style and ability. I would highly recommend it, especially for freshman, as it is the type of class that takes develops a students writing technique such that they are stronger writers, no matter what their ability was at the beginning of the semester. I think it is particularly useful early on, as it really prepares you to tackle large papers, which is incredibly helpful when first transitioning into the Yale workload."
