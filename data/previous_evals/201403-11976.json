    "If you enjoy star gazing and want a very light workload, take this class! There is only lecture once a week (and you don't have to go to them if you don't want to) and there is a lab every other week. Except for the first lab, the data collection never takes a long time. It's also a lot of fun and you get to meet so many new people.",
    "Easily would recommend. Really fun, very informative, and not that great of a time investment either.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for hard work.",
    "A basic astronomy lab class. This is for people who don't plan on doing much more astronomy. The class is set up so there is 1 class a week and 6 labs throughout the semester that you sign up for depending on the weather. The labs are due at the end of the semester so you can literally not go to class, go to the observatory for 6 nights, and then spend a week doing the lab reports for .5 class credit. The lab reports were pretty challenging because you had no idea how to work any of the software without going to class. If you go to class you still won't completely understand everything. You learn very little astronomy in the class and none in the lab. You just follow instructions and get a few pretty pictures of stars.",
    "Good class. However, if you want to take this class because you want to sit outside and look at the stars, this might not be for you. Most of the time we sat inside a room in front of a computer that controlled the telescope. It also turned out to be way more work than some of my full credit classes in terms of lab reports due at the end of the semester and going to the observatory.",
    "Definitely will.",
    "Everything is due the last day of classes. DO IT EARLIER! It's not as easy as it seems. Even if you attend the lectures (which you really need to attend in order to write up the lab reports) you are still going to be confused. Also, be careful, it's easy to get the data wrong and that will cause you a lot of problems. But a very interesting and fun class, but not as much a gut as it seems.",
    "A great introduction to observational astronomy. The labs are really interesting and I very much enjoyed the course. The TAs could have been more helpful, though.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. I went into this class knowing nothing about astronomy (and not really caring), but this is the kind of class that changes your entire perspective on a subject. I've never in my life described a class as fun, but this class is fun even if you know nothing about astronomy or are intimidated by anything STEM. Not too much work, great professor, and lots of fun.",
    "If you have background in astronomy, it might be interesting, otherwise you sort of just go through the motions without really understanding what you're doing. Class is pretty uneventful, just detailing how to do the labs, and there are one or two cool labs, but for the most part they feel sort of like busy work. Didn't get a whole lot out of it.",
    "Tough half credit but fun",
    "ASTR 155 is a fun, interesting astronomy lab class. It is an extremely low-commitment class - lecture once a week and just a few trips to the observatory over the course of the semester. But BEWARE: The lab reports are all due by the end of the semester, and if you put all 6 off until reading week, you WILL NOT finish in time. They are completely manageable if you manage your time right - otherwise, you'll screw yourself over during finals period. If you're an astronomy major considering taking it, talk to the DUS; the content overlaps with ASTR 255 and it might not be worth your time (unless you're trying to get out of physics lab (PHYS 205L), in which case it very well may be). Generally, ASTR 155 is an enjoyable class with enjoyable content - an easy introduction to astronomical theory and methods.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy: the six lab reports do take time to compile and the data analysis can be finnicky, but the overall time commitment is only in the reports. There is no other homework and class time is optional - just go to an observing run once a week (an hour or so). A perfect half credit. And this class is fun because it emphasizes the way in which astronomers draw connections between the pictures they take and the properties they can measure in space objects: with simplifications, we learn to measure age, color, temperature, distance, element composition... It can be really cool to discover these things yourself. If you're slightly more interested in astronomy, go to class, because it emphasizes all the topics you can learn in other astronomy classes, and Professor Faison's peripheral knowledge about anything you might just be curious about is staggering.",
    "Right now, this class is probably only worth taking if you are either interested in seeing some of the basics of how observational astronomy is carried out, or if you are an astro major who doesn't want to take a second semester of physics lab. The lab situation is going to be addressed by the department, from what I've heard, so I would probably recommend waiting until this class gets revamped to take it. Professor Faison is a great guy, but unfortunately he isn't the best about communicating via email or getting graded lab reports back to you."
