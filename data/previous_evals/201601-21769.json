   "comments": [
    "This class is a requirement, but the french department is so competent and amazing so I would recommend the language in general.",
    "Only take this class if you have to.",
    "I would recommend the class, but explain that it takes an abnormal amount of time when comparing to other classes. It does improve French foundations though.",
    "Fun class, good amount of material, but the tests were never terrible. Talking about books and movies really improves your french.",
    "An L3 language course. If possible, take this course with a native speaker, since much of it is dedicated to a handful of subtle grammatical items in the language: conditional and subjunctive, tenses, etc. The readings are a lot of fun, and if you're on top of the work, the class is perfectly manageable.",
    "Basically L2 but with more work and more nuances of the language. Basically all of the grammar is the same besides that. Novels and movies, for the most part, aren't the best. Try to get a good professor if you can because that makes all of the difference.",
    "It is a good continuation of 121. I think you will enjoy it as long as expectations at the start is not too high: I think everyone struggles with reading original texts at first, and it is challenging to adjust to the heavier oral emphasis, but the course will prepare you for it.",
    "The class is difficult and requires much work in order to do well. Yet, I am sure any L3 language course is the same. It is a stepping stone in achieving fluency in french, and you leave the course knowing you have progressed your french knowledge."
