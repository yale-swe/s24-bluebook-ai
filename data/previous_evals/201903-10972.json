    "This was the greatest academic challenge I have ever undertaken. I learned how to write a long, serious paper, and how to go about trying to make a meaningful contribution to academic writing on a topic. Also, how to work slowly and steadily on a project for a long period of time. And I learned more about my topic than I previously knew about anything in the world.",
    "This course offered the opportunity to explore a subject that I wouldn't have been able to study otherwise. I was able to direct my own project and learn about writing a long paper with my own research.",
    "Met biweekly with advisor to discuss progress on senior essay. These meetings were supplemented by weekly meetings with the rest of the ENGL cohort."

    "Yes. You need a good advisor. It's a real challenge. Only do it if you're up for it.",
    "I recommend writing a thesis because the process allows students to explore material that isn't always offered in classes. It also allows students to direct their own research and writing.",
    "Absolutely! An independent thesis is a great way to synthesize the skills garnered during one's career in the English department."
