   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It is a great introduction to U.S. history in the 20th century and the Professor's guidance helps the broad topic be more manageable.",
    "I took this course as an undergraduate, so it offered a very different experience than I was used to. In focusing on the historiography of the 20th century as much as the history of the 20th century, the discourse seemed elevated to a further degree of abstraction than that in most undergraduate history seminars, but nothing seemed to be sacrificed as a result. Professor Gage is also outstanding.",
    "It's a great introduction to themes in 20th century US history.",

    "It was extremely helpful for me in framing the trends in the craft of history in the twentieth century by juxtaposing generations of historians.",
    "I hadn't taken a US history course before, so I found it to be very informative and useful. It also met the regional history requirement of my degree."
