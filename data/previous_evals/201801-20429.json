    "Learned about different cellular mechanisms and methods used to discover them",
    "Experimental techniques for asking and answering questions in cell biology, different important processes that take place in the cell.",
    "We were supposed to learn a great deal about cell biology and the techniques used to study it, but we did not go in-depth enough with any of the content to fully develop an understanding of anything.",
    "Learned a lot about cellular processes and mechanisms.",
    "Learned basic principles of cell biology and its functions.",
    "I learned how to analyze data corresponding to cell biology experiments, and about specifics of cellular activity I had not seen before prior to this class.",
    "-standard experimental techniques for biology -interpretation of graphs -introduction to cell biology",
    "I learned a lot about the cell and the signaling pathway, as well as the experiments associated with these topics.",
    "I learned a lot of mechanisms and tests related to cell biology.",
    "I learned more about the structure and function of cells.",
    "I developed a fairly detailed of a few key biological processes conducted by cells: including signaling, adhesion, the biosynthetic pathway, and mitosis. I am told that much of the content was similar to what is usually covered in an AP Biology course, although perhaps in greater detail. I also learned about many experimental methods for identifying and measuring many of these functions. We were required to apply many of the concepts described in lectures to new problems on exams, which I imagine is extremely beneficial for students who want to begin to do lab work in preparation for grad school or medical school.",
    "Basic biology, pretty much what you would expect.",
    "I learned about the inner workings of the cell and the biochemical pathways involved. However, overall I feel like much of the material I learned was purely memorization of pathways which I will quickly forget. The main takeaway that I will remember is the sheer complexity of our cells.",

    "have begun to think like a scientist",
    "Nothing. Absolutely nothing.",

    "I learned so much about biology (obviously). I learned about biological processes that I never even knew existed and I learned how to test data which is extremely important for research.",
    "I feel as though I only gained a superficial understanding of the concepts covered in Bio 102. Most of the class was memorization based and did not fully explain why the processes happened as they did.",
    "I learned the basics of how a cell functions as well as many of the experimental techniques used in cellular biology.",

While a lot of the information was a refresher for me from my AP Biology class in high school, I learned a lot of details about cell physiology that broadened my understanding of the cells in our bodies.",
    "I developed the knowledge on how to understand and thoroughly know material about the cell such as the difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and the organelles that compose them.",
    "Easy to get by without doing the readings.",
    "I really learned a lot in this course about how cells and the cellular process. Some of the topics we covered were ones I touched on in high school, but it was nice to review these topics and go more in depth. I also learned a lot about experimental procedures and methods for how conclusion about the cell were made which I found pretty interesting.",
    "How to understand biological processes mechanistically The types of tools used in biological research How to apply my knowledge of research tools\/biological concepts to solve problems in biology",
    "Essentially, in this class, I learned the required content. I developed a good knowledge of cell biology and cell processes, especially regarding transport, signaling, and division mechanisms.",
    "Nothing useful. As someone who likes biology, and was interested to learn more, this class was too much detail to the point that it made me hate biology.",
    "I learned more about cellular biology and applying biological concepts to experiments",
    "Not much outside of biology. Maybe improvements to time management skills?",

    "I learned how to apply my knowledge to real world applications and apply small molecular concepts to bigger biological concepts.",
    "BIOL 102 introduces some basic signaling pathways (G-protein coupled receptors, the MAP Kinase signaling pathway), and covers some basic facts and ideas about cellular structure, mechanisms, and signaling. It's a good overview of concepts that will be delved into more detail in later biology courses, but the course doesn't give students a whole lot of opportunity to explore as much of cellular biology as they wish.",
    "Components of cells Cell's reaction to certain environments Differences between cells across the body How the body functions by way of these cells",

    "I learned about cell function.",
    "The most important skill that I learned is how to effectively synthesize information. In STEM courses, I was used to memorizing and regurgitating the information that I had learned in class; for biology, however, we were expected to take what we learned and apply our knowledge in new contexts.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include organization of the course (lectures, study guides, readings, homework, etc. are all uploaded on Canvas and easy to access). Weaknesses include clarity of lectures and comprehensiveness of explanations.",
    "The TAs were very helpful, the class was well-structured and felt very logistically sound on a macro scale. Unfortunately, I felt like Professor Horsley's slides were not very well organized sometimes and\/or not super conducive towards helping students learn. I wish she would put more actual content\/information on slides as opposed to just pictures.",
    "Strengths: the exams reflected what is taught in lecture Weaknesses: the content taught in lecture were a bit disorganized, so it required some outside reading if you are not in enrichment",
    "This course was too broad with too little depth. It felt like a poorly taught high school class in that we were looking at different aspects of cell biology, but in such a superficial way that it ended up being a class of straight memorization and regurgitation rather than genuine understanding and critical thought. I understand that it is an introductory level course, and, as such, it should give a \"taste\" of each aspect of cell biology, but the time spent on each topic was so fleeting that we failed to actually learn any of the skills required to be a real scientist. While Biology 101 was also an introductory course covering a broad expanse of topics, it was executed in a way that better facilitated true learning and understanding rather than the rote memorization of processes.",
    "Prof. Horsely is not the best lecturer. Making the slides clearer would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: Much better than 101. Homework is understandable and class is easier to follower Weaknesses: Class becomes rushed near end of semester",
    "Huge lecture, which is overwhelming in that asking questions becomes very inefficient. The lectures are structured in kind of haphazard and confusing ways, and some activities (eg. organelle competition) don't really facilitate learning. Could be improved by sheer organization.",
    "Strength: Professor's engagement and care for the students I'd suggest using clicker questions to increase engagement",
    "Strengths: The quizzes for every class were more relaxing than the weekly quizzes in Biol 101. I like that the slides were posted before each class, so I could print them off and write notes during lecture. I found discussion sections really helpful for cementing what I learned and to go over the topics I wasn't as sure about.",
    "The strengths of this course included the TAs and review sessions and the similarity between psets and exams. This course can be improved by including more comprehensive notes on chapters as it is sometimes challenging to write down everything during lectures.",
    "The sections were definitely the strength of this course. My learning was really reinforced there. A big weakness was overall engagement in lectures. They were very slow and boring.",
    "I would say that topics for the class are well-organized and provided a good overview of topics in cell biology. The homework problems were generally representative of material covered on exams, and having the TFs go over one homework problem during section with the opportunity to ask questions was extremely helpful. At times, there was a clear continuity between the things we'd learned in BIOL 101 and this class; at others, the transition was difficult. This class, in general, felt less well-designed to facilitate student learning than 101, because we had one single midterm instead of weekly quizzes, lecture slides were only posted the morning of class and contained far less info on them, sometimes the readings did not match up very well with what was discussed in class and seemed to offer unnecessary background info.",
    "I really like the way that the exams are written! It's great that there is a significant amount of problem-solving (as opposed to pure rote memorization) and they are fairly written and graded. I also like the pace of lecture (nice that there is lots of time for questions) and Prof. Horsley's style. Going to class is very helpful. One thing I would change would be the quizzes. I would either get rid of them altogether (not helpful for learning, just an annoyance) or make them in class so that there is some accountability.",
    "This course did a decent job of exposing me to the content (cell biology) and it did so in a way that helped me understand it. However, it was not very interesting, and I felt as though I was memorizing arbitrary information most of the time.",
    "The lecture slides and examples from real experiments helped to reinforce the concepts that were presented in the reading.",
    "Strengths: professor Horsley, professor Lin, the powerpoints, the study guides. I do not think the book was very closely connected to what we did in class, and I do not think the pre-class quizzes were particularly helpful in helping to learn the material. I thought the sections were great and super helpful; my TA was excellent.",
    "Strengths: Good intro to cell biology. Weaknesses: Not very engaging.",
    "good section layout. Poor lecturing style.",
    "It was very difficult to learn the material for this course in a large lecture hall with only one discussion section per week. Also, enrichment was only held during times that were inconvenient (during practice hours) for varsity athletes. This was a major disadvantage to athletes taking this course who cannot miss practices.",
    "I liked the structure of BIOL 101 better because the weekly in-class quizzes helped me facilitate my learning better than the at-home quizzes with BIOL 102.",
    "Not difficult enough.",
    "The weaknesses of the course are that the lectures and powerpoint slides are organized poorly. In contrast to BIOL101, Prof. Horsley's lectures and ppt slides often contained very little information. In addition, there were barely any practice problems available to prepare for the midterm and the final exam. Overall, it was very unclear what we needed to know and understand.",
    "This course was strong because it really facilitated learning with the lectures, pre-lecture quizzes, homeworks, and sections. All these different things reemphasize the same material so by the time the week is over, you have a strong grasp on each topic and you are ready to move on to the next one.",
    "The lectures were not linear and the teaching was difficult to follow.",
    "The class provides a decent overview of cell biology, however the pre-class quizzes are not at all helpful and the slides were very poorly prepared so that the content was difficult to decipher.",
    "Slides were poorly organized and corresponding study guides did not always match. Section was very good and helped clarify a lot of things.",
    "Discussion sections, enrichment sessions, and a general culture in lecture that was open and encouraging of questions were strengths. Weaknesses were organization of material and especially slide decks--I think the visuals could have presented material much more clearly, with more written explanation given to explain diagrams, define acronyms, and situate pieces of information in bigger context.",
    "A strength of this course is that it has very interesting material and that even though it is a lecture class, it is relatively engaging with discussion and activities. The course could be improved with more practice questions within lecture or more discussion of the application and process of experimental methods.",
    "The sections should be more engaging and the homework questions need to better reflect the content of exams.",
    "The course does give a good overview of general cell biology, but it lacked detailed explanations and organized notes. Many times, the powerpoint slides presented in lecture were not exactly as they were in the print-outs, which made the student's job much harder to get all of the necessary information to succeed in the class. Also, most lecture slides contained only minimal explanation of the diagram of picture presented, which meant that the student had to try to gather most of the important information orally from the professor. This made it hard for anyone who wrote slowly or did not fully understand what was happening to keep up. It would be very useful to slow the lecture down, go through each slide in depth, and make sure that people have time to write down the necessary information. I think this would reduce the number of clarification questions asked because more people would be able to get all of the proper details for each slide.",
    "The course teaches you the basics of cellular biology and I think does a good job of trying to create critical thinking capacity rather than just forcing you to memorize terms. However, it was somewhat unorganized (lectures and readings didn't really line up at times).",
    "This course involved a great deal more memorization than did BIOL101. Although the pre-lecture quizzes were marginally helpful, it became very easy to get behind on the material without weekly in class quizzes. The midterm and final were pretty fair though if you put in the work.",
    "Lectures were rather disorganized",
    "Needs better standardization. I learned completely different things than my peers who took it with a different professor.",
    "make homework less repetitive",
    "Strengths - Prof. Lin's review sessions were great and incredibly helpful; she was especially good at clarifying confusing concepts. I also thought most of the material was interesting. Weaknesses - Sometimes lectures were confusing or unhelpful (as in the case of the organelle lecture). I also didn't like the new quiz format - I like doing readings for a unit after we cover it in lecture (especially because exams only test material covered in lecture and if you do the readings after the lecture you know what to focus on) and the pre-lecture quizzes meant that you had to superficially skim the readings before lecture, which then just encourages leaving the reading at that. I wish the quizzes were maybe post-lecture but more complicated to make up for that or something.",
    "The lectures were often scattered or not well prepared. The lecture slides were also vague and made studying from them very difficult",
    "The lectures were often disorganized and confusing, containing some wrong information and irrelevant pictures.",
    "This course covers a lot of information, but it was well taught and there were many opportunities for students to get the help they needed.",
    "Strengths: -Learning about cell biology techniques and signal transduction pathways is interesting and applicable for future biology courses -Grading in this course is quite accommodating; you can drop one quiz\/assignment\/section grade -Homework problem sets are helpful for understanding the material -The teaching fellows and Professor Lin are very nice and helpful Weaknesses: -Some of the material is quite useless for most students. Maybe like 1% of people will care what the difference between COPI and COPII is -Lectures are boring -Sections give you the answer to half of each problem set.... it's nice I guess but it kind of defeats the purpose -Lectures are bad -\"Silence means consent\" -The final exam was significantly harder than the midterm\/homeworks -Very few practice problems for exams -Lectures are REALLY bad -Lecture slides are really really REALLY bad so you may need to go to lecture anyways -The \"study guides\" for each lecture do not include everything you need to know -You better hope the class never gets cancelled, because the recorded lectures are somehow even worse than the in-person ones",
    "A weakness is that the lecture slides were disorganized and were sometimes hard to follow. The professor often just read the slides in class rather than expanding more on the material presented. Strengths of the course were that I learned a lot of new material and the lecture study guides were helpful.",
    "This course is extremely easy if you had a good AP biology teacher or if you're good at reading and understanding stuff on your own.",
    "I think discussion sections were extremely helpful in synthesizing the information from lecture and piazza was a really helpful forum to ask questions.",
    "stregnths- the class in depth in biology, which is nice to know as much as possible. weaknesses- lectures could have had a better explanation to the material at times.",
    "Professor Horsley is an extremely unengaging professor. I am sure she is brilliant in the labperhaps she should stay there. Shes incredibly difficult to follow in class, often reads directly off slides (which themselves are almost impossible to read or make sense of) and mismanages time.",
    "I thought this course was taught very poorly. The material could have been made so much more interesting than it was. The slides were almost unreadable, and had essentially no words on them. The lectures were organized very poorly, and the material was taught in a very confusing way. They should have taught it like \"cells need to signal to themselves and to each other. There are a few possible signaling pathways, and we are going to go through a few of them.\" But instead, random pathways were just mentioned very briefly and were not connected. I thought that was the worst part of the class, was that none of the information we learned was connected, no one drew connections for us between what we were learning, and it seemed like we were learning random things. Until I was studying and tried to synthesize the material, I felt like I had no idea what I was looking for.",
    "The course was well organized with clear expectations. The emphasis on experimental procedures was helpful and going beyond sim pie theoretical learning to application based was good.",
    "Honestly, the only reason I found this course somewhat entertaining is because I love biology so I found the material interesting. The class was taught pretty badly.",
    "The strength of this course is that Prof. Horseley is amazing and so are her teaching fellows and Samantha Lin, who runs the bio sequence. In terms of weaknesses, I do feel like the course glides over a lot of information that could have been explained more in-depth. I also feel like missing one lecture (For whatever reason) would make a student fall behind so much. And although the argument could be made that they should've come to lecture, emergencies do happen, and one absence in this course can lead to another few weeks of ignorance, not to mention feeling stupid within section.",
    "The strengths are the lectures -- they offer great information and it is explained well. Weaknesses include the fact that the class size is so large, and that the textbook was not very conducive to learning for the course\/lectures. Thus the pre-class quizzes were very much a superfluous aspect that decreased from the quality if the course. Post-class quizzes would be much more helpful.",
    "The textbook used in the course was enjoyable and insightful. The course content covers a lot of pathways and mechanisms that actually shed light on a lot of the big question in biology, like learning how cells know how to respond specifically to particular stimuli. In terms of weaknesses, lectures could be dry, and while the professors and teaching staff made efforts to make the class more engaging, lectures still felt like a bit of a chore.",
    "It is hard to understand the techniques fully without actually doing them or watching comprehensive videos. More time should be spent on giving more information and step-by-step explanations of the techniques as opposed to the other information that is simply memorizable. Also, the information is not on the slides for the most part--this makes it v very difficult to study afterwards, especially since it goes quickly and it is hard to take notes on everything.",
    "The lectures were organized but the slides and content weren't always fully clear. The exams were fair. Though the HW was easy, it was helpful.",
    "A strength of this course is the discussion sections led by Teaching Fellows, because they enforced what we had learned in class and answered any questions we had. A weakness of this course was the large size. In addition, it was not a good overview of cell biology, because the topics were specific to Professor Horsley's research and were not explained in relation to each other.",
    "I thought the content was pretty interesting and the way it was taught was effective. Discussion sections were also very helpful.",
    "Material was ok. Professor Horseley is the weakness!!",
    "The slides were very unorganized and often times undeveloped. Going to lecture felt the same as just reading the slides as both omitted information.",
    "This course was well taught and well run. Maybe more office hours should be provided?",
    "I do not like how the course only provides overviews of various topics. I think that the structure of the course is confusing and makes learning the material more difficult than it should be.",
    "A few of the strengths of this course include the presentation of very interesting and applicable topics related to cell biology, the amazing peer tutors and Professor Lin that are available to help us with any questions that we may have, and the fact that I personally discovered study habits like creating study guides for each lecture in order to improve my learning, understanding, and remembering of the material. The major weaknesses of this course are having Professor Horsley as the professor and her extreme level of disorganization present throughout the course.",
    "I think one of the major strengths of this course is how organized it is and how lecture slides and study guides are always posted on Canvas. I think a weakness is the fast pace of the course and how students can easily get lost during lectures and feel as though they cannot ask a question because they don't even know what to ask a question about.",
    "The readings were too complex for the level of the course, confused me more.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were well organized. Material was, for the most part, concise. The mechanisms were taught clearly. Weaknesses: Not much information on the lecture slides",
    "The main strengths of this class were in its resources for asking questions about the content, and the very accessible way in which it was taught. However, some of its weaknesses came from the same exact issue. I understand that this is part of intro biology sequence and is meant to be the most basic biology course taught at Yale, but I think that it could benefit from being split into two or three different levels based on the preparedness of students, like how the first-year chemistry courses are split. While enrichment exists for the students who are less prepared or have not taken AP\/IB Biology classes, the class is taught at a level that is too simplistic for more experienced students. This is not a complaint, but considering that the course is a requirement for many more advanced science majors and that it is unlikely to place out of the intro biology sequence, it would make sense to either increase the content difficulty of the class or split it into various levels. In addition, I would suggest a minor improvement on the types of questions that are asked on homework and exams. Currently, most of the questions involve several paragraphs of reading with only very small pieces of relevant information, which then lead to extremely simplistic answers. Though this helps to develop the skill of extracting useful information, I think it would be more useful to make questions either difficult enough to warrant the lengthy descriptions, or to simplify the descriptions to match the simplicity of the current questions.",
    "This is an introductory course, so people have to take it regardless of the quality of the class. Therefore, instructors in the class (Prof. Sam Lin) don't really care about the needs of students and are super rigid with regards to everything, even the simplest things. In this class, I felt like everyone was making sure that my life was the hardest possible, and there is absolutely no flexibility with regards to anything. For instance, ask any piazza question they will ask you to look at the syllabus, even if it has to do with desmosomes or vesicle formation. I regret taking this class so much, and this is mainly due to the way instructors dealt with students. Professor Horsley on the other hand tried to be as helpful as possible.",
    "This course was not taught very well and seemed pretty random with the information. It seemed like we were jumping from one topic to another that did not have much correlation to the other and instead just seemed to be very memorization heavy.",
    "I appreciated the biweekly quizzes because it ensured I was actively learning the material since I was held accountable for it. As a visual learner, I appreciated the step by step diagram breakdowns and videos included. I feel the material could have been separated better, I feel sometimes it was too dense and too detailed, with many of the details remaining irrelevant or \"outside the scope of the course.\" Additionally, I feel like I was able to understand the material outside of the class when taught by someone else.",
    "Lectures could be better presented--too often, Professor Horsley just read off her slides. At other times, she used only a couple of slides to explain complex\/complicated topics or glossed over them fart too quickly.",
    "Bio 102 is intense but rewarding.",
    "The strengths are that the teachers and staff work very hard to ensure each student's success.",
    "I think I learned a lot which is good and shows the strength of the course.",
    "I think this course covers everything it needs to as an intro bio course. I effectively learned the information I need to pursue more advanced biology courses.",
    "The course did a wonderful job in providing a brief introduction to cellular biology, and it has a pretty strong organizational framework (Piazza, TAs, Enrichment, etc.) to help students who have questions or struggle with concepts. However, the course can feel restrictive at times: Whenever a student had a question that went beyond the context of the course, but still related to cellular biology, the TAs and professors would often dismiss the question. Additionally, the professor didn't always seem prepared for lectures--some of her answers to questions contained incorrect or confusing information. The grading on the homework assignments was fair, if a bit harsh at times and overly concerned with wording. The course could be improved by focusing less on wording specifics and more on conceptual ideas. Furthermore, some more practice questions for the final and midterm would be highly appreciated.",
    "i think it was taught very well",
    "Strengths: fun\/dynamic, well-done discussion sections, involved TF's, plenty of resources (ex. discussion sections, Professor Lin, TF's, Piazza) Weaknesses: unorganized professor who does not know all of the information",
    "I believe the course was very well designed",
    "This course could be improved by finding someone other than Valerie Horsley to teach it. The course could have been a really interesting and informative introduction to cell biology but instead it was a disorganized mess of terrible lectures and laughably easy homework assignments. I really don't know what happened since BIO 101 was a great course.",
    "The readings are far more complex than lectures and the lectures felt boring and had little information on the slides themselves. Also enrichment feels like it rigs the system because they gain additional information and know more about the exam topics than normal students.",
    "I thought the TF's were a strength, but I found lectures to sometimes be jumbled and hard to engage with. I felt like the homeworks were often a little repetitive but not always in a helpful way.",
    "I really like how it teaches the material and how that material is studied in the lab. It puts the course material in perspective and makes it easier to study in the lecture\/outside of lab setting. It nicely covers the big picture in cell biology and smaller processes within the cell. The homework was great to reinforce the material, and section helped cement the lessons from lecture and help apply it to the homework. I thought the textbook was a lot more specific than the course needed, and it would be nice to have a lecture that applied the concepts we learned and brought the whole course together.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is that we were given the opportunity to practice applying the knowledge that we'd learned through homework problems and in class. We spent more time identifying how an experimental method could go wrong, reasons for an experimental result or deciding how an experimental method could be improved. These practice exercises gave me the opportunity to explore the knowledge more deeply and identify my areas of weaknesses in my understanding. The weakness of the course was the sheer amount of reading that needed to be completed in the textbooks. It was difficult to understand what information I needed to pay attention to because the readings were so dense and often included information that was not covered in class.",
    "Lectures were at times rushed and disorganized. We would rush through the material and then end class early. Additionally, the final exam did not seem to fairly assess our knowledge. In fact, one of the questions asked about a specific detail only mentioned briefly in section.",
    "Strengths: interesting materials weakness: sometimes lectures are a bit boring, also its a lot of information and memorization",
    "The strengths were that it was well organized. The weaknesses were that the lectures were very basic and slides did not provide much information.",
    "better power points, better explanations that do not just include reading off the slides.",
    "Well organized. Sections were helpful. Lecture slides were not very informative",
    "One strength of this course is that they go into depth about the processes of interest and provide real names of the real molecules that are involved in things like the biosynthetic pathway. Rather than talking about things in vague terms, the course really focused on making sure students had the correct vocabulary to talk about biology. A weakness of this course is that the textbook was not well matched to the lecture. On one hand the textbook we used was very impressive in the detail it would provide; however, its level of detail was beyond the scope of the course and had the effect of making it difficult to parse out what was important to know for the class. The quizzes exacerbated this problem by asking very nit-picky questions that were not the type we would see on an exam. I preferred the quiz system in 101 because it made you study every weekend and gave a better sense of what kind of knowledge we needed to know. Another weakness of the course was the totally disorganized slides. Unlike in 101, where each slide very clearly fit in the overall presentation and was clearly labeled to state the key points, the slides in 102 were really difficult to follow when reviewing. Our professor also often changed the slides the night before class without updating them on canvas making it a struggle to take notes because I would print out the slides before class and take notes on them. The final weakness of the course was the inconsistency of the study guides with the slides. The study guide often did a poor job reflecting the slides and would occasionally add new information that was never discussed in section or lecture. Because it was already hard to tell what we had to know from the textbook, not being able to turn to the study guide or the slides for a definitive list increased that challenge.",
    "This course was poorly-taught, but I think a redeeming quality is the organization behind it.",
    "Strength: Interesting course material, discussion section effectively reinforced class topics Weakness: Unclear expectations for exams, very little homework\/few quizzes made it unclear how course concepts could be applied to actual exams, long question time bogged down lecture",
    "I thought it was pretty badly taught and that the professor could have done more to prepare before lecture.",
    "strengths: consistency, predictabilility weaknesses: none",
    "Its very good",
    "I wish the pre lecture quizzes were more engaging.",
    "The strength of this course was the structure. Material was always organized in a really efficient manner to allow us to self-learn and access the info whenever needed. The weakness of this course was the lecture and discussion sections. Lectures were not very informative at all. They mainly reiterated what was presented on the powerpoint slides. Discussion sections similarly just hammered in the same points without providing much extra insight.",
    "Less confusing lecture slides could improve comprehension of the material when its first presented",
    "The material is interesting but too vast and our focus is not directed sufficiently.",
    "The class material is not super challenging, but for some reason it isn't the most clear of classes. Lectures can be interesting, but often the class either focuses on super specific information or very basic topics (which is not necessarily bad) without clearly connecting them in a way that is meaningful--sometimes you don't know if you are talking about a class of proteins with something applicable to many or if something you are learning about is unique to the protein at hand.",
    "This course is extremely well organized, and the grading and assignments are fair. The lectures, however, were not always the most helpful, and many students found self-teaching to be most effective for this class.",
    "Strengths: organization, structure Weaknesses: not much engagement in class",
    "The course should focus more on experimental techniques and designs and analyzing data. Most of the lectures focused on facts that one would have to memorize while the conceptual parts of the course such as how a certain experiment works and how that experiment can be used to study a phenomenon was not adequately emphasized. More focus in the course curriculum on experimentation would have been better preparation for the exam and would have been better preparation for scientific thinking.",
    "Get a better lecturer",
    "The lecture might have too many students.",
    "At times, it is difficult to ascertain how much detail we should know about topics as the book is much more in depth than the lectures. It is also not helpful that the lecture slides have zero words on them, although I understand this is done to encourage in class participation.",
    "I though the material covered was very appropriate for an introductory course about the cell. I did not personally use Piazza to ask any questions, but I would look at the questions of my fellow students and I thought it was helpful. However, I felt some instructor responses to the questions asked on Piazza verged on flippant when the students were asking about unclear topics from class that were not well explained on the slides. For instance (and this is just one example), a student was asked to refrain from asking \"these types of questions\" when they asked about effectors and second messengers because apparently the slides directly answered that question. When I went to the slides specified in the response (and looked at the slides around it), though, the only information there was a very vague definition of an effector and the fact that second messengers could be effectors. Additionally, the final placed very little focus on topics heavily emphasized in class and section (like the specific signalling pathways) but put a lot of focus on things that were not stressed particularly significantly, such as many of the biological experimental techniques.",
    "In class material could be better explained",
    "Lecture was very boring with Horsley; section was much more informative; psets were good; textbook was too detailed for what we were expected to know for tests\/section It would be better if we had better guidelines for what we were expected to know. Also this was different from bio 101, since we didn't have any in-class quizzes, so it was hard to expect what would be on the final, so having more practice material would definitely be a huge plus.",
    "Professor Horsley's lectures (and especially the slides) were not very organized, which made going back and studying difficult. Also, the class felt very memorization-heavy and a bit dull for it. I think a strength was the incorporation of several scientific papers which the class gave us the skills\/background to understand. The problem sets were good; they were not too hard but indicated well which topics were most important to the course.",
    "Well taught, good homework assignments. I really liked the class. I think it would be better to have 3 days of class instead of 2.",
    "Weakness: the Professor was oftentimes confusing. Certain vocabulary was jumbled and incorrect information was fed to the students. Example: centromeres are not the same as kinetochores",
    "It wasn't always clear what specifics we needed to have memorized. I liked the lectures where we could pass up questions at the end but that only happened once or twice. But it was open to questions which was important to get clarity sometimes. Would've liked more engagement with scientific journal articles - I appreciated that aspect of 101 but it wasn't present here. Did appreciate the focus on experimental techniques though.",
    "It can be improved by going into deeper context",
    "Strengths: material usually easy to engage with Weaknesses: lecture slides not clear",
    "The strengths are that the lectures follow a logical and cohesive sequence. Additionally, the lectures go in depth but not too in-depth where someone could be lost like in BIO101. A weakness is that the lecture slides often were vague, making it harder to understand what diagrams were weeks after looking at them.",
    "The professor fails to convey content in a way that is approachable, relatable, or, often, correct. Shuffling through her conflicting notes makes learning relatively difficult new material even harder.",
    "The class is very detailed in the knowledge expected but the slides are a bit messy. I do enjoy the study guides but I think having quizzes online is not as beneficial for learning the material.",
    "The only strength of this course was that I realized how grateful I should be for my high school teachers, who were a million times better than Professor Horsley.",
    "One strength is the activities\/skits that Professor Horsley does in class, which helps a lot of students understand the concepts of the course. Another strength of the class was the discussion sections, which solidified what we learned in lecture every week. A weakness of the course is the disconnect between the assigned readings and the lecture itself. The book was very detailed and contained a lot of information that was not mentioned in class. If another book that correlated better to the class was used, the class would have been much better.",
    "The lectures tended to just be regurgitations of the information in the readings or on the slides. It made it difficult to engage\/even want to attend lecture, as one really didn't gain much more from being in lectures. I also felt as though the pre-lecture reading quizzes were more of a nuisance than a learning tool- many if not all of the questions were general or blunt enough to just google or command F to find the terms in the reading. They were also incredibly easy to forget, or if I happened to oversleep!",
    "I think getting our work graded back faster would be more beneficial. Enrichment was something that I thought was really useful.",
    "The class moves very fast and I found that section gave me a chance to go more in depth about the topics covered in class."

    "Not the best course, but often required anyway",
    "Maybe... there are probably other ways students would rather spend their time though.",
    "Definitely",
    "Biology 102 is a requirement for many STEM majors, so it is not easy to avoid taking it, but if one does have to take it, I would recommend not taking it with Professor Horsley. From what I have heard from fellow students, the other professor's course is more difficult, but much more rewarding in that it goes in depth into biological processes rather than simply glazing over the surface. If one must take the course, take it with someone engaging who challenges you instead.",
    "Yes, decent class, graded a bit harsh and Prof Horsely is eh, but overall good.",
    "If you have to take biology, take this. Not worth going through 101 and 102 for a science credit",
    "Not a huge fan of the professor, but am a huge fan of the course content.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot of skills and foundations for upper level classes",
    "Yes, because this is a required course for every biology major. It was actually nice to take these foundation courses and learn about biology from an experimental point of view. The workload is manageable and there are resources you can use to help yourself prepare for the exams.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in cell biology. This course was also interesting in the way that we could design experiments to test our hypothesis regarding how some drugs or mechanisms work.",
    "No, the only reason that I would recommend this course is if it is necessary to fulfill a requirement. The class is very boring and you gain little from being a part of it",
    "If you are majoring in a natural science, you probably have to take this course. My opinion is that the sequence that begins in the spring is overall more manageable and less painful than the sequence that begins in the fall. I would not recommend this course for someone trying to get a Science credit done, or who just has a passing interest in cell biology.",
    "Yes, it's pretty interesting and great (if not necessary) for any STEM major.",
    "No, I would not. I feel like you would have to already have a lot of interest in the subject in order to enjoy this course. However, it is necessary as a prerequisite for many majors, and it is not a painful experience to get through, but merely somewhat boring in my opinion.",
    "Absolutely. Great introduction to cell biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who plans to major in biology or the sciences, or to a pre-med student.",
    "No",
    "Probably not, unless it is required.",
    "It's not a difficult course, and the material is interesting, but the lectures are uninteresting and most students end up learning by reading the textbook.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student who wants to learn more about biology and is ready to be more challenged than in Bio 101 as this course is faster paced and the material is new but it is all very interesting and you do learn a lot from this class.",
    "If you have to take it as a requirement it's fine.",
    "Yes, it was very informative and I enjoyed it.",
    "yeah",
    "No. It's just painful",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about basic processes in cells and to build on elementary knowledge about cells from high school.",
    "It is a requirement for most people who take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in dipping their toes in the study of cell biology, but I would warn the student that the class can be disorganized and hard to follow during lecture.",
    "It is fine as an intro course, but won't really inspire you.",
    "very interesting course that gets you to understand the human body better by learning about the basic unit of life",
    "I didn't find this course particularly enlightening or anything, but I appreciate it as a prerequisite class. So I guess take it if you're interested in the material\/need to for any requirements.",
    "The content was interesting, although the class structure and lectures had more to be desired.",
    "I would, but be wary of the lecture slides being confusing.",
    "Yes, a great introductory science course. Much superior to the intro chemistry sequence.",
    "Honestly, courses like this are the reason why people do not like biology. A lot of the material in this course consists of rote memorization of uninteresting. highly-specific topics. The lectures were bad, but the lecture slides were even worse, so you're screwed regardless of whether or not you choose to attend lecture. The study guides don't even come close to including all of the highly specific material that you'll be tested on. You'll likely have to endure the painfully boring, occasionally incorrect lectures if you want to have a chance at knowing... what exactly you should (theoretically) be learning in the course. Sections are fairly useful for reviewing material, but they cover material at a much lower level than you'll be tested on. If you're considering this course, you're likely a premed or a bio major anyways and don't have a choice. Don't worry; it will get better.",
    "Most people only take this class if they are premed or it is required for their major, but it is a good class if you want to learn biology.",
    "I would if you have to take it or if you just want an introduction to biology.",
    "You most likely will need biology if you are in the life sciences. But if you are just taking it for a science credit then I would not recommend it.",
    "Not if Valerie Horsley is teaching it.",
    "Only if they have to take it as a prerequisite. It is poorly taught, and takes a lot of outside class work to learn the information.",
    "Yes, it was a good science credit. It is definitely more of a class to take if its a requirement, but its overall inserting and if you put in the effort, very doable.",
    "If you need this course for your major, then you need this course for your major and must take it. Otherwise, please no. Please do not take this.",
    "Yes, you will definitely learn a lot and develop a deeper understanding about biological concepts.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is a required course for your major or for pre-med. I would also recommend this course if you have a genuine interest in biology. If not, then look for SC credits elsewhere. Take a more specialized course with less people at lecture.",
    "I would, if the student has any interest in biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are deeply interested in biology. This course covers a lot of great content, but I believe the delivery and presentation of this content can turn off students who aren't very interested in the subject matter. For people who enjoy biology, this class will be enjoyable in that you will learn a lot of things that would never be covered in a high school or other introductory biology course.",
    "It is an introductory course, so it is hard to recommend unless a student needs this to move on and take more advanced courses. Overall, I think it needs to be improved so that any student, not only those who need the requirement, will want to take it and actually enjoy it.",
    "If you want to know what it means to be a cell biologist, this class is for you.",
    "No, I would not. Besides being a prerequisite for many classes, this class is not a good foundation and does not set up a student well for other courses because the professor chooses specific topics that are not explained very well and are often not very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biology and wants to learn interesting topics about cells and cell biology.",
    "no",
    "Not unless you have to. Professor Koleske will make you think the sequence is great and then you get to Professor Horsely",
    "Yes, its a good intro to cell bio and required for pre med",
    "No I would not, this was the worse experience I had this year in school.",
    "With Professor Horsley teaching the course, I definitely would not recommend this course. If there was a new professor and better organization, then I would recommend the course because the material is very interesting and the rest of the staff involved with the course do a good job of trying to facilitate our learning and understanding of all of the information in the course.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you actually need it for your major. Although it was well organized it is very challenging and stressful.",
    "Prof Horseley is very enthusiastic about biology but sometimes her explanations aren't super clear. The structure of the class relies on students asking questions, which I didn't like because I prefer to ask questions in a smaller setting. I found the actual content of Bio102 very interesting. It felt about the same level of difficulty as Bio101. I didn't take AP bio in high school and was also unable to sign up for enrichment sessions, but I still felt like I was able to succeed in the class.",
    "You have no choice, if its a pre requisite for your major",
    "This is a required course for the pre-med track, but besides that, I think I would still recommend this course because it does a pretty good job at giving students a foundation in cell biology and experimental methods. I found the topics covered interesting and section every week fun.",
    "If you need the class for your major, then so be it. It'll be fine assuming you get a good professor for it.",
    "Yes! Learning about these mechanisms of biology are interesting, and it would be a good course to take even if you aren't majoring in biology.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it is a requirement and a prerequisite for many other courses and majors, and because it does do a good job of teaching the content it intends to. However, it could definitely benefit from being more stimulating.",
    "If you are not Pre-med, PLEASE don't take this class.",
    "I would not unless this student really enjoys biology or has to take it for their major.",
    "Sure, but only if its a requirement.",
    "Yes, bio 102 is well structured.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a great foundation for any degree pertaining to biological studies.",
    "Yes, I would. The workload isnt too heavy and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, though with a caveat--the class does a pretty basic job of introducing foundational principles of biology. It does its job for the most part, but a lot about cellular biology is really interesting and compelling, and the course didn't necessarily convey that.",
    "Yes! It is a manageable way to gain an understanding of the functions of cells. The knowledge gained is genuinely interesting and applicable after the course.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in any form of biology",
    "I would recommend that they take BIO 102 with the other professor who teaches it during the fall. I would tell them to only take it with Horsley if there is no alternative.",
    "No, never. It was very not enjoyable and I am someone who likes biology.",
    "I mean most take it for a requirement, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. I would inform students that they should be gracious and set their expectations lower for this course.",
    "Yes--its a great introductory course to cell biology--delving in the subject material and how it was obtained.",
    "Yes. This course is a good beginner course for biology. In fact, I think this course should actually be Bio 101.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You are encouraged to understand the material deeply as opposed to simply memorizing information. There are lots of opportunities for support and the concepts are generally interesting. This was one of my courses of the semester.",
    "This course is a necessary requirement, but I was not particularly interested in the course or the material. I found that the information could have been presented in a more organized and engaging manner. I also felt that section was unhelpful and a bit unnecessary.",
    "Yes I would, but it wasn't the best.",
    "I would recommend this course if needed as a prerequisite.",
    "not if it is not mandatory",
    "Yes",
    "Only if you have to take it for a major.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "No, not unless you need it for your major. 101 is much better.",
    "Yes, even for non-pre-med students. I think this class is engaging enough for even non-STEM students to take for their science credit.",
    "Yes its a fantastic intro to biology",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend the class for anyone seeking a fundamental understanding of biology. The course material, while not the most riveting stuff you ever learn, is really essential to understanding the more interesting aspects of biology. With that being said, I don't think the course is taught particularly well, so that is one consideration that needs to be made.",
    "This class has some interesting information but some of the teaching makes it more complicated than is necessary. Lectures can be hard to follow even when you are attentive because diagrams do not necessarily follow each other. The tests focus primarily on very specific proteins rather than larger topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Besides being a pre-requisite to reach upper-level science courses, the material itself is interesting and serves as a good introduction to cell biology for both STEM and non-STEM people alike.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning these specific biological pathways or wants to get a better understanding of biological experimentation.",
    "No. Not if Valerie Horsley is teaching.",
    "NO",
    "Yes, as the material is interesting.",
    "yes, interesting material.",
    "from what i've heard, the course depends a lot on who the lecturer is: I had Horsely, who was a pretty boring lecturer; however, I've heard that Mooseker is a pretty interesting lecturer. Regardless, Samantha Lin, the course coordinator, is pretty good. if you're taking this course for major requirements, go ahead and take it - it's neither great nor terrible.",
    "It is foundational knowledge that I am glad to have (also, knowing how to read a scientific paper is cool), but the course itself was not extremely engaging. So, probably not unless if you have to, but if you just really like cell biology, then don't be dissuaded from taking it.",
    "Yes! Very interesting but also hard. Enrichment was extremely helpful.",
    "It is required for many majors and pre-Mrs. but normally, I would not recommend this class with Professor Horsley",
    "Yes - not too much work and engaging lectures - fascinating material! Solid intro to cells.",
    "Yes it is engaging and very informational",
    "Yes- very interesting material",
    "Yes, it is a very interesting course that allowed me to better understand how the cells function and influence daily occurrences.",
    "Yes! It was very interesting and organized very well.",
    "No. If you have any way to avoid taking the course, you absolutely should. The material and instruction presented here are far worse than any other educational experience I have had at Yale or anywhere else. I could not more strongly discourage taking this course.",
    "Yes I think this is a good course if you stay on top of the readings.",
    "Do not take this class! I learned nothing other than how grateful I should be for my high school teachers, who were a million times better than Professor Horsley. She does not actually teach. She merely reads off of her already confusing and vague slides, which only explains concepts with circular definitions. The tests do not access how well you understand biology; the tests only access how well you can regurgitate exactly what they envision your response to be. The material covered on the tests is completely different from what her lectures aim to, but fail to, teach.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a genuine love for science and biology. This class is way too detailed and involved in order to take it as a gut science class. The pre-class quizzes are untimed and generally easy, the homework assignments are definitely easier than BIOL 101, and the midterm\/final are probably the worst part of the class."
