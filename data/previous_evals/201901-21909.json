    "CS research",
    "Really enjoyed my project! Thanks to Dana for being a great advisor!",
    "I produced original research, gave a presentation, and wrote a scientific paper.",
    "Learned how to conduct research, keep organized records of work, and develop a comprehensive report; learned how to communicate effectively and plan projects well",
    "Experience doing a semester long research project on a topic I am interested in.",
    "It's the senior project. Be intependant.",
    "I was able to get a strong sense for the research process for my field and to start and carry out a significant project. This was, as expected, way tougher than I thought, but it was rewarding to be able to go through these bouts of frustration and progress.",
    "Doing Research",
    "I learned how to do a self-directed project and how to do modern software development like reading APIs and such.",
    "During most of this project I felt overwhelmed with new information, and I feel I learned how to handle difficult and complex situations. I gained experience choosing which aspects of a project are most important to spend time on, and how to go about gaining an understanding of previously unknown topics.",
    "How to perform research in computer science",
    "I learned how to design and implement large-scale networked systems in the vibrant field of federated machine learning."

    "I went to the S&DS poster session and was very impressed with it -- it would be nice if CS had something similar for sharing our work more publicly. I gave a presentation but it was within my individual lab. Additionally, somewhat more standardized guidelines would be helpful -- as is requirements were pretty unclear and ad hoc.",
    "Slightly disorganized\/unstructured, this was sort of a positive because research can vary so much, but also felt like there was nothing to grip onto regarding criteria\/deadlines",
    "An opportunity to see other student's projects would be cool.",
    "The course left a lot of flexibility for its students, and part of this entails the instructor being a bit hands-off. However, this sometimes meant that in less straight-forward projects, we didn't get so much feedback on how we were doing -- and this was a bit stressful for the theoretical work.",
    "Good as is.",
    "Your advisor is key. Make sure you choose an organized advisor."

   "comments": [
    "Required for CS major.",
    "It's required for the major.",
    "Absolutely -- be realistic with what kind of project you want to carry out and get started early by itemizing your tasks and delivering. It's an important skill, being able to stick to a project agenda, and this is an excellent time to practice, whether or not you're going to do more research in life.",
    "Very opened end! Not in a bad way. Gives you the freedom to work on basically whatever you might want to. As with all open ended experiences it is what you make of it. I chose to work with a lab, which I got a lot out of.",
    "It is a required course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Learned much more from this than from an average CS class. Take it twice if you want to learn something very well and get course credit for it.",
    "You should start early and set a clear list of requirements from your professor!",
    "This course is really dependent on your advisor, but if you start thinking about it early, you can do something really cool.",
    "This is the senior requirement in Computer Science. I had Holly Rushmeier as an advisor, and she was very helpful in pushing my project and keeping me on schedule.",
    "No this was a mess"
