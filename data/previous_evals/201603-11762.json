   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to think critically and carefully about the anti-Black foundations of canonical and popular texts, from novels like Uncle Tom's Cabin to musicals like Porgy and Bess.",
    "I think this course really taught me a lot about the origins of black performance, the history of blackface minstrelsy, and how to think critically about performance (e.g., performance studies). With the heavy reading load, i also developed time management skills.",
    "I got a sense for a wide breath of material related to racial performance and American popular culture.",
    "On the first day of class, Brooks mentioned that quote, \"the past is never the past, it's not even really the past\" and the course truly proved that in examining constructions of race and a history of blackface minstrelsy that have led us to the current state of race relations in the US.",
    "I learned more than I thought I could about blackface - both minstrelsy and the contemporary, blackface by a different form. I learned so much about performance studies and representation in theater and films, and about the performance (even in every day life) of blackness and whiteness.",
    "I learned how to historically, socially and politically analyze blackface and cultural appropriation and the power dynamics that are at play there. The class has shifted the way I look at and think about African American art and artists and the way they interact with the U.S.'s history of oppression and genocide, pushing back against tropes, stereotypes and white conceptions of 'blackness'.",
    "Definitely take this class! Daphne Brooks has been the best professor I've had at Yale thus far. You'll read a wide breadth of material that's interesting and fun.",
    "The history and legacy of blackface, both paint and practice",
    "This was one of the most deeply relevant courses I have ever taken at Yale, providing me with the tools to think about race, the performance of race, and the lasting legacy\/origins of blackface minstrelsy that continue to plague our nation. I have grown as a thinker, as a writer, as an artist."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Brooks is incredibly generous, and just an amazing teacher. The depth of her knowledge and compassion is awe-inspiring. She is an actual genius, and just being in her presence every week will change you for the better.",
    "One obvious strength is Prof Brooks' ability to engage with her students and make learning very exciting. She's passionate about the subject matter and she certainly makes her students feel just as engaged and eager to learn. At the same time, I think because she is so passionate about these studies (after all, she has dedicated her career to this) she does not always form reasonable expectations about how much content can be covered in class or how much reading we can do within a week. My biggest frustration with this class was that each day felt like we jam packed so much in that we couldn't possibly give every reading, every text its justice as far as discussion went. Besides from the struggle of trying to complete the reading in time for class, often times we had barely any time to discuss the texts and it felt a little like wasted time. By the end of the semester, I stopped attempting to complete each weekly reading in its entirety- partly because it was truly difficult to keep up, but also because we often never got the chance to ruminate and dissect the readings to the extent that I would have liked to. Another frustration that I had with class was that discussion was always stifled because Prof. Brooks never let it flow. Instead she would make a list of people who had raised their hands and would go down the queue. Of course, this was a good way to allow everyone who wanted to speak the chance to contribute, but it also meant we never had an organic, continuous conversation. If you wanted to respond to something a classmate said, you would have to \"get in line\" and wait for 5-10 minutes before it was your turn. It just felt like the discussion was never able to evolve into lively discourse, because of the rigid structure that Prof. Brooks established.",
    "The course felt a little all over the place considering the amount of texts we were reading each week. I felt like we never really got into anything in depth.",
    "The strengths are the content of the class and Daphne Brooks' amazing energy. The weakness was the intense weekly workload that too much at times. Also sometimes discussions were hard to have flow organically because it was often just people stating their point rapidly and then moving down the list of hands raised so it was hard to have flowing discussions sometimes.",
    "This class was incredible! A phenomenal professor, an incredibly intelligent class of students, and an excellent syllabus. My only suggestion was to have less readings. There were so many readings we couldn't ever even touch on them all for 5 minutes each class. It was just too much to be able to get a lot out of each.",
    "While I can see the value of all the assigned reading for the course, it was often hard to actually finish all the reading in time for class, and if I did have time to finish, it was hard to get all the reading done and then think critically about it before walking into class. We also often did not have enough time to talk about all the material in class as well. I think if the readings were a bit shorter we could have delved into things more in depth.",
    "The strength of this class is the readings and other material (movies, art) Professor Brooks has put together for this class. There could not have been a better syllabus for this class. However, I do think that in many weeks there was too much material, to the point where there were not many weeks in which we were able to fully discuss all the primary sources for that week. Reducing the reading\/movie load in certain weeks would help really focus the discussion on that particular work and provide for a fuller and deeper discussion, allowing us to learn and analyze more than when we superficially discuss two or even three works.",
    "Strengths: Professor Brooks. She's truly an engaging, smart, and brilliant professor who truly cares about her students. The material was incredibly interesting as well. I learned so much this semester in terms of blackface and its perpetuation into the 21st century. Weaknesses: There was too much reading assigned. Anywhere ranging from 300-800 pages in a given week. There is no possible way one can do all this reading, so it's about picking and choosing. Furthermore, we never got to all the reading we did anyway. The class should be better organized in a way so that there's less reading that everyone does, and we're all able to comment on in class.",
    "There was too much material. We didn't get through a lot of it.",
    "There was way too much content on the syllabus and not enough time to really unpack any of it. I appreciated being exposed to so much content, but I wish course discussions had been more focused. I think it would've been helpful for Professor Brooks to read our blog posts before class and maybe focus the conversation around themes and ideas we were already starting to unpack, rather than flying all over and getting a surface level engagement with each and every text on the syllabus.",
    "Lots of readings, but everything seemed necessary",
    "The diversity of texts that you study in this course is certainly one of its strengths, allowing you to draw connections between minstrel plays, Richard Pryor, Leslie Jones, Amy Winehouse, Josephine Baker, Mark Twain - the list goes on. Professor Brooks does an incredible way of structuring the course thematically at the same time that she structures it chronologically - giving you a strong foundation in ways of thinking about the history and legacy of blackface performances in America, while always emphasizing that we are merely exploring the tip of the iceberg. The only weakness I might identify was the way discussions were run during the first few weeks of the seminar - instead of allowing conversation to flow naturally, to make sure everyone got a chance to speak, Prof Brooks would write down a list of folks who raised their hands, and read through that list to determine the next speaker. However, conversation became more natural as the class went on.",
    "ton of weekly reading, not all of which felt necessary, but you learn an incredible amount of history and theory in Black studies- incredibly pertinent to the moment."

   "comments": [
    "This class will change your life. It will likely change your perspective on U.S. history, as well as complicate your understanding of figures like Amy Winehouse, Mae West, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Also Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, a former student of Professor Brooks, came to speak to us during our last class. This class will offer you so many opportunities like that to engage with writers and speakers that you admire, whether in the flesh or through your academic work. If you listen to music, if you watch television, if you speak contemporary \"lingo\", you have a debt that you need to pay to Black cultural workers. This class is one way to start repaying that debt. Professor Brooks' amazing syllabus will teach you where so much of American culture comes from, and how we partake in a culture that is deeply rooted in blackface.",
    "While I really loved the subject matter of this course, I did not love the course itself. Prof Brooks assigned way too much reading constantly. I don't complain about this simply because I found it difficult to keep up with the reading (which is true), but because we never had nearly enough time to dive into each text and discuss it in-depth. Prof Brooks always jam packed so much into class, that often we barely had time to talk about really conceptually dense novels and works. Even worse, the way Prof Brooks structured the seminar did not facilitate in-depth discussion, because she never let it flow. Instead she would make a list of people who had raised their hands and would go down the list. Of course, this was a good way to allow everyone who wanted to speak the chance to contribute, but it also meant we never had an organic, continuous conversation. If you wanted to respond to something a classmate said, you would have to \"get in line\" and wait for 5-10 minutes before it was your turn. It just felt like the discussion was never able to evolve into lively discourse, because of the rigid structure that Prof. Brooks established.",
    "I would only because Professor Brooks is a wonderful person full of energy. Beyond that, this class is very disorganized which makes learning hard.",
    "I would recommend because Professor Brooks is amazing and you learn alot, but perhaps Credit\/D because the workload is really hard to manage along with other classes.",
    "Yes! This class is absolutely fantastic! Daphne Brooks has been my favorite professor at Yale (and I'm a senior!). You will learn more than you thought you could about blackface - both minstrelsy and in its contemporary forms. But more importantly, you will learn to think and synthesize information in deeper and different ways than you had previously been able to. This has been one of the classes I have gotten the most out of at Yale! Definitely take it if you're lucky enough to get in!",
    "The critical work being done in this class is extremely important. Even if this class doesn't sound up your usual alley, it is a class that every Yale student should take.",
    "Absolutely! It is definitely a tough class that won't come easy, but the books, art, movies and comedy sketches and discussions totally make it worth it. There are not too many assignments but there is quite a bit of reading each week so you definitely have to plan it to do it all. The topic of the class is also extremely relevant today.",
    "Yes! Take this class! Understand it's not going to be an easy A, but it's incredibly engaging, and you'll learn so much fascinating information. Furthermore, Professor Brooks is worth taking a class for. Certainly one of the gems at Yale.",
    "Definitely",
    "The organization of this course was questionable, but the content is really worth engaging with. Definitely take it if you're interested in engaging with the texts on the syllabus, but be warned that you'll walk away from the class with more questions than answers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Brooks is an amazing teacher who is very engaging and tries to make sure that everyone is also engaged with the work. Definitely not a light course in any meaning of the word but very very important and overall a really great time.",
    "Definitely! Illuminating a field of study and strain of thought in black studies",
    "Yes. Please take this class, especially if you are a theater artist, a writer, someone who consumes media regularly, or aspires to produce it, someone who wants to go into politics, someone who wants to try and understand our country and the mess we're in a little bit better. Minstrelsy is a part of American performance history that we do not talk enough about at all, and is pivotal that we unpack and study it. Professor Brooks is one of the best and most daring and most caring and most insightful and incredible professors at Yale. Study and learn from her and your peers in this class."
