   "comments": [
    "Labor Economics is a solid Econ Seminar, Professor Couch is relaxed and interesting, the workload at least this semester consisted of weekly reading responses and a final paper. The material is well-selected, and Professor Couch knows a lot on the subject in general, really making you feel like you are learning a lot.",
    "If you are interested in the material.",
    "Labor Economics was an interesting survey of several topics within the subject, including worker displacement, racial hiring, evaluation of programs. It was interesting when the econometrics was accessible.",
    "Read 2 to 3 articles every week, summarize in 1 page (it always takes more), decide what interests\/confuses you and discuss, hear Professor Couch's crazy stories about how difficult it is to do research in labor economics, write a term paper on ANYTHING you want. You can put in minimal effort and probably do OK, but the material is interesting! So don't do that! I'm not sure how this seminar stacks up against others (it's the first I've taken), but as I haven't seen similar classes offered at Yale, I'd say if you're interested in the material, take it.",
    "Really great class. Professor Couch is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject material. He's also a really nice guy to get to know. He's interested in talking to you on a personal level and sharing things about his own career, giving a more personal feel to the class. The material is interesting too. You'll get an in depth look at a broad array of issues in labor economics. One warning is that you have to write weekly summarizes of every paper you read, which means you have to do the reading, and you have to do it carefully. If you put in the work, it's pretty rewarding because it actually forces you to learn the material well. But it's a bit time consuming. The final paper isn't easy either. So be prepared to work pretty hard but get a lot out of the class.",
    "Econ 486 is an interesting seminar that exposes students to several topics of labor markets and labor economics, and makes students become aware of the underlying research methods. The discussions are always interesting, and Prof. Couch is always open for questions and willing to help. Even though students are asked to know some econometrics, you can do well in the class is to be able to read regression tables. He does address several regression models in class, but that is additional knowledge that you would not necessarily learn in an intro to econometrics course anyways."
