    "Taking the second semester DS Lit was a natural continuation of the first semester course, only this time you are way more prepared to deal with the texts. The coursework is not that different (still heavy), the books are somehow more demanding, but in the end the fulfillment I felt when I had understood the connecting thread between the Iliad and Omeros was priceless.",
    "The class definitely helped me appreciate and understand texts better through close reading. However, I often felt our section focused on these detail-oriented aspects of the texts at the expense of broader topics and themes."

    "The works studied are beautiful and rich, and the discussions on them are engaging. The workload is not as stressful as the other DS courses.",
    "When I was assigned to Professor Slanski's section, I had heard that though a tough grader, her section definitely improved your writing skills. I was happy to learn and work to improve in this setting. However, between paper topics that excluded some of my favorite texts such as Don Quixote, papers consistently graded late (we received two of our three essays of the semester only after we had completed the final exam), and class that was canceled several times over the semester, I definitely did not learn as much about writing as I had hoped to in the class. On the other hand, I really enjoyed some of the texts we read over the semester, particularly Don Quixote and Hadji Murat. The class certainly increased my knowledge and appreciation of these books."

    "I'd certainly recommend DS to interested students and hope they take advantage of the opportunity. If Prof. Slanski is your section leader, be prepared for a lot of work though. Our semester she started requiring weekly reading responses and overall she expects a lot out of her students."
