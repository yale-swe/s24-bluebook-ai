    "I learned how to relate thermodynamics, physics, and other theory to different types of aerospace vehicles. This course was filled with useful application and information from someone experienced in the aerospace industry.",

   "comments": [
    "Mr. Lehrach was a great teacher and kind person. He made class pleasant and interesting. There should be more engineering courses like this in the department. I actually learned about specific aerospace technology such as ramjets and rockets, which I'm very interested in. This class was also fairly theory heavy, but there was always plenty of areas for application. Weakness: it would be nice to have a TA for homework help sessions. Some of the textbook homework questions were ridiculous.",
    "The main strength of this course is how practically oriented it is. Lehrach has a strong industry background and keeps everything that we learn focused on practical applications. This is pretty much necessary by the design of the course. It's split up into units on each propulsion device, so any concept we learn is firmly anchored to the real application in the device. This is really great. This is how I wish every engineering course could be. I honestly don't have any serious qualms about this course. It was great.",
    "Strength - the class itself and Lehrach's powerpoints - exams were fair and pretty straightforward (and take-home! Big plus) Weakness - sometimes the homework seemed a bit unrelated.",
    "Great class, could be useful to do more examples in class"

    "This is a great elective credit for MechE students interested in aerospace. It covers a lot but in depth enough to be very useful. Lehrach is very helpful and happy to tailor the class a bit to the students interests.",
    "I would *definitely* recommend this course to another MENG student. It was great! The course is split up into units about various propulsion devices, from ramjet to turbojet to turbofan to rockets, so everything you learn is directly tied to the application in the device. It never feels like you don't know why you're learning something. Everything feels relevant and interesting. Ron Lehrach is a great lecturer, too. He's an extremely nice guy and likes to get to know the class throughout the semester. He explains concepts and problems very clearly, and by the end of the semester you'll have a strong grasp on how to approach propulsion calculations and what information you need to solve them. Bottom line, I *highly* recommend this course.",
    "I think so. Naturally it will be harder if you don't have a background in mechanical engineering. That being said, I found it interesting and Lehrach is a great guy.",
    "Take this class"
