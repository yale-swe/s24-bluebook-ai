   "comments": [
    "\"Child Care, Society, and Public Policy\" was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Janna and Jessica are amazing scholars and advocates. The organization of the class was very effective and the workload was always manageable (and enjoyable!). I would HIGHLY recommend this class to individuals, regardless of your major.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it! It was an amazing ride. A huge emphasis is placed on early childhood education which was a pleasant surprise. You will read some very extensive readings about problems in child care each week and they are always pretty interesting. You will lead a class discussion and write a few pages in response to one article for your week. In the end, a 15-page paper is assigned in which you must design your own proposal for child care reform. The professors are absolutely WONDERFUL - they are so sweet and caring and put so much into this class. There is literally no way you can not love them. They also bring in some guests to class that are huge in the field (and they are, too, by the way). So, amazing professors and interesting (and under-recognized!) material - what have you got to lose?",
    "This is a really great course for anyone interested in children in any respect. It primarily focuses on children under age 5. Readings can be redundant but interesting overall and not too burdensome. Janna and Jessica are incredibly kind people who have dedicated their lives to improving the quality of childcare. Both are enthusiastic and really available outside the classroom.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in policy, inequality, education, child development, and women's issues. This class covers a broad range of topics and the teachers make the course fun and engaging.",
    "read cool articles, talk with interesting people, learn upsetting things about the state of childcare in america. I RECOMMEND IT",
    "Yes I absolutely recommend this course. I took it because I wanted to take an education class, and I thought that early childhood stuff was second-best. Jessica and Janna have thoroughly convinced me that I was wrong, and that what goes on in the first five years of a child's life is just as influential (if not more so) as what happens in the second five years. If you, like me, are interested in education, education policy, funding for education, and generally how we as a country educate out children, YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS.Also, Jessica and Janna are great, lovely people that you will be happy to have met.",
    "I feel lucky that I was able to take a class with these two women. the work that they've done in New Haven is inspiring and it's great that they're willing to take time out of their busy schedules to teach Yale undergrads.",
    "This class is amazing! Janna and Jessica are SO smart and also incredibly kind and supportive (and they bring snacks to class!). Discussions were always interesting and enlightening. The seminar offers a glimpse into a policy issue often overlooked but so incredibly important to all segments of American society. This course is an obvious choice for people who are into early childhood education\/have volunteered at a child care center or preschool before, but I would also recommend it to anyone interested in inequality, poverty, or social policy. It's also not a ton of work week to week, so don't be worried about adding it to a tough schedule. Basically, if you have an opportunity to take this class TAKE IT - you won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to other students!"
