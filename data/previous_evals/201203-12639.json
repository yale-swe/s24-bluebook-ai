   "comments": [
    "Math 310 is a basic complex analysis course that all math majors (and many in related fields) should take. Many of the results are beautiful, although the course at taught by Margulis is somewhat boring.",
    "Take it. Beautiful class, nice problem sets. Do additional reading in Stein and Shakarchi, and avoid reading Lang.",
    "I found that the languid pace of Margulis' lecture sapped the excitement out of some very interesting material, though it did make the class quite easy. Take it if you are excited to learn the subject or if someone else is teaching.",
    "Complex Analysis, taught by Professor Margulis, has been one of the most wonderful subjects I have ever studied. It really is an elegant and beautiful subject that I think all math majors should explore. It is taught by different professors, so make sure you understand who is teaching it.Professor Margulis (a winner of Fields& Wolf!) presents the material in a really well organized fashion, and his hw& handout& lectures all fit very nicely. All the homework questions, as I was reviewing the whole course, had some relevancy to what we learned later in the course, and it was surprising. Yet, a downside is that Professor Margulis is aged, and so his lectures are very low-energy. Shop it during the shopping period, and if you feel like you can get engaged through the lecture, you should be fine for the rest of the semester.Stick close to your notes& textbooks& problem sets. And you should be fine for all the exams. Also, keep in mind that everyone in this class is very intelligent. Exams are not that easy (nor is it difficult), yet a silly tiny mistake can get you to the bottom half of the curve. I think the average\/median of each exam was around 90, which shows how a lot of people in the class are very good",
    "Yes if you are a math major. Better than alternatives.",
    "You'll learn to do some crazy stuff with complex analysis, which can be interesting. Margulis kind of killed the course for me, though - he was just so boring to me.",
    "A fairly intro class on complex analysis. Reasonable problem sets. The exams are quite predictable, and should not surprise you if you know your material well. Margulis' lectures are easy to follow, however they can be quite monotonous at times.",
    "Complex Analysis involves some pretty nice theory and the integration techniques you learn are kind of neat. Nothing that will blow you away though.",
    "Margulis is a remarkable mathematician. The class is easy. Watch for the curve though.",
    "Margulis follows the textbook pretty closely except for a few topics for which he hands out notes. As a result, you don't really need to go to lecture although most of the class does anyway. Problem sets are definitely difficult, but this is normal for math classes above 300. The exams are pretty straight-forward if you know the basic material well and do the practice exams. However, be warned: the average intelligence of the class is very high and while Margulis curves fairly, his curve is not by any means easy. If you are not a studious math\/physics\/quant major who goes to lecture and studies a lot for exams, you will probably get a C in this class.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student if they didn't have a lot of background in math or if Margulis is teaching it again. I would recommend it to another student who had significant background in mathematics if there was a different professor.",
    "The material makes up for Margulis' difficult to follow lectures. If you're a math major, there's really no question as to whether you should take this class since complex analysis is one of the most beautiful areas of math. Even if you're not a math major, if you have the mathematical background to take this, I would recommend taking the class just for the material.",
    "It is a huge branch of mathematics-I think it would be a shame not to take it before you graduate. Margulis almost always teaches it, and I think he does a good job."
