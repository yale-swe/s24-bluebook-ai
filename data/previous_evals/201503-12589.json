   "comments": [
    "Russian 110 is an amazing class. Pretty standard amount of work you would expect for an intro language course. Professor Titus is awesome.",
    "This course is a great introduction to the language of Russian. The course is structured so that it eases you into the language in a small class setting and truly does not expect you to have had any prior experience with Russian. Be prepared, however, to put in the work necessary to keep up with this class, as Russian is completely different from most other languages. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone considering studying Russian.",
    "The class does have daily homework, and sometimes it can be a pain. But in the end, when you learn a whole new alphabet and are speaking the language, you will feel great. It's definitely a rewarding experience and I'd recommend anyone try to learn Russian. It's an amazing language and much cooler than the usual french\/spanish that most people learn in high school.",
    "Fantastic language and course to learn. Plenty of great opportunities to use the language after the class, and the small number of students give you a great chance to succeed, as long as you're willing to put in the necessary time and effort.",
    "Good course, as long as you're willing to put the effort in. The professor does her best to make sure all students learn as much as possible.",
    "Russ 110 is a great introductory language course for a very useful and interesting language.",
    "I would thoroughly encourage any student seriously interested in learning Russian (given that it is an inherently complex and complicated language) to take this course. Having said that, I would make sure that any such recommendation be validated by a professor as engaged and knowledgeable as Prof Titus."
