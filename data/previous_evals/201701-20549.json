   "comments": [
    "It was interesting to find out how environmental policy in the United States is shaped and takes place. I also learned that the agencies are severely under-funded and require citizens to push for environmental change.",
    "Lots about the environment (big interest of mine)",
    "Quite honestly, I wasted dozens of hours in this class. The biggest waste of money, around $5000, I think I'll ever spend in life. The goals of the course were too juvenile. It was supposed to develop skepticism of governments and organizations, help craft a framework to analyze environmental policy, and lead students to become more cognizant consumers. But with these skills already in place, I was filled with dread each time I walked to class, knowing I could have learned more watching edutainment on YouTube or reading a book. Only take this if environmental issues are foreign to you. If you're already familiar with the content, this class will be the biggest drag of your life.",
    "The current and historical implications of environmental law.",
    "Not much. I think this could be one of the most interesting political science courses (and even one of the most interesting courses at yale). But the lectures were very dull and basically recited off a power point slide. The exams did not test your knowledge, you just memorized essays that are given to your before and hope you can get it all down on paper in the limited time. Would be better off doing take homes or having an exam to test a range of topics covered in class.",
    "This course taught me that there are many things wrong with aspects of society that we decide to ignore purposefully. I began to question everything; read food packaging more carefully, and decided that being aware is more important than existing.",
    "I learned about different environmental case studies in a legal context.",
    "very comprehensive...learned a lot about the limitations and merits of environmental law, particularly in the US and US relations to other countries",
    "I learned about the way policy is enacted through law and other efforts. I also learned about the history of various environmental interests over the last century.",
    "Most importantly, I've become more aware of the US government's lack of transparency and now appreciate how difficult it is to litigate with all the secrecy present. I've also learned how to apply the course material in the context of the current administration, which has different ideas and morals about precaution v. reaction, reasonable certainty of no harm, solid scientific evidence from research, etc.",
    "Ethical and practical implications of environmental law, necessity for environmental law, messiness of environmental law, flaws and strengths, importance of burden of proof.",
    "Interesting facts about bombs and trees and chemicals. Not much more.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental factors and dangers that either knew of before, or had no idea they previously existed. I am extremely interested in environmental hazards and what we can do to avoid them. This course did a great job at identifying these hazards and coming up with solutions for the future.",
    "I learned to think about some important concepts like burden of proof and scientific uncertainty when analyzing environmental problems.",
    "I learned broadly about many different topics regarding the sphere of environmental policy, looking at different legislation and eras of political movement to respond to various environmental issues.",
    "Learned a ton about environmental law and how our government regulates and produces legislation for the environment.",
    "Essentially you learn all about the different impacts that various things have on the environment and how these things are regulated. For example, pesticides, nuclear weapons testing, palm oil, etc.",
    "Haphazard knowledge of various environmental issues, but only a small sampling of human-centric ones that specifically affect the quality of air, water, and land management... like there was literally almost nothing about climate change in this whole course. Or about politics and law! That background is not as common knowledge as the syllabus seems to assume.",
    "I developed an overview of several major legal and regulatory issues present in the world today, going into legal detail and court cases for many of the national-level (US) issues.",
    "I knew a lot about the material but not individual law",
    "Very little. This class was disorganized, the lectures were not really related to Environmental Politics and Law (the supposed topic of the course) and the readings were not helpful or engaging. Section was also not well run or informative. Not a good class.",
    "A more critical way of looking at the world in the sense of environment, health, and our role in these",
    "I gained a lot of very helpful insight to the politics behind many environmental issues and it really expanded my worldview in a great way.",
    "knowledge of the environment and accompanying US and state laws protecting it",
    "This course taught me a great deal about different important issues in the field of environmental politics\/law. I particularly learned a lot about the law related to human health and chemicals.",
    "This class provided an insight to life that I may have otherwise overlooked. It was truly a course valuable for any yale student. This class enhanced my ethics and reasoning skills.",
    "I have never taken a class on the environment. It is very interesting to learn about how laws change with different administrations. I leaned so much about policies and laws that directly affect me and what I eat and how I live.",
    "It taught me to treat the environment with care and understand that small actions can have large effects",
    "A lot about the environment and related politics.",
    "I learned about different environmental issues that may not be at the forefront of our minds in our daily lives. Also, I learned to be critical of why certain laws are set\/not set and how knowledge and money equates to power in law and politics.",
    "I was introduced to a lot of environmental problems I wasn't aware of, and I learned an enormous amount about the politics of these problems and why they are still ongoing.",
    "I was able to learn a lot of environmental policies and government regulation. This class made me more aware to modern day environmental issues and ways that we can improve them.",
    "This course taught me a lot about various cases of issues related to environmental problems that impact human life. These case studies were taught well, and Professor Wargo provided a lot of depth and insight into them. I also appreciated that he would always extrapolate the analysis of each situation to broader themes. However, the course was not really about politics or law as the name may suggest. Politics and law were included descriptively in the study of each environmental issue, with analysis of the shortcomings of the politics and law in each case. However, I did not really learn about environmental law generally nor about how environmental policy works generally. Rather, I learned about how politics and law played into various environmental issues that have risen. This was fine--the course was still educational--but just was not what I expected.",
    "cramming",
    "This course provided a very thorough introduction to the intersection between modern environmental crises and the frameworks in which the American law system has attempted to mediate them, and also compares these techniques to standards around the world. The class touches on the important issue of environmental justice, how different communities are treated unequally due to race, class, gender, etc., and also how our modern industrial systems affect local environments and our health on a daily basis.",
    "I learned a lot about a variety of environmental issues and steps that have been taken to address them. I learned how to assess complicated political problems and try to come up with solutions that take multiple views into account.",
    "Many details in the process of environmental policy abd litigation; technical law terms; how to evaluate the quality and impact of laws",
    "I learned about the extent to which humans are constantly exposed to toxins, whether from outside air pollution, the plastics that various objects are made out of, indoor household products, or outside radiation. I also learned that governmental secrecy, advertisements, and the market power of companies, have been instrumental to the relatively slow progress of environmental policy change over the years in the United States."

   "comments": [
    "It was very well-structured and informative. The readings were challenging to understand when they were just lists of acts or statutes. I like the idea of allowing students to prepare for their finals answers for the mid-term and final however there was no indication as to what warranted different grading levels and it was extremely inconsistent.",
    "Really interesting topics! no improvements needed!",
    "weaknesses - little to no feedback on midterm essays",
    "Lectures were disorganized and unfocused. There was a lack of analysis in all readings assigned. This course needs a total transformation before I'd recommend it to another student.",
    "Lectures were really interesting, however, then tended to focus more on the environment than on law. With no background in law, I was hoping to learn more about basic political systems. I did enjoy lectures though!",
    "I think it would be a better course if the exams were take home, 24 hour papers. I know that my responses would have been more developed and intricate in that case.",
    "Strength: lectures are very interesting. I found myself looking forward to it. Weakness: Prof Wargo doesn't portray the non-left side to issues, which is important because students need to be able to respond to non-leftist arguments and should have a well-rounded view of issues.",
    "Lots and lots of information...go to class!",
    "I wouldn't change a thing about this course!",
    "Good: very broad overview gives you many examples of major themes.",
    "I felt like the lectures at the beginning were too slow, especially when we spent several lectures talking about Vieques when it could have been condensed into one or two. However, the rest of the course was awesome and I really enjoyed it!",
    "The course was great a giving a brief overview of many environmental topics. The tests were fair. No need for much improvements",
    "I think that the course attempted to cover a wide range of cases in a way that wasn't connected very well. I think that the course was a little bit too focused on case studies, rather than focusing on specific laws and then talking about their broader implications. Also, often there were slides with lists of important laws or themes, but they weren't explained very well. Furthermore, the exam questions (particularly the first exam) asked us to make suggestions\/recommendations that I did not feel we had nearly enough information\/experience to make.",
    "This course was really interesting a lot of fun to take! The lectures were very informative. The readings were certainly a bit long, but manageable.",
    "Beginning of course is very boring but other than that it is well organized and interesting.",
    "I think that the lectures were a little dry at times, so by possibly making them a little more interesting, the course would be improved. Also, I think that the grading was extremely subjective for the exams, and this is coming from somebody who did very well on both exams. I think that maybe making the grading very clear across all TAs would be helpful.",
    "One thing I wish about this class: I came into it with not very much (or any) knowledge about how the US government\/legal system worksmaybe this is more of a personal failing, but I wouldve really appreciated if there had been a lecture or two at the beginning devoted to teaching us the basics about how court decisions\/congress rulings worked\/affected each other, or if this knowledge had been more explicitly conveyed throughout. I think it wouldve really helped my understanding of how different pieces of legislation related to one another. I also really hate essay tests where youre given a handful of questions to prepare for and only a couple of them appear on the exam because its totally possible to just get unlucky and the ones that you felt better prepared for arent on it, while someone else might be having the opposite experienceso I feel like its pretty unfair. If anyone is reading this (e.g. John Wargo). you feel me?",
    "It was very interesting but the TA grading was unfair.",
    "Weaknesses: The course doesn't really offer an introduction to Environmental Politics and Law (as it is intended to) it just offers a sampling of topics that Prof. Wargo finds interesting. Lectures were disorganized and not very relevant. They didn't have larger narratives and didn't really connect to broader themes. Professor Wargo is not a good lecturer. Section was not helpful. The readings were also not helpful. This class needs to be redesigned from the ground up and should ideally be taught by a different professor.",
    "AMAZING class, my favorite at Yale. Great job of giving interesting material, teaching in a way that included different types of media and exposure, strong section meetings.",
    "This class is a great survey class, but the exams are pretty unfair. They pretty much just test your ability to regurgitate what was on the slides from class, which doesn't seem to be what yale is all about.",
    "I think this is a very important course that has a lot of potential. The lectures and readings tend to be dry, but the topics are very interesting. I think the lectures should be reorganized. Some lectures felt really repetitive and could have been condensed to a single lecture (Vieques). Other lectures were disorganized and the main points were unclear (Adirondacks). Also, the course focused on providing recommendations to environmental issues but failed to provide enough examples or case studies that would inform these recommendations. When I wrote the final paper, I felt very unprepared to make informed recommendations.",
    "The content was wonderful I found the lecture topics so interesting!",
    "Bad TF ruined the class for me.",
    "great professors and TFs interesting material and not too much work",
    "One area of strength was that the discussion sections really brought out deeper discussion of specific topics brought up during lecture. In addition, the types of questions that we tried to answer during discussion sections were very intriguing and important.",
    "The class content was excellent and excellently planned out. The professor was very fair with the midterm and final, giving your prior notice to script essays for the exams.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings and lectures in this class, and felt that I learned a lot of very valuable information. My biggest complain with the course is with regards to organization and evaluations. More reading is assigned than students are expected to do, which I often felt made it difficult to hold students accountable to do almost any reading at all, and as a result, section discussion often suffered. The midterm and final exams were also awful. By giving students the questions in advance, it seemed to devolve into an opportunity to regurgitate as many facts from the course as possible, and was totally unclear, especially on the final, how to demonstrate any analytical ability.",
    "I thought the midterm testing was poorly design and not indicative of what we had focused on in class. I also found the readings to be unrealistically long and unrewarding.",
    "This class is very structured and easy to follow along with the time line. Its a great informative course! One way this could be improved is with clearer feedback on what they are looking for in the answers for the final. I thought my answers were adequate and thorough but still received a poor grade.",
    "I thought the course was taught very well for being a lecture. It would also be a great seminar.",
    "Readings were always very interesting. Lectures were a little dry.",
    "There were a lot of cool subjects and I learned about things I wouldn't have encountered otherwise. However, I do wish there was more of a focus on the actual laws.",
    "The lecture benefits from the use of pictures and videos alongside content from slides. The readings are recent and interesting. The course could be improved through more interactive classes to increase engagement during lecture.",
    "This course is really interesting if you're interested in topics related to the environment or the politics of it. Wargo kindly puts his powerpoints on Canvas, so sitting through his monotonous lectures isn't always necessary. His personal anecdotes, extensive knowledge, and interest in the topics he discusses would be enough to convince you to come to class, though.",
    "The TA's were very helpful with this course. Gave feedback and were quick to respond to emails. The lecture having wifi in the first half of the semester was a bummer but once we moved locations it was helpful.",
    "The case studies were taught well, and Professor Wargo provided a lot of depth and insight into them. I also appreciated that he would always extrapolate the analysis of each situation to broader themes. It may have been nice if there was more rigorous critical thinking involved on the part of the students surrounding these issues; however, I think the level of the course as an introductory class and its scale is not intended for that, so the course otherwise accomplished its objectives quite well.",
    "This class provides a very interdisciplinary overview that covers issues from a variety of social, economic, geopolitical, legal, and health lenses alongside the traditional concerns of the environment. The stories are captivating and Professor Wargo is a very skilled orator.",
    "This was a fascinating (albeit terrifying) course with a good survey of a lot of important and often overlooked environmental issues. I feel better equipped to go out and deal with these issues now. However, it was a lot of information to digest very quickly. This wouldn't be a real issue, except that there wasn't a lot of time for discussion. Section meetings were slow, despite the valiant attempts of our TAs. I think other students just didn't feel as engaged as they should have. I'm not sure how to address that- the material is brilliant, and the professor is incredibly knowledgable.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. The professor went into great detail, and I learned a lot.",
    "The course is very fascinating. However, at times, Professor Wargo could be a bit dry as a lecturer."

   "comments": [
    "This is a good course to take if you have any interest in the environmental status and policy formation of the United States, otherwise there are much better classes to take if you are looking for an easy 5th class.",
    "YES!",
    "I wish I would've had a warning before taking Environmental Politics and Law. EVST\/PLSC 255 is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Each lecture is just a regurgitation of facts, many commonly known to people familiar with environmental issues. The instructor constantly poses questions to his students, but never makes arguments about the best answers to the questions he asks. You'd be better off reading a $50 textbook on public and environmental health than spending $5000 on this course. It lacks rigor. Other students fail to do assigned readings, so section ends up being a regurgitation of lecture (great, another 50 minutes of this!). The course is a vortex of pain, and once you're done, any class you take will be profound since Environmental Politics and Law collapses the floor of standards required for a course at Yale. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS HELD AT GUNPOINT, or threatened with some other form of death. I wish I hadn't.",
    "Yes, great class to get an overview of environmental politics and law",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale--strongly recommend to anyone interested in a variety of topics pertinent to the environment today.",
    "I would. I think that the course covers important material that everyone should be exposed to.",
    "It's definitely interesting, though one-sided in that it doesn't portray non-left views at all and leaves students without a full understanding of issues.",
    "You learn about very important environmental problems that affect everyone's every life. Presentations are interesting and workload is very fair.",
    "Great course: Professor Wargo is a knowledgeable lecturer and was personally involved in a lot of the case studies himself. The reading load is fair: light for some weeks, heavier for others. There are two exams (non-cumulative) and a final research paper which allowed students to explore the history and policies of an environmental issue of their choice.",
    "The lectures are not very engaging, but the material is important and relevant.",
    "Yes!",
    "Every day I walked into this class and felt a little more discouraged about where the environment is going. Professor Wargo took us through a whirlwind of environmentally-related problem areas that, especially within the current administration, seem like they will eventually be tossed aside. At times, while Professor Wargo was a bit of a dry lecturer, the topics were extremely interesting and worth looking into. I felt like it was extremely useful to gain this context, and it was a light workload, so I recommend the class if you're just looking for a place where you can gain topical, relevant knowledge for the future.",
    "I don't really get it. Maybe I approached this class with the wrong attitude, but I don't understand what the point of this class is. Some of the topics we cover are fairly interesting, but it's mostly a survey course of serious problems on the planet that you could read about in the New Yorker. Not many avenues for intellectual engagement or concrete action.",
    "Definitely take this class. Extremely interesting material.",
    "If you have no experience in environmental stuff, this might be a good course to take to get a very broad intro, but you aren't going to learn a lot about actual environmental laws unfortunately. The lectures aren't very connected and Professor Wargo often goes on tangents about things that he has more experience in\/is more interested in, which can be interesting, but doesn't necessarily help you learn.",
    "This class was very poorly organized. The lectures were dry and there was no logical flow to the class from lecture to lecture. There were a few interesting lectures where I actually learned, but in most, I did not. The class aims to cover too much and ends up not really covering anything.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class covers hugely important topics. The lectures are interesting and filled with a lot of information and background, but with good analysis and application for the future.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, easy political science credit. Great TAs in the class. Essay questions are given before the exams, but you should definitely still study ALOT for the exams because grading is harsh and you need to know a lot of details to get an A.",
    "I think my biggest regret at Yale may be this course. Dont take it. I know there are lots of reviews for Yale courses that say stuff like this but honestly dont take it. This classs structure left a lot to be desired for creating a really FULL understanding of concepts Like we would learn about all the problems surrounding certain practices and the difficulties with regulating them, but I never felt like I really knew what needed to be done when we moved onto a new unit. Often unclear in this class when he tells us things whether its the way that it currently is, or the way that it was before a certain piece of legislation passed makes it hard to understand the chronology and the ultimate outcome of important events. Then, come exam time, the grading was very inconsistent between different TAs. I've never had a class where the material was so simple and my level of effort was so high that I'm still going to end up doing so badly in. And don't think this is just another butt-hurt review coming from someone who didn't \"have what it takes\" to do well in environmental politics and law.. I am a junior EVST major with a (slightly) above average GPA so i am telling you this to exemplify the fact that it can happen to anyone. There are some instances when the intellectual challenge of a course or engagement with the material makes it worthwhile even when you know you're not going to do well in it - this is NOT one of them!",
    "Yes. Fantastic course with great topics and discussion.",
    "Easy class but depending on TA grading can be tough. Still interesting and especially after take American Environmental history.",
    "Absolutely not. Do not take this course. You will not learn about environmental politics and law - you will just talk about random topics that Professor Wargo finds interesting. This class is especially painful to sit through if you have even a slight background in environmental studies. Do not take this class.",
    "Yes! It teaches you to look at everyday routines practices and commonalities and address them as problems that need solutions. It reveals brutal realities in our world that you may have never known about otherwise, and inspires you to change them.",
    "DON'T take this course if you want an easy A. There isn't that much work, but the level of detail expected on the exams is absurd. If you are good at memorizing f and regurgitating facts, this course is for you. If you actually want to learn about environment law, try EVST320. That being said, if you get to know Professor Wargo he's actually pretty great.",
    "Definitely, all good reviews, professor Wargo is lovely!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student as long as they have a different TF than me.",
    "great political science class. interesting material and professor",
    "I would recommend this course. The material is very interesting and covers a lot of fundamental questions that underly environmental law\/politics.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale.",
    "yes",
    "In the end--no. I took this as a requirement for energy studies, and I have found it disappointing. The ideal Yale class demands much of the student and much of the teacher. This class demanded very little of the teacher, and only weekly readings from the student that were largely informational--but never transformative. My main issue with this class was the format of the exams, which required you to know specific legal legislation we did not cover in class. Upon taking the exams, I realized this class is requiring me to regurgitate random information rather than learn new skills. I did learn about case studies such as the adirondacks, haze in indonesia, and vieques--but I feel like reading a couple articles would have done just as well.",
    "YES! Take this course. I am not a Political Science major and I really enjoyed this course. It is informative and interesting.",
    "I would, everyone should take it because of the amazing take aways.",
    "Yes- it is an important class to take.",
    "If you are more interested in politics and where to focus action I would recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely. The course highlights environmental problems everyone should know about as well as possible solutions to those problems. Additionally, it highlights the complicated nature of environmental laws and what challenges certain laws face.",
    "Yes, if you have any interest in the environment or environmental politics. You learn about a lot of interesting topics, like radionuclides and how the government hid them from us to food quality to tobacco.",
    "Yes, it makes you more aware to the environment. Also was interesting to take the course during the new administration.",
    "This course taught me a lot about various cases of issues related to environmental problems that impact human life. These case studies were taught well, and Professor Wargo provided a lot of depth and insight into them. I also appreciated that he would always extrapolate the analysis of each situation to broader themes. However, the course was not really about politics or law as the name may suggest. Politics and law were included descriptively in the study of each environmental issue, with analysis of the shortcomings of the politics and law in each case. However, I did not really learn about environmental law generally nor about how environmental policy works generally. Rather, I learned about how politics and law played into various environmental issues that have risen. This was fine--the course was still educational--but just was not what I expected.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Lectures were interesting, but overall it was not constructive. You would be far better off sitting in on the lectures with John Wargo. All else aside from the lectures were a waste of time and unproductive. I do, however admire Prof. Wargo and wish that there were a way to engage with him on the subject outside of the lecture hall.",
    "This is an excellent class that makes environmental issues very accessible to students with a variety of interdisciplinary interests. The workload is well-paced and the content is very interesting, engaging, and pertinent to our lives.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have any interest in environmental issues. This class will scare you- you're going to walk out of there realizing just how messed up our country and our planet are. But, you're also going to walk out better equipped to deal with those issues. Professor Wargo gives a lot of information and you have to read a lot of supplementary material, but it's worth it to know exactly what's going on in the world.",
    "I would because you learn a lot about the technical processes and considerations in creating and enforcing environmental law and policy.",
    "Yes-this class will teach you to have a new perspective and the workload is light."
