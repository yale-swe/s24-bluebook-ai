   "comments": [
    "this class is pretty much what the title says it is: it is the history of medical imaging, starting with x-rays in 1895. we covered x-rays, ct scans, pet scans, mri, nmri, ultrasound, etc... the reading was very interesting, and i didn't mind doing it each week.",
    "I would recommend this class as an expansive overview of the history of medical imaging. But be prepared to be bored some days.",
    "If you care only about the information from the reading, there's a lot to learn and everything's extremely interesting as long as you're interested in medical imaging and its history. The course revolves around the book written by the instructor, which is a great read and not difficult at all. However, going to class is the difficult part: Professor Kevles has a lot of interesting experiences to share about her research, but likes to dominate the discussion. I guess it also depends on the students taking the class, but no one likes to argue with the professor--she won't let you win. Overall, it's a poorly taught class on great material.",
    "This course is exactly what the title indicates: an overview of the development of medical imaging from the discovery of the x-ray in 1895 to the present. It shows how the x-ray (and ensuing technologies) impacted all facets of culture, not only the medical world, and many of the contributing figures, fields and factors are discussed with some depth. Professor Kevles' book Naked to the Bone is the textbook for the course and is extremely well-written and is worth reading even if you don't take the class. A fascinating course.It's not too much reading for a seminar and you can write the research paper on whatever you want.",
    "Great course--take it if you are already a humanities major (I was an engineering major). Lots of supplemental readings that I read and studied so hard for no reason--just enjoy the class and take it easy like everyone else. It doesn't even matter how hard you work, just as long as you give the answer the professor wants."
