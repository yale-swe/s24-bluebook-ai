    "I had to take this as a required class for global, otherwise I wouldn't have. It's basically AP Statistics + regressions. Not too difficult, but for some reason the midterm was more difficult than we all thought it would be. The material isn't challenging whatsoever, but Justin Thomas loves to emphasize theoretical material, which is kind of annoying, since it's hard to know what exactly he's looking for. He's a great professor, but the material is so dry that he's fighting a losing battle every lecture. Overall, if you're into this kind of stats stuff or you have to take the class for the global major, go for it, otherwise look else for a QR.",
    "This is a great stats class for \"non-math people\". I had never taken stats before and now feel like I have a solid understanding of a lot of super useful concepts that I can apply in almost any field. Not to mention, stata is a great program to know how to use, and it appeals to employers when you tell them you know how to use stata for data analysis. Professor Thomas is also a great guy and makes lectures engaging and easy to understand.",
    "Your basic intro to stats class with a public policy focus.",
    "As far as stats classes go, this one is probably one of the most interactive and engaging ones. Professor Thomas is a great professor, makes everything clearer and more interesting. So yes, I recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're looking for a social science stats class. JT is a fantastic professor -- super engaging and responsive. Possibly the only person who could make a stats lecture laugh-out-loud-funny. He's also just a nice guy - he took the time to learn all of our names, which was sweet. The workload is manageable and the exams are really fair. Section involves learning Stata, which is one of those useful career skills you should probably try to pick up before you peace out from Yale.",
    "If you are looking for a QR credit, this class is a good option. You will learn helpful information and no prior math like calc is necessary. That said, this is not a gut. Psets require time and energy, especially if you are new to Stata software. Professor Thomas is great!",
    "Would recommend for Global Majors of course!",
    "Great option as a QR credit. Relatively straightforward and useful for life, basically (if you're reading any social science research).",
    "Great, practical QR credit. Justin Thomas makes it fun.",
    "I would recommend AQA to students, even non-Global Affairs students, if you want to learn statistics through policy-oriented questions that can be answered\/addressed using the statistics skills you learn. The professor is a great lecturer, but if you learn slower or don't have statistics background, it can be overwhelming. Stata was intimidating for me so I spent hours doing problem sets, but if you are looking to gain hard skills i.e. using this software then this is an opportunity to do so. That said, if you learn better in a seminar course, especially with QRs, then the lecture format may not be for you.",
    "Yes if you are a Global major. If you are not, I think you have to really want to learn the subject matter for it to be worthwhile.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT: Prof. Thomas is AMAZING. funny and engaging. manages to make stats fun. If you avoid QRs this is the QR for you! You will learn a lot and be able to look at sociology, polisci\/ other quantitative studies and understand what you're looking at. Stata is a pain, but the problem sets really aren't all that difficult. Statistics are notoriously boring and tedious and with Prof. Thomas learning the material was easy and interesting. Prof. Tomas focused on answering every question even if that meant covering less material to make sure everyone was on the same page and to help us learn and understand rather than memorize. Every explanation Prof. Thomas gave made sense, his teaching was extremely clear, and for every answer we gave we had to show we understood the answers we had memorized by explaining them in \"plain english\". He used examples like Mike Tyson as income\/education outliers and the Bill Gate's phenomenon to explain the why behind the central limit theorem. GREAT CLASS.",
    "Really good course, Professor Thomas is super dynamic and down-to-earth and gives great lectures. I've found the material helpful in analyzing data for other social science courses. Lectures are more like large discussions, which is really important for understanding the material. This isn't a gut QR, it's really useful for any kind of social science stats analysis--I'd recommend to folks outside the Global Affairs major too.",
    "I would recommend this course for an introduction to statistics. The use of stata and the knowledge that comes about the program is also useful.",
    "I would recommend it. I think that any student, Global Affairs or not, has something to learn from an analysis course like GLBL 121. Justin was good at introducing real life examples into everything we did, which really helped in learning the material. Overall, I understood the value of what we learned pretty immediately, which was awesome. It can be slow at times, but Justin and the TF's did their best to make it interesting.",
    "You should definitely take this class if you want to learn the kinds of statistics used in social science. I think this would be useful not only for Global Affairs majors, but for Political Science, History, Sociology, EP&E as well. After the course, you will be able to understand statistical methodologies used by social scientists in their research. You will be able to interpret the data they present. And most importantly, you will be able to think critically about their study design and assess the quality of the evidence they present. You will also be able to build your own datasets and analyze them. Basically, if regression tables confuse you and you want them to make sense, take the class. It opens up a lot of avenues for conducting quantitative research in your social science classes.",
    "GLBL 121 is fairly well explained by its course description. It begins from the very basics of statistics and gets you all the way to analyzing multivariate regression tables (found in many of my Political Science and Global Affairs papers) and even generating these tables through Stata, a digital statistics program. After taking the course, I feel I have sufficient skills to apply to research papers in my courses and potentially in professional (internship, etc) experiences. I took this course to gain quantitative analysis skills and learn some basic functions of Stata, and I think I accomplished that. I did not have to take this course as distributional requirement or for the Global Affairs major (I'm Poli Sci), but I feel it taught me important technical skills for the long term."
