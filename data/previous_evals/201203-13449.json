    "Sure, its a fun credit.",
    "This class is a survey of the Beatle's work and how it was created.",
    "You will learn everything you want to know about the Beatles. About how they recorded, and about their history, too. Scott knows all. It's not heavy on music theory or technical stuff, which could be a downside if that's what you're looking for, but it's still so fulfilling.",
    "I probably wouldn't take this class again\u00e2\u0080\u0094for what it was, it was a very good course but I didn't find the subject material interesting enough to study for an entire semester. Lots of anecdotal history and stories about the production of various songs. 30 page partner paper at the end was really difficult to do during finals season.",
    "This class is awesome. It requires some musical knowledge, but even if you are not a huge fan of the Beatles to begin with, this class will convince you of how interesting and amazing the Beatles were.",
    "YES! if you love The Beatles you'll love the class. basic knowledge of music theory is required, but dont be afraid to take the class if you have little knowledge of music theory, will just mean you have to work a little harder for papers.loads of writing though (two 5-10 page papers and one 25-30 page paper to be done in pairs), all this without a writing credit! so beware (but you learn a lot by writing the papers).",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "If this course is offered again, you should definitely take it! It's a really fun topic and a nice break from the typical workload.",
    "If you like the Beatle's, definitely take this class!!",
    "For someone who's not a music major, I felt like not having so sharp of hearing seemed more disadvantageous than it actually was, especially because there is published sheet music for all Beatles songs. I hope the seminar returns in the future. It's exactly what professors or anyone else should try to make if they want to open up a little bit of what actual musical analysis is like to people who like music but never have taken college music courses.",
    "This class was basically a weekly, 2 hour mini-lecture (about 15 students) where Professor Freiman went through a new album by the Beatles each week and analyzed it from a compositional and recording perspective (heavier on the recording). Freiman talked about chord structures in songs, recording technology, recording trends, and a little about the Beatles lives as their narrative went along. Freiman assigned us reading from \"Can't Buy Me Love\" by Jonathan Gould, an awesome biography on the Beatles and other books as well as listening- usually one Beatles album each week plus other music that influenced the Beatles. We had two ten page papers analyzing Beatles songs of our choice and a final 25 page paper that we wrote with a partner. Overall, I came out of the class having learned a lot more about the Beatles and about other bands around at the time. I would recommend this class, but keep in mind that because of the two hour format with little actual discussion with other students during the class, it can get somewhat dull at times."
