    "Very nice overview of species counterpoint and contrapuntal composition in the style of Bach. Would highly recommend if you have an interest in Baroque model composition.",
    "A fantastic course!! If you are interested in Bach at all, you should definitely take the class regardless of your major. You focus a lot on species counterpoint for the first half of the semester, and the second half focuses more on composition and analysis. Our composition assignments this semester were to write a Minuet&Bourree in the style of Bach's keyboard suites, an Invention, and the \"torso\" of a fugue--exposition +some episodes. Normally I do not enjoy composing, but these were often quite fun to do, and the finished product sounds awesome if you follow all the rules of counterpoint. Chris and Prof. Harrison were excellent professors. I definitely recommend the class.",
    "Music 302 is an excellent overview of counterpoint. I would recommend the class to any musician as it helps one understand the music of Bach in a relaxed atmosphere.",
    "An amazing dive into Baroque counterpoint and analysis. After this class my contrapuntal chops feel much stronger. It reenforced much technique and exposed me to many contrapuntal ideas and concepts I had never considered. Highly recommend.",
    "Definitely take it, especially if you are interested in Bach and\/or eighteenth-century counterpoint. Personally, I find it fascinating, and my enjoyment of the class reflected that. I don't know if they'll keep the format, but this year it was taught jointly by Daniel Harrison and Chris Brody. I thought it worked overall: they have slightly different lecture styles and areas of expertise, which allowed for a nice amount of variety, and I thought it was helpful to get their often diverging perspectives on our assignments. (This was only in class; they divided up grading, it seemed, more or less randomly.) In general, I felt that ithe class achieved exactly what it set out to do--that is, teach us the basics of tonal counterpoint and of Bach's compositional style, in particular his contrapuntal music. We did cover dance suites to an extent, since that's apparently more where Brody's particular interests lie, but the meat of the class was, as it should be, in counterpoint. Assignments grew longer and more involved as the semester went on, but they also grew more infrequent (e.g. due weekly instead of daily). Grading was very fair. Harrison and Brody aren't shy about putting anyone's work up to critique in class, but if you're not willing to show your work to the class, you probably shouldn't be taking the class in the first place. Besides, Harrison and Brody are always constructive in their criticism and very responsive to requests for help. In sum, great class, and a must-take if you want to attain a better sense of tonal counterpoint.",
    "Take it take it TAKE IT! Okay so I happen to be a Bach nut -- and be forewarned, despite the broad title this is really the study of Bach's keyboard works. But seriously, how cool is it to be like oh hey, I just wrote a fugue in the style of Bach, nbd. The assignments are pretty fun - either full-scale compositions or counterpoint puzzles. The course is small and casual, and Profs. Brody and Harrison are both fantastic. They can sometimes be a bit contradictory - I had a couple assignments where one graded it and thought it was awful, and the other gave it the highest possible grade - but ultimately it's not a course where you really have to worry about your grade anyway. And actually their different interpretive styles can sometimes be an advantage, because it sparks some lively and productive class discussions. Definitely recommend."
