    "French 876 is a very interesting class on 18th century French literature. I would recommend it.",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think the class is going to offered again (at least not by Professor Kavanagh), but I would, hypothetically, recommend it.",
    "\"Libertins et philosophes\" was incredibly useful to me, as someone who had little to no previous knowledge of the 18th century. As I said before, I appreciated the balance between literature and philosophical texts, and the authors we read were wide-ranging, although surely there would have been room for some female voices, especially given how important the theme of gender relations was in much of what we read."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know how much the course will contribute to my own writing I am primarily interested in the twentieth century but the course gave me a good grounding, I think, in a century and subject I hadn't done much work on. In this sense it was highly productive.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the discipline in focusing on a specific aspect of eighteenth-century France but also covering a number of canonical works. A useful foundation."
