    "The guest lectures were excellent and the syllabus content was great. There was a lot of engaging discussion on the various topics, though some of these would have been better with more lecturing in addition to the discussions. The first half of the class was very fast paced and we rushed through a lot of interesting topics and concepts. The second half was slower and more focused on the final paper. Perhaps there can be more of a balanced pace with the readings also being more spaced out."

    "We had inputs from writers outside of the field who were thinking about how work on law fits into food systems in general. The final paper and presentation process were also very helpful. The instructor is also responsive and interesting.",
    "Professor Czarnezki did a great job of explaining the laws pertaining to food after we read them We were then able to interact and ask questions so we developed the best understanding possible.",
    "The guest speakers and reading materials were excellent.",
    "This was one of the worst courses I've ever taken at Yale, maybe even the worst. As an undergrad (a senior), I was so looking forward to taking a class at the Forestry School, and getting a chance to learn with some of the best teachers there are in the environmental policy world, and other fantastic students. While I deeply enjoyed being in class with FESers, this was the worst taught class Ive ever taken. I cant even answer this question because there were no redeeming aspects of the course. It was through and through horrible. I will comment on the specifics of this below, but it all had to do with the teacher, Jason Czarnezki, who I hope for the sake of Yale students in the future, never is allowed to teach at Yale again. As someones whose entire academic focus at Yale has been on agriculture policy and food systems, a class titled Food Systems and Environmental Law is seemingly right up my alley. I cannot tell you one thing I learned from this class. While I will elaborate on the specifics of this below its important to note that there seemed to be no curriculum for this class. Half the syllabus was blank. With the exception of a few guest speakers which were the highlight of the class, there was nothing I got out of this class.",
    "The professor has a very fun, engaging style of teaching. The course gave us a lot of insight into agriculture and related legal issues in the US - and around the world through the student presentations."

   "comments": [
    "There could have been more focus on laws outside of the US, as comparisons are also useful for learning.",
    "I don't feel there was enough actual lecture, too much focus on individual final papers. Would have enjoyed more teaching.",
    "Everything. This class, taught by Jason Czarnezki should not exist at Yale University, most of all in the Forestry School. I cant really tell you exactly what happened and why our professor did not give a crap about this class but it seemed to me that he held some sort of grudge against Yale students. When shopping period began there were about 30 people who shopped the class. It quickly became apparent that this professor had no clue what he wanted this class to be, had no curriculum in mind, and had put very little effort into planning this class, and thus once shopping period ended there were fewer than 10 students remaining in the class. Czarnezki clearly was agitated by this, as he continued to mention every class how much he disliked Yales shopping system. He clearly was frustrated that few students decided to take the class and as a result decided to just put his hands up and not even teach. What do I mean by this? Our professor cancelled three classes, including our last class, and instead offered to meet with students over skype to discuss their final papers. Furthermore, the classes we did have were mostly taken up by student presentations, which occupied the entire second half of the semester. There were only about four or five classes that actually covered any teachable content. To make matters worse, there wasnt a single class that ran the duration of the allotted time. Czarnezki left early every week in order to catch an earlier train, which he proudly informed us of. While I wish I had space here to critique his teaching style, which is bizarre to say the leasthe is boring, not comfortable in the material, and behaves erraticallyI felt it necessary to just cover the basics. To put it bluntly, a fourth grader could have taught a better class than this. At least maybe he or she would have had the decency to show up. I am also going to absolutely going to contact the dean\/academic affairs office at F&ES to further elaborate on this review because I really hope no future students have to go through what we went through with this class.",
    "The pace of the class needs to be more balanced. While the instructor lectured well on many of the topics, some of them needed more lecturing before we dived into the discussion"

Yale desperately needs more courses studying food policy and law, and Id hoped that this would be a hallmark of my academic career here. Oh how wrong I was.",

    "Absolutely not. If you are reading this on the evaluation site it means that Yale has somehow allowed this professor to teach again, something he is utterly unqualified to do. Worst class Ive ever taken at Yale or perhaps in all of my 16 years of schooling. I learned nothing, the professor doesnt care about his students or the class, and he seems to have no rhyme or reason for the curriculum he puts together. Do yourself a favortake any class at this school besides this one. Youll have a better experienceI guarantee it.",
    "Take it! You'll enjoy it if you have an interest in food and agriculture. While it is US-centric, the discussions and student presentations can bring out international issues\/perspectives. The professor is also open to discussing other issues"
