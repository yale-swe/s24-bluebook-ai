    "A look down into the deep canyon of computer architecture. This course does a good job of covering many topics in satisfying depth. Plus Jakub is just adorable!",
    "Chill class with some programming assignments that may or may not take up a lot of time, depending on how much you want to invest. However, it's also Szefer's first time teaching this course so he might change it in the future.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. The topics covered are interesting and Professor Szefer is a very good lecturer. The coding assignments were a bit overwhelming at first, but honestly they are not much more work than the assignments given in similar classes and are not a problem if you start on them early and ask good questions (I would not let those scare you away from taking the course). Additionally, you have the opportunity to attend some interesting computer engineering seminars, which keep you focused on the bigger picture of what is going on around the world in computer engineering research.",
    "It's a fun class. I hope it will have better structure next year.",
    "This course covers a lot of the same material as CS 323, but with an engineering focus. The workload is quite light and the grading is very lenient. The assignments themselves aren't really interesting or challenging, but hopefully that will change the next time the course is offered. Professor Szefer is extremely generous with his time, and is very helpful."
