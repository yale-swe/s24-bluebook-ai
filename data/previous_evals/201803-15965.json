    "Strength: The instructor provided sufficient motivation for the subject. His explanation was clear and he tried to make sure that students understood his explanation. The instructor also offered office hours to help us doing the homework. Weakness: Sometimes the instructor rushed the calculation. The class started at 8am. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to this class every week.",

    "I think this course is very important to every math major, whether you haven't done much probability and want to develop intuitions for it, or want to take your learning further in a beautiful field."
