    "Strengths: the material was fascinating and Professor Rokhlin obviously knows it as well as anyone. Weaknesses: Absolutely no work at all => no retention of the material. I didn't feel we covered that much, especially since we didn't go that in-depth on the topics we did cover."

    "I can't say I would. I love the material and I like and respect Professor Rokhlin, but I wonder if I would have learned just as much from staying home and reading the Wikipedia pages. Having said that, there's literally no downside to taking it except the time spent going to lecture.",
