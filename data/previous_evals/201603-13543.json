   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was fantastic! I do wish we had been in a smaller classroom. I did also wish we'd gotten the slides a little sooner some days. I usually tried to look at them around 8 or 9 the morning of the class.",
    "important for all public health students to understand policy.",
    "This class was by far my favorite class this semester. The workload is totally manageable, but it's up to you to hold yourself accountable, because you're an adult. The lectures a so engaging, sometimes the go a little fast, but Dr. Friedman always looks for feedback on how people are following class and is happy to try to adjust to help for other people. Otherwise no weaknesses, all strengths in this class. Super engaging!",
    "The course was challenging, but manageable. It moved quickly, although the HW's, readings, and lectures were extremely helpful resources to grasp the material.",
    "This was an amazing course to introduce students to microeconomics. I had never taken econ before, and I am so glad I waited until now to take it with Abby. She listens to students' feedback and takes time to ensure that everyone understands the material.",
    "I really enjoyed this class (it was my favorite class this semester). i have no critiques.",
    "I learned so much! At times I felt that the class was aimed primarily towards visual learners which was tricky for me, but talking through material with Kayla, Will, and Abby really helped! This class NEEDS to be moved out of Winslow.",
    "The course is a great introduction to the core principles of microeconomics. Each lecture has its own introduction with theory and problems. The class goes by really fast, but the problems used in lecture are 10% as hard as the homework questions, so when you get to the homework, you really have no idea what you are doing unless you spend a few hours really trying to understand it. Section was a waste of time, for I don't need to be walked through a homework problem over the course of an hour.",
    "Good",
    "Strengths: LOTS of material covered, TA\/Professors were very accessible, lots of practice materials to help students understand subject better Weaknesses: instructor can be picky about grading (but wants to make sure that students truly understand the material)",
    "Great class.",
    "Abby was definitely the reason I enjoyed the class so much. She was incredibly understanding, engaging, and her slides were wonderful. The TFs were also super invested and always available to help. I think this combined, with a smaller class size and weekly problem sets was perfect.",
    "May be a bit fast-paced, but there is good responsiveness to students' problem areas",
    "very good. the activities didn't always seem to be relevant or to highlight important aspects of the class.",
    "This was my first economics class, and I thoroughly enjoyed the subject and how it was taught. I appreciated the 2-hour lectures + sections format, and how the professor helped us to reinforce the material we were learning with lots of practice.",
    "This was the surprise best course of the semester. Simply loved how Abby connected economics to not just healthcare but also life.",
    "Strength: very useful for understanding of beginning economic, taught you to look at things in a different way. TFs are very helpful! Recommendation: since the materials maybe relatively new for many students, it might be difficult for these students to internally make senses of it. I think it would be helpful to have 2 classes per week instead of just one. Also, It would be nice if TFs can spend the majority of time in sessions to go over the difficult concepts so the students can get exposed to them more than once.",
    "Its a great course",
    "Use of a smaller room if possible and overhead projection (rather than writing on a whiteboard) would be good. An expectation that homework will be handed in on canvas (with a reasonable attempt made) before lecture is an idea to increase participation. The text book was excellent but some other readings were less useful.",
    "Thorough and relevant introduction to microeconomics and health systems applications. A very fast paced introduction that can be overwhelming at times (particularly because it only meets once a week), but there are many resources to help students learn the material along the way.",
    "I think that the professor was the greatest strength of the course. Overall it was well structured and she had great concern for her students. She took into consideration any feedback we offered her. The weekly TF review sessions were very helpful and as were additional review sessions before exams. I think the first half of the course was much easier to follow than the second half, and the review sessions started getting confused around then (after break) so some material was given greater attention than the rest. But overall it was good.",
    "great intro class, extremely well organized and appropriate for students with no economics background"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is fantastic! I came in with no understanding of economics and Abby explained it in approachable manner that I felt I was able to leave the course with an understanding of and ability to converse in health economics.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0overall very organized lectures and practice problems. sometimes talks fast in lectures. posting slides ahead of time is helpful so we can print them and color on them since the graphs have so many lines it is helpful to follow along in class",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She is one of the best professors I have ever had in undergrad and grad school. She actually makes such an effort to engage the students with in class activities or good examples\/videos to help explain difficult concepts. She goes above and beyond to make sure students can understand everything as best they can. She is constantly looking for feedback from students to try improve the course, slow down to help students understand better, or go over something again if people are confused. Most of the time she doesn't need to go over things more than once though because she is such an awesome teacher. Really it was such a pleasure being in her class.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0One of the best professors I have ever had. She is entertaining, and her ability to explain complex topics was incredible. She was extremely open to student feedback at any point throughout the semester. She gave students every chance to succeed and was a pleasure to learn from. I would take any class she teaches, as I know I would learn a ton.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is incredible! She is amazing at explaining complex theories and ideas. She is warm, kind, funny, so brilliant -- ultimately I feel so lucky to have been taught by her.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby was a great professor, addressed every student's questions, and was very attentive to the class'a needs. The only critique I have is that she talk a little slower. Other than than she's an excellent professor.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Totally delightful teaching style-- you can tell Abby really cares about the students and about making the material interesting and relevant. My biggest issue is that sometimes Abby would speak \"econ\" instead of English which made the material more confusing.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is wonderfully helpful in office hours. She came off as fairly arrogant the first few classes, and it was very discouraging, but she got nicer as the semester went on. Overall, her lectures were WAY too basic in nature and really should have delved more deeply into the material, especially as it pertained to the exams. Lectures were too simplified.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Very clear and knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strengths: teaches both the math and the \"intuition\" behind the math; really cares about students and is willing to work with schedules to ensure that students are set up for success Weaknesses: lots of materials in lecture means a lot to cover (can be overwhelming for students who have never taken economics) in a 3 hour period. Maybe break up the class into two sessions a week for 1.5 hours each?",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is a strict grader. I wish she would be more open to other interpretations. But she knows her stuff. More than almost any other professor I have.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby was one of the best professors I've ever had. She made every lecture engaging and extremely interesting. Her slides were also very helpful. I think Abby was also understanding of student life and was very flexible to make sure we did the best we could do.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Excellent professor. Glad to have taken this course with her",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She was great and very good at explaining material. Really good.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman was truly a joy. Brilliant, she knew how to take complicated information and translate it into an understandable and digestible form. She was also incredible responsive to students' needs, even moving a quiz date having found out that many students had an exam in another class around the same period. It was obvious that she was trying to help us rather than trick us. She was also engaging, used fascinating and relevant examples, and definitely challenged us while connecting microeconomics to public and global health issues.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Superb! extremely cognizant of the class structure and requirements. I had no background in either math or economics and she made it totally worth it. It has been an honor being in the class.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0she is very prepared and enthusiastic to teach this course",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is awesome! She makes it enjoyable to be in class and that is huge because Microecon is hard!",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She is a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is a kind, professional, and thoughtful instructor. She is intense, and can speak fast at times, but she is knowledgeable and it's a joy to learn from her.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Dr. Friedman does a great job of making the course material engaging, and provides many resources to help students along the way. The course moves quickly, and Dr. Friedman constant use of economic vocabulary to explain principles can sometimes get overwhelming, it is an appropriately advanced course that has many supportive resources to help students who get lost along the way.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She was wonderful, and has a great grasp on how to help her students (see above).",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0excellent, responsive, well organized and made the classes a joy to attend.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0too fast."

    "This course was fantastic, I entered with no prior experience in the course and was able to leave with an understanding of health economics. Abby is a fantastic, engaging professor and I immensely enjoyed this course and feel I have learned a significant amount of information in a short period of time.",
    "great course. wish we talked about more health-related problems in class or in the practice problems. but I also understand that this is an introductory course. I really enjoyed the case studies session and wish we had more of those.",
    "Amazing. I would absolutely recommend this course. Dr. Friedman does a great job going over microeconomic concepts and showing how they apply to healthcare issues.",
    "It was great, no complaints. I would absolutely recommend it to any student.",
    "This is an amazing course. I am not in the health policy\/management track and I just took it because I have always wanted to learn about microeconomics. Abby is an outstanding professor -- truly one of my favorite at Yale (I am in the 5-year B.A.\/MPH program so I really mean all of Yale). She is so considerate and passionate about teaching, and it shows in every lecture. I learned so much in this class, and I was so proud of myself at the end of it because I feel like I gained more skills and a new way of looking at the world. My advice: whole-heartedly take it.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to microeconomics. It's definitely challenging but I think it's worth taking.",
    "You learn all the basic of microecon and how it applies to help in one jam-packed semester!",
    "This course was a general introduction to economic theory and thinking behind microeconomics and how markets fail as they pertain to healthcare. I probably learned more in this course than all of my other courses combined, but it was really challenging. Overall, a great class, but prepare to work hard and don't take other math-based classes with it.",
    "Good",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially someone interested in health policy and management. Make sure you do the textbook readings, complete ALL the practice problems (at least twice), go to section, and do all the practice quizzes\/midterms. Material can be difficult to grasp the first time around, so make sure to practice!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone!",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It will change your perspective on life and give you cool tools to think about things. Deff take it with Abby!",
    "yes",
    "Think about the big picture and apply the concepts to things you see in daily life. Being able to do HW problems is important but try to think about what the problems are telling you about the concepts.",
    "It's a great course.",
    "Take it if you have to, or if you're interested in micro. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Fast paced, math heavy introduction to microeconomics in health systems. Appropriately advanced course that provides many resources of support. If you are interested in econ and health, I would strongly recommend this course and engaging with both instructor and TAs.",
    "This is a great class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you have taken a microeconomics course before (unless of course you are an econ major). It was taught with great regard to relevance in healthcare which kept it interesting. The professor is wonderful and willing to do anything within reason to help her students. (In fact when we told her we felt rushed during quizzes, she gave us 3 hours to complete a 2 hour final). It is definitely taught at a much higher level than undergraduate introductory economics courses (I have taken 2 microeconomics courses in undergrad and there was material in this class - mostly towards the second half - that I had not been introduced to before).",
    "definitely recommend to anyone who has no prior economics background. the course relates economics to healthcare in a way that is easy to pick up and apply.",
    "You have to put the time in, but you will definitely learn a ton from Abby and get so much out of it."
