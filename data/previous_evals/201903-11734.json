   "comments": [
    "Gained a lot more sight into Islamic history and the reasons behind much of the violence in the Middle East today.",
    "Great foundation on the history of the Middle East that combats the \"Orientalist\" approach that most educational systems take.",
    "Understanding of Muslim Fundamentalist ideologies in Middle East countries and how they fuel past and present terrorist groups.",
    "I developed knowledge of basic Islamic theology and Middle Eastern history.",
    "History of religious movements in different major countries of the Middle East. Dealt with the issues of Islam and the West, as well as Islam in government and the question of Jihad.",
    "I was exposed to ideas from many disciplines of study relative to Islam, including cultural history, theology, and political science.",
    "I learned not only a comprehensive history of the Middle East but the religious impact and how it has shaped the region today.",
    "Lots about Islamism in the 20th century!",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the evolution of the interpretations and implementation of modern jihad. Professor Griffel explained topics (see syllabus) extremely clearly, showing how complicated intellectual ideas and interpretations relate to each other, to a certain political and social context, and evolve through these interactions and relationships. I have a much stronger baseline for which to understand the ideology and methodology behind different individuals and groups, and I have a variety of sources from which to continue learning more.",
    "Survey of climate in Middle East",
    "I learned a lot about the modern history of the middle east and about the development of fundamentalist movements. This is definitely a class you take a lot of information away from.",
    "We learnt about several fundamentalist movements and thinkers from the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.",
    "Professor Griffels class Islam Today provides an in-depth, cogent survey of Middle Eastern jihad groups, their origins, and the philosophies behind them. The class great emphasis on different schools of thought and how those ideologies interconnect with historical events in the region. All of this was supplemented with historical and political background, usually from the 1800s to present day. This lecture was fast-paced and intense. Professor Griffel provided us with substantial amounts of information and expected us to internalize that knowledge in equal measure. This class will make you feel like an expert of the Middle East.",
    "I definitely have a much more nuanced understanding of Islamic movements and Islamic terrorist organizations in the world. Before the course, names like Taliban, Al Qaeda, Hamas, ISIS all blurred together in my mind but now I know their varying ideological roots as well as doctrinal differences."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the interesting materials and the lecture skills of the professor.",
    "Strengths: Griffel is very knowledgeable and offers great perspectives that I appreciated. Weaknesses: The readings were often alot and the books were expensive.",
    "Strengths would be lectures, Griffel was great in explaining historical contexts and ideologies. Sections were a little dry, and the midterms and final were quite extensive and content memorization heavy.",
    "The course was nicely structured and the lectures had a natural progression that made the material easy to follow, especially once the class started covering modern Middle Eastern events that applied the theology learned in the beginning of the course.",
    "Strengths: Informative and very in-depth as well as wide in scope. Weakness: The exams sometimes touched upon topics or figures which do not hold a significant role in the entirety of the topics of the course.",
    "This is a great course. Professor Griffel lectures very quickly, but the readings do a very good job of supplementing and complementing.",
    "Perfect course to learn about Middle East and specifically extremist groups. Wouldnt change anything",
    "It was a really good course, very structured, strong overall.",
    "Professor Griffel did a really good job with his discussions and explanations; truly I learned a lot and I only wish to continue to learn more. I wish there was a Part II to this course, as there is only so much a Professor can (reasonably) pack into a term!",
    "Great class!",
    "The course does a great job of teaching a lot of content and has a good balance of primary and secondary sources. The only improvement would be to have maybe just a little bit less historical stuff in terms of dates and years and more focus on the arguments of different thinkers.",
    "This was a very strong class! The lecture was fast-paced, engaging, and coherent. Expectations for students were very clear, and feedback was excellent. Both of the TAs and Professor Griffel were very approachable. I learned more in this class than any other class that I have taken at Yale! I wish there had been review sessions to go over terms before the exams. We had hundreds of terms that we needed to know and contextualize, and especially when given very similar names, this could be quite confusing! I also felt that some of the exam questions were trivia instead of representative of a students knowledge (e.g. Mohammad Atta), which was a bit unfair to students who studied substantial amounts but couldnt remember every single name. In the future, I hope Professor Griffel puts ID names that better encapsulate the most important parts of the course.",
    "I loved Prof. Griffel's lectures and I think they were clear and engaging.",
    "Strengths: Class is well organized, the lectures and material are really interesting. I really felt like I got a lot out of the class. Also a very reasonable amount of work. Prof. Griffel is also greathe actually gets to know people and is an engaging lecturer. Weaknesses: Studying for the midterm and final felt a bit like memorizing vocabularywe just got giant sheets of terms we had to know. I suppose this helps form a base, but I do wish there was a bit more of an emphasis on the ideas and transitions of Islamic fundamentalism (the class definitely has this, I just enjoyed those parts so much I wanted more)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, provides great background to many of the factors underlying the Middle East that currently leads to unrest and violence.",
    "Yes! Its a great introduction to Islam and issues in the Middle East.",
    "Yes, great for understanding and interpreting current events today.",
    "Yes, I think it is a good intro course for Islam and Middle Eastern history\/current affairs.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "I certainly would. A fascinating survey.",
    "Wholeheartedly. Professor Griffel is a great lecturer and the subject material is so cool. Most of the reading especially primary sources is worth doing as well.",
    "Yes. The professor is great and the course material very engaging and well presented.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course; if you want to learn about the topics (see syllabus), Professor Griffel explains everything extremely well, with primary sources, and in detail, without losing sight of the big picture and implications. It is both a great starting point and a more detailed focused discussion of the topics. The course is organized, the reading manageable, the professor fantastic, and sections are focused and helpful. Also, the skeleton notes are posted; though you learn so much more from lecture than just what is written on the notes. Still, the skeleton notes are an extremely helpful resource to reference and know that you have.",
    "YES. Amazing content. Good sections.",
    "This is a great class if you want to better understand the phenomena of jihad and fundamentalism. There is definitely a large memorization component, so don't take the class if memorization isn't your thing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially because Professor Griffel is very knowledgeable and makes lecture very interesting.",
    "Absolutely! This was an awesome lecture that was very valuable to expanding my worldview. After taking this class, I can read the news and understand the ideologies and motivations of different political parties and jihad organizations in Middle East. I have a much richer, deeper understanding of current conflicts and how they relate. I also understand the ideologies behind jihad groups, their foundations, and their connections with other organizations and key thinkers and actors. Professor Griffel teaches the Middle East without substantial bias, which is a rarity and a gift in such a divisive world. He is genuine, honest, and willing to admit when he has a certain position on a topic. As for the workload, there is essentially nothing except readings and a few essays for most of the semester. The caveat to this is that exams can be quite difficult. Because so much information is taught during the semester, there are literally hundreds of terms you need to know. While this can be stressful, you learn so much that all of your hard work is worthwhile! This is the kind of class that you keep all of the readings and return to them again and again. I would go so far as to say that this was one of the best classes offered at Yale. Good job Professor Griffel!",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend it because Islam is one of the most important forces in the world now and has to be understood.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in these areas (and it's obviously a relevant topic), I would highly recommend the course even if you have little prior experience. It's not too much work, generally very well taught, and covers a lot."
