   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's one of the best courses I've taken at YSPH. I think you get out of it what you put into it, and if you're willing to work hard and to think hard it's a really rewarding and enlightening experience.",
    "The teaching style was amazing. I was surprised at the amount of knowledge that I learned in such a short among of time.",
    "It definitely gives you a new way of thinking about health and global health issues. Having to think strategically and being put in the mindset of the minister of health or finance gives you a new perspective about how countries work and why some countries have been successful and why others have yet to make significant improvements with regards to their health status. However, by making the course only evaluated based on policy briefs was kind of a disadvantage for most students. Having little to no policy background, writing policy briefs was challenging. Also by not really teaching students how to write policy briefs but rather just instructing what 5 key questions to focus on it took a while to figure out what exactly was expected. Splitting the class into groups and making us come up with solutions to country issues was an excellent way to make the material engaging and collaborative - just like it is in the real world. However, a little more guidance or making the in-class assignments part of the grade (i.e. participation) could be helpful.",
    "A great course on global health, regardless of your familiarity with the subject. Touches on all major issues within the field and prepares you to embark on a career.",
    "Excellent course. One of the best I have taken at YSPH. Broad exposure to major topics in global health assessment and reporting.",
    "This was my favorite course. The content was very interesting and the interactive nature of the class was great. I learned a great deal and feel much more confident in my global health knowledge.",
    "The assignments (i.e. three policy briefs) was one of the best parts of the course as it requires us to communicate a problem\/solution in a very clear and concise manner. Very few classes at YSPH require us to do that and it is an important skill to have in any future employment. It might have been beneficial to do more deliverable style assignments so that students can build a portfolio by the end of the semester.",
    "Excellent course, very engaging and informative",
    "In my opinion, practice writing the policy briefs is the strongest aspect of this class. I was actually very excited for this course at the beginning of the semester, but by the end, I was quite disappointed. Aside from policy briefs, which offered a very practical skill, I don't feel like I gained much from the course. A lot of the material is repeat from the global health seminar. The material that was new could have been greatly condensed.The course is also taught at a very undergraduate level.A suggestion: instead of the in-class presentations about disease X in country Y, a more constructive use of time might be to design rather complicated scenarios (should be easy to do if Professor Skolnik bases them off of his very extensive experience). In class, students can group up and come up with solutions that are as realistic as possible... the groups could then present solutions to the class. Many of the students in the course have extensive global health experience and Professor Skolnik really did nothing to ensure that other students were able to learn from their peers. I think these scenario-based activities could change that. Just an idea. I think the problem solving component would greatly enhance the course.Also, the course did not necessitate a three-hour time slot. Two would have been sufficient.",
    "Policy briefs were useful but grading should be split up more",
    "This class really shaped how I think about and approach global health issues. The structure of the policy briefs mimicked the way the professor structured the class and gave me a better \"real world\" approach. I enjoyed the breakout sessions and presentations. The articles and extra videos were very appropriate.",
    "This is the best course I have taken in the past one year! Excellent structuring of the course and execution!",
    "Good course, learned a lot. Absolutely intimidating course though. Tried to do all the readings, but that would have taken forever.Cold calling was terrifying and didn't get comfortable with it until the last few weeks of the course.I felt like I learned a tremendous amount, nonetheless.",
    "Strengths: Cover a lot of material, interesting guest speakers, great way to improve public speaking and writingWeaknesses: HORRIBLE TIME OF DAY (Wednesday 5-8). It would be nice if there were more cases studies that were specific situations rather than just always addressing a huge issue in a country (maternal health, health systems, etc.)",
    "This course is really meant for first year students \/ students who have no prior global health experience. If you are already well into your global health studies, you probably won't get much out of this class, but if you take this before other related courses, you will likely get a lot more out of those.",
    "Truly amazing course, great into to GH for novices.",
    "Great introductionary course to global health even though we don't have enough time to cover everything. I like that its interactive and not just straight lecture for 3 hours each class.",
    "Strengths: good professor, great introductory course to all things global health. I also learned how to write a policy brief, which is very useful.Weakness: i hate that it's from 5-8pm. It's kind of an awful time.",
    "I think I would have liked one major test to really seal in the information. The papers were fine but in my opinion provided too little pressure and you could do without reading.",
    "Very useful course for anyone interested in the field of global health. However, it would be more helpful if the course is more organized. For instances, writing down important speaking points\/today's agenda on the board would be very helpful for students to follow, especially for a long course such as this. Group activities, as well as writing policy briefs are great exercises.",
    "I learned how not to write a global health brief. That's OK. I'll probably never write another one again.I thought this was a great elective course.",
    "Strengths: covers all the basics of global health i.e. global health in a nutshell. I liked that Prof skolnik also went over the details of programs in resource-poor settings; I cannot imagine another class teaching it this well. His experience certainly enhanced the class immensely.Weaknesses: for more advanced students, this class may not be so useful. The class is also only based on the policy brief grades. I feel that for those students who not have writing experience, more than 3 tries would help improve the writing style greatly. I personally felt that I only \"got it\" on the 3rd go.",
    "This course was fantastic. Great oversight into global health. Good experiences with group work and public speaking. Overall really great."

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Just fantastic. Professor Skolnik cares deeply about students and the subject matter. He has a nuanced understanding of the issues and invaluable experience on which to draw.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Encouraged and empowered students to understand and articulate critical issues in global health.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Highly interactive; great orator; brings in good speakers if(which is rare) he does not know a topic well enough for a grad class",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is obviously knowledgeable, well connected, and an amazing person to have in your corner. Since the class is lecture based, we didn't really get a lot of interaction 1:1. He is very engaging and makes a lot of jokes which help foster a relaxed but educational environment. He does tend to go on rants about all the people he knows or previous accomplishments - which are amazing stories - but sometimes detract from learning time.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0I found myself looking forward to class each week, despite its unfortunate timing on Wednesday evenings. Professor Skolnik was always engaging, earnest, and honest in his teaching. I appreciated the cold calling, and the group projects we performed in class.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0course would be more beneficial if instructor had more didactic way of teaching",

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik was great. He expected a lot out of us as students, but was very helpful and accessible. I enjoyed the class discussions and appreciated his advice.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is one of the few YSPH professors who can maintain a class completely engaged during an almost 3 hour block. I think the \"cold-calling\" method was implemented very well in his class and I liked that it required us to be on our toes, so to speak.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Very knowledgable and has a very effective teaching style",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is a very good professor. He keeps students engaged and is able to enrich the learning due to his many years of experience in global health. I also really appreciated that he is not a researcher- there are too few non-researcher professors at YSPH.Professor Skolnik is very good at opening himself up to students as an academic and professional resource. Few professors can match him in this regard. I do sense, however, that once students approach him for advice, guidance, etc., he falls short of meeting the expectations he has created for students.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0The professor is extremely knowledgable and accessible",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is deeply invested in this class and his students, and always made himself available to meet with students. He is highly experienced and very knowledgable, which makes him the perfect teacher for this class and allows him to personalize the topics that we discuss. His teaching style makes sure that all students are involved and interested and he has lots of group exercises that made the class a fun and informative experience.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He seeks engagement from every student in every class. He has high expectations for the level of participation and preparation for the classes, but you get out of it what you put in. It ended up being one of my favorite classes because of this, although it was intimidating initially.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Excellent instructor! Never a dull moment in class!",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Really cares about his students and wants them to succeed in life--which is really a great quality to see in a professor. You could see the passion for global health oozing from his pores and its hard not to be enamored by it. He's brilliant and expects a lot from his students. I'm like an anxious rat-dog around him in fear he'll cold call me, but i think that makes you work that much harder in his class (not only to learn but to earn his affection).",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Richard is an engaging speaker who will keep you on your toes. There are very few professors I've had who are able to do this for 3 hours straight every week.I think that he could improve his structure of his lectures more, utilizing the chalkboard or at least providing a written outline of the barebone major topics of each lecture. My notes are currently useless since I sometimes do not know how to structure them.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Super knowledgeable instructor, makes class extremely interactive and interesting",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Very engaging and knowledgable. Encourages us to think critically and connects us with the appopriate experts when we have a question that he cannot answer himself.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He's great! Very accessible.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0I really liked his pragmatic style. I also appreciated how approachable he is and how dedicated he is to his students' success. Very genuine guy.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Terrific. Unbelievably knowledgable on the subject.It would have been nice if he and Mary (TA) would have graded the briefs sooner. The comments would come back the week of or just days before the next brief was due.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Prof Skolnik is a memorable man who cares greatly about his students. I personally felt quite touched when he bothered to skype in for a class when he was on medical leave. I do not think that other teachers would bother. His style is sometimes repetitive, but I think that this style certainly drills in the basics. I for one can attest to remembering many, many details from the class because of his repetition.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Richard is one of the best instructors we have at YSPH, very organized, easy to get along with, open for communication, and truly a leader in his field."

It's a wonderful opportunity to learn from someone with field experience who is completely devoted to keeping up with trends and information as it develops. It's also just really fascinating and I would definitely recommend it to non-GH students as well.",
    "Amazing. A must take class.",
    "Excellent course. Gives you an easy understanding of global health issues even if you are non-global health student. The policy briefs are a great learning exercise and impromptu presentations in class are enjoyable and good for developing public speaking skills",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class. It supplements the material discussed in the Global Health Seminar. It takes a while to get used to Skolnik's teaching style and self-important demeanor. However, he is extremely knowledgeable and well connected and is always willing to support his students. You should seek advice and help when writing policy briefs (especially if you've never done them before). He seems daunting at first but don't be afraid to speak up (even if your wrong) and really try and engage yourself in the discussions. You get the most by being proactive and participating. Even if your not globally focused or want to work internationally, learning how to think critically about important issues can be useful inany part of the world or in any field.",

    "You should take this course if you want to learn about the major issues of global health, what it is like to have a career in global health, and how you need to communicate in global health. Though it is not perfect, I would recommend it because Richard is a fantastic lecturer and is someone who can give you a good idea of what it is like to work in the real world",
    "Take this course if you're interested in GH at all. One of the few classes at YSPH you absolutely must take before graduating.",

    "Yes I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this class wholeheartedly for anyone willing to play in global health, as Prof Skolnik says. His wealth of experience will be of benefit to anyone who wants to work in GH. I went from knowing not very much at all to knowing significantly more, and most of all, becoming passionate about the subject. I know for sure that I definitely want to work in global health from now on.",
