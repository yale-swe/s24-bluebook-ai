    "A great introduction to the Victorian novel, and worth taking even if one is familiar with the texts.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone looking to engage in both Dickens and Eliot texts.",
    "English 807 is a comparative study of a selection of Eliot and Dickens's mature novels, based on pairings by genre. I would recommend it to students with an interest in the nineteenth-century English novel, including those familiar already familiar with the set texts, and also to those with a more general methodological interest in comparative work of this kind.",

    "The question is irrelevant since the nineteenth century is not my intended field of expertise. But a semester spent reading Dickens and Eliot \"contributed\" to my experience of being alive, and anyone hoping to make a career teaching English literature should have read the books in question."
