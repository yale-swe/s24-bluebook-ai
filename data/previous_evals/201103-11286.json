    "The instructor definitely improved as the course progressed. The help of the TAs was essential to learning in this course as there was not enough class time to cover in detail the material that needed to be learned.",
    "The readings were excellent and really helped with course material; enjoyed the diversity of topics and authors. Would be helpful if the readings were published MUCH earlier prior to class; in most cases I would have gotten much more out of lectures if I had done the readings prior to class, which is difficult when they are posted at midnight the night before.The Markets and Environment book by Keohane and Olmstead was particularly helpful; by the end of class we had read many chapters in that book. I would suggest including this as the course book, or at least recommending at the beginning of the semester that people buy it. Looking back, I would now prefer to have the whole book rather than 50+ loose pages.Professor Gillingham is obviously very knowledgeable about the subject matter; it would help lectures more if he had examples or alternate explanations for some of the difficult concepts presented in class.Course material was very helpful going forward in an environmental career. Thank you!",
    "Overall a great course. However, only problem comes from the fact that there is no microeconomics prerequisite - so in the course you get students from a very wide range of backgrounds. This means that the course is probably moving to fast for some and too slow for others. Additionally, I liked the use of calculus towards the end when we dealt with fisheries, but it was odd that we used in then to relate TC and MC, but not earlier in the course. It would have been nice to have used basic calculus throughout.",
    "I think that provided the circumstances and given that the instructor had never officially taught a course before, it met my expectations.The TA's were invaluable to my learning experience and without their guidance I would not have been able to master the course concepts.",
    "The beginning of the course was slow, but it was too fast paced at the end. Unfortunately, it's the stuff at the end that was the much more interesting material.",
    "The Mankiw book for this class was extremely helpful. It would help if there were more readings to supplement the renewable energy lectures and if we learned how to mathematically apply the Wicksell and Faustmann rotation equations and opportunity cost change of carbon equation.",
    "The course is a very valuable on introduction to economics and environmental economics in particular. Professor Gillingham's teaching will undoubtedly improve over time. He had high expectations for our capacity to learn a large number of subjects, which is good and encouraging.",
    "The pace of this class was at times too slow and at other times too fast. Also, the instructor was sometimes too responsive to student comments, answering esoteric and unhelpful tangental questions for great lengths of time.",
    "Great Intro environmental econ class. Come away with a lot of deliverables mathematically and conceptually.",
    "1. Mankiw wasn't that helpful. The other readings were great.5. Professor Gillingham sometimes seemed frustrated when students were clearly not understanding something and then became defensive and his tone got edgy.7. Gillingham did an excellent job of being well prepared and clearly invested a lot in the course. I think that he can work on being less defensive with students and explaining the big picture before diving into graphing concepts. I totally appreciate how responsive he was to feedback along the way.I did think that this was a very valuable course.",
    "Since this was the first course ever taught by this professor there were pieces of this class that were very frustrating. I think the professor has a lot of potential to be an excellent teacher, but for this introductory course it should have been more of a lecture format and fewer discussions and questions. The midterm was written in a completely inappropriate format, and was designed to only favor those who have already taken econ in the past. HOWEVER, I very much appreciate that the final was a MUCH better test. The final was designed appropriately to award those students who had tried hard in this class all semester. The final certainly wasn't easy, but it was a well-written test.",
    "7: The graphs drawn on the board were really hard to follow. I wish they could be bigger, or maybe we could get a rough\/grid template in advance (from Classes*v2) and then we could fill them in during class. Or maybe the graphs could be made available after class on Classes*v2.",
    "Overall, this course was paced too quickly for students who had no prior exposure to the subject matter. Though the readings were useful and the weekly problem sets helped illustrate important concepts from the lectures, the concepts were typically only cursorily explained in lecture--leaving most students to resort to outside resources, heavy reliance on TA assistance, and group work in order to learn or re-learn the subject matter.Understanding that it is difficult to find the \"sweet spot\" for a large survey course and select the right pace and workload to balance those with no prior exposure and those who might be taking their 2nd or 3rd economics course, the instructor generally did not do a very good job of focusing the lecture time on explaining the concepts in non-technical terms in a way that was accessible to those newest to economics. I anticipated that the subject matter would be far more intuitive than it was tought. Many of the explanations were esoteric and a lot of class time was wasted on questions that should have been saved for a different forum, or been pre-empted by more concrete, relatable explanations of the concepts. The weekly problem sets required a lot of work, typically--sometimes as many as 6-8 hours per week, with heavy reliance on groupwork. This meant that personal mastery of the material was rarely achieved, and people ended up doing what they needed to do to get by and get the problem set completed. Perhaps some additional readings or exercises that illustrate concepts would be more useful.",
    "The TAs for this course were EXCELLENT. I can't say enough about how well they explained the material and how patiently they explained the answers to even the most basic questions.The lecture style was appropriate for how much material we had to cover, though it was really hard to see the whiteboard parts of the lecture, especially if you sat on the other side of the room. In future, maybe it would be useful to project a tablet screen and do the math on there, since we could also save the slides and use them for future reference.It was a hard balance to take questions from students while keeping the lecture moving.Last - the course sped through an enormous amount of material after finals. It would be helpful to even out the pace over the semester, as well as the amount of math required, so that those who are unfamiliar with basic calculus have ample time to practice.Overall, very useful course and I would take a Gillingham class again or another course with the three TAs.",
    "The professor was clearly knowledgable on the material but was unable to effectively teach the material to the students. I learned more from the TAs (Nathan Chan in particular) than from the professor. There is definitely room for improvement for this class because I believe the material is quite interesting, but the teaching was lacking.",
    "In regards to question 2, I think that the instructor could improve his clarity of explaining concepts. I think it could benefit him to start the explanation of a concept through a few quantitative examples and then extrapolate into the larger concept. His approach was a bit the opposite- leading generally with the larger concept and then using a few graphs. However, in most of the cases, the graphs were general trend diagrams without deriving the answer quantitatively - rather they tried to demonstrate the larger intuition. Personally, this method was more difficult for me to fully understand - particularly, what was the basis of the intuition in some cases.",
    "In re: Question 2, while Professor Gillingham initially struggled to explain course material, he definitely improved as the semester went on. I'm sure he'll continue to get better as an instructor as he gains experience.",
    "I think this class has great potential, and it is very important course material. However, Professor Gillingham probably needs a few years to improve his teaching so that he is better able to communicate effectively to students about the key principles of economics.The content of the course was fantastic though, and I feel that I have a solid base with which to move forward in the future.",
    "It would have been helpful to have the graphs drawn in class on the lecture slides, or available in classesv2, to refer to after class. The text on the slides were not always very meaningful without the graphs there too.I also felt like it was assumed that we had a familiarity with economics - giving basic analogies or examples of the intuitions behind concepts (Nathan, the TA, did this a lot) would have been helpful for someone like me who has not taken economics.",
    "Question 5: Professor Gillingham is already a strong instructor and will only become stronger. I'd recommend that he state that he'd like to 'get back to students' (and then follow up with the class later) if they ask questions to which he does not have a solid answer when on his feet in the middle of lecture.",
    "The first half of the course addressed the basics and the content of the midterm exam required further understanding of the concepts and prior knowledge. However the second half reflected the intuition behind the theory very well on the final exam.",
    "Overall, the class was very helpful to my education at F&ES, and I've already been able to apply some of the concepts that I learned in two other classes this semester. The professor sometimes had difficulties explaining the concepts and supporting details clearly. While I could usually follow most of the topics(at a conceptual level) in class, he didn't always explain why things worked that way, which made it more difficult to apply these concepts to homework and real-life policy analysis. However, the teaching fellows really helped myself and many of the other students understand the details behind the concepts so we could apply them.",
    "The course was a good overview, but economics is difficult tounderstand when the topics are covered so broadly.",
    "The instructor needs more time in the classroom to learn how to teach. He had a very difficult time controlling class discussion and was routinely dismissive of people's comments and questions. His own commentary when he asked a question, which no one answered, suggested that we were all not competent, however, at least in my case, I was just not interested in raising my hand to offer an answer which might be received negatively or with a disparaging response. Additionally, both the TA's and students made recommendations on teaching or presentation of materialThe slides were not helpful at all. All of the actually relevant information was provided on the board, including graphs, which were always drawn messily. Why can't this content be provided as part of the lecture notes??",
    "While he clearly meant well, this class suffered from Prof. Gillingham's novelty as a teacher. I was lucky to have personal experience with the material, so felt no real stress in following his dense efforts at communication. Too often he keeps to \"the literature\" instead of citing real-world examples for his extremely real-world topics. Alas, his topics are in fact incredibly cool, but his inability to explain himself with a mere dense powerpoint-and-chalkboard-chart system left most people too frustrated at the end of each class to appreciate the gravity of what he's meant to explain.But to his well-earned credit, Prof. Gillingham's lessons improved greatly towards the end of the semester. I believe that was a combination of the topics - we had reached the really interesting stuff of climate policy - as well as his personal comfort in front of the class.Again, this is meant with respect for Ken, with whom I've genuinely enjoyed numerous conversations, and who I will probably ask to be my advisor. He's a fascinating researcher and a good guy, but so far, his teaching skills miss a tremendous opportunity to inspire (or at least educate). I highly recommend that he become a tenured FES professor in time - I'm writing such a thorough review because I'm genuinely cheering for him. But with the proviso that FES makes available some tutoring in communication.",
    "Although the explanations provided my Professor Gillingham were very good, there were different levels of understanding because many people already had introductory courses or degrees in economics.It must be very clear from the start that this is a foundation course and a lot of material is new to most students. Also, it must be considered that international students are not familiar with many American environmental policies, for which different readings should also be provided.Mankiw's book is not that helpful.",
    "The subject matter for this course was extremely interesting and I always appreciated the work Professor Gillingham put into each lecture. He clearly was committed to all of us. That being said, he was also clearly nervous and his inexperience showed especially during class-wide discussions that at times went on far longer than they should have. This caused many students to lose focus. When teaching a large class like this was, I would recommend cutting discussion much shorter and advising students to continue their questions or seek clarification in section. I am sure this will also become less of an issue as Professor Gillingham 's explinations become more lucid and suscinct. He clearly knows the material, was prepared, and has an impressive grasp of the field."

    "Professor seems genuinely interested in the material.",
    "I thought the best part of the course was where we started learning about different policy instruments and the role economics plays in natural resource policy and decision making. The readings were very helpful and applicable to the lecture material. The TA's for the class were excellent.",
    "I found the readings to be useful and interesting. In fact, they were absolutely necessary to convey some of the course's concepts that were topically covered in class.",
    "The TA weekly sessions",
    "- The TAs were very engaging and committed to the class- The layout of the class, the expectations and assignments were clearly presented at the beginning and maintained throughout the semester- The assignments were returned back to us in a prompt manner, suchthat we still could remember the questions and review them while still fresh in our heads.- The concepts were taught clearly and I feel that I was able to retain the information.",
    "I felt that Dr. Gillingham and the TA's were watching out for me, that they really wanted me to succeed.",

Environmental Economics is really something that most environmental professionals must have an understanding of, and I thought that the course did a great job of applying the principles to real-world situations.",
    "Ken's topics in this class may have been tough to follow sometimes, but fundamentally, he picked them extremely well. Market failures, game theory and the economics of extraction rates are FASCINATING, and foundational to nearly every environmental problem an FES could choose to tackle. I was grateful for the breadth he managed to cover.",
    "The problem sets and sections with the TAs were the best place to reinforce concepts learned in class, to practice, and discuss different points of view with peers.",
    "The class improved as the course went on. Professor Gillingham never seemed to get totally comfortable in front of the class but he certainly got better. Also the content of the second half of the course was much more interesting and better presented than the basic microeconomics that made up the first 7 or 8 classes.",
    "Professor Gillingham did a wonderful job of teaching. He was very responsive to students' questions, and toward the middle of the class, he began to give examples that were very relevant to homework questions and real-world examples. He left for a conference for a week and had another professor of high esteem substitute for him. Until then, I hadn't realized how much I preferred Gillingham's teaching style. I learned a great deal from this class. The course sparked an interest in economics (of the environment) for me, when I had absolutely no interest before. The course was fantastic."

    "The professor needs to be more selective about which student questions he answers in depth as he often became so sidetracked we didn't get through everything he planned on doing for that day.",
    "Structure; getting readings and lectures posted sooner so we can come better prepared; bigger graphs or pre-drawn graphs in slides",
    "Maybe work the pace of the course a little bit better. I found the stuff we covered in the last 2 lectures to be very interesting, but we could have used a few more classes to cover the material.",
    "Better reading material would improve this course a lot.",
    "The answer to this question changed throughout the semester. Naturally Ken seemed nervous toward the beginning but I hope he is more comfortable (he seems to be). Unfortunately, fellow students liked to complain rather than look inward for a lack of progress in the course. He did a great job considering it was his first semester teaching and if I am not mistaken, F&ES 505 is the largest class.I would suggest however that he work on the typos in his slides. A couple of times he had to re-post his PowerPoints on Classesv2 after noticing typos during lecture.",
    "There is an urgent need for an Environmental Economics textbook in addition to the micro-economics textbook. There was not a consistent reference for the concepts covered in the last half of the semester which proved to be very frustrating.",
    "I anticipate the professor's teaching style will improve overtime as he gets more experience in front of a large classroom. lectures we a little dry...but i thought they were good on the whole.",
    "Changing the pace of the class. Try getting through intro material faster, so as to allow time to go through the harder material later. Also, Professor G. should consider not answering as many questions in class because sometimes they are tangential and distracts from the course material. Save questions for section?",
    "More emphasis on helping students from non-economics based backgrounds solve the problems in the homework sets and exams. I often felt that too much was left up to the students intuition and previous experience.",
    "Lectures stalled a lot because of constant questions. Things would have been clearer if the Professor's whole message came through first and then questions were asked.",
    "I wish we had more time to focus on low carbon technology policy.",
    "more practice problems. for example we only had one problem from the problem set #9 and during final review we went over the same problem. There was little diversity in the type of questions we could be exposed to before the final test.",
    "The number of subjects covered and the Professor's capacity to synthesize them clearly in short lectures. The exams could also have been more closely matched to the material covered on problem sets.",
    "Clearer explanations of the core concepts in class. Often too much time was devoted to tangential questions, and key concepts were up to students to figure out during problem sets.",
    "Professor Gillingham was very accessible and definitely willing to help students. I feel bad that FES made him teach a course like this his first semester at the school with so many different levels of students and covering such a BROAD range of material. I also don't think the course the way it is designed is helpful. There should be a mandatory one or two week microeconomics sessions outside of the environmental economics portion of the class so there was time to spend on the material that everyone comes to FES to focus on!",
    "The readings were great (especially Keohane and Olmsted). It would have been helpful to have them integrated into the syllabus with dates from the beginning.I think Professor's Gillingham attitude towards students was sometimes sarcastic and dismissive. It might be worth noting that the students who were most involved in class were SOM students...maybe more of an effort could have been made to teach to the students who are new to economics.",
    "If you wanted to be able to complete or even comprehend the homework assignments, you would have to attend both the TA sessions and their office hours as only about 10% of what is asked for in the homework is covered by the instructor. I feel that for the amount of time I spent on work for this class I don't know nearly as much as I should. I would also have liked more economics-based lectures as opposed to policy-based lectures.",
    "Professor, lectures, problem set design.",
    "It was great! Gillingham is a great lecturer and is super approachable. I would love to take a seminar with him (hint hint hint).",
    "Nothing really. Great course.",
    "The workload is a bit too much.This could be worked upon",
    "During the first two weeks the course would benefit from less questions and debate",
    "I feel like I spent a lot of time copying slides and graphs. Maybe Gillingham could add the graphs to his slides.",
    "This is an introductory course. A textbook explaining all concepts covered is absolutely necessary.",
    "The midterm wasn't well put together and when we expressed concern to our instructor, he did not seem to accept responsibility.",
    "I found the graphs really hard to follow! Also, it would be good if there were some mention about how this is orthodox economics, but other types of economics (which reject some of these assumptions) exist and have credibility.",
    "The marker boards for illustrations during lecture were grossly inadequate and difficult to see in the classroom, thus compromising my ability to learn the material (and I did not sit in the back of the lecture hall). Bigger, better chalkboards are necessary. Yale should, at minimum, be able to provide a functional classroom.",
    "I thought for his first semester of teaching, Professor Gillingham did a good job. However, he or the school need to decide who this class is suppose to serve. I have never taken an economics course but I'm sitting in class next to SOM students. I realize that its difficult to teach to students with varying backgrounds but FES needs to figure this out. In all of my other foundation courses it seemed that everyone was on the same page as far as background in the material and understanding throughout the semester - not the case in Environmental Economics. I'm not saying the course material was too challenging, but people move at different paces given their backgrounds and prior knowledge regarding the material. At the very least their should be two different classes. One for people with a micro\/macro background and one for those with no background. That will benefit all - both student and professor.",
    "This class must be more approachable for those who have never had economics. A better balance of the quantitative and qualitative methods for explaining the concepts would help even the playing field for those with econ backgrounds and those without. A slightly slower pace would have been useful for me, but I understand if that was not others' experience. The classroom setting also was not conducive to learning the materials as they were tought. Since graphic and mathematical representations of the material were an essential part of the lectures, the whiteboards were not always easy to see or follow in class. The lecture notes also rarely corresponded with the graphs or diagrams drawn in class--and it was the latter that was essential to completing problem sets and succeeding on the exams.Though the instructor is new to teaching (and clearly very capable and intelligent), he needs to slow down and make the class more relatable and less academic and non-approachable. I was very much looking forward to taking this class and was turned off very quickly by the abstractness of the material and never really got re-engaged.",
    "The professor needs to be able to more better convey the material to the students",
    "I think the exams need the most improvement. I found that they did not test the actual material taught in the class- but rather extrapolated into subject matter that was not really discussed in the class. As I felt that I had a very strong understanding of the material taught, these exams were a bit frustrating - that I could not demonstrate my understanding through the exam. Additionally, in comparison to the exams from the year before, they were much more difficult.",
    "Dr. Gillingham is a new teacher and it shows. I'm sure his lecturing will become better with more experience.",
    "The pace of the course was a little strange. At times, it seemed as though we would spend valuable time belaboring relatively inconsequential points; while at others we would skip over seemingly important material. Professor Gillingham would be advised to not answer every single question directed at him; once in a while, it's okay to say, \"Come speak to me after class.\"",
    "The instructor should be better prepared to give examples to clarify his points in class.",
    "I feel that there should be project based evaluation too. A real case may be given to students and they should be asked to apply concepts of economics and come up with feasible strategies.",
    "Professor Gillingham's teaching - but I'm sure this will just take time. Its a big jump to teach your first college course.",
    "Full understanding of how the theory taught in this class is actually used by practioners in their jobs.",
    "The way the lectures are delivered need less open questions to the students and more content discussion rather.",
    "Dr. Gillingham is a very inexperienced teacher. He does not keep the class on topic and does not explain difficult economic concepts well.It would be VERY useful to use some kind of technology that would project hand written notes and graphs rather than using white boards. It was difficult to see.",
    "The class could better explain the reasons behind the economic concepts so the students have a better understanding of the material.",
    "The discussion sections and assignments could integrate better with the material presented in class. Assignments could also be weighted a little bit more given the substantial amount of time they require.",
    "The TAs were not even. There were some who where fanlminal and other who sucked. Because so much of the class relied on the work of the TA and the discussion sessions the difference between the TAs is a big draw back on the class.",
    "In the beginning the professor did not seem to be in the pace of class; in the middle there was a lack of reading materials, but at the end, he seemed to find a good balance.",
    "Cover too many thinks, no time to digest all",
    "This is a foundation course. The concepts and material are not challenging. The key piece in making this kind of class a success is not a good researcher but a good teacher. Hiring someone with little to no experience actually teaching was a mistake.Also, this course needs to cut out a lot of the micro background. If people don't have this prior knowledge, they should be required to take a separate course.Get a better textbook. The one required only provided very elementary micro background and was fairly fluffy. I had much better books from previous coursework that I had to rely on heavily.",
    "I often felt that the course was taught with an undergrad mindset. I'm not sure how to really define that other than the way the professor talked about exams, assignments, grades, things like that was as though we were undergrads and still competing for good grades. I also thought that some of the PPT slides could have been much improved were there graphs on them, rather than the professor always drawing graphs on the board, which were often difficult to see.",
    "I recommend that Prof. Gillingham \"unveil\" each new topic in appreciable real-world examples. Ken loves \"the literature,\" but his students do not live in that world.For instance, Prof. Gillingham would introduce a day's topic as \"informational market failures according to the literature\" and leave it at that for us to comprehend. That's necessary, but insufficient without, \"when people don't know what's out there to buy and sell, they can't create an efficient market. Take Craigslist; it created a market for knockoff items. Those unwanted rocking chairs and toasters always existed in attics, but an informational market failure - that attic contents are generally unpublished - kept a market from efficiently trading them around.\"It's to Ken's credit that he was able to cover so many topics in one semester, and among my friends in class, I consider myself lucky that I followed a decent amount of it. But unfortunately he left too many folks in swampy graphs without the real-world context - and in fact real-world inspiration - of much of the fascinating topics he wants to cover.",
    "Problem sets were not worth enough credit. They are a better reflection of students abilities to grasp the material and apply it, than are timed exams. They are a huge time commitment so they should count for me.The professor could definitely make his own \"textbook\" specific to the course with the exact concepts, equations, and graphs we were responsible for learning. This would be much more useful than a few relevant chapters of a micro econ text, power point slides with no graphs ,and supplemental readings. At the very least, including sample graphs\/problems on the powerpoints would be nice.Too much asking students to guess at answers during lecture. More time teaching would be ideal.",
    "Having a blackboard that everybody can see in Burke auditorium, better power point presentations, and more handouts to complement the readings.If at the end, the professor is running short of time, it is preferable to skip one last theme than to run though it.",
    "We should move much more quickly through the first half of the course. It is unfortunate how many items at the end of the syllabus were missed. The last few classes were fascinating and it would be great if we could have gotten to them sooner. During the microeconomics overview in the first half of the class, Professor Gillinham was often lingering on points when most of the class had already grasped it while only a few people were still working on it. Especially in a large class when we are behind on the syllabus it would have been great to use section to catch those students up rather than using large portions of class time when the majority of the class was not engaged. Obviously this is difficult in a foundation course but the balance was not well struck, especially during the first half of the course.",
    "After the first few weeks, Gillingham adapted really well to the teaching environment and from then on provided excellent and effective examples. My only comment is that maybe he could have started giving those kinds of examples from the start of the class."

    "Excellent, especially the TA help.",
    "Had class during professor office hours but was able to go to several TA office hours; always incredibly helpful.",
    "I always contacted the TAs when I needed help. I generally went to office hours once a week in addition to the weekly section to ask a few questions on the problem set.",
    "The quality was incredible. I worked with David and Nathan and they provided great guidance throughout the semester. I think they handled our questions in section and review sessions well. Some students quite frankly had a bad attitude and complained too much about the course and I appreciated their diplomacy in fielding comments.",
    "Both were readily available and responsive! It was great!",
    "very available",
    "TA Agha was very responsive via e-mails",
    "Great.",
    "Office hours for Professor Gillingham and Nathan Chan were very helpful and all explanations were very clear.",
    "Yes, the TA were very accessible and always willing to help.",
    "Excellent - the TA Nathaniel was wonderfully helpful and took pains to catch up students on materials they did not understand. He'll be a great professor.",
    "The TAs were incredibly knowledgable, accessible and helpful. Cannot express that enough. I was unable to attend the professor's office hours, but I heard he was helpful as well to those who were able to attend.",
    "Both were very accessible. The Discussion Sections were a must to understand how to do the problem sets.",
    "The TAs were splendiferous",
    "The TAs were great (all 3). The instructor was available for help, and was usually helpful.",
    "Quality of instruction from the Professor was poor. I don't think a foundation course is the place to train a first year professor with no teaching experience. The lectures were pretty bad, especially when they turned into town hall style question and answer sessions between the professor and a small group of the same 2 or 3 students. You can't run a lecture of that size by taking a question on an esoteric tangential topic that no one else can hear, and then use your answer as the take home point for the subject. Really, just poor lecture hall management. You have a class full of people from varying degrees of economics backgrounds. Spending the amount of time the Professor spent entertaining peoples' desire to listen to themselves speak is an absolute drain on scarce lecture time and was a clear indication of the Professor's inability to lead the lecture. with that said however, i wish this was not the first class I took with him, because he is clearly doing some really interesting work and i would like to learn more from him, but I am really discouraged because of my experience in this class. not entirely his fault though; I think that faculty management is at fault here and the board, or whoever makes these decisions failed in dispersing its faculty resources in this area.",

    "The TA's were incredible.",
    "Outstanding.I felt like the TAs were sometimes stuck with teaching things that should have been taught better in class (ex. harvesting and growth curves) and that going to section was essentially more class time rather than just reviewing concepts and problems from class.",
    "they were both very helpful and available",
    "All TA's for this class went well above and beyond to make sure students were understanding the material.",
    "Very available and helpful.",
    "Excellent -- all 3 TAs were incredibly accessible and available, and explained things very very well. I wouldn't have been able to pass this class without their discussion sections!!",
    "The TAs for the class were excellent. Review sessions were well run and I dont think I would have passed the class without their help. With that said, I thought it was unfair that the Review Sessions were more \"learning new material that we didnt have time to lean in class\" than actual \"review.\" If you cant figure out a way to incorporate materialduring actual class time, dont place that burden on the TAs when they are suppose to help with what we do learn in class.Professor Gillingham always made himself available but his office hours were always during normal class periods. Also, considering he was only teaching one class, I thought his involvement in the class as a whole could have been better. At least show up to some of the review sessions or hold extra sessions. For all of the other foundation courses this was done.",
    "Both the TAs and instructor were available and helpful outside of class. No complaints here.",

    "The TAs were particularly exellent and always willing to help!",
    "TA's helped us grasp the concepts.They were very supporting.",
    "I often went to my TA - Nathan Chan - for help during office hours if I had questions that were not answered in section or class. He was fantastic - extremely patient, responsive, clear, etc. One of the best TAs I have had in my 3 years at Yale.He also made it clear that he was available to help outside of his scheduled hours, and we could email him with questions during the week.",
    "Excellent. All made time for students, and the quality of my TA's sessions (Nathan Chan) were where I learned the most from the course.",
    "Very helpful!",
    "From the TAs the availability and quality was outstanding. Always willing to dispose their time in fruitful explanations and investing more time at the sections for further questions.I didn't contact the instructor for help regarding the course material so I have no comments for his part.",
    "The TAs were very helpful. They worked very hard to fill in the gaps in our understanding after lectures.",
    "I reached out to the TAs for assistance. All three were very helpful during their weekly sections (I've been to at least one session with each), and office hours.",
    "Excellent availability of both the instructor and TAs for any questions whatsoever.",
    "Good, the Prof was always available. See the TA response above.",
    "Without the TA's it would have been difficult to understand the topic",
    "The TA's were the saving grace of this class. All extremely competent, especially Nathan Chan.",
    "The TAs were outstanding and were always available and willing to answer our questions. I reached out to them much more than to the professor, but Professor Gillingham also made himself available whenever necessary. The TAs definitely were critical to my understanding of the core concepts, including using little tricks to help us remember certain things that I wish were taught in class.",
    "Although there were three TAs for this class, I really only made use of Nathan Chan. Nathan is an incredibly talented teacher, and it's to his credit that most of us learned from this class. His official review sessions were always an excellent use of an hour, and he made himself available for homework help at almost any hour of any day. I assume he used up waaaaay too much of his own time to make sure all of us felt up-to-speed with the class.My only contact with the other two TAs was through the handouts they occasionally devised to shore up particularly dense topics and lessons. Those handouts were excellent, and I'd recommend that they be distributed before their topic is covered in class.",
    "The TAs did a lot of the grunt work in this class, with respect to actually getting students to understand the material. Especially Nathan and Dave. Ali's strength was in the handouts he made for us outside of class.",
    "The availability and time put by the professor and TAs was excellent. Real quality time and real interest on wanting students to understand the themes reviewed in class.",
    "Yes, Both Nathan and David were terrific TAs. Nathan in particular was a huge help to me and often provided extremely clear explanations.",
    "Professor Gillingham invited questions in class. He sometimes devoted 15 minutes to answering students' questions. That was really clarifying.The TA's for this course showed genuine concern for the students' learning. They were dedicated and devoted a great deal of time to their students. If it weren't for them, the course material would have made less sense to me, and the course overall would have been less effective. I intend to take another course with Gillingham, and hopefully with the same three TAs."

    "As a joint-degree student in law, economics is critical to the way that we analyze environmental legal issues. I can already see the concepts covered in this course coming into my readings for other courses, and I definitely took away the \"fundamentals\" of environmental economics from the course. I think a course like this invaluable to anyone studying environmental management; however the design and structure of the course needs work.",
    "I'm not sure I will explicitly use it in the future but it was helpful to have an understanding of the economic aspects of decision making. I will not likely continue with economics course.",
    "This is a foundation for my program and vital that I understand the subject matter thoroughly.",
    "I'm very interested in how decisions are made at the policy level and how factors are considered. Environmental economics shows a very deliberate way for understanding when the optimal time or amount of a resource should be extracted so falls right into my interests.",

    "It was a great introduction to Environmental Economics",

    "I have no interest in economics but wanted to have some understanding of how its applied to environmental policy and management. I think it did the job but could have been better.",
    "This course is likely essential to my overall program (MEM) and any degree specialization tracks I may choose to take. I have a strong background in corporate business and few, if any, of my prior experiences were useful in understanding the material or concepts.",
    "I entered the course with no background whatsoever in economics, and was very grateful to obtain some. To me, it sometimes feels like what we're doing here at FES is essentially getting a business degree - we're here to sell, or at least make other people value, a product, and it just so happens that our product is the environment, a good that has never really been adequatelyvalued before. This is hardly a unique insight, but protecting the environment will require accurately evaluating and communicating the benefits it provides us in monetary terms. This class was incredibly helpful in that regard.",
    "I am a senior Environmental Studies major in Yale College, and this course was important to me because I felt that I needed to understand basic economics to be able to engage with others in the professional world, especially because economic and environmental issues are often closely related. This course satisfied my expectations and I'm very happy that I took this before graduating.",
    "This course places the foundation of environmental economics, the results from this foundation are to be profited from in the following course work.",
    "Since I plan to focus on Business and the Environment, this course was a critical foundations course that will help in the rest of my coursework. I plan to take a more advanced economics course after this.",

    "Yes",

    "I have a fairly strong economics background, and while I likely won't be using most of the tools and equations I learned in this class in my professional career as a corporate environmental manager, just having an understanding of environmental economics (very different from traditional economics) will be essential in helping me speak the language a little better and see howthings work in the bigger picture.",
    "I'm interested in the economics of climate change. This class was mostly review of concepts I knew intuitively but hadn't necessarily named before. Although I've made clear my sense of the class' teaching style, I want to emphasize again how much I enjoyed the topics.",
    "Economic valuation of natural resources is nowadays a basic tool of environmental management and having the basis of microeconomics is very important for an overall understanding.My background as a Biologist and former NGO participant needed every once in a while being familiarized with economic terms. I am very glad this is a foundation course for the MEM program because this course has given me the tools to read through papers and understand the concepts and maybe help in future economic valuations if needed.Also, this course is very important for people without economics background and is important for many other courses that I am now considering for spring semester.",
    "I have taken economics courses before but never environmental economics and I hoped this course would be a good refresher for future economics courses as well as provide a focus on environmental economics.",
    "This course covers the foundations of natural resource management. It covers the tools used in policy to cap emissions, and why or why not some of those tools may or may not work. The course was great at laying the foundations for policy and for management, as well covering the basics for environmental economics."

He moved us through a lot of material and if you do your part, you will come away with a good foundation in economics of the environment.",
    "The discussion section is not optional! Make sure you get to one every week!",
    "give kenny g a chance, he's new! ;)",
    "If you dont come from an economics background be prepared to learn a lot in a short time.",
    "It is really important to understand the fundamentals of economics because everything else you will learn in the future build on these principles. Office hours are a great resource if you're struggling with any of the material.",
    "Go to the TA for help.",
    "Go to sections when you do not understand the material and work hard on problem sets. Do the reading as much as possible and ask questions when you do not understand.",
    "Go to discussion sections!",
    "I hope this course changes.",
    "Read all the recommended material. Go to section and ask tons of questions. Working in a group for problem sets is invaluable. Try to understand the concepts more than just the math.",
    "Be prepared to teach yourself economics. Absolutely go to the TA sessions; the lectures are not worth nearly as much as those sessions (if you would like to pass the homeworks).",
    "Take it with Kotchen.",
    "Try to keep up with the readings they're really helpful and reinforcing concepts. Go to the office hours if you have a question--or even if you don't. You'll have clarifying questions you didn't even realize you had.",
    "Overall a good course if you are interested in understanding basic economics for environment",
    "seek help from the professor and TA's early in the semester.",
    "Work with others. Go to section. Ask a lot of questions.",
    "take problem sets to your advantage!",
    "Make use of the TAs to bring you up to speed.",
    "If you're really trying to learn the material, review notes after each class, and come to discussion sections with specific questions.",
    "Don't take it if you have had evenone econ class already, take something more advanced.",
    "Be prepared to put a lot of work into the course for an unequal amount of reward, and that if you have never taken economics or haven't done math in recent years, be prepared to do so.",
    "Seek your own help from the beginning and do not fall behind; ask a lot of questions and be persistent until you understand the material",
    "Take advantage of section, do all the problem sets.",
    "Definitely seek out the TAs - they're extremely helpful. Make sure to take notes on everything written on the white board, as the most important material is often not included on the slides. And remember - econ theory is just that, theory. If you're thinking about asking a question that begins, \"But in the real world, this would never...\" just save it til after class.",
    "It is necessary to put a sufficient amount of time into the homework assignments and the readings in order to really learn the material.",
    "Make sure that you do all the readings before the class to get better understanding of what is going on in the class.",
    "Seek help from that TAs if you are confused - they are great resources.",
    "Definitely go to the weekly TA sessions, and seek outside help. Professor Gillingham's readings were also very helpful in most cases.",
    "I would advise students taking this course to wait until the second lecture of the week to start the problem set. There is no point in starting earlier since the material was usually not covered until the end of the week.",
    "Don't hesitate to reach out to the teaching fellows if you have questions about the homework or concepts in general. Additionally, the readings really helped to better understand what was discussed in class.",
    "Attend every weekly discussion section as many topics that are on the assignments are covered in the section but not in the lecture.",
    "Don\u0092t take it. I have some comments that I don\u0092t think fit in anywayre else so I am going to put them here. I think hat Prof G will be a good prof in the future but he has a lot to learn. He let students runs the class in terms of pace and what we covered and that was not a good thing. He needed to take control of the classroom and be willing to tell students that they need to see him out of class because their questions were waisting the time of other students in the class or because they are just to slow to keep up with the work.",
    "Be ready to do problem sets!",
    "If they want to learn the basic of economics of the environment, they should take the course.",
    "Not to take it",
    "There is a fair amount of work, but it's manageable. If you haven't had any economics before it can move kind of fast, but if you have the first few weeks might be a nice chance to really solidify what you already know before diving into new topics. And if you are an SOMer but haven't had environmental economics before, I definitely recommend taking it, as there is very little overlap with the economics taught over at SOM.",
    "Get a copy of the Cartoon Guide to Micro ahead of time. Get a fun crew and a 6-pack for each week's problem set, and keep in very close touch with TA Nathan Chan.And do the readings. Ken may love \"the literature\" too much for lectures, but he does do a great job choosing interesting readings.",
    "1. Asking a lot in class2. Reading all the papers3. Doing all the problem sets4. Attending all the sections with TA5. Considering going to office hours with the professor",
    "Only take the course if you anticipate using economics (i.e.: for environmental economic policy) in your future career.",
    "You MUST attend TA sections. Go to all three if you have time for it. It will make your life so much easier, and you will understand the material better. Go to TA office hours too. Homework, and therefore understanding the course material, will be nearly impossible without these resources."
