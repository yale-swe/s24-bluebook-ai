   "comments": [
    "take it, it's actually interesting. not a very difficult class, you get a lot out of it if you're actually interested.",
    "It is one of the most entertaining classes at Yale! I have learnt a lot and I laughed a lot too. If you need a science credit go for it!",
    "I would recommend this class as a great way to learn about an overview of how the Earth and Solar System works, as well as how they impact natural disasters.",
    "freaking awesome class",
    "It was a good science class -- I was engaged by the material and I definitely learned applicable information. The homework felt random compared to the lectures, because it was so focused on concepts of physics that we werent really doing in class but the professors changed the program such that more of the equations were explained in the homework and Friday lectures.",
    "Great course, especially if you need a Science credit. Workload is a problem set per week and the problem sets is very informative and the math is totally do-able. Not to mention the material is REALLY INTERESTING!!!",
    "Its not a difficult class but you have psets every week and you need to pay attention in class and study for exams.",
    "G&G 100 is a super fun, super easy class! I would definitely recommend taking it; it's made me excited about earth science again. (I loved it in middle school, but forgot it until now.) I learned a bunch, didn't have to work very much at all, and am hoping to go on the spring break trip to the Caribbean, to see what real geologists do!",
    "I would highly recommend anyone taking it. The workload is quite manageable, and the exams straight forward (as long as you know the big concepts).",
    "Take it for your science credit. Not too hard and really interesting and applicable to daily life.",
    "one of those classes that makes you view the world that we live in differently",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is an interesting class and it is taught very well.",
    "Good class. It included some math, which was annoying as you don't get QR credit, and weekly problem sets. But overall, a good science credit for non-science majors.",
    "YES! If you need a fun science class with understandable material, take it.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. The class is very intersting and the professors are awesome. The only thing that sucks are the problem sets each week, but if you go to section they help you do them easily.",
    "Rant: because science is a hierarchical subject, and there aren't an army of professors ala the math department to school everyone very roundly in the basics, you end up with the guts and then the really difficult classes, with a couple of diamonds in the rough, which are moderately challenging and can nicely round out a semester. Sometimes this class was the last, and a lot of times it was the first. The material is fairly interesting (and to my mind, important), and the professors were really lovely and easy-going -- I get the feeling that geology departments tend to be a fun mix of super-outdoorsy tail-gaters and the uber-nerdy -- but the class atmosphere was a drag, and made going to lecture kind of painful, and going to section even worse. I don't see that ethos changing unless the class gets harder.",
    "Take this if you need a science credit. If you get to go on the field trip I also recommend it because it seems like a great experience. The material is interesting and not exactly the most difficult.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! It is a very interesting, fairly easy science credit. The material is also very interesting and useful to know.",
    "It is a great intro course to geology. Professor is really helpful. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course if you have taken physics in high school. Don't take it if you've never taken physics before because the problem sets will be awful otherwise.",
    "We basically cover the concepts of how and why natural disasters occur. The material is pretty interesting, although the homework has a lot more math than I expected. But otherwise, the work load is light and very doable.",
    "This was a GREAT class in which I learned about all sorts of natural disasters in an interesting way. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone wanting a taste of geology and the (amazing) geology department, toboth science and non-science majors. The professors are fun and very approachable, and offer field trips and any outside help you may need.",
    "This is the best science credit you will ever take. It's so fun, the professor is AMAZING, and it's the kind of information that is really cool to know. Exams are completely fair and the workload isn't half bad either. You'd be missing out on one of the best professors and the best classes at Yale if you went four years without taking this.",
    "Good class for non-science majors. Problem sets each week are hard but there are review sections that help you through them and are definitely worth it. TAs were very good during review sections.",
    "If you are taking this class for an easy Sc credit (like I did), be warned that it is easy depending on how comfortable you are with basic physics and advanced algebra. There are weekly homeworks, which are often math-based, but the midterm and final have very little and SIGNIFICANTLY easier math. So, if you can do well on the homeworks (and there are sections each week you can go to which will basically give away the answers), you are set. You don't really need to go to lecture, the powerpoints get posted online and the textbook is basically the same thing.",
    "Good class. Lectures can get a little boring, but Professor Bercovici is a good guy. The G&G department is full of chill bros, both professors and TAs, and that makes the class pretty enjoyable. My caveat for taking it would be that most people are justin here for a science credit, and I think the professors and TAs realize this, so everything is heavily simplified--which is not always a good thing. Also, people not in it often consider it a joke, although I would say it's actually a decent introduction to the Earth and its working (aka, geology and geophysics).",
    "TAKE NATTY D. You will not regret it. Everything about this class is stellar. If you have a math-talented friend to do the psets with then this is a no-lose situation for you, let me tell you. I'd recommend going to the Friday classes but a lot of people don't so if that's what's stopping you DON'T LET IT STOP YOU. I actually ended up genuinely loving this subject ugh I can't say enough good things about this class, I'm so serious right now.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student! I think this class is worth taking...the things you learn in here are applicable to real life... I loved how they emphasized learning \"concepts\" rather than the details... because of that... this was the one class that I actually learned the most from this semester and probably throughout my experience at Yale. The bonus is that you can sound smart when talking about natural disasters because not many people know why the occur..",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I first took the course for a science credit, but found it became one of my most enjoyable classes, even though it met on Fridays. The exams are straightforward and not difficult if you study the lecture slides closely. The Professors are both very enthusiastic and seem to really enjoy the class.",
    "G&G100 is a great class if you are looking for an interesting way to fill your science requirement. The material is great and the professors are even better!",
    "I would recommend it. Learned a lot! An interesting lecture, though they were often stuffed with a lot of info to take in at one time. DB makes the class fun, though the problem sets could be confusing; go for help with the TAs when you can.",
    "I would recommend it. Easy class that is very straightforward. The science may be hard for non-science people, but it is probably one of the most straightforward science classes at Yale",
    "Overall interesting class for a science credit.",
    "This class is a reasonable science credit if you like a funny professor and a relatively light workload. The reading is totally unnecessary, and class is kind of too since he posts all the lecture slides online. The problem sets can be a little physics or calculus-based, but honestly it's nothing above Precalculus or basic physics (forces, centrifugal forces, etc.) If this worries you, maybe you shouldn't take the course, but there are even sections dedicated to just solving the problem sets. Overall, there's a lot of hand-holding in the class, and the exams are extremely fair. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as amazing as the title suggests.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. All students should take it.",
    "This is a course that does not seem important or interesting but is worth every minute of it. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in the sciences we actually interact with on a daily basis.",
    "Perfect class for a non-science major needing a science credit. Much better than the other science offerings. Professor was very helpful. Problem sets were somewhat difficult but they give a lot of help. The exams are basically the problem sets with different numbers.",
    "This is a course that explains the basics of many natural occurrences that occur in the world. I would definitely recommend this if you don't mind some problem sets that get a little tricky mathematically. Overall it is a fun course.",
    "A great science credit for non-science majors and helpful in the real world. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in natural disasters.",
    "Professor Bercovici was a great lecturer. The powerpoints were clearly carefully made and were really helpful. This class made natural disasters very relevant and made me look at the world in a different way. So awesome to know how thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanoes etc. work!Pros: Awesome material! Really made me think about the world in a different way. Very relevant, great powerpoints, helpful sections and helpful TAsCons: Difficult Psets, too many psets, 2 midterms AND a final, weekly reading quizzes, a LOT of material.Be warned: NOT an easy science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a pretty easy 5th class, especially if you have some math\/science experience. Plus, free spring break trip!",
    "AMAZING. TAKE IT. DAVE IS THE BEST. Don't be frightened by all the math at first, it gets better... this course is not a gut, but as a non-science\/math guy, it was still manageable. This class was great- made me wonder why I ever wrote off science back in the day.",
    "The class is a general overview of the topics in G&G with a focus on disasters (plate tectonics + earthquakes and volcanos, climate + storms and hurricanes, fuel + fires, astronomy+ impacts on earth). There is a weekly problem set, which are easy if you go to section and two midterms. Overall It was a good class and not too hard.",
    "This is the BEST science class to take if you aren't really interested in science. The context of natural disasters makes learning basic physics and earth science concepts much more relevant and interesting. The professors are awesome and very laid-back too--they basically don't care about grades and want everyone to do well.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. A bit heavier on the math than I expected and the homeworks were not always easy, but the material was really interesting and both professors are personable and make lecture enjoyable. Really was a lot of fun!",
    "Natty D is legitimately one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I wish more courses were like it.I hadn't taken Earth Science since 6th grade, so even though the class was taught at a 10th grade level (since it's a sci gut) I still learned a ton.I had been avoiding taking a science class because I didn't want to take some hardcore sci credit and have to compete with the premeds, BUT on the other hand, I actually really LOVE science and didn't want to take a dumb, pointless class just to get the Sci credit. Natty D struck the PERFECT middle ground.Not too much work, yet I actually learned a ton about the world around me. I had never understood plate tectonics or tidal waves or why the heck East Rock was there sticking out of the ground.Also, Prof Bercovici is AMAZING and hilarious and really personable, plus there's the spring break field trip to the Caribbean.Downsides: maybe a bit dumbed down in some ways, tho the psets usually went into more detail. Also as a heads up, the problem sets (weekly) take a couple hours. You can't just scrawl them out during lunch.",
    "It's a great course for non-science majors. I wasn't overwhelmed by the material and just enjoyed it. It is very applicable to everyday life.",
    "I would summarize it as a fair amount of learning, very interesting course material and kind of difficult. I would definitely recommend it to whoever needs a science credit.",
    "Take it. You'll learn a lot and the workload won't be to high.",
    "The course is an interesting course for a non-science person to take for a science credit. It is interesting and useful knowledge. I highly recommend this course if you need a science credit but do not want to take a math-intensive course.",
    "Bill Nye the Science guy in college",
    "Good course to take for an SC. Interesting + Bercovici is great.",
    "A great way to get a science credit. It is not a QR even though you have problem sets to complete every week.",
    "GREAT beginning knowledge of the earth's systems. NOT A GUT--but not super hard. The teach--amazing.",
    "Natural Disasters is a fantastic way to get a science credit. The material is interesting and relevant, and Professors Bercovici and Robinson explain everything in a clear yet engaging way. I never felt like the material was being too dumbed down, although complex terminology is de-emphasized. There's a fair amount of work\u0097weekly reading quizzes (graded on completion, not accuracy) and problem sets, two midterms, and a final\u0097but none of it is very difficult and there are plenty of (optional) sections where you can get help. Both Professors are great (Bercovici does Monday and Wednesday, Robinson does Friday), and pretty much everything is online if you have to miss a class\u0097not that you'd want to. In short, YES take this class.",
    "Take it for an easy sc credit, or if you need a cool, fun 5th class",
    "Natural Disasters is an interesting class that requires a lot of memorization. The most important part is knowing what and what not to study. There is lots of information and general ideas are definitely the focus so don't waste time studying all the non-critical details.",
    "this class is mostly a joke but take the latter half of the course seriously--things can get a little difficult if you never show up to lecture",
    "Natural Disasters is a survey course of the natural hazards and disasters that we experience on our planet, including earthquakes, volcanoes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and asteroids. Weekly lectures and optional homework checking session are both helpful and instructive. Weekly problem sets are pretty straightforward and a good review of the material from the week's lectures, and 2 midterms and a final all cover the material from the lectures as well.Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The course was very interesting, and quite a painless way to earn a science credit. I would definitely recommend to someone taking this class to go to lecture on Friday, as the material for the week is reviewed in depth, as well as it is helpful for the next week's homework. I would also recommend going to the homework sessions. The professors were great and energetic, and this class was an overall positive experience.",
    "Very interesting class. Basically you learn about the disasters in the planet and what precipitates them; it's interesting to realize towards the middle (when you've absorbed enough different material) how everything is interconnected. Combined with a great lecturer (Bercovici is the bomb), it's an awesome class to take.",
    "G&G100 is an awesome class that introduces you to the general concepts of the processes that drive our world. It's not super rigorous, but if you're looking to learn how earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, etc. drive our world and keep it in equilibrium, this is a cool class to take. Professor Bercovici and Professor Robinson are a humorous duo and very easy to follow so you shouldn't have much difficulty with this course.",
    "Good class, especially for a science credit. The hw\/reading quizzes don't take that long, and reading the book is alright for a textbook. Lectures are interesting enough. And some people get to go to Dominica\/Martinique over Spring Break, which is cool. I'd definitely recommend this class as a science credit.",
    "Natty D was a great great course for a science credit. Fun topics, fun professors, straight forward exams. The problem sets can have trickier math, but the help sections are immensely helpful if you are struggling. I'm so glad I chose this class for my science credit...I was actually genuinely interested in the material and the lectures (which is saying a lot for me in a science class). Take it!",
    "Intro to natural disasters - really good class that knows exactly what an intro course should try to accomplish. Not easy, def not a gut, but interesting and structured enough that if you put in the work you'll do well",
    "An overview of every kind of natural disaster from volcanoes to asteroid impacts. I would recommend it for anyone, especially if you are looking for an easier science.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Material is really interesting, Bercovici is a good lecturer. Two midterms and weekly problem sets. The problem sets can be challenging but sections are offered at night twice a week to go over all of the problems. The class is not super challenging and not super quantitative.",
    "I would recommend this course. There is a fair amount of work involved, but it is tailored to help you master the material and prepare you for exams.",
    "Great science credit because material is interesting and relevant.",
    "Not a gut. Problem sets are hard, almost impossible at times but the tests are really easy.",
    "G&G 100 will teach you all about the systems involved in natural disasters, going through their causes and relation to broader systems of how the earth and universe work. The material is interesting and understandable. If you need a science credit, this is a great way to get one.",
    "YES. Dave Bercovici is fantastic, an informative, kind, and challenging (but not overwhelmingly so) professor. I was looking for a science credit that would interest and challenge me while not being overwhelming and this fit the bill exactly. I'm now inspired to take more geology classes, and only wish that Professor Bercovici taught a follow-up class or other intro classes. As a non-science person, he really brought out my excitement for the subject. A word of warning- this is not a gut. The problem sets can be tough, but there are loads of homework help sections, and if there is enough demand Professor Bercovici will hold one of his own- I ended up going to that every week.",
    "If you're looking to actually know something after your science credit, and are willing to spend a bit of time on memorization, this is a great choice.",
    "It's areally great class that teaches you about hurricanes, storms, plate tectonics, volcanoes... all in a really easy to understand and remember way. It corrects common misconceptions you might have about how the Earth works. It's really a great class, a lot of fun and really interesting. You should definitely take this class.",
    "G&G 100 is a survey course for Natural Disasters,as well as Earth's Systems and Processes. It is a very comprehensive survey. I would highly recommend this class to a student. It is well taught, interesting, and most importantly, extremely relevant, as it touches on topics like climate change and hazardous weather events.",
    "Definitely. Take this class.",
    "I think this course is perfect for a student looking for an engaging but relatively easy science course.",
    "The class is not difficult at all as long as you follow the lecture slides. The math required is equivalent to some of the things you learned in physics in high school, so it isn't that difficult. Definitely take it if you are looking for a science credit!",
    "Its a real-life applicable science class for non science majors. Dont take if physics is your mortal enemy. Id recommend it though, engaging lectures and not that much work compared to other science classes.",
    "Overall I certainly recommend this course because of the interesting topics discussed",
    "It's a good class for a science credit--not a blowoff class, so you actually learn information and come away with a good understanding of how the world\/natural disasters work, but it is not science heavy and the problem sets and exams are very manageable.",
    "This class was interesting but a bit harder than I had expected. The reading quizzes were helpful to understand and research topics, but the problem sets were much harder than anticipated and did not always help to understand the concepts that were tested.",
    "You come away with a good general understanding of the science behind natural disasters, which covers concepts in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and geological history. At the end of class, by justdoing problem sets, going to lecture, and not really having to read much of the book, you should be able to do well on exams and understand the different forces operating\/disturbing\/recycling themselves on Earth.However, you will not really be able to name specific events or grasp complex scientific\/mathematical concepts, just the basics.I'd especially recommend this class to students interested in the Earth and nature, because it's the hands-on experience of going out and looking at rocks and hanging with the professors(which we did on a mini-field trip) that you actually appreciate Geology.",
    "I would recommend, very interesting class",
    "G&G 100 was a great course. Grading was fair, lectures were fun and interesting, and the professors were very helpful. I would recommend this course because it was interesting and relevant to the issues we face today.",
    "This class has a decent amount of work, but is a great class to take because you learn so much taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class with the following caveat: it is not a gut class. It requires a great deal of work and there is a fair amount of quantitative work thatcan at times be frustrating to those with less than stellar math skills.",
    "This is a science course for people who don't like math. The only math you use is basic physics (energy equations) and dimensional analysis; the rest is all qualitative stuff. I took this class on a whim and found it pretty interesting to learn about what goes into earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, etc. Bercovici is a cool guy who can keep lectures interesting. Frank (who did Friday's lectures) can get a little dry at times.In order to do well, go to the sections they hold. All they do is go through the problem sets problem by problem and basically do it for you; I never got below a 90 (out of 100) on the PSets, so they're a good investment.",
    "Geology and Geophysics 100 01 is a course about natural disasters mostly. It focuses on geological, cosmological, meteorological disasters. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to purse this major or who wants to receive a science credit, but does not want to compete with premeds in a biology or chemistry class. I took this course for the latter reason, but also because I am interested in hurricanes. Looking back, the course did not reach my expectations because there was not enough emphasis on this. Also, there is so much other information to learn that I feel the title \"Natural Disasters\" should not be used to describe the course.",
    "The course focuses on how things work on our glorious planet. The problem sets were not easy (well that's mostly because I'm a little rusty on my math) but the professors and TA's were consistently helpful. Definitely take the course!",
    "Some problem sets were a lot harder than the normal class material.",
    "Very good class. Interesting material, not very difficult, and Professor Bercovici is clearly passionate about making sure the students of the class are all engaged.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is extremely interesting and if weather processes and origins of life and Earth could prove interesting to you, it is worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It was very interesting to learn how the Earth works, it truly is an amazing planet!",
    "Dont take it, one of my least favorite classes. You can find easier sciences.",
    "Yes, if you like the material or need a science credit",
    "It's an easy science credit, as you have probably heard. If you try hard enough and are able to pull out a good application at the end, you have a chance to go on the Spring break field trip to see volcanoes! Take it!",
    "While the homework's were usually more math-based and overall more difficult than both midterms and the final, they were do-able because problem sessions were held. A broad range of both interesting and not-so-interesting topics were covered and the professors are very understanding. You can definitely get away with not doing the reading. Overall great class- definitely take it if you are at all interested!",
    "This course is very interesting and combines various sciences to teach about all the natural disasters that occur on Earth and that effect us everyday. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because the teacher is very good and the class material is intriguing and fascinating.",
    "This class was great.I learned a lot of information and though nothing was out of my reach as a non science major, I still feel that I came out of the course with a better understanding of how the earth works.I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to fill their science credit OR anyone interested in the subject even if they are already on top of their science credits.",
    "I don't think I would recommend the course to another student because I took the course because it seemed like a good science class to take for non-majors and because it didn't seem like it involved a lot of math whereas it actually did and I found that difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class was great--I could not imagine a better-crafted intro class for non-science majors, and it was clear that our instructors Dr. Bercovici and Dr. Robinson were highly skilled instructors who were actually invested their teaching.The strengths of the course: interesting topics relevant to real life; well-structured lectures and demonstrations; fair problem sets and tests; plenty of help sessions. I truly felt like I learned \"how things worked\" regarding many disasters in a way that I can apply to my life and won't forget after 5 months.My only caution: the problem sets do involve a reasonable amount of actual math-y physics-y problems so if this is not your forte, this may require some effort. Good news though is that there're weekly TA sections that literally walk you through the problems, and the actual tests are not so hard if you learn the main concepts.Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in the subject matter at hand or for someone interested in taking a well-taught intro level Geology and Geophysics course for the science credit.",
    "I recommend this class. lectures can be boring but overall interesting."
