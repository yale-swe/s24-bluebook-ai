    "Big mistake not to take if you get in.",
    "1. Read great speeches (but you don't really have to, because Hill summarizes all of the material in class).2. Give speeches (one introduction, one speech that you pick, and one that you write) and get critiqued (the class is awesome for giving you sharp constructive criticism, and you're expected to do the same).3. Do random assignments (bullet point memos, occasionally giving a short speech on a random topic, or writing a diplomatic letter)4. Have discussions (on anything from current speeches and events, the fashion of Hillary Clinton, or lamenting the decline of American education)5. Learn life lessons with Charles Hill (really, he talks a lot about great topics, although he is very opinionated).A great senior class if you can get in.",
    "Of course, you should take this course! Not much work but you will learn things that will help you in your professional life. Professor Hill, I have a feeling, taught us those lessons that aren't good just for a class, but that we will keep coming back to later in life.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. Three yeses from me. Great, great class. Perhaps one of the most useful classes I have taken here at Yale. Before taking this class I'd be nervous to speak up even in seminars. Now I can go up on the stage and address a crowd at ease. I am very happy to see this transformation in me. And if you want to see the same kind of transformation too, do not hesitate to shop it. Only open to seniors though.",
    "Absolutely perfect for a second semester senior. Loved the final project (a 3 min speech).",
    "You read, give, and discuss great speeches. This is a really unique and wonderful course that makes a great capstone to a liberal arts education and will not drown you in work for your last semester. Definitely take it if you get in.",
    "I highly advise this class for anyone looking into polishing his\/her public skills. You build really good realtions with your peers because you are put on the spotlight for feedback, so it is a trusting and nurturing environment for your rhetorical speech. Besides from that, the historical and classical texts reviewed are a must, so it is a good chance to get to read them.",
    "Great course, highly recommended if you can get in. With oratory, you only really learn by doing, and you will be doing plenty of oratory, giving speeches in front of the seminar on a regular basis. Charles Hill, though perhaps a bit old-fashioned, is one of the more knowledgeable people you will ever meet, particularly on politics and oratory. You will learn a lot, and it's a great course for bonding with your classmates and learning about a vitally important topic not taught anywhere else at Yale.",
    "An opportunity to broaden ones intellectual horizon and be constructively realistic about how things actually work in practice.",
    "Yes. If you get in it is a no brainer.",
    "This is an awesome class. You should definitely take it if you have the opportunity. Not only do you get to learn , the class critiques the speech and offers constructive criticism. Each class revolves around discussion of a different orator. There is a written midterm, and the final is an opportunity to write and deliver a short speech on the topic of your choice. Professor Hill is awesome. He has tons of experience in the area, and he has great stories and answers to all questions. Taking a class with him was a privilege.",
    "Life lessons with Charles Hill. Lots of practical lessons on speaking in public and how to conduct yourself in professional settings.",
    "Read good speeches, practice writing and giving speeches. Lern life lessons from Professor Hill. Meet a great group of people and have a lot of fun. Take it if you can!",
    "I think that this class was the perfect offering for a 2nd semester senior. The workload is manageable and the skills and knowledge acquired are applicable to life after Yale in so many ways. You really have to take this class if you get in. The thing is, if you're not a senior, there's no way you're gonna get in. But hedge your bets senior year and absolutely go for it. You won't regret it. One of the most exciting classes on a day-to-day basis that I've come across. And taking a class with Charles Hill is a must if you have the chance",
    "I would whole heartedly recommend this class",
    "Lots of fun. You get to practice speaking and listen to and critique your classmates. Very laid back but extremely valuable experience for anybody, any major",
    "This was an interesting class -- though it was admittedly more of a \"story-time with Charles Hill\" class than I was expecting. However, that wasn't really a bad thing, as Charles Hill has some very memorable stories and insights. I wish we had had even more opportunities to give speeches! (You only give 3 prepared speeches during the semester). I also think the emphasis in this class was on improving delivery of speeches as opposed to content\/speechwriting. That said, I very much enjoyed this class; it is an excellent class for seniors about to leave Yale, and there's a nice camaraderie that develops among the students. Professor Hill also challenged our beliefs a great deal; it is no secret that he is conservative and most Yale students are liberal-- he often caused me to reflect on my own political and social beliefs, which I definitely appreciated.",
    "This course is unlike any other you will take at Yale. You will gain a broad knowledge of the history of western oratory, a toolkit for analyzing, writing, and delivering speeches, and have the opportunity to practice your own oratory style in a setting thick with honest and constructive feedback. In addition, you will bond with your classmates in a way that only honest feedback can allow!"
