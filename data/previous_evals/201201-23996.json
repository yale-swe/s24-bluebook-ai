    "A must-take if you are interested in decision neuroscience in human. A very good complement to Neuroscience 596, which focuses more on the monkey electrophys literature.Would definitely recommend it."

    "As an undergraduate, it has certainly made me start contemplating different concepts to test for a senior thesis.",
    "It extended my thinking in a very different way than I am exposed to in my own discipline. It even got me to thinking of an alternative dissertation question, which ultimately won't be pursued (but the class was that thought-provoking).",
    "Coming in with little neuroscience background, I learned a ton. Not sure yet how much I want to go down that road in my research, but if I end up doing so, it was an excellent starting point.",
    "Very helpful. Expose me to a great breadth of the field"
