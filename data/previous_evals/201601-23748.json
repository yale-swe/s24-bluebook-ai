   "comments": [
    "Great course. Definitely for people who prefer to learn conceptually and truly understand physics concepts.",
    "If you took 170 and liked it, give 171 a try. Otherwise take 181. 171 may be easier, but it was a frustrating experience.",
    "The class is pretty demanding since there is a weekly quiz and problem set in addition to exams, but these really do help you stay on track. The course is as fair as it could be. Whenever there was an assignment that a lot of people bombed, they would drop it and learn to make the next one less difficult. The professors definitely care about you in 171.",
    "A really cool class. Who knew physics could be so fun? (seriously, though.) I mean, psets are psets, but they weren't so difficult to go through since there's really good support from both instructors, TAs, and all the peers (the community is generally superb).",
    "PHYS171 is a basic general physics class and a good counterpart to PHYS170 (exact same format). The two-professor format is not the best, but the class is manageable if you put in the time to understand the material.",
    "Don't take it",
    "It was a lot of work for me, but the course was also easier for some students. It depends on your physics background.",
    "Like everyone else says, if you're taking this course it's because you have to. Be prepared to do most of the learning on your own time. Weekly grind. Grading is pretty fair though.",
    "This course was really challenging. The problem sets mostly contained math derivations that felt impossible without the help of the TF's. The lectures were frustrating because it seemed that their focus was not on physical concepts but on math equations. I did not enjoy this class because of that.",
    "171 isn't an amazing class, but most of the intro physics classes aren't that great. I took 180 in the fall so I was switching over to 171, but I would still make this choice. 171 was fairly straightforward but oftentimes unnecessarily confusing. If you study the lecture slides and do practice problems, though, you'll be good. Problem sets and participation and quizzes together make up a huge part of your grade, so don't slack on these easy points!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Lots of work, and it's a difficult class, but I learned a lot.",
    "Physics 171 is one of those courses you take if you are worried about your background in mathematics, because it really does well to teach you the concepts necessary for understanding basic E&M, without going too far into it. Take the course with the associated lab, 166L, if possible. It'll help. Work in groups on the PSETs. Ask questions. You'll do fine, though maybe won't have fun. But then again, maybe you will.",
    "PHYS 171 was much better than PHYS 170, both the content and organization. It is a tough course and you really have to put in the hours to understand the material because it is not something you can understand fully just by going to lecture. Take it if you need to, but not if you don't.",
    "Take this over 181. It wasn't too traumatic.",
    "Definitely take Physics 181 instead of 171. As a premed, I thought that this would be the most effective path for me. However, it's just not worth it. There are no biological applications and it just ends up being poorly taught and all over the place. I took 170 and that was definitely worth it, but 171 is not.",
    "The course is fine overall. It takes a lot of work, and since you're probably being required to take it it likely won't be particularly enjoyable, but it's probably more fun\/interesting than PHYS 181 so you might as well. Lots of work--a new chapter every week or two, a p-set every week, weekly quizzes, lots of out-of-class time required to really understand the material, two midterms and a final. If you took 170, it's a straight-up continuation of that, though a bit slower-paced (definitely a good thing).",
    "171 was less bio centered than 170, which made it feel pointless. I heard that 181 was taught better, maybe take that. However, in past semesters 171 has been better so I really don't know. Up to you!",
    "Worst class ever. Very abstract. Was in survival mode the entire time.",
    "You're not going to learn much from the modules (the online textbook) because they're poorly written, and you're not going to learn much from lecture because they largely just run through examples in the module. What you WILL learn from is TA's office hours, sections, and the interactive parts of lecture (the clicker questions). I can't imagine why anyone would take this class except for a requirement, and so I feel bad for you if you still have to take it. That said, as much as I would have liked a real physics class with a real textbook that might have taught me more physics, I can't say that I would have chosen 180\/181 over this series because 170\/171 was pretty light on the calculus (I have no idea if 180\/181 required a slightly higher level of math, but I'm assuming it was). It was cool learning how physics relates to bio, but if you're decent at math, honestly it's not worth it and you should just take the classical physics (180\/181). Honestly the biggest thing I learned in 171 was how to calculate eigenvalues\/eigenvectors because almost every topic incorporated them.",
    "I really liked PHYS 171 - it was very well-taught, the material was super cool, and I thought the tests were challenging but fair. I was also constantly impressed by how much the professors (Claudia and Rona) cared about students and took into account their feedback."
