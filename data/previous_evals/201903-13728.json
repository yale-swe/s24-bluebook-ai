   "comments": [
    "no weaknesses, best class ever at yale",
    "If related to more advanced tools would be better",
    "This course should be a flipped course - where students review lectures\/handouts ahead of time and Dana is able to work with students in the lab during class. The examples used in class are not applicable to many forestry students who are working with incredibly spatial and disparate data, but are geared more towards landscape architects or urban planners. Having Dana in the lab, working with students to show how the software works with our respective information would be helpful.",
    "The course is a great way to gain hands on practical experience of GIS applications but even though its a practical course, it is taught theory style. the course should be a 1 hr lecture and 2 hour lab course.",
    "I think the coarse could be improved if we spent more time on model builder from the onset of the course.",
    "Strengths: 1. PSETs and tutorials are well-designed 2. Professor is intentional with his teaching, as in, the way he structures his courses\/deadlines, etc. 3. Professor is very kind, responsive, and answers questions well. Weaknesses: 1. Class was often let out early--which may be seen as good, but I wish he'd go over more things. We might be tested on the same amount a before, but it'd be cool to be introduced to something.",
    "basics of automation such as for looping, conditionals, should actually be well taught instead of glossed over",
    "Fantastically taught - Professor Tomlin literally designed GIS and is incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, and one of the clearest communicators that I have ever met! Workload is reasonable, and the structure was based around three major reports that allowed for a good deal of specialization on an application that you cared about, which is great for upper level students trying to work in a certain area. I have very few criticisms, and they are minor: 1. offer more guidance on sources of reliable and downloadable data - that was far and above the biggest time sink 2. perhaps shift the structure of the problem sets to require a deeper dive into model building before the final project - it would have been nice to have an extra week of troubleshooting and in-person contact with the professor before reading week when the model building report was underway.",
    "Everything is perfect.",
    "The lectures are prefect as is. It would be nice to follow the lectures immediately with a workshop session led by the TF to begin work on the homework.",
    "More lab-based office hours.",
    "Weakness - a lecture for a computer program class made students feel disconnected. In theory one can understand how to do something but still lack specifics to achieve the objective. The lecture could be A LOT shorter and to have a lab for this class. The instructor weighted esthetics highly, and that scale was really hard to gauge because it was based on was he saw as good.",
    "The weekly homework projects could be very challenging and time consuming. I found the online posting of completed homework assignments and rankings to be very stressful and not conducive to my learning. I would have appreciated more personalized feedback on my term project.",
    "As it is currently set up, the lectures are not a valuable use of class time. It would be more effective for Dr. Tomlin to record the content he wishes to convey in each lecture in a webinar, have students watch it beforehand, and then use class time as a workshop, where students can actively practice using the skills and get feedback in real time. Piazza and remote emails with the professor are insufficient and inadequate as the sole supports for student learning-- they are not effectively replacing in person office hours or lab time. There is also too little time spent in this course-- especially in the beginning-- in data management, or how to set up one's data, data sources, etc. to most effectively and efficiently work in ArcGIS.",
    "The course is clearly effective; that can't quite be denied. I learned a lot about GIS and made many friends along the way because we spent the majority of our terms in the lab. Unfortunately, I think the structure is quite flawed and not conducive to a healthy or productive learning environment. Prof. Tomlin rates homework assignments against one another, thereby showing how one student did vis-a-vis others. These competitive learning environments are not effective. There is research on this. It is old-school and anxiety inducing. It creates a toxic work environment and I found it very annoying, honestly. I was also frustrated that we didn't get grades for these homeworks. I spent countless hours on these assignments before Prof. Tomlin clarified in about Week 11 that they were meaningless. I can't tell you how defeating that was. Third, I do not think it's useful to have a GIS class in a lecture style. I found it unhelpful to come to lecture where Prof. Tomlin spoke for several hours. He went over the material; however, it was hard to follow and couldn't be done on a laptop. Once I actually started working on the homework assignments, I noticed that I couldn't remembered any of the skills taught in the class. GIS is all about muscle memory - it seems - and this didn't help for that. I've never heard of a GIS course not taught in a lab. The result is that I spent a hugely disproportionate amount of my term working on homework for this class - about 50%. Last, the class seems to be advertised as a introductory GIS course; however, it also appears to be graded on a curve. The problem is that many GIS students come in with advanced levels of GIS experience and therefore have a clear advantage in grading. I think FES needs some sort of intermediate level.",
    "Lectures and homeworks are well designed, but it may help to have the lectures filmed and used in a flipped format where students watch online and most of time in class is spent in a computer lab working through projects with Professor Tomlin and two TAs (rather than just one) helping students. However, the current format of the class also has its benefits for students to work independent hours.",
    "The most successful aspect of the course was the nature of the homework assignments, and their openness for interpretative when it came to finding solutions to answer homework questions. The weakness of the course was in the ambiguity surrounding the grading criteria. I would spend hours on certain homework assignments, thinking that I solved them and described my work in a creative way, but I would receive low grades. Receiving a high grade was not my priority as much as learning new GIS tools, however I felt the ambiguity made me concerned that I was not learning from the goals of the weekly assignment as I thought I had. I would prefer to see more detailed criteria for grading, or more commentary after grading, to learn what I can do better, and specifically if the aspects that need improvement have to do with my ability to use cartographic tools or more in my ability to communicate and present my work, as the former was more important to me for this course."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn GIS, you have to take this class",
    "Very useful class",
    "Work with the TF every chance you get; they are much clearer on how to work through the assignments than the handouts typically are. Also, there are diminishing returns as you work on GIS! Don't spend your entire life in the lab - understand the assignment first and then outline a time schedule in order to prevent yourself from feeling as though you will never finish.",
    "Spare lots of time!",
    "Only take this course if you are able to commit the time, if you are not sure, then audit this course instead and take subsequent courses with Dana once you understand the commitment level.",
    "If you are taking the course, be prepared to spend many hours on projects and PSETs (at least I know I did). Also be prepared to have errors be very specific (e.g. you need a specific file to do something; or an output seems to be something but doesn't work for a tool that should be used for it...). Piazza is helpful though! Don't be afraid to ask questions!",
    "Fantastic class to learn a skill, and by far one of the best taught coding classes that I have taken. Be prepared to devote a lot of time to the final project reports (3 total) and choose a topic that you care about, because there is a lot of potential to create real, useable content.",
    "if you're interested in learning GIS, this is great. just be prepared for the final reports to take lots of time!",
    "The class involves a lot of self-teaching, because there is no built-in computer lab time in this course. This can lead so some very frustrating\/drawn out\/unproductive experiences when trying to work on the homework and projects independently. While I think this experience can ultimately be helpful, as it forces you as a student to sit down and work through problems you encounter, it can also be very discouraging. If you don't have much past experience with ArcGIS, expect to spend a lot of time on the assignments.",
    "Very helpful.",
    "Plan ahead for your homework so you have time to ask questions and received replies well in advance of when it is due. Ideally, start your homework right after the lecture.",
    "Make sure you have enough time in your schedule to dedicate 4-12 hours per week on projects and homework.",
    "Don't. Unless you have recent experience with GIS and graphic design you will end up hating this amazing software. If you want to learn GIS, show up to the class, download the program, and meet the TA or the GIS librarian. This felt like an arts class. I wish instead the course helped us find new ways to incorporate modeling into our focus\/research.",
    "If you don't have a computer that can run ArcGIS, you will probably be spending a lot of time in a computer lab. Manage your time wisely.",
    "If you have never taken GIS before, this class may not be the best use of your time. This class is better suited to those who have some GIS experience and are seeking to hone their skills and learn more of the theory behind it.",
    "This is a heavy loaded curse. I spent up to 20 hours per week doing homework. If you are planning to take this course please think about how well you will be dealing with the workload.",
    "Take care of your mental health. I saw a number of students crying in the lab. Do not spend much time on the homework assignments because they are meaningless. Just learn the skill and move on to your project which matters for the grade. Also, keep in mind that Prof. Tomlin does not live in New Haven. He does most of his instructing online via email. If you want hands-on instruction, you will not get it in this course. The class would be just as effective as a purely online class because you get very little interaction with the instructor in-person.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work if you want to gain the skills.",
    "Be ready for the time commitment that this class requires! Don't agonize over the weekly homework assignments, and use that time to better your project. Know when to set limits, because you can always keep adding and adjusting things."
