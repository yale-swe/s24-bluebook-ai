   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class if you are considering graduate school in economics. Beware! this is not an easy course, it will take you more time than any other subject. In the end is very rewarding and you do feel like you've learnt a lot. The midterms are very difficult but thefinal not that much. The professor is very fair tough.",
    "Overall, the class was good. The material covered in lecture was the same as the material in the textbook, so going to class was not necessary. However, Professor Bewley does a good job of condensing the textbook material, so I found the class notes quite helpful.We had weekly psets, which could be tricky at times, but section and office hours were very helpful. We also had two midterms and a final. Professor Bewley took the highest of the two midterm grades and if the grade from the final is even better, he replaced the midterm grade with the final grade. Basically, the determination of grades worked in favor of students.",
    "Only really recommended to Econ math majors, because it's a requirement. Professor Bewley is nice but his course structure could be improved. The lectures are 90% theory but the tests are all number-based. Students would have an easier time learning the material if more examples and explanations were provided, as the textbook is extremely theoretical as well.",
    "General Equilibrium Theory serves as the core of microeconomic theory. This course explores the foundations, concepts, and applications of general equilibrium in an inspiring way. It begins with an exposition of what efficiency means in different types of economies and continues to develop key concepts in Walrasian economics, all while emphasizing mathematical tools and examples to provide a rigorous foundation for special topics including welfare theorems, insurance, social security, growth theory, and competitive equilibrium. The beginning of the course sets a solid foundation in analytic methods which are essential for understanding the nuances of proofs and concepts before segueing into the intricacies of general equilibrium covered on weekly homework assignments. I would recommend this class to undergraduate economics majors who want to learn mathematical economic theory and be able to understand the foundations of the material covered in far less depth in intermediate microeconomics (and macroeconomics). Take note that this is a course in mathematical economics and topics from real analysis are often used in proofs, although it is not essential to understand mathematics at this level, it is important that students who consider taking this class have a foundation in the methods of calculus and basic linear algebra. I understand thatthere are many other economics department courses which students consider better uses of their time; however, I would definitely recommend students consider making this course a core part of the undergraduate economics program, even those students who are not economics and mathematics majors.",
    "Not a great class... You don't have to go to class as the professor is extremely disengaging and pretty much just reads the book. But the underlying material is pretty beautiful and the teacher knows his stuff and is really helpful if you go to office hours. Pretty much only take it if you have to (econ\/math)",
    "Somewhat difficult. Very boring. But essential to an understanding of economics, so I'll take it.",
    "Take it if you are econ math and you have to. Otherwise, it's not terribly necessary.",
    "I would not recommend taking if you're not an Econ\/Math major. Although the subject is interesting, I think it was a bit of a mistake.",
    "It's an essential course, I think every econ major should take it. It's not as hard as it seems, really.",
    "Yes, but only if you recognize that this will involve a lot of math and less economic intuitions.",
    "So, you need to learn the material yourself unless you are the kind of person who preview each and every lesson before class and come to class prepared, OR you are simply a mathematician. General Equilibrium theory taught in this course is merely mathematical manipulation and nothing else, almost no economics intuition here.If this is your econ-math requirement, then be prepared. if not, reading Bewley's book achieves the same end except you don't get the credit.",
    "Econ 350 is difficult, time-consuming, and at best frustrating. But it was the first economics class at Yale where I feel I learned about economics. It's fulfilling at the end of the semester to look back at what you've learned, regardless of the grade."
