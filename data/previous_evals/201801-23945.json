    "Readings were great and very useful to my future work. I plan to save the syllabus for eternity. I hated the scheduling of the lab on Friday afternoons. Forestry students generally don't have classes on Fridays, so I think that Friday labs might discourage their enrollment, if that matters. The taking of attendance felt not great. I'm more pro people doing what they need to learn, not being forced to come to class if it's not useful.",
    "good",
    "Great to know about methodologies of exposure assessment But can be more specific for more fields instead of some common strategies",
    "I might like more in depth assignments that includes much more time and focus on the specifics of exposure measurements and techniques. This would include the types of instruments to use in different situations, how to use them, and the appropriateness of each. I know we covered this briefly in class, but I think it might be useful to go a little more in depth. I would also like to see more hands on work in general. Move it from a full lecture to more opportunities for student engagement.",
    "Course provided a good overview of exposure assessment as it relates to occupational and environmental epidemiology.",
    "This course provides a good overview of exposure assessment methods.",
    "I thought this course did a great job of covering the breadth of the field of exposure science while still covering important subjects in sufficient depth. I am not sure that the Friday discussion section contributed significantly to the course, as it often felt rushed and too short.",
    "Very practical, up to date, evidence-based.",
    "This was a good course.",
    "The lectures were very holistic, but often dry. I don't think that this can really be improved in any way though, due to the nature of the course.",
    "Good overview of important topics in exposure science. Including the industrial hygienist and hands-on labs was a major strength of this course.",
    "Great",
    "Excellent course. Could be improved by having more applied exposure assessment opportunities. For example, an exposure assessment case study over the course of the semester, where we assess a situation in multiple ways could be a good way to integrate skills."

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Excellent. Approachable and willing to teach.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole is excellent.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel was wonderful and very articulate. I do wish that we could have received more in-depth feedback on the assignments, though.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very knowledgeable on these topics and offered good feedback during office hours. Overall a good teacher but at times seemed unsure of herself.",

    "I would recommend this course for students interested in an introduction to exposure assessment methodology.",
    "This course is a great introduction into the field of exposure science and the methods you might apply to exposure science research. I would recommend this course to those who are new to the field as well as those who have some experience with exposure science, as Dr. Deziel's expertise means that even experienced students will learn something new.",
    "Excellent. Highly recommend.",
