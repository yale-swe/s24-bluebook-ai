    "Good course. two midterms and one final, equally weighted. Also undergrads have different grading scheme that is said to be on the generous side. Prof Jorgensen is great I had him for Intro to Orgo and this class, and he's been great in both classes. Material is pretty challenging, but only a limited amount of Orgo knowledge is necessary. Mostly extension of physical chem concepts in orgo setting.",
    "This is a chemistry course with very little work outside of the exams, but you will study very hard for the exams. Physical organic (what this class is) seems to be a field that observes phenomena, and then tries to explain them, with very little predictive power. Be prepared to take down pages and pages of tables from which you must extract trends and make deductions. Jorgensen is very softspoken and can be very hard to hear. All those things considered, it's a pretty straightforward class, with little weekly work required. I am glad I took it to fulfill the advanced lecture class requirement in the chemistry degree.",
    "VERY different from any other chem course you've probably taken up until this point. The class goes as follows: introduce a topic, suggest a trend, then explore all the exceptions and anamolies. Within the analysis of anomalous observations, the following are used to explain EVERYTHING: Electronic effects and sterics.-- Stick with those two and you can't go wrong",
    "This class wasn't exactly fun, but the information was important. I don't know if i agree with the style of the class."
