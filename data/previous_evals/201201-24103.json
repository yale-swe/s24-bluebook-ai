   "comments": [
    "Perhaps the best class you will take at Yale. A weekly profile in ethical leadership gone right and gone wrong. The return on investment in this course is incredibly high - you can get away without doing the readings, etc. but you'll regret it. Highly flexible in terms of options for midterm and final papers - simply write about something you care about it and give it your absolute, very best. Fantastic opportunity to be in the room with leaders from business, finance, and law and hear how the tough calls get made.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone. It is a complete waste of time and credit. There is no real work, and Ellis basically assigns a different 300 page book each week that no one reads. There is also no real syllabus, as Ellis simply outsources the job of teaching to a different weekly \"guest.\"",
    "\"Adventures in Business Ethics\" is an excellent course. Charley Ellis is the main star: rarely have I met a professor so passionate about teaching and so caring toward students. Every class is an \"adventure,\" in which we try to figure out what the right thing to do is. The readings are pertinent, the class dynamics is vigorous, and the subject matter is fascinating. This class was definitely one of the highlights of my Yale experience.",
    "This course is very unique; the combination of Professor Ellis's knowledge along with the amazing speakers makes this course a gem. The largest strength of this course was Professor Ellis's dedication to the course and his students. The papers are not easy and sometimes class discussions were dominated by the same students, but overall I would certainly recommend the course!",
    "Quite possibly the best and most unique course at Yale. Absolutely take it if you can. Charley is an amazing person and an amazing professor.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Take it if you can get in. One of those courses where you will carry the lessons on with you even after the semester ends, and where the professor is actually engaged with you as an individual throughout the semester. I know Business Ethics as a topic may sound a bit cheesy, but it's astounding how much you learn from sheer exposure to the professor and his guests. A real gem.",
    "This was an excellent course all around. The syllabus was engaging and manageable, and both papers were enjoyable to write. Charley Ellis has high standards, but he makes it clear as well that he is interested in helping students meet them."
