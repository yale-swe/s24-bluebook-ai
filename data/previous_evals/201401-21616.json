    "Strange, excellent seminar.",
    "Yes. You'll get out of this class what you put in, but either way you will be exposed to the study of climate from a completely different perspective than most \"climate change\" courses will bring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student! Take it! It's very interesting, very little work, you learn a lot, and you have no final or final paper.",
    "G&G 402 is a peculiar class at Yale. No tests, no homework, but two hour-long presentations that in the end are meant to comprise your grade. Whether or not this is actually true, the class is certainly for those who are self-motivated to pursue an interest in paleoclimatology. There are two types of people who take this class: those that are incredibly interested in the subject material, and those that try to take an easy, low-stress class. But from talking to my classmates, I am pretty confident that the people trying to find an easy, low-stress class are instead putting themselves into an entirely foreign environment full of weird terminology and scientists\/science majors... that being said, whether or not you have an interest in science, if you're up for the challenge, then I strongly recommend this class.",
    "I would summarize this as a crash course in reading and critiquing scientific studies within the context of Earth's climatic history. If you engage with the material and do the reading and work (which is more reasonable than any other course I've taken at Yale, seriously, just do it) you will gain not only a great familiarity with the subject matter but critical thinking skills valuable for anyone in any scientific field. That being said, if you don't do well without structure or hate presenting or talking in class, or being asked to participate or called on by the teacher, you will not enjoy this course. Pagani is a fun teacher though, and if you're willing to participate, this is a great class, and a valuable one."
