    "It's the only undergrad number theory course, so if you're interested in that, it's about your only choice. With Kontorovich, it was quite a good class.",
    "A 'boutique' course that really shouldn't be; the material is pretty essential; we ended up getting through the first 10 chapters of Ireland and Rosen, the essential 'intro' algebraic number theory text. Professor Kontorovich is pretty great. He is very concerned with students' comprehension, which was particularly effective in a class of this small size. His enthusiasm for math and the material is immediate and infectious.",
    "I give this my highest possible recommend. Alex Kontorovich is incredible. The best math professor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had. And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellent by Yale teaching standards in general, not just department of math teaching standards.The workload was regular but balanced, with a weekly problem set, two quizzes, a midterm, and a final. The quizzes were very short and low-stress, but they were high impact in terms of providing an incentive to remain caught up. The final was time-consuming (a take-home final with 10 problems) but rewarding; it gave me a way to solidify my knowledge that an in-class final couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The text is clearly written and only rarely uses an \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is obvious that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d that baffles. The material\u00e2\u0080\u0094Euclidean domains, unique factorization, congruences in modular arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, primitive roots, quadratic residues, quadratic reciprocity, Gauss& Jacobi sums, and cubic reciprocity\u00e2\u0080\u0094was really fun and approachable to a student of math without the need for any particular background knowledge beyond familiarity with proof methods. I would say that the pre-requisite course would be helpful but is not necessary; one or two previous proof-based courses are essential, though. I would very highly recommend this course. If you are considering Prof. Kontorovich for another course, I would also very highly recommend him as a professor. He was approachable, led the class with charm, and asked for feedback, which he acted on. He frequently stopped to see if we were following, and gauged our reactions more effectively than any other professor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had; he would actually adjust course by adding an example if we were lost or skipping an elementary proof if we were bored. His proofs were clean and very near flawless. For your sake, please take a course with him.",
    "Do you want to take one of Professor Kontorovich's highly recommended courses? Do you want to leave yourself irrevocably biased toward algebra (and against analysis)? Do you want to take a class with a big black dog? Do you want the dog to WINK at you? Then join Professor Kontorovich in MATH 354 as he delivers yet another blockbuster in his growing repertoire of classes here at Yale University by proving the Riemann hypothesis! Multiple times! In various forms! But never in the one that you want...anyways, you get to learn about cubic reciprocity, Gauss and Jacobi sums, the action of the Frobenius character on L-adic complex projective manifolds (okay that was a guest lecture that nobody really understood...great lecture though), and the number of solutions to the equation x^2 + y^2 = n...or maybe it was n^2...or n^4...or whatever it was that Goncharov said. The course starts moving decently quickly toward the end, but luckily \"algebraic geometry\" means \"nap time\". Homework isn't so bad, around 5 hours a week...good thing too, or else even Professor Kontorovich's own analysis classes couldn't cure you of the algebra bug that you will undoubtedly pick up through taking this class.",
    "When Prof. Kontorovich taught MATH 310: Intro to Complex Analysisin the Fall of 2011, one of the student evaluators wrote a series of Chuck Norris jokes describing the transcendental qualities of Prof. Kontorovich and his lecturing ability (go, read them! for real!). I am proud today to offer my personal endorsement and verification of these comparisons, and to add a few more to the collection (read on if you want to see them!). Prof. Kontorovich is truly in a league of his own -- a first-rate lecturer, a brilliant public speaker with impeccable comedic timing and stage presence, a supremely patient teacher determined to help all of his students follow the material, and a genuinely great guy. This class is simply awesome -- you'll cover the first nine chapters or so of Ireland and Rosen's textbook. A running theme in the course is proving Riemann Hypotheses in contexts that aren't quite worth a million bucks, but are well worth the tuition money you spend on this credit. You'll laugh, you'll cry (tears of joy once you learn any of the many proofs of quadratic reciprocity), you'll lose 15 pounds (of ignorance once you learn how to prove theorems that even stumped Gauss). Even if you're not a math major (and I'm certainly not one), you should take this class -- it's great for developing general background in number theory, and could even be useful for cocktail party conversation starters (seriously, try it!). Any class you take with Prof. Kontorovich will be among your magnum opa at Yale. But, don't take this evaluation's word at face value! -- if you have any questions, ask the author! Get in touch with me at jerry.wang@aya.yale.edu, and I'd be happy to tell you why this class is great. In case there is an automatic filter to prevent e-mail addresses from getting through, I'll type it here again: jerry [dot]wang [at]aya [dot]yale [dot]edu. At this point, to save space, I refer the reader to my evaluation of MATH 109: History of Mathematics (also taught in Spring '13) to see the other conditions under which I would greatly enjoy an e-mail from you. And now to reward the patient reader, and to conclude my final evaluation at Yale, an addendum to the Chuck Norris jokes of old (which were originally written by either Tong Zhan or Henry Wilkin... or maybe Benno... no, probably Mike Jin... actually, it might've been Darren... wait, did Phil end up dropping the class?... actually who am I fooling it was me). Prof. Kontorovich can kick Z[\\sqrt{-5}]so hard that it becomes a unique factorization domain. Ascending chains of ideals in Noetherian rings halt not because of the standard proof, but because they're afraid of getting too close to the ideal within which Prof. Kontorovich lives. There were odd perfect numbers until Prof. Kontorovich made them all imperfect by casework. Eisenstein was actually Prof. Kontorovich, but he used a pen-name 'cause he was sick of all the fan mail. There have been an infinite number of twin primes ever since Prof. Kontorovich told them to buddy up. Prof. Kontorovich can construct ANY regular polygon using only a straightedge. Prof. Kontorovich knows a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis by quadratic reciprocity -- too bad he thinks it's a boring technique. Every character is the trivial character in the hands of Prof. Kontorovich. Prof. Kontorovich actually understands the content of Prof. Sam Payne's guest lecture (for those of you who weren't there, which I imagine is all of you reading this evaluation, this is the highest praise of all -- Prof. Payne's lecture was very well done, but hilariously impossibly advanced). E-mail me if you want more one-liners, we (that's right, \"we\"!) think of more all the time! Hope to talk soon! Jerry"
