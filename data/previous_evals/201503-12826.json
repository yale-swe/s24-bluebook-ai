    "Urban Life and Landscape was a tremendous class, with a few definite caveats. On the one hand, it really introduced a number of areas, particularly urban sociology, that are of help and interest to anyone who lives in a city--i.e. every Yalie. The discussions were well-run and thoughtful, the readings insightful, and Rubin himself is an energetic, knowledgeable, caring guy who really loves what he does. Plus, the three field trips we took might have been the best individual class periods of my time at Yale! On the other hand, Rubin can be disorganized to a frustrating degree (hard when you need help on an assignment) and the class is a lot of work. I actually don't think Rubin intends\/wants it to be so much work, and each of the three assignments before the final paper are fun, you learn something new, and you get to see\/explore the city. Still, though, they are each substantial, and the work adds up. Nonetheless, a very solid class definitely worth taking.",
    "GREAT COURSE. TAKE IT!!! SO INTERESTING! ABOUT CITY LIFE! DON'T WORRY THAT ITS ARCH LISTED, COOL FOR ARCHES BUT ALSO COOL FOR ALL OTHER MAJORS. TAKE IT! ELIHU RUBIN IS THE MAN. really, so good. take it!",
    "Interesting course and would recommend if you get credit toward your major because it is not super time-consuming and the field trips are fun. Didn't love the seminar discussions or readings \/ reading responses, but that might be a personal preference.",
    "Fun course that will allow you to engage with architecture and policy in the urban environment.",
    "A sociological approach to American cities, particularly New Haven. Very freeform and self-guided, with interesting assignments. Worth taking, but also dependent on the people in the class.",
    "I expected much more out of this course. I was hoping that the course would have a better arch that taught students to look at the city differently but this did not turn out to be the case. I felt that the course was poorly organized. It was never clear what was expected of us for each assignment. The discussions were interesting at times but I don't feel like I gained much from this class.",
    "interesting course take if interestedbin urban studies. Prof Rubin is great.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you can!",
    "Urban Life and Landscape is a really interesting, very un-stuffy-Yale way to look at a city and a city's geography. I had not intended to focus on urban studies, and am now looking to weave that exploration into my History major after this class. Discussions are lively, the readings are interesting, and the field trips really opened up my view of the city. I found this class to be a \"get out what you put in\" type of space you CAN do well without having done the readings, but it will be a much more rewarding experience if you actually DO do the readings. Elihu allows his students a lot of welcome freedom to do what they want to do, and projects ended up being interesting and widely varied. A great class it asks you to think about public spaces and public places in a really nuanced way."
