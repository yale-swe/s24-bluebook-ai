   "comments": [
    "Strength: The course provides useful quantitative skills.Weakness: The course is too conceptual. I hope to learn more application topics and SAS skills.",
    "Probably it can focus more on the theoretical part.",
    "This course is helpful in real data analysis, it also help you learn SAS.",
    "The course didn't seem to have a well-defined audience. Sometimes the material seemed to be more geared to students without much background in statistics, but at other times, the material seemed to be geared toward students with a stronger background. This made the course a little difficult to follow at times, and it became hard to understand the expectations of the instructor.",
    "Poorly made slides, unclear delivery of knowledge.LAB sessions were even more helpful than the lectures.If it's not required course, I'd have dropped it.",
    "Although the material was interesting, the lectures didn't go into much theoretical detail.The HW's mostly involved coding in SAS. It was helpful to learn some SAS but the HW's didn't reinforce the material learned in class as well.",
    "Way too much material way too fast. Narrow the scope.",
    "good",
    "Lectures are well explained. labs needs to be better structured, and lab materials needs to be improved so that it is more focused on interpretation of results not just analytics.",
    "Too theoratical. Please be more practical in lecture.",
    "can't understand the course.lecture note given by the instructor sucks.not intuitive at all.",
    "weakness: graded students in two groups(biostat&nonbiostat) did not make sense, not very fair",
    "it would be better if the course can be more systematic, and well-explained.",
    "Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really poor for understanding. Lab by TA could help to understand the course.",
    "worst course I have ever takeninstructor unprepared to teach; slides with mistakes; materials taught not fully reinforced in homework; concepts unclear; extremely disorganized and unfair for students in biostatistics (biostat students had one extra question on the exam!!)NO SOLUTIONS for any of the homework or exam questions! This was the worst part of the class.",
    "Strength: it is helpful to know about longitudinal and multi-level data analysisWeakness: sometimes it is hard to follow the instructor, and the exam doesn't relate to the materials a lot",
    "This is important material for public health students. Learning data analysis techniques for longitudinal and multilevel data will be very useful.Pros:Important subjectCons:Material is not well organized or taught.The slides are repetitive, have typos, and are often have text extending off the edge of the page (which can't be read)."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Haiqun is very responsible, but I fell it is not so fair for biostats students, as biostats students are required to do more problems in the same time in the midterm exam, and are graded separately with non-biostats students. I understand that biostats students are expected to grasp some in-depth topics, but most of us are unable to finish all questions in the given time in the midterm exam.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0I think the quality of lecture notes need improvement. The notations are messy. Reading lecture notes after class can only make you more confused.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The lectures are not detailed enough in theory.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She spoke too fast but was enthusiastic.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The lecturer explains difficult statistical concepts very well in a good pace. Perhaps a little more materials on multilevel analysis would be better.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0focus more on teachingmake the lecture notes neat",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0helpful after class, but give too much hw in the final week",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very nice person, but still need to improve teaching skills a little bit.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She may be very good as a researcher but not good at teaching. Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really poor for understanding.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0This instructor cannot teach and should not teach anymore if YSPH wants its program to maintain its prestigious title as one of best public health schools.This instructor skips over important concepts and dwells on things that have no relevance to homework or practical use. Slide materials are from years ago, and contain mistakes, and no detailed derivations. No proof of how an equation or concept came to be, and no explanation of usage. Absolutely ridiculous homework that have little relevance to class and are so time consuming.When she teaches, she always separates the biostat students, which seems quite prejudice sometimes. She always says \"you know\" ... as if asking us do you understand, but when we say we don't, she replies \"you should\" or \"do the derivation at home\". Even worse, if she does explain, its unclear and conceptually irrelevant. This is either because she knows the material so well and so advanced that she is incapable of explaining or she is not capable of teaching this material due to lack of knowledge.She is never available for help and ALWAYS unresponsive to emails.Yale should be ashamed to have such an irresponsible professor to teach students who pay thousands of dollars to be here.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0she can be confusing sometimes, it is hard to follow her during the lecture. The lecture note can be messy sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin certainly seemed to care about her students.Her examples were often not clear to me (not a biostats student). She seemed to expect a higher level of knowledge than was usually present in the class.The class seemed poorly organized:There was not a scheduled date for the midterm on the syllabus, and we were given the midterm with just 1 week's notice.There was only 1 day to do HW2 after that week's lab.This is maybe a complaint about my fellow students rather than Dr. Lin, but there was often a lot of talking going on between students which made it hard to focus on what was being taught. Dr. Lin never asked the students to be quiet or leave."

Her lab sessions were extremely helpful in learning not only the SAS code, but also helping to learn the material covered in the course lecture. She proved immensely helpful with homework questions, as well as clarification questions regarding some of the more difficult material.",

    "Instructor: Yizhen Xu \u00a0not very reachable after class",
    "Instructor: Yizhen Xu \u00a0If Yizhen wasn't the TA, this course would have turned out way worse. Many thanks to this TA for compiling the lab notes and SAS code that got us through basic concepts and homework. Many thanks!Perhaps it was because the professor did not provide solutions to the homework, but places I knew I was wrong or I asked for further explanation were not marked wrong by the grader, Wang Lu, which was annoying.",
    "Instructor: Yizhen Xu \u00a0In lab sessions, she explains things clearly.",
    "Instructor: Yizhen Xu \u00a0Yizhen did a pretty good job as TA. She would work with sutdents and try to answer our questions, of which there were many. She stayed after lab at least twice to try to answer questions for homeworks which were due the next day."

I would only recommend it to people who feel that they have a solid foundation in statistics, otherwise it will be overwhelming."
