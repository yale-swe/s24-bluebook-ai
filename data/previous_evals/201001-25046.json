    "While it is not required to do a senior project for the Music Major, I would highly recommend all music majors, not just those in composition or theory, to do some sort of senior project. It is unfortunate that the option to do a recital and have that count towards the intensive major is not available. However, I believe that spending your year focusing on one specific aspect of music history, theory or composition or broadening your horizons by learning about music that you never knew is infinitely beneficial and contributes to the growth of any musician.",
    "Do it if you're a composer! It involves writing a large-scale work, or body of work, which you would presumably do anyway so why not get credit for it!",
    "MUSI 491 is a fantastic opportunity to write a large, sustained work (or two). It's largely self-guided, which, depending on your personality, can be both a good and a bad thing. Overall, I thought it was a great experience!"
