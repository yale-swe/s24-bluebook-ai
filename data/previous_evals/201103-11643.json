   "comments": [
    "Great introductory German course starting from scratch\/some basics. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take German! The department is wonderful and the workload is reasonable--there's no final and there aren't tests every week, unlike many other beginning language courses. This doesn't mean it's a gut, though; German grammar can get knotty and ridiculous fast. But it's taught effectively, and it's been a great introduction to the language. It's also just a great class in general, and I was actually happy to wake up for it each morning (take it with Marc if you can, because his sense of humor fosters a nice community). I am looking forward to next semester, and semesters beyond. P.S. Start this course in the fall so that you can take advantage of the GMAN 130\/140 summer program in New Haven and Berlin--after one calendar year, you'll be in L5 German.",
    "It's a good language course and I would recommend it to other students although the grammar is very complicated.",
    "Would recommend it if you are willing to be consistent with the work, it requires a reasonable amount of work on a consistent basis.",
    "All L1 language classes get good reviews except Arabic, let's be honest. If you're interested in German, it's as much fun as you'd expect an L1 language class to be. If you're not, don't take it.",
    "If you like learning new languages, then definitely take German! The instructors are great, and - knowing English - it is not as hard as say, Arabic. Especially good if you are looking for a second foreign language, or would like to take two at the same time."
