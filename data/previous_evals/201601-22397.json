    "This course provided a reinforcement of techniques used in bioinformatics of which I was mostly aware. It allowed me to conceptualize the coding structure of many of the tools. It also gave me greater breadth knowledge of the field and a better context to the fields that surround my research.",
    "This course gave me a broad introduction to bioinformatics which then allows me to pin point which areas of interest I want to further explore."
