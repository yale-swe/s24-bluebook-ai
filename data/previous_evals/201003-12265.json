    "Again, you listen to various people play the same piece of beethoven and then compare. It is very interesting. I learned a lot about why classical music is more than elevator music. I have a much greater appreciation for it and can enjoy listening to it now. If you know classical music is not your thing and you have a closed mind, dont take this, you'll just hurt the wonderful professors feelings.",
    "This course focuses on the interpretation of Beethoven's music. It is divided into units by \"genre\" (piano sonatas, symphonies, concerti, duos and trios, and string quartets), in each of which several pieces are studied. For each piece, students study 3-5 recordings, which are then discussed in class. At the end of each unit, there is either a quiz (identifying snippets of recording by piece and performer) or a short essay. The course concludes with an 8-10 page paper on a Beethoven piece chosen by each student.If you are an experienced musician, you will probably be bored by some moments in class-- going through an explanation of what a repeat is, what a sforzando is, etc.--but there is certainly something in this course for everyone. You will become more familiar with the astonishing range of Beethoven's repertoire, and learn about some issues of interpretation unique to performances of his works.Prof. Friedmann is hilarious-- the course is worth taking simply for him. Also, who can argue with listening to music for homework?",
    "Great class - interesting and not too demanding. As long as you can read music and play an instrument it shouldn't be too tough. Would definitely recommend taking this class if you're interested in Beethoven (or even music in general). Professor Friedmann is a great teacher.",
    "Great course if you love listening to music."
