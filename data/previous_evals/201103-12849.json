   "comments": [
    "Starts off very easy but gets really hard really fast. Be prepared to study a lot towards the middle of the term.",
    "Chinese 132 is an intense class with a lot of work and memorization involved and a lot of daily homework. There are daily quizzes to make sure that you learn the 15 or so characters every day. It was hard to adjust to at the beginning but if you figure out a good schedule for learning the characters, you'll be fine. But if you really want to work to improve your Mandarin, this class is perfect. You don't get a lot of practice for speaking Mandarin but definitely a lot of writing and grammar, although private tutoring sessions are integrated well into the course. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Chinese and has a solid background in it already (heritage speakers).",
    "Unless you got placed in L5, there's not much choice. The class is good, but the material at times was very outdated and unusable in everyday conversation.",
    "It's a lot of work if you're not fluent but as long as you put in the time it'll reflect in your grade. It was pretty rewarding.",
    "Take it to get a better understanding of Chinese language and culture. Don't do it if you think you wouldn't be able to handle the work load. The class meets every day, have vocab quizzes everyday. And the homework load for this class is by far the heaviest.",
    "I would take it if you want to improve your chinese a lot, but definitely not just to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "recommend because most likely you have to take this course anyway because you are a slightly white-washed asian american like me.",
    "This is a fairly good language course and a very good way for heritage speakers to improve their Chinese, since the focus is on reading, writing, and grammar.",
    "As a student who went to Chinese school and speaks Chinese at home, this was the perfect class for me. Be prepared to take a lot of time to just memorize the sentence patterns and structure. The course starts off easy, but quickly becomes harder, so get ready! Must be very careful with little things while writing Chinese, or else points will get taken off.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 132 for any heritage speaker who is willing to put in time and dedication to improve his or her Chinese. I'm not sure whether the rather rigid and intense style of this course (and really, the Chinese language in general) works for everybody, but it did wonders for me.",
    "The class focuses on improving formal writing and reading skills. Xu Laoshi is very helpful and the workload is manageable, but expect to put in time to study for homework exercises and daily quizzes.",
    "A fast paced course of intermediate Chinese. The beginning is easy, but it gradually moves away from conversational Chinese and starts focusing on textbook, more formal Chinese, which is much harder. The class is always moving so it is fairly engaging, and the teacher isvery enthusiastic which helps. You definitely have to put time in, but it's not excessive and I found I learned a ton in just one semester."
