    "Yes. I love this language because this course helped me to feel as though I really had a grasp on both big concepts and small details. A great refresher of L1 and L2 that propels you into the conversational and writing-based courses of L4 and above.",
    "I would recommend this class because Italian is a great department to fulfill your language requirement. This class did not involve much work but you feel like you get a better grasp of the italian language. Kaiser was an amazing professor and made the hour go by quickly. Plus he baked us cookies.",
    "i would highly reccommend italian 130 04 to another student.",
    "A great review of the entirety of basic Italian grammar, vocab, speech, etc. By the end of the term I really began to feel like I could express myself in Italian. The workload is totally manageable, but you spend enough time each week working\/thinking in Italian that you can make progress. Chris Kaiser is a great instructor and fun guy.",
    "Yes. Italian is a beautiful language, and I have only had good experiences with the department",
    "Relatively easy and you learn Italian. You watch a few movies and read a few stories and poems which was my favorite part.",
    "It is an overview of the grammar of Italian with some culture placed in. I would recommend this class to people who are interested in continuing Italian!",
    "ITAL 130 covers the same material as ITAL 110 but at an accelerated rate. The class focused on solidifying our Italian skills by exposing us to different facets of Italian culture in the forms of literature, opera, cinema, art and poetry. I highly recommend this class to any student thinking of taking Italian. It was always pretty relaxed; a good 5th class. It didn't even feel like a 1.5 credit course."
