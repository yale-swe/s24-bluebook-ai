    "I would recommend it only to someone interested in philosophy",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has had no previous experience with philosophy and does not plan on making the subject a central focus of the semester; otherwise, I would recommend trying out a more advanced course.What this class aims to do, it does well. It gives students who are new to philosophy a taste of Plato and Aristotle's main arguments, and gives them a basic vocabulary for discussing and evaluating the structure of philosophical arguments. Lectures are clear and well-delivered, and expectations for assignments are made fairly clear--for instance, writing a philosophy paper is new to many in the class, but Professor Harte was kind enough to prepare a thorough guide detailing how would should go about doing this. In general, Professor Harte is excellent. She knows her stuff, she's personable, and she's engaging.The main difficulty with this course, I would say, lies in how little it asks of students. The readings are very brief and there are few assignments, so inevitably one puts little time into the class--there just isn't all that much to be done for it, aside from to go out of one's way to read additional Plato, and other classes will certainly compete for your attention more aggressively. This means that I didn't learn as much as I would have liked to, and I know a lot of my classmates feel the same way. Additionally, readings were usually scattered excerpts that were difficult to locate in the larger scheme of the works in question, which I found frustrating. While my TA was lovable, the discussion section itself was not particularly enriching.I should note that, although there aren't many, those assignments there are should be taken seriously. It is definitely feasible to dowell in the course, but only if you make sure your writings are precise and well-executed. Students do well to follow the instructions closely, since it's easy to step out of the bounds of a philosophical analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a very deep understanding of Plato and Aristotle. I found that my class was mostly composed of philosophy majors, which makes sense since this class is a prereq for the major. As a prospective philosophy major, I feel like this class provided me with excellent foundational knowledge. Professor Harte is brilliant and funny and makes the class a great experience for all. Her lectures are always extremely easy to follow and organized, and she manages to make clear very complicated concepts. Overall great course, extremely worth it.",
    "Study of ancient philosophers and their contributions to relevant philosophical discussions. Quite interesting course material, and I'd recommend to anyone interested in philosophy.",
    "Intro to Ancient Philosophy is a solid 5th class\u00e2\u0080\u0094very little work, and the information is interesting (and important to know). I do wish the readings had been a little more comprehensive (mostly just short excerpts from the Republic and the Nicomachean ethics\u00e2\u0080\u0094we never even came close to reading all of either)... Professor Harte really knows her stuff, and is definitely engaging... but to be entirely honest, with this class, you get out of it what you put in (it would be very easy to leave the class without remembering anything you've taken notes on, as there are no tests, etc. etc.).",
    "I would recommend it if one is interested in the subject material and hasn't really encountered it before.",
    "It is a review of several important works by Plato, Aristotle, and a few other philosophers.The assignments which you are graded on have little relevance to the lectures. As you can see in the syllabus, all of the grading is based on philosophy papers. Unfortunately, there is very little reviewing of how to write these papers in class. It is up to you to hunt down the TAs and have them show you the appropriate writing process.I took this course Credit\/D\/Fail, and I managed to complete all of my assignments with reasonable success (B\/B+)even though I skipped many of the lectures. There just doesn't seem to be a great cross-over between lecture content, and what you need to do to get good grades.",
    "Exactly as its title suggests: an introduction to ancient philosophy. I would recommend it if and only if the student were interested in ancient philosophy and\/or considering becoming a philosophy major.",
    "Take it if you want to do philosophy and\/or classics and want a good introduction that is not Directed Studies.",
    "Great class - Really really interesting lectures. Its pretty much all plato and aristotle, so make sure you are interested in reading plato and aristotle! Very little reading and the lectures are really comprehensive. Not too much work either.",
    "This was the first philosophy class I have taken, and while it was certainly challenging, it was also interesting. Even if you understand the main point of the readings, when it comes time to complete the writing assignments, you will find that just understanding the main point\/what's being discussed isn't enough. I would recommend this class, because although it was challenging, it was never so hard that I felt like I couldn't do it, and my interest in the readings remained pretty steady all semester.",
    "A great intro to Plato and Aristotle. The class also does a good job of teaching you how to write a philosophy paper, but the grading is very tough.",
    "A good introduction to philosophy! As someone who had never taken philosophy before it has inspired me to take some more philosophy classes. Harte is a great lecturer and the readings and papers are very manageable. Recommended!",
    "It is a class that gives you a broad education of ancient philosophy through the required readings and lectures, but the workload is poorly structured. Your entire grade relies on three assignments and the grading is tough. But if you are interested in ancient philosophy take the class. If not and just want to take a philosophy class, this might not be the class for you.",
    "I really tried to like this class but Professor Harte, while very nice and helpful one on one, is a very boring lecturer, regardless of her sense of humor and ways she tries to make things enjoyable.",
    "Lectures moved too slowly for my tastes. It felt like Professor Haarte was targeting them at the lowest common denominator.",
    "I would summarize it as a good overview of ancient philosophy with rather difficult writing assignments. I would recommend it if they were confident in their writing ability and\/or had experience in writing philosophy papers and analyses before.",
    "Phil125 is basically a course on Plato and Aristotle. Each lecture you read a passage and professor Harte develops the argument in class. It's a good class, but I have enjoyed other philosophy classes a lot more, possibly because more modern philosophers deal with more relatable questions. To another student I would definitely recommend taking a philosophy class, but maybe not this one. If you're a philosophy major though, of course you have to take it and its not bad.",
    "Very good.",
    "The course material is very very interesting if you have any desire whatsoever to gain some understanding of philosophy. You trace the roots of some great traditions of thought and really appreciate the genius of ancient thinkers.",
    "Lectures with Verity Harte are excellent and well worth your Yale tuition dollars. The readings are, of course, classics, so you can't really complain--Plato is a pleasant read whereas Aristotle is a pain. Section is often a drag, unless you can entertain your TA with Greek (otherwise, enjoy your hour of writing Heraclitus twitter statuses). In the end, I recommend this class. Take it C\/D\/F if you're not in the YPU.",
    "If you enjoy the topic, it's alright. Reading the greats is great, but you won't find a whole lot of inspiration in this intro class. Not a lot of depth, which is fine, it was just uninteresting much of the time, and not much fruitful discussion was to be had.",
    "This class is mostly about Plato and Aristotle. It was a good class, but I wouldn't take it on a whim."
