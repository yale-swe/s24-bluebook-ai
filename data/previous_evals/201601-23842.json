    "It is a fine class to take if looking for an excuse to watch war films. For the most part we did not talk about the readings. Watching the movies is enough to get by in the class, making this class not that much work.",
    "Great course, exposed me to war films and the connection between govt., Hollywood, and reality",
    "Wonderful analytical seminar on war films. Take the time to actually watch each movie and complete the readings (not too onerous)they really are worth it. The syllabus includes a huge number of classic American war films and the class has the potential for many intellectually stimulating discussions on American culture (both military and civilian). Take advantage!",
    "Solid if you are looking for a good dosage of war films (not necessarily the top ones) and analysis on their connection to American society."
