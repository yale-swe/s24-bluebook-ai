   "comments": [
    "This course provides a unique opportunity to focus on reading and discussing ethnographic and theoretical monographs on Japan.In its current configuration I would not recommend it to another student. As mentioned in the previous responses there are a number of logistical and interpersonal issues that prevent this course from being as productive as it could and should be. That said, if the hypothetical student in this question was someone who would contribute to the discussion and to an atmosphere of mutual respect and dedication, then I would recommend this course to the student in order to improve the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students; a great learning environment, and an opportunity to begin building up a good annotated bibliography of the literature in Japanese anthro."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has the potential to contribute to my knowledge of the discipline and to my dissertation research, but only insofar as I put my own effort into the readings and thinking through the issues. Discussions in the seminar itself are usually unhelpful and seldom do the comments from other participants help me to work through the issues or come up with new insights. Karen is pretty much the only one who contributes to thoughtful engagement with the text in new ways, and I would probably benefit more from one-on-one meetings with Karen rather than in the seminar format as it is presently configured.However, the very individualized and personal nature of effort and growth that is possible in this course could be its strength in cultivating individual professionalization and in aiding in dissertation research, as long as these elements are foregrounded and emphasized from the start by the instructor and senior members, and mentioned throughout the semester in order to remind participants to be dedicated to the class."
