    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially one who learned the basic concepts in algebraic geometry and is looking to see how they apply to actual problems in geometry.",
    "I would recommend Math 656 to any student with an interest to do research in algebraic geometry and who already has a solid background. Although those who are not yet experts in scheme theory will still get much of the class, many results from the middle of the course on rely heavily on it, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to take this class after studying scheme theory in detail. In essence, the course really is a survey on several advanced topics inalgebraic geometry culminating with the current status in the development of several of them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great course, and I would strongly recommend any one with the necessary background to listen to Prof. Jensen lecture.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in algebraic geometry whatsoever. It is both fundamental and beautiful."

    "The course dealt with similar topics to the ones I'm thinking of in my PhD. The fact that I now have a better picture of the field will definitely help me as I look forward to the next steps in my research.",
    "Contributed greatly towards my own research, due to particularly fruitful timing. Several lectures weredirectly applicable to problems I am working on currently."
