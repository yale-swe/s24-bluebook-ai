    "no take the lecture! better curve and easier",
    "Good class, be prepared to study a lot for midterm and final. Do the readings before class.",
    "A microeconomics class which mirrors 110 with additional emphasis on math.",
    "If you need to take an econ class, and can place into 108 (haven't taken calc before), then definitely go for it: it is the most manageable out of the micro econ classes. It is still challenging - I took it for my QR, and there are for sure QR classes out there that are easier than this - but its good to have a basic understanding of econ, and this is your best bet for getting that done at Yale. What sets this course apart is that Tolga is incredibly willing to help you outside of class, so even if you don't understand the materials, you can always seek out help if you need to.",
    "Tolga is an amazing professor ! If you want to take this course, I strongly suggest you take it with him!"
