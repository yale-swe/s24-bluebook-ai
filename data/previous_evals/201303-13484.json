   "comments": [
    "I was really skeptical before taking this class since I had never taken an English class at Yale before and writing is not one of my strengths. Prof. Zarin did a great job of creating an open class atmosphere and helped each individual student with their unique problems. Be prepared for work, but if you want to become a better writer I suggest you take this class.",
    "I was somewhat disappointed by this course. I went in with high expectations, having heard excellent things about English 120, but my expectations fell short. I did not feel that my writing improved much. That being said, I learned a few crucial things from Professor Zarin about the importance of straightforwardness, clarity, and simplicity in writing. Weekly essays could be a challenge (each week, either a rough or final draft was due), but they were, for the most part, fun. I would say I learned the most not from Professor Zarin's feedback on my essays, but from the peer review workshops. While the weekly readings could be interesting, I don't feel like I learned much from them, and thus had difficulty applying their authors' techniques to my writing. I think that part of my disappointment with this course was due to the fact that I had high expectations which were not met, and I also learned that I am not particularly interested in creative non-fiction writing. So, if you know that you like this genre of writing and are looking for an introductory English course, this may be for you; but if you already consider yourself a skilled writing, you may find the class under-stimulating.",
    "Great selection of readings, wonderful essay topics, a challenging class that was very worth it. Professor Zarin taught many techniques for analyzing works with a writer's eye. I would recommend this course, and great friendships come out of it.",
    "If you like to write at all, I highly recommend this class. It's great in that it allows you to develop as a writer while doing a type of writing that you don't often get to do. Professor Zarin was great--really helpful, an excellent writer herself, always available to meet privately.",
    "I think this is a course that everyone should take during their time at yale. It is a classic for a reason. If you are at all interested in writing please take it.I would caution people that professor zarin has a very hands-off approach to teaching. If you are looking for a lot of feedback or individual attention. I would not take her class. That being said she will push you, and if you are willing to work you will definitely get something out it.",
    "ENGL120 is an introductory english course where you improve your writing by writing a series of 6 essays and reading exemplary works to see examples of different styles and prose. I would recommend it as it allows you to write intensively, but it certainly is as much as you want it to be - make sure that you do all of the reading, as class discussion is much more fun and interesting that way.",
    "Yes!",
    "An enjoyable and challenging introduction to creative nonfiction writing. Take it, but push to meet with Zarin as much as possible. You will definitely become a better writer by taking this.",
    "Yes, I think ENGL 120 is a class that every student at Yale should take at some point in their college career. It's not just about writing or creative nonfiction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Professor Zarin does a much better job of explaining this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it's about learning to think and communicate clearly. Most of our class discussions eventually morph into a talk about how the writers we read communicate certain ideas or influence their readers. It's definitely a different and positive way to look at writing. Professor Zarin herself is brilliant, and I always left class feeling like I'd learned something new. You can't get any better than her for ENGL 120, so if you're like me and lucky enough to be put into this class, TAKE IT! Just be ready for harsh grading and a mental boot camp. Professor Zarin tells it like it is.",
    "If you're at all interested in improving you writing or, on a more basic level, thinking more clearly, take English 120. It is a class that feels important while you are taking it, and while the workload can wear you down, you're writing will undoubtedly improve\u00e2\u0080\u0094by leaps and bounds. If you take English 120, for the love of God, take it with Professor Zarin. he is sensitive, perceptive, and relentlessly kind, while still being stern. When it comes to writing, she has a hawk-like sense of what is good and what is bad\u00e2\u0080\u0094both stylistically and morally. She effortlessly weaves together lessons in writing with lessons in life; a skill that must come from her genuine and unflinching conviction that language and humanity are somehow deeply linked. She really, really cares about her students, and while she doesn't sugarcoat her weekly edits, she will go to great lengths to support and better her students. She insists on meeting with each student individually on a semi-regular basis and getting to know he or she\u00e2\u0080\u0094and his or her writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094on a personal level. In a sense, everyone in the class also gets to have a tutorial with Professor Zarin.I could go on for a long, long time. Just take the class.",
    "Take this class because your writing will definitely benefit from it."
