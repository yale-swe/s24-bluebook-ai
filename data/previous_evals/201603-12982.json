   "comments": [
    "I learned how to critically analyze arguments regarding the disease vs. choice model of addiction. In addition, I learned about the various personality, environmental, and societal influences that can impact a person's trajectory towards substance use and abuse. The takeaways from this course are the addiction is a complicated social and personal puzzle that is not easily solved by any one action or policy. Instead, it is necessary to take a holistic look at the experience of a drug addict and what sorts of techniques can be applied for better treatment, intervention, and therapy. Communication skills are developed in this class as it is mostly a discussion-based seminar. Also, the final presentation tests your presentation and debate skills.",
    "I learned about the biological, social, and psychological components of addictive behavior, different approaches to treatment, and competing views within the field of addictions.",
    "I gained a new perspective on the nature of addiction both through the readings and the behavior change",
    "We learned about the etiology of addictions from a biological, psychological, and social standpoint. We examined various components of addiction (for example craving and withdrawal), the neuroscience behind addiction (impaired executive functioning, the incentive salience model) and engaged in a behavior change project that allowed us to experience the components of addiction we studied in class. We also learned about the legal issues surrounding addiction. The weekly reading responses allowed us to engage critically with the reading material and thus retain more of the information. It was also fascinating to hear debates on current issues surrounding addiction, such as the existence of a gateway drug or the legalization of marijuana.",
    "This course helped give me insight in how to critically analyze scientific studies and how to use this information to debate important topics related to how drug addiction is treated and how drug-use policy and laws should be implemented in our society. This course taught me how to engage in thoughtful discussion on controversial topics related to drug addiction treatment and the war on drugs. This course also helped me develop formal presentation skills on presenting a a topic for a dialectic argument.",
    "During this course, I learned an immense amount about addiction. We learned about many different aspects of this topic, and the professor was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions we had. There were interesting and unique projects throughout the semester that involved a level of immersion and participation that I had never experienced in another class before. For example, there was an optional food fast for 24 hours that was supposed to demonstrate craving to us. Additionally, there was a semester-long behavior change project in which we had to give something up that we use as a stress-reliever. The final debate allowed us to go further into detail into a specific topic regarding addiction and to listen to others present their topics as well. Overall, this was a valuable class that taught me a lot of information and had fun and interesting projects throughout.",
    "I learned how to integrate neuoscience and psychology with public health concepts in order to gain a holistic understanding of what an addiction is. Being able to accurately and concisely communicate issues pertaining to addictions and disorders in general is an important real-world skill for anyone interested in public health"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: course material is well-designed and covers the topic of addiction and policy thoroughly. The final paper and presentation are a great way to learn a TON about a topic and have it be something you can intelligently reference in a normal conversation. It's also a great way to fulfill your senior psych writing requirement. Weaknesses: sometimes discussion felt a little TOO student-guided - would have liked a little bit more directed discussion on occasion.",
    "This class was amazing. A subject that I love to study, and plenty of engaging material to interact with.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, from the behavior change project to the lectures to the discussions. The breadth and depth of this course made it incredibly informative, as it is one of the few courses offered on addictions. Prof. Baskin-Sommers is a very engaging lecturer and good facilitator of discussion. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses, besides perhaps the class discussion could be more active if there were fewer people. But then again, so many people want to take the course that it might be unfair to make it smaller!",
    "This course has many strengths. The length of the course is adequately scheduled which allows the professor to discuss important background information for the class while also allowing plenty of time for lively debate and discussion between students and the professor. The weekly response papers were a great way to allow myself to think critically about the topics that would be discussed in the next class. The behavior change project was something I didn't really like doing for 10 weeks, but overall it did give me a lot of perspective on how extremely difficult it can be to change your own behavior and even more so how much more difficult it can be to change the behavior of being addicted to a substance. The presentation and final paper were great assignments that I enjoyed doing. I don't really find any weaknesses with the design of the course.",
    "One strength of the class is the amount of material covered. We go through a lot of information and I really left the class feeling I gained knowledge on this subject. Another strength is the final debate\/paper, which allowed me to go in depth with an interesting topic and present on it. One weakness is the weekly journals we had to do for the behavior change project. Although I believe reflection is valuable, I found myself writing almost the same thing every week. It would have been nice to have a theme or specific direction each week to change it up a little.",
    "Such an organized course!!! I cannot stress this enough. Lectors always built on each other and tied into the over-arching concepts.",
    "I think the set up of the class is fantastic and I really enjoyed it (as will be seen below! My one suggestion is that I think the \"experience summaries\" went on a little too long. I found myself really reaching in the last few and feel as if I did not get that much out of them once we stopped incorporating those weekly twists. Perhaps stopping around Thanksgiving in future courses would help this."

    "This was probably one of my favorite courses at Yale thus far and I would highly recommend it. Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great teacher and assigns a super reasonable level of work. The activities we do (food fast and behavior change) are a cool way to really experience the things we are discussing. If you have the chance to take it definitely do!",
    "Definitely. It's a great deep dive into the world of addiction and how problems are being solved in the real world. You get elements of history, public policy, neuroscience, interpersonal relationships, and therapy all rolled into one seminar.",
    "Absolutely, if you have any interest in the field of addiction, and even if you don;t and are just curious, take this course.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you get the opportunity. The material is fascinating and the professor is brilliant and good at teaching.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topics that we covered were fascinating and Professor Baskin-Sommers is a very clear lecturer and great facilitator of discussion. We learned about the etiology of addictions from a biological, psychological, and social standpoint. We examined various components of addiction (for example craving and withdrawal), the neuroscience behind addiction (impaired executive functioning, the incentive salience model) and engaged in a behavior change project that allowed us to experience the components of addiction we studied in class.

It was also fascinating to hear debates on current issues surrounding addiction, such as the existence of a gateway drug or the legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, Professor Baskin-Sommers is one of the most responsive and organized professors I've had, and you know exactly how you are doing in the course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Take it before you leave Yale if you can. Every week there was always a lively debate and discussion in class about the course topic. The course is designed to help you succeed, and Professor Baskin-Sommers is great. This was one of my favorite classes ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in psychology\/addiction. You will learn a lot from a knowledgeable professor and gain a new perspective on many of the issues discussed. It was a fun and relatively low-stress course.",
    "A great senior seminar! Nice way to tie together concepts that you've learned throughout your 4 years.",
    "Absolutely take this course! Arielle gives just enough of the most recent background literature for students to engage in thoughtful debate on the foremost controversies in the field. I also really enjoy the emphasis on the ramifications for public policy coming out of the latest research (esp. regarding treatment and prevention).",
