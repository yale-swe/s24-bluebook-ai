   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT!!",
    "I highly recommend this class. It's very relevant to life and understanding how and why humans act certain ways. It's not very much work at all, and the stuff you learn is so interesting!",
    "This is a very good course and you will learn a lot of interesting things you never thought about before but see the effects of every day. It requires a decent amount of reading, but the material is mostly very entertaining and not difficult. The course does not require a lot of work, but you have to be very prepared for the three midterm exams. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Social Psychology is a really interesting subject, but the class is not taught well. Most students did not attend the lectures. The exams test both the lectures and the textbook readings, and the final grade is based solely on the three midterms. There are no weekly assignments, so the workload is not too heavy on a week-to-week basis, but the readings could pile up if not done on a timely manner.",
    "It's a good overview to social psychology. Not necessary to take if you've done many psych classes. But it's certainly an easy and interesting 5th class!",
    "A very interesting psych course",
    "It's a pretty good class because the way we interact in groups is really important. The tests are pretty hard so might be a good class to take Credit D, as there is no curve.",
    "Good class if you don't want a lot of work besides reading and don't mind being bored",
    "Interesting class that, like my experience with previous psych classes, is not conceptually difficult, but does require a lot of memorization and time.",
    "I would definitely take it! But the exams are very nitpicky and can be hard if you don't put in the time of going to lectures and doing the readings and taking notes.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student because the topics are very interesting and from everyday life situations. I also think the workload was very appropriate and not to much.",
    "Good class. Learned a lot of interesting things; pretty laid back, not that much work. Would definitely recommend. Lectures can be a little repetitive and disorganized at times though.",
    "I wouldn't take it if you don't need it. Good class to Cr\/D if you just want to take for fun. Less stressful that way.",
    "A survey course of social psychology concepts (i.e. group behavior, influence, leadership, stereotypes, bias). Conducted poorly, makes fascinating topics dreadfully dull. Don't have to go to lecture, have to do the reading. Three non-cumulative exams.",
    "I would recommend this class because it had a lot of interesting material, it's just tough because the only grades are your tests so you have to do well on all of them.",
    "The perfect Credit\/D class. Interesting material, only 3 multiple choice tests, no work. Couldn't get any better, life is good.",
    "Social psychology is a twice-a-week lecture with three non-cumulative exams. There is a lot of reading from the textbook every week, and I highly recommend that you keep up with it, otherwise it's way too much to do the night before each exam. The material is generally interesting, albeit intuitive. Don't expect this class to change your worldview, but it's a decently engaging lecture that doesn't increase your workload by too much. I'd recommend it to psychology majors who need to fill their social science core requirement it's probably less interesting than developmental or abnormal psych, but is lighter in terms of workload.",
    "Dull and harder than it should be. Only 3 tests, but they aren't super easy. You need to read the book. Professor Bargh is charismatic but his lectures can be boring. Take it if you like the subject or if you need to, but beware it's strange mix of guttiness and earnest challenge.",
    "This course is definitely accessible to non-psychology majors. I would not recommend this course to anyone who has previously taken Bargh's \"Modern Unconscious\" course, as the two are very very similar. The grading is based on three exams, so if that is your preferred assessment style, this course might be for you. Overall, interesting material presented in a fairly dry manner.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who is interested in psychology.",
    "Good core psych class. 3 midterms, no final, but you will need to read the textbook to do well on the exams. No other work however.",
    "PSYC 150 is a good class for the sake of the Psychology major. I don't think it is a class one should take for fun.",
    "Overall, the course was interesting, but the exams could sometimes be a pain. Make sure to read the textbook readings beforehand!",
    "If you're thinking about being a psych major, definitely take it; if you're like me and you're a humanities major looking for a social science, make sure you're interested in the material before you get into it.",
    "Psych 150 is a very interesting class for those who are interested in society's psychological patterns",
    "A class that will definitely make you interested in wondering about conducting your own social psychology experiments and will highlight the importance of studying in the university where more than 98% of the experiments you studied about in class took place.",
    "Would recommend if you're looking for a straight-forward class with interesting material. I enjoyed taking this course a lot. And the exams weren't too stressful because the lectures\/textbook do a great job covering all the material you need to know.",
    "If it's with Prof. Bargh, I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you need it for Psych. Sadly, it's a really awesome topic, but taught really poorly. Pretty easy as a CR\/D\/F class, but probably not as a letter grade. If it's not with Bargh, I'd say give it a shot.",
    "A great lecture course about an incredibly interesting topic; likely relates to many other subjects you [undergraduate students] have learned about (not necessarily even those in psychology but other disciplines as well); spurs many ideas for potential research in the field if you are interested"
