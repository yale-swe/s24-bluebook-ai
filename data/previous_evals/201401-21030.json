   "comments": [
    "Terrific Course! You learn a lot but be prepared for lots of memorizing.",
    "if you have a photographic memory, yes. if not, please don't do this to yourself.",
    "The first half of the course is very straightforward. The second half is all about mechanisms and will require a lot of memorization. People give Professor Clay a bad rap for not teaching the second half well, but the material is actually very complex. The course is just 4 midterms without any problems sets.",
    "Take it if you must or love biochemistry. Take MB&B biochemistry as most suggest.",
    "Lecture and four midterms. The first half of the course is much more straight forward and concept based. Clay's tests are very nitpicky and memorization based, so be prepared to spend a lot of time memorizing slides.",
    "If you are taking this class it means you have to take it. But if you are taking it for the love of biology, take it and then drop it before the second half of this course destroys your love.",
    "It's an incredibly demanding course that picks up in the second half. All of the instructors, including Nicole Clay, are terrific. Ron Breaker is easily one of the best science professors at Yale. You basically cover a chapter each lecture, so the pace is pretty fast. No problem sets, which is amazing but your entire grade is based on four 50-minute exams (no final). You learn a lot but it's a challenge. Resist the urge to neglect this class because it will really come back to bite you when the exam rolls around. Also try to understand concepts instead of just purely memorizing things, although this kind of becomes a necessity when you have to learn several different pathways and their intermediate structures in the second part of the course.",
    "As I am sure all the other reviews will say, the first half with Breaker is great, but the second half with Clay is not. So, if you can take the other biochem, take it.",
    "The first half of the course is straightforward and requires an average amount of work. The second half of the course covers an incredible amount of material which must all be memorized for the exams. Finals week was especially stressful. If I had to choose again, I would take the MBB biochem.",
    "It's a trap. Mad difficult. Although there are no hwks or quizes, the exams require at least a week of intensive studying.",
    "Not really a great option. It is fine if you study hard and do well on the first two midterms, and then just hope to hold on for dear life in the second half of the course.",
    "MCDB 300 is a difficult and challenging class, but it comes with a very good support system that you should use to perform well in the course, from the professors' office hours to the TFs to Piazza \u2013 to make sure you understand well the concepts presented in the lecture slides. The exams \u2013 especially the last two \u2013 can be challenging but they are fair. Overall, the more work you put into it, the greater the satisfaction you will get out of it!",
    "Only if they absolutely have to take the course.",
    "You probably need to take it, so whatever. But, just be warned of Nicole Clay's tests. I actually thought she was a fine lecturer, but her tests were SO HARD. I scored As on the first two tests (Breaker's and Engelman's) and BOMBED the third one (still waiting on the last one). Just... the class changes a lot once Clay starts teaching. The class overall isn't that bad though, compared to some science classes. Also FYI the final is on the last day of finals, and is technically a midterm. It sucks for seniors trying to go to Myrtle. You guys should ask to move the last midterm up to reading period or earlier during exams or something.",
    "I mean, we'll see what the curve is. The only reason I took this over the MB&B version is because I heard the curve is better.",
    "This class is OK. This would be a fun class to take credit\/D but if you're taking it for a grade, it's stressful in the second half - it's not impossible, though, and I wouldn't be scared of taking it. Just appreciate Breaker and Engelman and be prepared to work twice as hard in Clay's.",
    "I think I would still recommend taking the MB&B version of biochemistry, but if need be, this course isn't so bad. I found biochemistry super cool - it's a different way to look a biology.",
    "Nicole clay is awful. The first half of the course is great, actually enjoyable. Nicole clay then came and gave way too much material in each lecture.",
    "This class was hard, but not impossible. There are four non-cumulative exams, and the first two are very reasonable. The second two are on denser material and significantly more difficult, but if you plan ahead, it's not that bad. I enjoyed learning about all the stuff they taught, even if it was in a lot of detail.",
    "It's a lot of memorization. A lot. Not a fun class.",
    "This class is a trap. The first two tests are very doable and instructive. The last two tests are a living nightmare. You will need to study 14-20 hrs for each of the last two tests. That being said, you will come out with a rather comprehensive understanding of how metabolic pathways intersect. I wish there was more attention paid to the physiological implications and connections, but Clay did try to do this somewhat. You'll learn alot, but I'm not sure how much of it will be retained, since it's a lot of information. Not an easy class by any means. Orgo 2\/ orgo definitely required.",
    "It's tough but breaker is great. Clay could improve by presenting concepts in a more linear fashion.",
    "I thought this was a strong biochemistry course. If you were good at Orgo, then this material won't be difficult.",
    "MCDB 300 is a good introductory course to biochemistry and metabolic processes within animal and plant systems. It was fairly well taught by three professors - Prof Breaker and Engelman for the first half and Prof Clay for the second half. It takes some time and effort in transitioning from one professor to the other; however, it is doable. Professor Clay's half of the semester is notoriously more challenging but with effort and time memorizing molecular structures and pathway mechanisms, the material isn't impossible to master. Good luck!",
    "A general introduction to biochemistry that emphasizes biochemical pathways, how they are regulated and how they feed into each other.",
    "The class is good overall, with a great first half by Breaker and Engelman and improving second half by Clay. Previous years have bemoaned Clay's teaching, but I saw a great glimmer of hope during her review session for the fourth test. During this session she slowed down to write mechanisms out on the board and go step by step through metabolic cycles, which was extremely helpful. I believe she is the most junior of the professors for the course, but she was certainly much better compared to what I had heard about her from past reviews.",
    "Stay far away if you value your sanity. Nicole clays portion of the course has too much material and lectures are very hard to follow if you haven't studied biochem before.",
    "Take it only if you need to. It's very similar to orgo (with some gen chem and bio) so a lot of the material is familiar or redundant. If you're an orgo fan though (yes, they exist. I'm one.) then go for it."
