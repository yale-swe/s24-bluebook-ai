    "This could have been a insightful course but I felt it was very disorganized. The information is good but the course should have followed the layout of the text in order to be more cohesive.I felt that the chinese FDA lectures were not valuable. Maybe 1 would have been interesting but having the 4 or 5 that we had was a waste of time.",
    "Very poor organization overall. There is clearly a lot to learn, and if we had stuck to the syllabus I think we would have learned a lot more. The fact that the syllabus was wrong about the topics we covered, the amount of homework we had and the projects we had to complete was very frustrating. Also, the tests did not really test anything we actually talked about in class.",
    "class has a lot of potential, however, the syllabus was not really followed.",
    "Course is very useful for understanding the whole drug approval process. I got to learn many more things about the FDA and clinical trials. For anyone who's intersted in working for pharma, I'd recommend this course.",
    "Overall, it was a poorly organized course. The material became very repetitive after the midterm. Very few new topics were discussed during the second half of the course.",
    "A lot of the lectures were repetitive, and there were far more homework assignments given than were listed in the syllabus. The course was very informative but did not follow the syllabus. It could be improved by updating the syllabus, since it is not an accurate description of the coursework.",
    "Strengths:Great professor.Great book.Great new class for YSPH.Weakness:Should be a year-long course.",
    "Interesting subject matter, but class was not well defined or organized. Guest speakers were excellent.",
    "I think this was a good introductory course. I think that the book tends to be a little bit repetitive at times. The faculty might actually consider combining the course with the Clinical trials one and either making them 0.5 credits each (or even making it a 1.5 credit for the total year). There is a reasonable amount of overlap and the subject matter dovetails well (albeit there are certainly different goals of the study). I think that at time we could have gotten a bit more technical in terms of the \"nitty gritty\" of FDA and the regulatry world. It would have been good to hav done some case studies such as following a drug all the way from Preclinical regulation thru post-marketing issues.",
    "The material is very practical, but not very well organized"

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Excellent instructor who had the great sense to invite the Regulatory Affairs class to many outstanding lectures that Yale sets up for the Chinese FDA.In addition, we had the best speaker ever in our class, PETER HUTT, ESQ.!!In- and out-of-classroom opportunities for learning pharmacovigilance and regulatory art and science ... spectacular!",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Prof Makuch is a solid, straightforward instructor. His expectations are clear and reasonable. He is very approachable and has good real-world experience which informs a lot of his instruction well."
