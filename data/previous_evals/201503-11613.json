   "comments": [
    "I would say to only take this class if you have to for the astrophysics major, or if you are very comfortable programming in python. Although you do not need to have prior programming experience, python is not taught in the class and, specifically, astropy is used a lot. The class was interesting and I felt as if the things we learned in class were important, for example how to reduce data and how to write an astrophysics proposal. However, it could have been organized a lot better and a lot of the time I felt extremely lost.",
    "If you are an astro major, take this class because you have to. Other than that, unless astronomy is your 100% passion and you are highly skilled in python, I would suggest maybe looking elsewhere. If you are looking to learn about astronomy, I would suggest maybe Astro 210. This class isn't about the science behind astronomy, but rather how to take and interpret data.",
    "Great class. Difficult, and i reccommend having some programming experience and a sincere interest in astronomy and research. Absolutely go on the arecibo trip. Was the highlight of my semester.",
    "111 READ THIS SUMMARY :D Are you a major? NO -- don't even think about it. YES -- read below. PROFESSOR Avoid Arce. He is a great guy but sucks at transmitting knowledge or helping the students in any manner. ARECIBO If you are thinking about taking it for the trip to Arecibo (which happens during Fall Break for all Astro Majors), DO IT. But get ready, as the course is heavy and gets muuuch harder after break. COURSE It teaches you many things, but you need to learn it all by yourself. IT IS WORTH IT, but beware the challenges of learning by yourself and spending some very stressful nights with the freaking Arecibo project. The final proposal is not as awful but is still stressful. GOOD PART You will bond with other Astro majors over the suffering and the Arecibo trip - which is the only thing that saved the class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have experience coding in Python. Otherwise, this class can be really difficult (as it was for me). The material itself is very interesting if you think you might need to know how telescopes work or other observation details, but the vast majority of the homework is less \"question-answer\" based and more \"write this code so that you can analyze this piece of information\" based. The final project was pretty cool because you get to create a proposal for some sort of astronomical observation, but it can also get highly specific to a degree that requires a lot of outside individual research, since we don't go into the nitty-gritty of how certain telescopes work in class. Overall, a good class to take, but be prepared to do more work than perhaps the description suggests."
