   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the Arab world this is definitely worth taking. One of the most structured (in a good way) courses I've taken in IR. Also just a lot of fun, interesting readings, good discussion, fair grading.",
    "I would recommend the class highly. The readings were very useful although somewhat heave at the beginning of the course and at times outdated. I liked the structure of the course with presentations and two papers that left much leeway in terms of topic for students to pursue interests. The guest lecturer, William Burns, was also great in providing the American perspective on the subject.",
    "I would recommend the class as a very topical (but no less intellectually rigorous for it) class taught by a non-member of academia, but a good instructor at that. I would have appreciated slightly more 'presence' around campus on the part of the instructor.",
    "Yes. It is a great course that introduces the students to both the history of reform. The coincided with the Arab spring and Prof comments and insights on the region were valuable. Muashers"
