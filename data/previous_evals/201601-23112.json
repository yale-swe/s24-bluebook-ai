   "comments": [
    "This is a fabulous course and I would recommend it to any student interested in international security or even current events. Professor Weir is a great professor and there are a lot of super interesting guest speakers who address the class throughout the course. There is a fair amount of reading but it is generally interesting and directly tied to class discussion. Definitely take the course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about terrorism.",
    "This is not just analyzing current\/recent terrorism in the news, but rather the entire semester is spent attempting to define what exactly should be considered \"terrorism\" and the criteria under which the term should be applied to certain acts of violence. The syllabus covers examples of terrorism in many regions of the world, such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Israel-Palestine conflicts, ISIS, and other examples. It is a decent amount of reading each week, but most readings are interesting which definitely helps. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of terrorism and understanding what may compel a group or an individual to commit acts of terror.",
    "Amazing class! I learned so much and gained a deeper understanding of terrorism and its causes and effects. Many of my assumptions about terrorism changed throughout this course and I loved the speakers that Professor Weir brought in. Professor Weir is very knowledgeable and provided great material and discussions.",
    "Take it for the guest speakers, class discussion was eh",
    "Yes, I recommend this course. It is very much a course in which you will get out as much as you put in. The readings are interesting, and the discussions vary from exhausting a narrow subject to broad sweeping theories about \"intent\" versus \"action.\" There is not much intervention from the professor during class time, so you will need to be prepared to speak and prepared to fight your way into discussion.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Important to read all the material you are given (sometimes its a lot), but that's to be expected. Highly suggest if you're interested in National Security, Counter-terrorism, military, or are just really interested in the subject matter.",
    "YES - would highly recommend, 10\/10 material, 10\/10 professor"
