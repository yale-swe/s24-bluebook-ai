   "comments": [
    "How to observe small children in a classroom setting while adding to the class environment; reading critical literature about childhood education practices; how to entertain multiple perspectives on childcare.",
    "A much better understanding of the importance of early childhood education and the precarious funding situation it currently is in the United States. You also learn observational skills and how to be a better teacher and helper.",
    "This class provided a wide range of skills, knowledge, and insight. The workload was not significant, but that enabled me to really ponder the theory and practice of early childhood education. This class fundamentally changed the way I view children and early childhood education.",
    "This class taught me a lot about early childhood education and how seemingly unimportant things are in fact, incredibly important for early childhood. It was an amazing course to discuss about the challenges and hardships of early childhood.",
    "you learn a whole lot about what the best educational practices are for children, the developmental expectations for kids 0-8yrs of age, and how to create an ideal learning environment",
    "This class offered incredible insight into child development within and outside of the classroom setting. We also briefly studied education systems in the U.S. specifically with reference to current events. The combination of observation practicum and seminar discussions allowed for students to obtain a great deal of analytical skills.",
    "Lots about Early Childhood Ed. Really interesting and applicable knowledge in the classroom! This was brilliants designed and the blend of hands on learning with learning in the classroom was excellent. Skills: Learned how to reflect on learning as it was happening, learned about development and teaching practice, saw that practice in action and had to be conscious about what was happening in the classroom and otherwise."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great engagement and interaction by everyone, the one thing I would improve is updating the readings, especially on gender studies and multiculturalism.",
    "The materials of the course are so interesting! The course could benefit from more organization.",
    "The only thing that I can think of that would be extremely helpful is having all of the students who are on the same floor meet to discuss their most recent evaluations together for about fifteen minutes every week. The few times that we did this it was extremely helpful as it gave our own observations a much broader sense of context. The observations are the best part and the conversations that I had with Professor Horwtiz and the other teachers were incredibly nuanced and informative. You can really tell how experienced she and the staff are as educators and how much they think and care about children, and how much respect they have for very young children. Unfortunately, class discussion always felt a little bit flat, I think possibly because they were more centered around the readings than our observations, though the readings are certainly necessary context for the observations.",
    "The observation part of the course is one of the major strengths. It was a very different experience from other classes and added to the course incredibly.",
    "excellent course!! besides the class being so far away, i have nothing but praise for this class- I learned so much, I was engaged with the class and the kids",
    "Loved the observations. The subjects were well designed and the observations made those subjects so so so rich to learn about and see happening each day. I would have liked more comparison within the course. It is rightfully focused on Calvin Hill but I think the discussion and the class would have benefitted from visits or other frames of reference outside of Calvin Hill."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great course in terms that will improve your academic and personal life.",
    "Absolutely, If you are at all interested in education, children, or development it is an amazing informative class, that balances work and learning well.",
    "Yes I would recommend.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful course if you are remotely interested in the course. The walk to Calvin Hill twice a week is somewhat of a commitment, but more than worth it. You will learn a lot about what goes into child development at this age and gain appreciation for children and teachers.",
    "Definitely! This class is unlike any other I had taken at Yale. So long as you are alright with getting up early to head to an observation (and you like young children) then it will be an incredible learning experience.",
    "Definitely take the class if you are at all interested in early childhood. Professor Horwitz is incredibly knowledgeable and made the class a great learning experience.",
    "Yes. Amazing course and amazing professor. Assignments were fulfilling and meaningful, and helped me to connect with the reading materials and learn a lot about early childhood development. Would recommend for any psych majors interested in observing childhood development directly or even anyone who is interested in children and\/or early childhood education.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course, especially for Psych and Ed. Studies majors. Class was enjoyable, very low work load level outside of class and observations. Incredibly interesting material on very important topics",
    "YES! Observations are great. Something that will push you in ways other classes wont. Just great."
