    "This course consisted of a midterm, a final, three small group presentations, and a final paper on any immunology topic of interest. While this sounds like a lot, the material was engaging and interesting, and having spaced out assignments throughout the semester kept the students learning for the entire course. On average, I probably spent about 3 hours per week on the readings, studying, and reviewing material - very manageable workload.",
    "4-5 during the first two-thirds of the course, 2 hours per week durign the last third...about 10-12 hours total working on the final paper",
    "2-8",
    "1-2 on non-exam weeks, ~10 before exams",
    "3-5ish for reading textbook and preparing presentations. More for midterm and final studying. Less (like 0) toward the end after the final when there were only guest speakers",

    "I would estimate that in most weeks I spent 1 to 2 hours going over the lecture slides. But there were a couple weeks that I didn't due to my workload from other classes. For each of the two in-class exams I spent 6 to 7 hours over the immediately-preceding weekend and a couple hours the night before the exam. For the 3 papers that my group had to present, I would estimate that I spent 3 total hours on each including reading the paper, doing extra research to understand the paper, coordinating with my group and making my slides.",

    "Great class! Very interesting, and the guest lecturers at the end really helped tie the course material to more real-world applications and research topics. The exam formats need a bit of work, as the wording was very tricky for both the midterm and the final exams. Overall, however, I would recommend this class for anyone interested in the science of the immune system and the applications of it as an epidemiologist!",
    "Good summary of immunology. Great textbook...detailed but not overwhelming.",
    "I enjoyed the class overall. I think the material was laid out in a clear manner. I would have preferred if we had continued learning about immunology in the textbook right till the end of the class, rather than only having guest speakers after the final exam.",
    "Prof. Krause is incredibly nice and willing to help. Lectures can be a bit dry, especially in the first 2\/3 of the course when we're just doing the basics of the immune system. Student presentations are generally good and the guest lecturers on actual applications\/diseases involving the immune system were great. Exams were fair.",
    "Strengths: A great overview of immunology that covers a wide range of topics and does not go into too much detail so that you couldn't see the forrest for the trees. For that, you'd probably need a more advanced immunology course. As someone who had no experience in immunology but was excited to learn, it was great and I feel like I can read the basic literature now. Weaknesses: the presentations often felt like busy work. I think less would be better with smaller groups because they often were helpful, but with big groups, you don't do too much with the papers. Improvements: I think a big broad overview at first would help put everything into context in addition to another lecture on innate immunity. I thought the innate immunity concepts got lost because we skimmed over it particularly on different cell types and their effector functions.",
    "This course focused more on immunology and felt like a basic biology course. The beginning of the semester was very fast paced and we went through the entire text book by the middle of the semester. I wish that more of the class had been focused on looking into specific diseases throughout the semester instead of at the end. The guest lecturers were very helpful in tying in some of the concepts that we discussed but it was not till the end of the class that it seemed our time had been useful.",
    "The course attempts to cram a full semesters work in before the start of November which seems wholly unnecessary. This does not provide a deep understanding of the material or how it relates back to Epi at all. The course should be structured so that it covers the full semester. I did enjoy when other professors spoke about their specific research so if those could just be spread throughout the semester, that would be better. Also, there is no need for 3 paper presentations at all. I'd rather just have regular homework exercises or reflections on certain articles. And then use that time in class to learn more and at a slower pace. The slides are all kinds of convoluted. They need to be restructured so that students learning Immunology for the first time can connect the various processes. There's just too much going on and it's too poorly explained via the slides. The book helps explain this more. Most importantly: the multiple choice portion of the tests are a bit insane. Dr. Krause gives the option for \"all of the above\" but also says that you could just pick multiple answers which goes against all standard multiple choice methods. The questions should just be standard \"pick the correct answer\" or \"pick which answer is NOT true\" format.",
    "Excellent introductory course to immunology, very useful for reviewing key concepts.",
    "Lots of interesting topics about immunology. But the student presentations are too frequent.",
    "This is a good course covering a lot of material. However, I thought that the lectures should have been more interactive. Not everyone learns very well from straight-up lecture, so I think a more interactive component (audience questions, student group-led teaching of certain assigned topics, etc) would have been beneficial. The student presentations were mildly interesting, but I didn't feel like I learned a lot from them.",
    "I think the second part of the class, where we focus on the cross-section of immunology and epidemiology, was the most interesting part of the semester. I would have liked to have more of that along the way besides just the group presentations.",
    "I thought the class was very interesting. I do not have a very strong background in the biological sciences",
    "I feel that this is an important topics for those of us interested in the intersection immune system, infectious diseases, and populations. Covering the topics in a way that makes sense is challenging and I think the course could have been better arranged. We flew through the textbook chapters, covering a lot of important topics in 30-40 minutes or so when we really needed to proceed a bit slower and stop and recap what we covered mid-lecture and pause to see what questions students had. We need time to digest the presented information. This should come at the expense of the student presentations. The amount of group work was tedious for the presenting groups as this required a fair bit of coordination and communication. The articles we presented were of rather low in scholarly quality. The audience was not engaged in these presentations. Student participation should be incorporated into the class in other ways. Special topic presentations could have been better tailored to the level of detail we had covered in class. The \"final\" was worth way too much of the total grade. I enjoyed the final paper and that was labor intensive, it should be been worth more of the grade. Should have introduced the idea of immunoepidemiology prior to assigning the paper. Thought there were a number of unfair\/poorly worded exam questions and the professor was not present for clarification.",
    "Excellent course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Great professor, though he tended to speed through his slides. For more complex topics where the readings were confusing, more time and explanation of the content would have been greatly appreciated. Dr. Krause is very approachable and has a great sense of humor that tended to keep the course lighthearted and engaging yet also interesting.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Knowledgable and clearly devoted to the field of immmunology...asked lots of questions during student presentations, which forced us to be very prepared and really understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Incredibly nice and approachable professor. Sometimes went a bit too fast with reading off the slides full of text, but willing to stop for questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is great! He asks a lot of questions and is really interested in the material. He has to cover so much in a short amount of time though. Maybe make lectures on the long days and student presentation on the short days.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Peter is one of the nicest and smartest professors that I have ever interacted with and it is clear that he has a passion for immunology. He was always available to answer questions, was encouraging and was honest with us about the merits of a study when researchers fell flat and how they could improve. It would have been interesting to hear more about Peter's research and could have helped the science of the course relate to the epidemiology side throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0His slides are poorly constructed \/ he doesn't do a great job of tying everything together. Reads a bit fast. Is a very nice and knowledgable guy overall and just needs to make some simple alterations to the class to make it one of the more enjoyable EMD courses.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Please stop using multiple choice questions with arbitrary number of choices; you can accomplish the same thing by having multiple true-false questions, which will not confuse anyone.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Excellent instructor, very comprenshensive and understanding.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very nice, patient professor",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Peter is extremely approachable and helpful to his students. Great person to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0I thought the instructor was very good. His explanations were clear and coherent, he was very responsive to questions. Typically he was very knowledgeable in response to students' questions but he was also very honest in situations in which he was somewhat uncertain. He asked very good questions that I hadn't thought of during the group presentations that I appreciated as they bettered my understanding of the paper being discussed. On some occasions, I got the impression that he was too focused on getting to the end of the slides designated for that day so the presentation could get somewhat rushed at the end.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Friendly and warm instructor. Some difficulties delivering lecture which sound rehearsed or too much like reading. At times speaks to the screen instead of the students as he reads off slides and misses student questions.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Excellent teacher."

    "Great course, engaging content, very fast-paced but interesting. Guest lectures after the final really help tie together some immuno concepts and current research that is being done in the field of immunoepidemiology. Learned a lot!!",
    "Standard Immunology class, chock full of biology",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Prof. Krause is incredibly nice and willing to help. Lectures can be a bit dry, especially in the first 2\/3 of the course when we're just doing the basics of the immune system. Student presentations are generally good and the guest lecturers on actual applications\/diseases involving the immune system were great. Exams were fair.",
    "I recommend the course for anyone with very little or no knowledge of immunology but who is excited to learn the basics and apply them in your own research or reading. There are two exams that you study pretty hard for but that aren't too bad, three presentations (that I recommend get cut down), and a final paper. The final was in November and the rest of the class was taught by guest lecturers on applied research and special topics.",
    "Ugh.",
    "Excellent course for reviewing key concepts in immunology, very useful for students pursuing medical school.",
    "Yes, good course to learn the immunology and epidemiology",
    "This course is not bad at all. You may have to do a lot of reading and studying on your own to master the concepts, but that's only because immunology is quite dense, and if you haven't taken an intro class before, this one will be fast-paced. Workload is very manageablejust 2 exams and a final paper, with several easy group presentations interspersed throughout the semester. You may be tempted to fall behind in the material when there isn't an exam looming, but if you keep up you'll find studying for the exams much easier.",
    "The first 2\/3 of the semester are really heavy on the immune system. You go through the whole textbook in 12 weeks. It's tough. The last 1\/3 is guest lecturers. That's the really interesting part (not because they're guests but because it's the more practical thing for epidemiologists). You'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend it. I think I may be somewhat atypical in terms of having less of a background in the biological sciences than the average student so I found the quantity of information somewhat overwhelming, especially at first. I really appreciate how phenomenal\/complex the human immune system is now. Some of the exam questions were a little more confusing than they needed to be to assess the students' understanding but I think it all comes out in the wash.",
    "Crash course in immunobiology, lacking on the epidemiology side of things.",
    "Helps to understand immunology from an epidemiologic perspective. Highly recommended if you are interested in microbial disease, and\/or medicine."
