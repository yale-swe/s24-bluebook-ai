    "I learned some interesting things about the philosophical considerations around the physical history of art.",
    "The course provided a survey of conservation practices across many mediums\/disciplines. I had the opportunity to meet specialists, and see demonstrations relating to their work. The readings were also an excellent complement to this hands-on component. The course made me think more about how conservation intersects with teaching, curating, writing and producing art.",

   "comments": [
    "Getting to hear from subject-experts was great fun. Learning about the identification of Pre-Hispanic Meso- and South-American fakes was a particular highlight. Most of the materials were not particularly new, especially to anyone who'd already studied physical or technical art history. That said, given how new it is as a field, it does seem awfully hard to teachthe field seems still to be grappling with what the methodology of technical art history is. Caro did a beautiful job of handling what she had to work with, and finding unexpected themes to tie into the physical history of art.",
    "The best part of this course was the range of experiences\/specialists Professor Fowler introduced to us. It was great to see materials and talk directly with those practicing in the field. The readings were good, though we didn't always have a chance to discuss them because of the planned guest speakers. If anything, I would say the course could have been longer (a full year), but I know that is not necessarily feasible within the curriculum. A longer course would have allowed for more depth, especially in our own research, as the course felt like an introduction to many disciplines.",
    "The strength of the course is the way we used resources at Yale, i.e. visiting the Art Gallery and having great guest speakers in class. The readings, however, were slightly underwhelming sometimes."

    "It might depend on the background of the student in questionbut for someone interested, hearing from the conservators and other experts who came to speak would be well worth taking the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in the subject, even if it is not their primary field. There were a range of departments\/schools represented in the class, which made conversation more active."
