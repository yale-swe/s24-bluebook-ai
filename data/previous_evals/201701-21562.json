   "comments": [
    "Quantum Mechanics, properties of light, General Relativity, Cosmology, overview of Particle physics.",
    "I learned quantum mechanics as well as very introductory general relativity through this class.",
    "This course taught me a ton about quantum mechanics and general relativity, as well as relevant math, that I otherwise probably would not have encountered for another year or two. The difficulty of the material taught me how to best utilize resources such as office hours, and improved my study skills.",
    "I learned about quantum mechanics and began to understand general relativity.",
    "Most of what we covered in this course was new material, beginning with the plane-wave solution for light, followed by all of quantum mechanics, and ending with a tensor representation of special and general relativity with some cosmology. Overall, this course gave me a solid fundamental basis for all of modern physics.",
    "This course teaches participants the basics of quantum mechanics and general relativity. The skills developed will make it easier to understand the subjects in a more in depth manner in the future.",
    "I learned a lot of math and introductory physics behind quantum mechanics, atomic theory, and both special and general relativity.",
    "The key things covered in this course are Electromagnetic Waves, Quantum Mechanics, a review of Special Relativity, 4 Vectors, Relativistic Electrodynamics, General Relativity, and Cosmology. These are all done at at introductory level, so don't expect to gain a deep understanding. However, this course does a good job of giving a broad overview of what each field is all about.",
    "Physics 261 helped me to apply my knowledge about familiar concepts to entirely new methods. For example, in order to develop Einstein's Theory of General Relativity for gravity, Professor Baltay first chooses to apply the methods to electricity and magnetism. He then draws clear parallels and points out distinctions between gravity and E&M.",
    "Everything about Light, Quantum Mechanics, tensor notation\/analysis, and general relativity",
    "Baltay basically gives a speedy overview of selected topics from higher-level physics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity",
    "I learned about different fields of physics that I hadn't studied before. In conjunction with that, I learned some higher-level math concepts for the first time and how they could be used in physics.",
    "I learned about general relativity and quantum mechanics in this course. I also grew in my ability to think like a theoretical physicist because of the proofs that were used for different elements of this course.",
    "I learned some introductory knowledge on quantum mechanics and general relativity.",
    "I gained a mathematically-based understanding of quantum theory and general relativity. In this course I was introduced to tensor mathematics of the kind I've not seen before!",
    "How to understand concepts in quantum mechanics",
    "An in-depth formulation of quantum mechanics and a brief foray into general relativity.",
    "Idea of how quantum physics and GR generally work"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Needs to better integrate the review\/problem set sessions into the course so that we have more exposure to example problems than just the problem sets.",
    "The course is rigorous, taught very well, and well placed. The way tensors are taught could for sure be improved and clarified.",
    "This course covers extremely interesting material, however, because it is so advanced, it's almost impossible for freshman to really understand it. The math is not taught very well, and so much of the content of the course is built on a shaky background. The course is proof based but the psets are problems, and they often don't really match up. This forces you to teach yourself material not covered in class to be able to do the psets. It is not made clear what material (things covered in class or on psets) will be on the exams, and often studying consists more of trying to memorize equations than actually understand the material. It would be helpful to spend a little more time in class going over the equations and problem types that are on the psets (especially in quantum mechanics), and we should be given an equation sheet on the exam so that we can focus on learning the substantive material, not memorizing equations that can be looked up in a second in real life.",
    "Strengths of this class include the material which was very interesting and engaging, as well as the professor. It was clear that Professor Baltay especially enjoyed what he was teaching this semester and it made the class very engaging. It also offered review sessions periodically that helped learn the material. There were very few weaknesses for this class - one may be the textbook that it uses for quantum mechanics was a little weak and a little less rigorous than most quantum mechanic textbooks.",
    "This material covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. That is both a positive and a negative.",
    "The course does a good job of touching on almost all the topics of physics. In general, it could have used more rigor in the second half, as it was difficult to know exactly what we were supposed to know for the general relativity portions. The fact that the textbook had errors in it certainly didn't help, especially since no one knew the tensor math. Perhaps more time and rigor on the math there would have helped.",
    "I appreciate that the course covers such a large amount of material, but that's also the biggest problem I had with it. If you want a broad overview but aren't looking for a deep understanding of any one particular thing than this is a good course. The expectations aren't unreasonable, but that doesn't mean it's easy.",
    "The main strength of this course is its structure. The topics of lecture build on top of one another and are clearly provided. The weekly problem sessions and problem sets align well with what we learned in class, yet still allow us to explore the topics further. The TAs (Anna and Scott) are incredibly helpful, accessible, prompt, and know the concepts students tend to be confused about well. A weakness was probably not knowing the information that would be covered on the exam\/the breakup of the questions sufficiently ahead of time. Also, I would have liked for there to be an opportunity to go over the midterm questions at some point before the final.",
    "The strengths are that the material is really interesting, the TAs are good, and the kids are all bright. The weaknesses are that the lectures are sometimes hard to follow and the GR material needs another textbook (other than the notes) to support it. I felt like I never learned the material until a few days before the test.",
    "I think the biggest strength in the course is that we got to see topics of physics that aren't normally covered in a freshman-level course; being able to study them was really cool. I think the biggest weakness of the course was that because it was meant to be more of an overview, sometimes it felt like there was more breadth when I would have liked there to be more depth.",
    "While the material was interesting, the structure of the general relativity section was often confusing. Professor Baltay chose to prove general relativity using a different method than most other general relativity textbooks so the TA's were not able to follow his proofs to help the class understand. It was also such a large amount of material that it would have been helpful to have a more detailed study guide for midterms and finals.",
    "The course is good in providing a rapid overview of important fields of modern physics. Weaknesses: little focus was on actual problem solving and creativity, and ways to approach new problems in physics. Some changes that could be made in this regard: have a greater variability in the scope and difficulty of problems, and have a formula sheet on the exam so the exam is focused less on memorization but more on actual understanding.",
    "This was a very strongly taught course. Most of the notes come directly from an introductory General Relativity manual written by Professor Baltay, so there is a direct reference for all of the material learned in class in the event of confusion. This class was challenging as we had to learn a whole new notational system in order to understand General Relativity, and sometimes both the instructor and the textbook could get sloppy with notation; however for the most part everything was crystal clear!",
    "Problem session definitely helped loads, and meeting with Anna outside of class. Often during lecture I would be very lost and zone out because derivations were so involved and at many times hand-wavy. A lot of it didn't make sense until the very end, but when we got there, it was very cool. Baltay is pretty intimidating which would deter me from asking questions in class.",
    "This course is fantastically put together. The way everything follows logically from starting with electromagnetic radiation creates a cohesive and well-taught class. It serves as a great intro to modern physics. The material is invigorating and exciting.",
    "You learn a wide range of stuff but the lecture format and Baltay just going over proofs and derivations in class is not very interesting or helpful to learning"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "For those interested in the physical sciences, YES. Otherwise, NO.",
    "Without a doubt! It's fantastic and Baltay is a one of a kind lecturer.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, but only if you're really interested in physics and have a strong math background. The material is incredibly interesting, but due to the math required for it (such as tensors), you won't really understand what's going on most of the time. The psets don't take a lot of time (maybe 3\/4 hours a week average), but be prepared to spend tons of time cramming before exams. Utilize office hours the TF's are amazing and it's much easier to understand material when you can ask questions.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student if they have already taken Physics 260. Although it is more challenging than Physics 260, the material in this class is simply more fun and interesting. The quantum mechanics sections in the textbook are fairly easy, but general relativity can be quite confusing at first. Overall, a great physics class.",
    "I would recommend this course as long as the student had a very healthy interest in both math and physics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is seeking a solid basis in physics.",
    "If you've taken 260 and want more physics, then yes. I certainly think I had a better experience with 261 than I would have going to 201. On the other hand, if you aren't that interested by physics, then this class will be incredibly hard and boring.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only to someone who would be bored in a traditional physics sequence. You'll cover a lot of material but in doing so it's assumed you already have a string grasp of the fundamentals.",
    "Absolutely - if they are interested in physics and theory in physics. The class (both semesters) covers such a wide variety of topics without sacrificing depth.",
    "I would recommend it if they have the mathematical background \/ are looking for a class where you accept that you won't understand everything the first time around and have to teach yourself some.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in physics. It was really cool to be able to study quantum mechanics and general relativity for the first time.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has a strong background in physics and wants to be challenged. However I would absolutely recommend attending office hours.",
    "I would recommend this course for those looking to gain a broad introduction of general relativity and quantum dynamics. The course can sometimes feel overly focused on memorization of formulas, rather than in depth understandings of the material and application of knowledge to challenging problems.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in physics! While the course material is challenging, it's also very interesting and relevant to physics theory that is being developed currently by researchers. The workload is not too heavy, and the TAs are extremely helpful, holding office hours, weekly problem set sessions, and multiple exam review sessions during midterms and finals.",
    "It was incredibly rewarding at the end to go through all of general relativity and tensor analysis and realize how much I understood; at the same time, I still left the class wondering if I really grasped the topic. The time needs to be put in in order to understand and appreciate the concepts, but if a student is interested enough in learning quantum and gen rel, then I would recommend it. It's very cool to see how equations describing gravitational radiation and electromagnetism can be derived from tensor analysis.",
    "Yes, if you're really interested in physics and willing to put a great deal of time into studying",
    "Take Physics 261 if you're on the fence about being a physicist: this is the stuff most modern physicists focus on. It's a great continuation of 260 (and even a bit easier).",
    "Yeah, you will end up learning a lot of interesting stuff and baltay is funny"
