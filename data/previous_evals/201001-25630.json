    "This was literally my fantasy course: two distinguished NY Botanical Garden systematists teaching a course with a field trip to some of the most botanically fascinating regions of Costa Rica. The skills I gained for this class are totally applied and I will be using them starting this summer and for the rest of my life hopefully.",
    "The School should consider this course as integral to its other \"tropical\"-related courses. It is also important to increase the number of students going on the spring field trip. In the end, 'feeling' the course in real life in my opinion, is critical to the overall competence of the student. I also wish to suggest that a few out-of-classroom fieldtrips in addition to the Costa Rica trip be added to this course to give students the opportunity to put 'mental' pictures of plants in the field to the theoretical concepts learnt in class.",
    "Question 10 -I think this is an incredibly valuable course and many students were very interested in taking this class this semester. I would love to see it offered each year - this is the only class for identifying plants in the tropics.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester, hands down. The instructors are amazing, and even though they know so much, and mostly deal with students at the advanced level, they were extremely patient with us beginning botanists. The two instructors make an excellent and very effective team, and it seems like they had a good time with us as well. While I enjoyed all my classes this semester, this was the one I looked forward to, and the one where I saw the steepest learning curve over the semester, and the one I wish would just continue next semester. While the final was harder than I expected after having extensive practice during the field trip, I still feel like I now have the tools to venture out into the tropics by my own, and I'm thrilled!"

   "comments": [
    "The field trip, but the whole class was excellent.",
    "I very much enjoyed the guest speakers. They were relevant and discussed current themes in their fields. I believe this is a core of the course and the amplification of the topics occurred due to the contrasting opinions that they brought for discussion.",
    "The trip to Costa Rica was really great but it's tough to retain when you get back to New Haven. Repetition is key, but when you get back to campus it is hard to do.",
    "The professors, the TA, the field trip.",
    "The emphasis on being able to group plants in families. This in my opinion is helpful for field work",
    "The field trip. It was great to have constant access to the instructors in the field too, as they are such a source of knowledge. That really brought the material to life, though it was a bit awkward and unsatisfying to return to powerpoints after seeing everything in situ!",
    "Both instructors were fantastic. They brought in samples each week, patiently answered our numerous questions, and were amazing hosts on the Costa Rica field trip.",
    "The instructors, the TA, and of course the field trip - amazing. Also, even though I'm still not sure I understand any of the criteria in picking students, the instructors managed to pick a great group - that was by far the most harmonious and least dramatic group trip I've ever been on, thanks also of course due to excellent organization by the instructors, and their refusal to get upset about anything."

   "comments": [
    "There needs to be more botany classes available to F&ES students. This class is great, but we need more opportunities.",
    "The class is as good as it can be given that we don't live in the tropics. Many thanks to NYGB!",
    "A trip to NYBG should have happened.",
    "A first part (2 weeks) perhaps, of \"knowing your identification terminologies\". The first week could be classroom-based and the second week one with live plants to enhance the student's understanding of identification exercises.",
    "Students did a really impressive job about organizing outside of their own class times to construct keys and review traits. It would be better if this was formalized as a section, so the material could really sink in for the whole class. I know that the 1 day a week is necessary becasue of the instructors' commute, but the TA was perfectly competent in leading the review sections, and could maybe in future courses be tasked with running a formalized section for an hour each week to help the material stick.",
    "It would be great, if after each test - the teachers could go to each plant sample and let us know what the answer is.",
    "I think it might have been helpful to have weekly small assignments - like research and description of one genus chosen from one of the families discussed the previous week. I don't think we'd need much feedback from the instructors, but small assignments like that might have helped me sit down with my notes more over the course of the semester.Also, the only thing I feel like I didn't get any practice in was keying out plants during the field trip. It might be helpful for some students to include maybe one plant a day that the students key out using Gentry, just to get used to his keys and his particularities while we had the instructors around to ask questions.Oh and another thing that would have been FANTASTIC but totally not necessary - a field trip to the Garden would have been great, but I guess we did have two weeks in Costa Rica. It just feels strange that we had people come up from NYBG once a week and we never went down there... thanks for making the trek every week!"

   "comments": [
    "Great",
    "They were wonderful and made themselves very accessible!",
    "The instructors are incredibly good and have an encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants. Very good instructors. The TA was extremely helpful and had a very strong knowledge of tropical plants as well.",
    "A+ from the TA.",
    "Great. Instructors were good with emails, even when not present",
    "The TA was amazing and provided hours worth of review sessions before the midterm, and especially to review what we had done during the field trip and then to help us preparare for the final. She was extremely patient, always willing to answer questions, and surreptitiously took the best notes of all of us in the field, which I didn't notice until she went over them when we got back.The instructors are amazing, and had (almost) never-ending patience with (almost) all of us. I was impressed by the fact that they never talked down to us, even though we might have asked the same question every day during the field trip, and failed to remember the most simple facts about a family even at the end of the field trip. They are both very much anchored on planet earth, which is not what I expected from NYBG staff. They were very human, and great to travel with - a lot of academics, including many faculty members at FES, are quite awkward, and don't seem to have that much interest in interacting with students. I never got that impression with these instructors - I think they genuinely cared about us. And, they were a lot of fun."

    "I am interested in tropical forestry so this class was a great introduction to some of the major plant families of the tropics. Very useful. Now when I see families described in academic papers I sort know what they are.",
    "I do field work in the tropics and never have had a tropical botany course on field ID. It was very useful for that, and provided a good basic foundation.",
    "For me, this was a very necessary and overdue introduction into the tropical plant world. I need to work with a framework in my head to effectively learn and remember information, and this class was instrumental in providing that framework. It might not look like I learned a lot, based on the final exam, but I did! I now have a very clear idea in my head on how the tropical plant species I am interested in are related to each other, and it has already made it so much easier for me to retain important plant species and the necessary information about them. I'll get better at the ID part with some more practice... I hope."

    "see question 16",
    "As a career conservationist with greater training and experience in non-botanical areas, i wanted to enhance (at least), amy understanding of the essentials of plant management by learning in a broad sense, plant families",
    "To become more competent in IDing tropical plants in the field- learn more families.",
    "I tried reading books on plant systematics to learn this on my own, but I really needed a full course, over a semester, where I would be forced to engage consistently with systematics, characteristics, and ID techniques. This class is unique at FES - I actually came out with a skill - and teaches information very hard to find in other places. I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to take this class, and am thrilled that it will be taught again next year. I'm not sure what I would have done if I hadn't made it into the class - I'd probably be wandering around the Marsh Botanical Gardens with a copy of Judd and some flashcards, alone and totally lost."

    "Yes, and I learned a great deal...though it was much harder than I thought it was going to be. The one thing I hope they keep in mind in terms of grading is that the range of ability varies greatly - people are all beginning at very different places, and I know this makes it difficult to teach - but they did very well.",
    "Yes, this class got me up to speed quickly with the botanical terms I needed to know. I now feel comfortable with botanical terminology and the process of identifying and categorizing tropical plant families. DON'T take this class if you can't go on the field trip! I don't think it's worth it if you do because you never truly get immersed in the plant world unless you do.",
    "Yes",
    "For the most part. the course was very humbling in terms of how much work and practice is required to be competent at plant ID.",
    "I had very high expectations of what I would get out of this class, but I still think they were more than fulfilled - and the class was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. There was always enough random information about what kind of habitat a family was likely to occur in, or other small facts, so the class was never dry, although there was a lot of information presented inshort amounts of time. Plus, the instructors were having fun (it seems) and that helped make it not dry."
