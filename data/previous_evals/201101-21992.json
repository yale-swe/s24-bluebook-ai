    "Its simple but useful. Tedious at moments but if you want to learn basics that can be helpful go for it.",
    "the most basic music theory class.",
    "This class is the perfect introduction to music. I had a bit of experience coming into the class, so I felt it a little tedious at times, but I did end up learning a lot. I would recommend it if you have some experience and want to learn how to better read music and improve your ear training skills.",
    "Definitely take this class because creating the compositions was a joy and a great and productive distraction from readings and p-sets.",
    "This class will teach you how to read music and sort of become comfortable with basic music jargon. Very worthwhile if you have lots of friends who are music majors, or if you are interested in any sort of musical anything (a capella, an instrument, etc.)",
    "The course was a solid introduction to music theory, beginning with rhythms and beats, working through the staff and notes, and going through chords and simple progressions, inversions, and harmonies. I thoroughly enjoyed the class, and am extremely happy to now be able to read sheet music! Absolutely recommend.",
    "This is a good course for anyone who has little familiarity with music or knows nothing about music theory at all. It can be a little dull due to the repetitive theoretical exercises and the aural practice can be discouraging for those who are not used to listening to music. On the other hand, I would definitely recommend the course if you are interested in continuing to learn more about music in a serious way, because it covers all the fundamentals required for further studies.",
    "Music 110 is an introduction to music theory and composition. It covers the very basics of notes and staff to the major and minor scales, intervals, and harmonic analysis. Lalli stresses ear training more so than other professors, which is challenging but ultimately quite rewarding. The class depends very much on the professor, and take it with Lalli even if it means getting up at 9 am! It'll be totally worth it. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with a passion for music, regardless of experience, though if you enter with no musical experience, as I did, it will be quite a tough class (just take it CR\/D and you'll be alright)."
