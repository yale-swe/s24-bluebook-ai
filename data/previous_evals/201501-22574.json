   "comments": [
    "This course is designed as a lecture accompanied by a helpful section discussion. I would recommend this course to one interested in political science, specifically international relations studies in that field. It is a pretty useful course, overall.",
    "Good introductory course to take.",
    "No. Don't take this class unless you love reading hundreds of pages of various international relation articles a week and can focus when you have a different professor almost every class. The tests are much harder than you would think based on the style, and you really have to put a lot of work into the class. The topics felt disjointed from each other and often from the readings. Section was more about the readings and made going to lecture feel pointless.",
    "A great into class for polysci whether or not you intend on majoring in it.",
    "Really great course, definitely recommend it.",
    "Intro to International Relations is a good course for anyone who is interested in political science or who wants to have a better understanding of the nature of current events. The workload is not very difficult and the lectures are generally pretty interesting.",
    "Definitely a must. Talks about modern day problems that everyone should know.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is willing to put in a lot of time and effort to succeed in this course. I would not recommend it to someone who has difficulty digesting news and history and politics in headlines\/short tid-bits without delving into much depth. Here are some things that I really think worked: - Debates\/discussions in section - Well-structured lectures that follow a similar format - Discussin the general tools for understanding and evaluating international relations before delving into specific cases in modern politics. I Here are some things that I beleive should be improved: - The definition of what a response paper is and what the guidelines for evaluating desperately need to be clearer. - Though the amount of reading doesn't necessarily need to be reduced but students MUST be taught how to read documents of this length properly. - Discuss how to format and structure the writing in general for this class.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student interested in the theoretical side of international relations (as opposed to someone only interested in the history of international relations). Overall, a great class. BUT! If Professor Monteiro gives an example prompt for the midterm and says he isn't going to ask it - study it anyways!! This messed a lot of people up on the midterm.",
    "A solid overview - not worthwhile if you have any sort of background in other international relations courses (having taken a few higher-level IR classes, a lot of it was repetitive), but good to learn about both how to think about IR and what to know about IR from a great lecturer.",
    "Warning: it is no longer a gut. I chose it for an easy 5th class and it was a mistake. You will have to put in work (3 2pg single spaced article critiques). The midterm was graded fairly toughly and the final is 40% of your grade. There are roughly 140 pages of reading each week, but to be fair, they are generally very interesting. You need to shop this course to see if it is for you. This course teaches you the theoretical frameworks to understand international relations in the first half of the course and surveys a variety of topics in the latter half. Monteiro is FANTASTIC. Also funny. Be careful who you choose as your TA. My TA graded extremely harshly which was very discouraging and detracted alot from my class experience.",
    "Intro to IR was a great class if you're interested in this kind of stuff but if you're not then it can be quite dull. I only recommend it if you're considering a major in global affairs.",
    "Course was subpar. I would not recommend it to another student. You may feel like you put in solid work preparing for a test, but the grading is very subjective.",
    "Don't take it normally, because the grading system is so ridiculous. Would be a good course to Credit\/D, because it'd only require like 15 or 20 hours of work the entire semester to pass.",
    "Interesting class and great building block for international relations. Lots of reading but not a difficult class.",
    "There is a lot of reading however a good course. The class focuses on various aspects of international relations, therefore serves as a good introductory course.",
    "I definitely would if they are interested in International Relations. It is not an extremely easy class, and there is a sizable amount of work. If you are truly interested in the topic than it can be a great class.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 111 to another student as long as they are searching for a broad overview of the structure and issues of international relations (which I hope they are in an intro course), especially if it is taught by Professor Monteiro. Also, the advantage to the guest lectures is that they allow you to sample other professors and classes in the department if the major interests you. There is a significant amount of reading, but Professor Monteiro fully expects one to skim through for the important information.",
    "I think this class was interesting if you have no background in international relations, but otherwise it could be a bit slow. I also didn't like the format of having guest lecturers. But in general Idid learn from it, so if you are interested in IR or political science it would be a good course to take. It also wasn't very difficult.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Interesting and Nuno's lectures are very engaging. Although a bit more focused on WW1 and WW2 than I expected in the first half of the course.",
    "Good general course. Not a ton of work. Lectures are interesting for the most part.",
    "Monteiro is great, and some of the material is solid, but the WAY in which we learn the material is very dull and not inspiring. Rather than engage students in discussions during sections or push students to think outside of the boxes with IR issues, this class encouraged students to simply memorize and regurgitate and not think critically about the theoretical frameworks we were learning about.",
    "I though it was a gut. Definitely not a gut! exams were really tough. learned some though.",
    "Every political science major should take this class.",
    "A sampling course on international issues! It was a great overview of global issues and international politics.",
    "The course provides a great taste of what political science offers and is a great beginner course to start you off on the field. I would recommend the course to another student who is interested in politics and world affairs.",
    "Nuo is the man. Take it with him. The course goes over a wide range of topics and gives you a good theoretical and current events foundation in IR. The 3 short papers are kinda annoying but I did get a lot out of them. I didn't enjoy most of the guest lectures, and section was solid (mine was mostly just reviewing key terms). I would recommend the course. It's what you make of it.",
    "This class has a long way to go in terms of content and TF choice before I would recommend it to a friend.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You will learn an insane amount, and it's really interesting. Just keep in mind that the guest lectures are going to be really bad. You have have to brace yourself for it. But Nuno is amazing.",
    "Great lecturer, very interesting content, guest lecturers could use improvement, no longer a gut",
    "A fantastic class that you should definitely take regardless of your focus of study. Not too difficult and not time consuming. You won't need to do everything, but you will want to.",
    "I loved this course. I think that if you want a good base understanding of international relations or even want to go into this field, it is extremely important to take this course. The workload is consistent but not difficult if you balance it over the semester and the readings were interesting. In addition, Professor Monteiro is a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and became a more concerned, aware global citizen because of it. The case studies were kind of all over the place, and I would've appreciated more unity, more flexibility, and a lot of more application to the modern news everyday - but overall I really learned a lot. Nuno was great.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 111 for anyone interested in learning whether Poli sci is something they would like to pursue further. PLSC 111 gives a very broad overview on the topics of IR, a very varied, yet superficial discussion of these topics.",
    "Good course, I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. Solid introduction to the jargon and theories of international relations, intense historical analysis, and if you have a good TF and section, you also apply them to the modern context. Professor Monteiro's lectures are jam-packed with information and super sassy--they're the soul of the course, so I'd say if you're not going to come to lecture, don't bother taking this. Interesting and well-selected readings, not necessarily because they're 'good' but because they show the range in theories and opinions. Three short and fun-to-write reaction papers for the semester, plus midterm and final.",
    "This is not a gut course. There are a lot of readings (around 200 pages per week) and the tests are not easy. However, this class gives you a broad view of international relations and help establish a good foundation if you plan to major in political science.",
    "Yes! Great course to learn about general topics that will lead international relations discourse for the rest of your lives.",
    "It is a good intro level course in international relations and history of major war. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about communication and world politics.",
    "Amazing lectures by Professor Monteiro, a couple of interesting guest lectures, but overall a course I would highly recommend. You get really great breadth, but also pretty good depth as well.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course, but you have to be aware that it is quite a bit of work. You have to really know the material that the professor gives you to do well on the tests. At the same time, though, he does a great job of explaining it very logically so that it is doable. I would say it's a lot like a high school course where there are specific theories and terms you have to know well. Not knowing them would be really harmful to your grade. Overall, this class is really good if you want to go away with a framework of how to think about various topics in IR and if you want to get a sense of the vast field and the diversity in it. I would definitely go for it but it could be useful to talk to somebody who has taken it to get a sense of assessment.",
    "They graded it too difficultly. The guest lectures sound like a good idea but got real boring. You will have to learn about world wars 1 and 2 for context with I did not find very interesting. The amount of reading assigned is also absurd, and I bet very few people did much of it."
