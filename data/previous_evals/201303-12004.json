    "One of the best small history seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in the subject. The readings are interesting, and Professor Yannielli is great!",
    "An intriguing take on the complex series of interactions between Africa and the Americas ( focusing primarily on the U.S.). I found that the course focused on intersting figures and accounts, with only occasional references to broader processes. We were a small, intimate group so in some ways it made it easier to participate. If you're at all interested in America's surprisingly long and storied history with Africa, check it out. The weekly blogs are manageable, and the final paper is actually surprisingly short for a history seminar. Also, Prof. Yannielli brought in yummy snacks every other week! ^_^"
