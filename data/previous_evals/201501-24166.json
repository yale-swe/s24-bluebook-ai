   "comments": [
    "Getting to take a course with Sarah Ruhl is one of the reasons to come to Yale, if you're interested in theater, or writing, or poetry, or Greek myths, or life. She is a world-renowned playwright who is deeply invested in teaching, and she treats everyone's work with respect and enthusiasm. She also has a way of forming a class into a community. I felt every week that my fellow students were excited to hear each others' work, and that they genuinely wanted to ask questions and help improve it. This is really a once-in-a-lifetime class, and yo should take it if you possibly can.",
    "This is a playwriting workshop that cumulates with a full-length 60-page play in the Ovidian style. You read a play a week on which you write a short reflection paper. You present and workshop about 20 pages of your work twice during the semester. I would recommend this to a student who is seriously interested in playwriting who needs a break from all the structure and realism oriented theatre courses.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who was interested in playwriting. It's formatted differently from the other playwriting workshops offered that I think ti would be a really good opportunity to expand your creative horizons a bit.",
    "If you get in, absolutely take it. Sarah is one of the most perceptive teachers and people you'll ever met. You get exposed to plays you might never otherwise have read (you probably won't like them all) and you get to write your own play. What more could you want? That being said, the whole structure of the class is designed so you end up writing an Ovidian play, which basically means a Ruhl-esque play. If you're not into her theatrical style, or at least open-minded about it, then this class might not be for you.",
    "Take it if you can!",
    "Yeah! But only if you're pretty experienced in playwriting already. There is not much structure in the class; it's more of a chance to workshop whatever you want to work on (keeping Ovidian themes in mind) and push yourself rather than get a lot of guidance.",
    "Wholeheartedly. See my other comments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. But know, it's a workshop class so your experience is in many ways much more contingent on your fellow classmates than on Professor Ruhl.",
    "If you get a chance to take the class, you should jump at the opportunity. Sarah Ruhl offered an idiosyncratic definition of a genre of \"Ovidian play,\" and from there we read a great deal of wonderful and strange plays, all while working on writing our own.",
    "Take it if you're interested in playwriting!"
