    "It is essentially a literature class with a focus on Algerian emigrants. I think it is less work than the standard French literature class, and if you are more interested in politics or current events than humanities, the subject matter will be more engaging. While the focus is on literature, a few articles and films give a little more depth to the class. I only took this class to fulfill my language requirement, and I would recommend it for that. However, I do not think I would recommend it otherwise.",
    "A small class that examines the theme of north african immigration and integration in france. Readings, both scholarly journal articles and novels, which tend to be tedious and not at all interesting.Because of the small seminar setting, you are held accountable for reading.There are very few assignments, however, and are all very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student with a decent level of french. It allows one to touch upon many subjects around the world right now while learning about important aspects in France."
