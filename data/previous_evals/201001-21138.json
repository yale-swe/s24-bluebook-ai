    "I only took this class because I had to (degree requirement), and must say that it doesn't seem too relevant to the research I will be doing. For anybody interested in Logic, and who has taken a course in first order logic, I would definitely recommend this class. After this class you will understand not only what it means to say that first order logic is sound and complete, but you will actually know how to prove that. If you would like to know these things, it's exactly the right class for you. (But if you have a lot of math background already, it might be a bit too slow for you - it's mostly aimed at people like me with background in philosophy and not so much in math)",
