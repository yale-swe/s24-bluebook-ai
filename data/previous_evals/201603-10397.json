    "Wood working and critical thinking",
    "I learned how to operate multiple tools used by woodworkers, including a bandsaw, chop saw, panel saw, joiner and planer, as well as learning different sculpture techniques. More importantly, I learned how to think critically as an artist, and move beyond symbolism to produce art that evoked various emotions.",

    "I learned several new joining techniques. I also learned how to respond to criticism in a productive way to push my ideas further."

   "comments": [
    "great opportunity to practice woodworking",
    "The course provides a very solid base in woodworking technique as well as an introduction to critical thinking in art.",
    "Perfect balance of creative freedom and instruction. Only improvement would be if we could have taken a trip to a museum or studio outside of yale",
    "The crits were more structured than they have been in other art classes I took. Sometimes I appreciated this, but sometimes it felt artificial. Overall I think it was a good idea for an intro art class. The prompts were not too restrictive and as long as you communicate with Prof. Tubergen and the TA about your plans, you won't run into issues. I do wish we'd had more projects. We only had 2 plus the final project and the timing was off. the 2nd project we had several weeks to complete and the final project, only 10 days\/2 weeks. We didn't have a classroom! I found this extremely difficult to work around. We had to store our supplies and finished piece in the shop, risking their getting broken or stolen. We had very limited space to work, compared to other sculpture classes I've taken. This was really unacceptable.",
    "It taught the practical skills, yet there was a gap in how students and professor understood what Art is. And that distance was taken as granted,not challenged."

   "comments": [
    "i would recommend this course to someone who has not used woodworking tools before",
    "Yes. If you are looking for an introduction to art and are fascinated by wood as a medium I highly recommend this course.",
    "Amazing class. If spending time in the woodshop sounds appealing to you and like sculpture and or woodworking 100% recommend. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in making things out of wood and learning more about how to use various power tools and joining techniques. I think I grew as an artist somewhat less in this class than I have in other sculpture classes. But I still had a good time.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to someone like me - I'd never taken an art class at Yale, but found the class to be really engaging, something that I looked forward to every week. I think the setup of the class makes it really flexible - we had experienced students making really incredible pieces of art, and students like me just learning how to use the machines and eventually making pieces we could be proud of. Great class.",
    "Great class, definitely take it if you can!"
