   "comments": [
    "Wonderful class, definitely a gem. The trip is fantastic (of course), but the material is interesting - albeit a bit difficult. Problem sets, reading responses, a presentation and paper make up the grade.",
    "So the class goes to Barbados, but you will be doing geology in Barbados in addition to having fun. Take this class if you have at least some interest in geology\/earth science, not just for the trip. That being said, it's actually a good class to take even if you don't go on the trip--Dave is a really good lecturer.",
    "Take it if you're interested in tectonics",
    "As a non G&G major, I got to learn a ton from this class both from Dave and other students (many of who were G&G majors). The spring break trip to Barbados was definitely one of the most exciting trips that I have gone on. The class is not too much work throughout the semester but can get quite hectic with the final paper at the end of the term.",
    "This is a really awesome class! The spring break field trip is amazing (though be warned, you will have to do work!), and the lectures are engaging. Definitely worth it!",
    "I would recommend Global Tectonics to another student with some geology background. While it is not required, those with more geo experience definitely gained more from the class and were able to appreciate it the most. The fieldwork in Barbados can go all day, and having a genuine interest in the subject is essential to contribute to the class day after day.",
    "AWESOME CLASS! Dave Evans is an excellent professor and you get to go on a cool trip over spring break (This year, Barbados!). The material was interesting and you really get to understand the geology first-hand on the trip. You have a few problem sets and an intensive final paper, but this year it was a group project. You really get to know the professor and the other students in the class and have a great time."
