   "comments": [
    "This is a rigorous course. The bulk of your time will be spent doing audio exercises, but you emerge a much better reader, writer, and speaker.",
    "We review and learn very key grammar. The books and movie based syllabus is effective, and I greatly enjoyed them. We read Le Petit Nicholas, L'etranger, Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du quran, and watch the movies, L'argent de poche and Jules et Jim. Workload was reasonable. Very enjoyable class to start the day off with each day.",
    "Definitely more enjoyable than French 120, if you disliked that you may find your interest in French rekindled.",
    "If it's essential to complete the language requirement, take the class, but personally I didn't like it. There's value in some of the stuff you read (The Stranger in particular), but otherwise I found the work in the course to be tedious and educationally worthless.",
    "A good foundation in French grammar. I would recommend it to improve your French, but would strongly advise against taking it with Professor Vysosias, who is extremely disorganized and unclear.",
    "I certainly recommend this class, I feel much more comfortable with my French after taking this class.",
    "Recommended. You probably need to take it for language, and the french program is strong."
