    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0Alan has a sharp eye and practical sensibility which made desk-crits and group pin-ups typically very productive. I appreciated his attention to real-world concerns and ability to keep the studio on pace with the expected deadlines. Sometimes desk-crits were very short, and the duration varied greatly between groups of students, but I trust that this difference accorded with what he saw as necessary.",
    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0Alan is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable in the subject of urban design.",
    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0Alan has an encyclopedic knowledge and keen critical sense. It was a pleasure working with him!",
    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0Alan was an excellent critic with a vast knowledge base. He always gave helpful and insightful advice, although at times I wished he would have pushed our project in a more radical direction. Overall, the studio was excellent and well organized, and the urban design problem extremely stimulating.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal's studio was definitely one of the most valuable studio experience I've ever had at Yale so far. He spent time to know us well, put in a lot of effort to know our project and intent, and pushed us really hard to get our projects well represented. We were really impressed by how well he timed us. By being demanding and challenging, Bimal has fulfilled his role as an excellent studiocritic. Clearly Bimal has established trust and a reputation for elevating the students to achieve beyond what they expected - all the students from Bimal's previous studio would say the same.I really appreciate that Yale has given the opportunity for young critics to teach at this level of studio. I really appreciated it. I hope more and more young critics would come out of this tradition and teach in similar capacity as Bimal has in the past semester.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal was definitely the best critic that I have had at Yale, and was particularly well suited to the task of introducing a group of novices to the difficult task of designing urbanism.One of Bimal's greatest strengths was keeping our studio focused many smaller, particular tasks week by week as a means of investigating the larger ideas we ultimately had to grapple with in our finaldesigns. The success of this approach was shown most clearly in the heavy emphasis placed upon urban research and analysis during the first few weeks of the semester. Before diving into the complexity of a spatial proposal, we spent a tremendous amount of time investigating the historic, economic, demographic and environmental trends that combine to create the complex context that is Providence today. Despite feeling somewhat behind other studios at the \"quarter review\" in terms of the actual development of a scheme, I think we were actually far ahead of many in terms of having gained a meaningful understanding of the context within which we were being asked to design. The success of this approach was clear in the direct relationship that many of the schemes from our studio had to the city. This connection was forged without falling back on mimetic representation of local forms, materials or styles, so that our schemes often resonated with the context without bordering on kitsch.I would encourage Bimal to allow students to make more productive use of studio time to create models\/drawings and to push forward new ideas. While it was certainly useful to meet as a entire group to discuss our progressing schemes, time spent talking during studio often left little time for design and production. The model making charrette was perhaps a good antidote to this tendency, but I think it would have been more useful earlier in the semester - perhaps the first week after returning from midterm.While the scarcity of our time is always a problem, Bimal's approach - asking us to present what we had produced in whatever state it was in- did ensure that every member of the studio had to be prepared at the start of class. This was a nice contrast to what seems like the prevailing approach in the school, where students fight for the last spot on the desk-crit list, and everything is thus pushed to the last minute in an attempt to create something that seems polished. Bimal was invaluable to students in emphasizing the importance of strategic preparation well in advance of a presentation, and while he pushed us and encouraged us to do more than we could ever have time for, this was never at the expense of the clear communication of an idea.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal was an excellent and helpful critic. He encouraged us to work hard, but also really became involved in our projects. I appreciate his dedication to teaching. And even though I didn't always enjoy having extra meetings with him, because, let's face it we all have so much on our plates already, it's a lot to have an extra meeting or crit during the week, i do think it made my projectbetter. And I really appreciate that he was so often available. I'm also glad he encouraged us to stick to a schedule, even though we didn't always stay on track, I think we accomplished more because of it.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal Mendis is without a doubt the most effective (whatever that means) and dedicated studio critic I\u0092ve had thus far, and from what I gather, almost all of the other studio critics, as well. I\u0092m sure that some people will probably comment that he was in studio \u0093too often\u0094 and that the sheer number of times we met almost seemed to guarantee that there would never be enough work done. And there\u0092s a kernel of truth in that. But I think that, at the end of the day, even having those pinups where clearly no one was 100% prepared were useful and pushed all of our designs further along, faster.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0I found Bimal's approach to teaching very refreshing. The strong focus on research in the first part of the semester lead to stronger, better supported work than if we had rushed into design before establishing a firm position respective to the city of Providence. Bimal also gave sound advice, and my partner and I were able to improve our proposal significantly by testing the options that we discussed during our critiques.I also appreciated that Bimal encouraged a collaborative approach throughout the semester, had the studio work on projects as a whole, and supported the teams of two in continuing to develop projects together. This made the projects more cohesive, and forged our studio into a unified group, even while we were all in teams of two pursuing our own projects.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Great student and practitioner of architecture but has some difficulties as a professor. Has a mentality that is full go and is either extremely productive towards a goal or tough to get an idea through to. Glad to have taken him as an professor and to have had his critique. It made me a better student.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Prof. Mendis was a great instructor. While at first he seemed rather emotionally detached from his students and a little stoic, by the end of the semester he was very encouraging and engaged with the work of the students. He was also very insightful in his observation of how students worked, both as a team as well as individually. This ability made his advice during desk crits and pin-ups extremely useful actually implementable within the design and production of the studio projects. His exit interview was also very helpful to me personally, and the advice he gave then as well as throughout the course of the semester will be extremely beneficial in my development both as a student as well as an architect.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Bimal is a very good studio instructor. He really cared about our work and obviously wanted to help us improve over the course of the semester. That being said, I would have appreciated some more control over my own schedule. I felt that we had too many meetings, especially later in the semester, which took up time that could have been used for producing drawings, models, etc. Studio only counts for 6\/18 credits in the fourth semester, and we do have significant work obligations in other courses.",
    "Instructor: Deborah Gans \u00a0Deborah was a wonderful critic from whom we learned much. She consistently provided objective criticism and showed committed dedication to both our education and our project. She always showed enthusiasm when meeting with us which made us continue to maintain the energy in our work the entire semester. Deborah was a pleasure to have as a critic.",
    "Instructor: Deborah Gans \u00a0Professor Gans did a great job considering she had to step in at the last minute for Keller. She was very engaging and always had provided useful criticism.",
    "Instructor: Deborah Gans \u00a0Deborah was very enthusiastic and engaged in our studio. I really appreciated her energy and criticism, and enjoyed working with her this semester.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0I had a great experience with Ed Mitchell as our critic this semester.Ed was able to identify the students\u0092 individual (or partner group) interests and encouraged us to pursue these ideas. As a result, each project within our group was quite unique and investigated different sets of issues relating to the site. This made for interesting conversations. I appreciated that he was working with each student\/group, in both the conceptual realm and the \u0093realistic\u0094 development of the site, rather than pushing us all toward a similar direction in the site design.I appreciated greatly the respect that Ed shows for his students \u0096 for example, he recognized individual patterns in conceptualization and production, rather than micromanaging our work flows.In other studios, I have felt that the critic was trying to \u0093Beat the personality out\u0094 of my work in order to homogenize the result to a fixed idea of what is and is not Architectural, or worthy of attention. Rather than treating his students\u0092 individual talents and skill sets as handicaps to be overcome, Ed recognized them as assets that can enrich our approaches to architecture.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Ed was an ideal critic for the Urban Design semester. Coming into the class, I did not expect to enjoy working at a city scale; it seemed too nebulous and vast to develop any useful facility with. Ed very smartly chose categorical urban precedents to study, which became extremely useful in understanding the 'broad strokes' of urban design. He criticism was always pointed and highly opinionated, which I find to be a welcome distinction from many of the core critics who may be less willing to commit firmly and explicitly to a single critique. Ed's feedback was useful and direct, but at the same time asked for the student to develop their own approach and goals, not simply adapting their critics. Overall I feel it was a highly enjoyable and valuable semester, and I am indebted to Ed for making urbanism a topic which I now not only enjoy, but feel confident enough to have my own ideas and opinions about.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0The silent reviews were very helpful. Also making the students ask questions during the pin-up reviews made everyone more engaged rather than sitting there bored and not paying attention.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I think that Sunil is a really great critic and I enjoyed working with him this semester. My one criticism of his teaching style is just that he sometimes seemed a little disengaged, while at other times he really jumped in and discussed critical issues with us (there just seemed to be an uneven level of criticality). Overall, I think I learned a lot from working with him and really appreciated his feedback and advice throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil is unquestionably consistently nice. That quality is great in a friend and a person generally and not necessary of much value at all in a studio critic. For one, it doesn't encourage one to work particularly hard. If you drop the ball or excel Sunil's even keel will not budge. I'm not advocating for the culture of patronizing criticism or the model smashing crap which is all to well affiliated with academic architecture. I'm advocating for a well place \"NO!\" or a \"what the fuck? This drawing is terrible!\" Just a couple of those go a long way. Sunil's comments are all too often shrouded behind a veil of academic wishy washy jargon; a well said neutral flow of words. Maybe I'm dumb but usually his crits left me with nothing to go forward with. The only negative thing I ever heard was at the final review. That left me with a really funny taste in my mouth."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't lie - I did my homework and asked about all the 4th semester studio critics' reputation by speaking personally to upper class students. I also talked in person with almost all the critics in reviews and during office hours to get an idea of what I should expect. I had high expectations of Bimal's studio and all of the expecations are met and exceeded. The studio is much more than I could ever hoped for.",
    "I had a better experience in this studio than I had expected. As stated above, I enjoyed having Ed as a critic. My work partner and I worked well together \u0096 it was immensely productive to be able to pick our own partners based on mutual interests and agreeable personalities. With so much common ground, we were able to focus on our design and production without distraction, and our skill sets were complementary. We both feel that we had a hand in every aspect of the project, but were able to take ownership of specific drawings and models. This semester, I produced the first project that I am completely proud of, which is directly a result of the confluence of a supportive, thoughtful critic and a compatible working partner.",
    "I suppose my expectations were to learn what urbanism is or urban design is, I'm still not exactly sure the difference, but I did learn about a city and how research and design can potentially influence its development.",
    "all my expectations were met",
    "A progressive take on urban strategy. Expectations were met.",
    "I didn't really know what to expect from an urban design studio and initiallyI wasn't too excited. However, in the end I found it to be pretty interesting.",
    "My one criticism of the semester overall was the insistence of the critics on studio work. I had an unproductive working relationship with my partner and tried to dissolve our partnership after mid-review but was strongly discouraged from doing so by my critic. I'm not even sure that, had I insisted more, I would have been allowed to. I think that this emphasis is misguided. I understand that group work and collaboration are very important aspects of architectural education and of architecture at large, but I also feel that I didn't get nearly as much out of my semester as I would have had I been working alone.",
    "This studio was a little too chaotic. Too much generic production came out of it. It wasn't as useful as I thought it would be.Also, I think the intentions of the studio and design criteria were not entirely clear. Projects lacked depth and serious-ness.I think my expectations for this studio were not well met.",
    "My expectations were low, since there seems to be a relatively widespread sentiment that the urban studio is forgettable, or \u0093blow-off-able;\u0094 that the stakes are so low because urban design as a practice doesn\u0092t really exist. But I think that the studio, at it\u0092s best, becomes a platform for ideas and speculation, tethered loosely to reality. It\u0092s refreshing after the last couple semesters, where the tether is noticeably shorter.",
    "I expected to learn about large-scale ruban developments, and learn how to work at multiple, radically different scale simultaneously. We did do this- particularly early on in the semester by suddenly jumping to a large-scale model when the urban plan had hardly been established, which was challenging and provocative. The storm water management sessions with Alex Felson addressed extremely important, real-world issues that I was glad to learn about, although the sessions could have been better integrated into the studio work by coming later in the semester and lasting until the end.",
    "I expected to learn abouthow violence and aggressive acts have had an impact on the building and destruction of cites throughout the world, particularly regarding contemporary issues. Given the recent upheavals around the globe, especially in the Middle East and Africa, I was hoping to gain a more nuanced and insightful understanding of the conflicts and their architectural ramifications. The readings, discussion, and guest lectures were great, but the actual assignments were often ill-defined and confusing. The course\u0092s syllabus was given out very late (almost mid-way through the semester), and there was never any formal brief given out outlining the expectations or requirements for the final project. This made the class unnecessarily stressful and confusing, which took energy away from more productive activities.",
    "This was a good urban design studio. I appreciated Bimal's integrated research-design approach."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Everything is there - Plasma screen, plotters - when we need them.",
    "For the most part, the facilities are totally adequate for producing our projects. One suggestion I have is to mount a camera stand to the ceiling or the track system in the basement photo studio, and to provide a laser distance meter for focusing,so we can take straight-down plan view shots of large models. Currently, it is very difficult to do this when standing on a chair holding the camera in one\u0092s hands.",
    "we were making a lot of big models and toward the end it was difficult to find space to put them all and work on them all. Also, the computer at my desk seemed markably slower than last semester, I often worked in the sub-basement lab for this reason. It would also be nice to have two monitors, and I wish the library would let you check out a book for more than a day.",
    "yes",
    "Yes",
    "Please, please, please: give us new computers next year. It\u0092s unforgivable that I decided to come here based partially on the provision of working machines, and then somehow got saddled with computers that most offices would throw away.Also, please ask the DM office to get up every once in a while and fix some problems. It would be nice, for instance, if ANYONE COULD EVER USE THE REMOTE FOR THE LCD PRESENTATION SCREENS. without accidentally triggering the adjacent screen. That\u0092s just absurd, and it seriously effects the performance of a presentation.",
    "The library hours and policies (as always) were prohibitive. The short and odd hours, combined with the one-day check-out policy made it hard to get my hands on two books that I would have benefited from having at my desk for several weeks.",
    "Yes",
    "There needs to be much more space on the school's classes server for studio projects. With how cheap storage space is now, I don't understand why each sudent doesn't have at least a 100 GB of space for studio.",

   "comments": [
    "Most valuable aspects: pin-ups. group research. peer critiques (from 3rd yr students)Least valuable aspects: maybe those group meetings at the \"corner office\" at the beginning of each studio could be shortened or condensed. We also had to meet on most of the weeks 3 times a week, because Monday critics overflowed to Tuesday evenings. We appreciated how much time Bimal has put into the studio, but it also messed up a lot of people's weekly schedule a little.All and all, the \"less valuable\" aspects are very very minor. I'd say this past studio is a high A on almost all aspects.",
    "Desk crits were always very productive and valuable, and I liked how they were highly conversational and allowed ideas to flow. It always left us with a lot to think about and insights about how to refine our site design. The juries this year were very well-selected and perceptive. The midterm was useful in helping us refine our argument toward the final project. We had a thought provoking conversation during our final review, which helped cohere the ideas we presented and gave us some ideas about how to pursue investigations into our interests in the future.The stormwater exercises were too superficial to be particularly productive. That information might be better conveyed with a \u0093kit of parts\u0094 that can be applied to various building sizes and land masses. I do think that some lectures, exercises, and requirements about ecological issues are needed for urban design, but the stormwater lessons (in their current form) are too abstracted and cursory.",
    "The stormwater charrette was poorly organized, and Alex Felson's lectures were difficult to follow without a background in the field. We should either spend the time required to understand water management, sea level rise, and infrastructural systems in a meaningful way (maybe a solid week), or we should remove them from the studio entirely.",
    "The most valuable were the pin-ups and desk crits. I appreciate that we did a lot of research at the start and were able to share it within our group. I wish there was a little more crossover between the studios, more interaction with other critics and their approach to the problem, I felt like this year each studio took a very different path. Also there should be more organization in mapping out the assignments, when they are due, and what the students are intended to get out of them. The brief was WAY too long and confusing and it didn't always feel like the critics were all on the same page. I also believe the TA could take a stronger role in coordinating and possible holding GIS workshops as that was one thing that was very helpful to learn, but we didn't learn it from our TA.",
    "most valuable - desk critsleast valuable - group pin-ups",
    "The most valuable were desk crits and pinups, the least valuable was the initial storm water exercise: desk crits once we had projects developed were much more helpful. Also the \"creation of a public\" sectional model did not have enough time dedicated to it and wasn't very helpful.",
    "I thought desk crits were most vaulable.",
    "Articulation of studio objectives and goals was extremely unclear and lengthy. Needs to be much more clear and simplified.",
    "Working in pairs is interesting but sometimes its not the best.I think that the studio should start out individually and then if people want to work in pairs they should chose to do so - not the other way around.It makes it difficult to split later if pairs were formed earlier and I think that when working in pairs its a little hit and miss in terms of the dynamic and taking control of your education - being able to push your ideas without having to have them collide with another person's.I think this studio would see greater diversity of ideas if this were the case and less churning out of generic nonsense.Also, the more practical schemes suffered in the end in favor of more 'fantastic' schemes. The studio should be clear about what the criteria are (for design).The weeks and weeks of analysis at the start can be cut to about half the time - and the site visit needs to happen earlier somehow.",
    "I think that the water management aspect should have been stressed as something you could either choose to investigate, or something that you decide is less important; what I\u0092m saying is, i think that a lot of the projects this semester turned into boring wetland architecture because the water management aspects were pushed so hard. It just seems pedagogically shoe-horned into the curriculum.",
    "I found the selection of jurors to be excellent, particularly at the final review.Alex Felson was an asset to the studio, although his sessions, as mentioned previously, could have been put to better use later in the semester and provided more focus.The few who worked alone, or do in the future, could certainly use more critic's or fellow student's critique beyond the weekly desk-crits. Toward the end of the semester there was very little communication between studios or teams of students, which was difficult when working alone.",
    "I think the water management strategy should have been better incorporated into the design process, if it wants to be incorporated.",
    "It was helpful to make the large-scale model early on in the semester, even though it was premature. I enjoyed learning about Alex Felson's water treatment angle, but the scientific\/quantitative aspect of it really escaped me and was difficult to grasp after those short workshops. I think it may be necessary to encourage the ideas inherent in the \"best management practices\" for water treatment rather than to have us use spreadsheets and actually calculate it.",
    "Most valuable - small pin-ups (2 or 3 teams)Least valuable - studio wide pin-ups- certain professors outside of the student's own critic had markedly different approaches to the studio and it realization so their advice was often not as helpful or focused on the goals, design ambitions of a particular student teamProf. Felson was also a nice touch to the studio and his advice was very helpful for many teams. HIs storm water lectures were also very interesting, but I think the studio as a whole could do without the hypothetical exercise. I was too hard to incorporate them successfully into projects with such an abstract exercise. More focus on the larger concepts and their implementation and less on the specific numbers would be better.",
