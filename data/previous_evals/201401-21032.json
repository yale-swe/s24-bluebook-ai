   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course but definitely be ready to pay attention.",
    "definitely take this course, and take great notes.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this to another student.",
    "Clear and concise lectures, minimal workload (no homework or required reading), and a vast range of interesting topics. If you're interested in microbiology, definitely take this course!",
    "Microbiology is a rigorous and engaging class that does not require very much background knowledge of biology or chemistry. It is by no means a gut - to do well one must attend lecture and review the material at least a few times before the exams. The textbook readings are also essentially optional but do help in solidifying one's understanding of the lecture material. But the exams themselves are very reasonable in their content and level of difficulty and expectations, as reflected by the midterm averages, which were about 85%. The final exam was also quite reasonable.",
    "Great upper level MCDB course. Only 3 tests decide your grade, so stay on top of the material. Both lecturers are wonderful and very competent. The course material itself is fascinating-- microbes are so cool!",
    "Interesting course. Keep up with lectures. Genetic screens are really important. Extra help is probably necessary since lectures can be unclear.",
    "Honestly, I'm not sure. It just depends on your ability to hang with the course despite the change in lecture style. Good news is that the material is all really interesting! There are only two midterms and one final as far as assessments go, so you'd better do well on all three. Not sure if it's curved at all and for that, I'm nervous about my grade.",
    "Microbio is extremely interesting and covers a very wide range of topics. I learned a lot and while Professor Bascom-Slack isn't quite as good of a lecturer as Professor Jacobs-Wagner, they both did an excellent job. Grading is quite harsh on the midterms.",
    "A class that will teach you an incredible amount about how bacteria work and also challenge you to think in new ways. You will cover more material than you thought possible in a semester-long period, but the most valuable takeaway will probably be methods of thinking about real microbiological problems. I think the class is pretty well-run as well; the divided lectures worked (although Jacobs-Wagner is a much better lecturer than Bascom-Slack), and only having 3 tests constitute the whole grade actually reduced my stress level (most weeks the class required no work aside from reviewing material). I'd absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking to fulfill MCDB requirements or anyone with a serious interest in biology.",
    "Great introduction into Microbiology. If you're looking for a biology elective to take, definitely take this class. The material is often really dry and boring, but the overall ideas in the class are powerful and relevant.",
    "Awesome class for the first half, decent for the second. It's an interesting class with not a lot of work. There are only 2 midterms, non-mandatory online quizzes and a final.",
    "Take it.",
    "Overall, I would recommend taking Microbio. However, I enjoyed the first half of the class with Prof. Jacobs-Wagner much more than the second half with Prof. Bascom-Slack (although this may just have been because I am more inclined to enjoy cell bio-related material more than evolution\/communities\/etc.) The workload was easy since there were no psets or quizzes, just midterms and the final.",
    "Good class - I learned a lot. A good amount of work though.",
    "All based on lectures, but the grading is very difficult. They are nit picky about wording etc.",
    "There's basically no work or assignments besides the exams. Topics include genetics and molecular biology of bacteria, evolution, pathogenicity, viruses, and metagenomics. It's not too hard and is a fun and light intermediate bio class.",
    "This is an excellent MCDB elective. Definitely worth taking after cell biology. Not too much overlap with other bio classes I have taken, which is good. The course has two midterms and a final, so if you want more evaluations along the way then perhaps look elsewhere. Since microorganisms are the most abundant life on the planet it would seem silly not to spend at least a semester studying them!",
    "I loved this class, and would recommend it to any student with even a mild interest in microbiology. It's definitely not a gut science course, but I promise you will be happy you took it!",
    "Like most high-level MCDB courses at Yale, this class is difficult if you don't have a strong background in science. I would recommend taking intro biology and biochemistry before taking this course. The material seemed to come much more easily for others in the class who had that background.",
    "MCDB 290 is a very standard MCDB course. I was a bit disappointed because this course focused more on how our basic biology knowledge could be applied to microbes than microbiology itself. I wanted to learn about interesting microbes and how we use these microbes for our benefits (e.g. bioremediation). These topics were covered briefly, but I wish the instructors would change the curriculum so that we can learn more about microbiology."
