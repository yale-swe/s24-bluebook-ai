   "comments": [
    "Would not recommend. I never felt like there was a cohesiveness to the course or like there was a set method of study or a defined analysis for the class. We \"talked\" about corporations being unethical and we talked about some of the things the professor said corporations did to obfuscate their questionable business practices, but the only conclusion that was ever made (and was made very quickly in the course and always repeated) was that external reporting systems were required to ensure that corporations were ethical. We never talked about how that could come to fruition and we never talked about any standards that we should hold corporations accountable to. There was no talk of how we might arrive at normative imperatives for corporations, where those would come from, etc. I feel like we were talked at for a semester about the professor's observations in the field. I rarely felt like I knew what the objectives for the day were or what was expected out of the students' work as a result.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in corporate social responsibility. Understand, however, that it's mainly lecture. Not much discussion. This can be good or bad. It definitely doesn't encourage you to read.",
    "Make no mistake: this is a weird course with a weird professor. Sethi will not even know your name by the end of the semester. And the name of the course should be \"Corporate Social Responsibility in a Globalizing World,\" given the main thrust of the material, but there are several weeks of seemingly random theoretical papers about business ethics thrown in at the beginning. There are no class discussions, just often-insightful and even-more-often-random lecture\/ramblings from Professor Sethi about how much of a mess the world is today.I was very surprised to realize at the end of the course, though, that I had in fact learned a good deal. You get a very good framework for understanding how corporate conduct is regulated in the modern world, how NGOs are a part of that work, and how governments are a part of it. The course really helps you critically judge whether certain corporations are acting ethically or not, and helps you understand why certain regulatory frameworks do or do not work. This subject had always been rather abstract to me, and Professor Sethi - who has worked with an NGO in this field for years - made it very concrete, especially by bringing in guests from CSR departments of a few companies.Ultimately, verylittle work: readings are almost entirely optional (and are only about 50 pages if you do them), and it's just one short paper, one substantial take-home midterm, and one substantial final paper.Be ready for a very bizarre experience, though. Assignments will appear and disappear, and due dates will suddenly not exist anymore, only to sort of exist again towards the end of the term. And it will be a lecture in seminar format.",
    "Don't ever take a class with Prof. Sethi. He is unorganized and inflexible. The class was not a seminar, but a lecture on why MNCs are bad and why he is right. He was not interested in student discussion and barely permitted it. He did not tell us when assignments were due or what readings were due which weeks. By far the worst class I've taken in seven semesters.",
    "Sethi knows his stuff very well, and has a great sense of humor. Tends to be a lecturer more than a seminar leader, but you get good content. Sethi has an open mind.",
    "This class is interesting if you are really into learning about globalization from a critical point of view. Class can sometimes feel like a 2 hour lecture, and the readings hard to get through.",
    "Don't take this. I learned very little, and Professor Sethi essentially believes that there are very few ways for businesses to act ethically. There is no debate in the class about where to draw the line between ethical and unethical business behavior; instead, you just bash business and bash the ways that they supposedly enact \"corporate social responsibility.\"Then again, there isn't a lot of work.",
    "Not one of the best classes I've taken, and not one of the worst. Professor Sethi is very knowledgeable and experienced in his field, but despite that, I didn't feel that there was a great classroom experience. He treated most of the class as a lecture rather than a seminar, so we rarely got a chance to discuss the readings or issues at hand, or at best discussion was dominated by the few individuals who spoke up a few times throughout the semester (though this is also somewhat my own fault for not speaking up as much as I could have). You don't really need to do most of the reading to get through the course, but randomly some days the readings would get mixed up and on days I did prepare for discussions, we ended up often talking about another day's readings, which made for a confusing and unfulfilling seminar experience overall. However, it is interesting if you take the time to make the most of it -- we covered issues in globalization, MNC governance, trade codes, ethics codes, etc. and it opened my eyes to a subject I didn't know specifically much about before."
