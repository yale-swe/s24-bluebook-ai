   "comments": [
    "This is a good course if you're interested in applying biological techniques to a wide range of industrial applications. The material is new and you mostly end up reading a lot of papers, which is good practice.",
    "If you need an upper level elective, I would recommend this class.",
    "This class is okay. Some of the subjects are interesting but it's fairly disorganized. It seems to not have a coherent message and progresses in no sort of orderly fashion. The content is really not tough but it's made harder by the lack of coherence of course materials. Hopefully they improve organization and then the course will be really great! There really is some fun stuff and a lot of really cool guest lectures.",
    "Interesting lectures, difficult tests",
    "Good class to take for an upper level MCDB requirement. The material is very interesting and up to date, and you are exposed to many different areas of research. This is perhaps one of the most applicable classes in terms of learning what to do for research, and if anyone has a particular interest in research involving complex machinery or are just interested in the progress of scientific research, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes! Next to Cell Bio, this is one of the best bio classes I have taken at Yale. You get to see how everything you learn in all of the other bio classes is actually applied to pharma\/ agriculture\/ medicine and more. The exams aren't easy but the workload is manageable. You will gain practice reading and understanding primary literature. A wonderful opportunity to learn from a variety of the best members of the MCDB faculty. This class will make you want to start working in the Biotech field!",
    "Biotechnology is a great class! I haven't taken too many MCDB classes, so I opted to take this one credit\/d which was a good choice. This course really forces its students to think critically about biological methods, while at the same time introducing exciting new technologies and techniques. It made me seriously consider becoming a biologist.",
    "The lectures were interesting, but the test were fairly difficult. The papers were also interesting. Overall, a solid class.",
    "The material covered in biotechnology is incredibly interesting and very new\/relevant. It's a nice course to take senior year as a culmination of all the basic bio background you've taken before. I appreciated the different lecturers and enjoyed the papers assigned every week because they were so new - however, the tests are difficult and the overall organization of the course seems somewhat off. Some of the material that comes later (particularly the Isaacs material) could have been seen earlier in the semester - but overall a great course",
    "Take it if you need an upper level elective or are interested in Biotech.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. The topics were broad and interesting; the lecturers were all good, if not wonderful; the sections were run as journal clubs, which allowed us to learn specific (and often new) technologies that we may not have been able to cover as in-depth in lecture alone.",
    "This class is a great choice to fulfill the MCDB upper level class requirement. The topics covered were different from any other in the major and were very useful to anyone going into any kind of biological or medical field. The tests and quizzes could be vague or challenging, but the lectures were interesting and engaging. There were also a number of guest lecturers from different fields (patent law, pharmaceuticals, biotech entrepreneurship) that added a lot to the class.",
    "MCDB 370 suffers a lot of the problems typical of multi-instructor courses. There is little to no communication among lecturers, leading to an often frustrating repetition of concepts. While sometimes the concepts are mundane, this process does admittedly lead to a deep understanding of broader themes. The difficulty of testing also varies: some instructors pose challenging yet thought-provoking questions, while others simply require arbitrary fact recall. Lastly, the quality of lecturers vary. Despite all these problems, the intrinsic technologies themselves are so intriguing, and they far outweigh the weaknesses of the course. The course setup is ideal, and while long, the exams were fair. Dr. Wolenski makes this course worthwhile. I would take the whole thing again just if it meant I could have a few lectures with him. This course is great for any upper level MCDB majors who want to finally see all the cool applications of the challenging topics they've been struggling to memorize and understand in intro courses. If you're a senior MCDB major and thinking about taking it, just do it. You'll come out with a lot of cool info.",
    "An amazing review of what's out there now, taught by the people who care and invited guests who are making it happen as we speak. A little more coordination among lecturers would avoid overlap, but the important things were brought up multiple times, so it is reasonable to want to hear them again.",
    "One of the best classes in MCDB you could take. If you're at all interested in medicine, research, or industry at all this is a must-take class. It's easy, low key, and a great junior or senior class. This is one of a few classes at Yale where the material I learned in this class directly applied to the real world - I used the material learned in interviews with research firms, biotech firms, and consulting firms.",
    "MCDB 370 is a great way to fulfill upper level MCDB requirement. It's a super interesting field and the information is really applicable in a scientific\/biotech career. Inspiring course and you learn a lot, through a good amount of work. If you're at all interested in biotech, which as a science major you should, you should look into this course.",
    "MCDB 370 should be a required course for all MCDB majors. Unlike other MCDB courses, this course focuses on resent developments in biological research. It is important for all biology students to familiarize themselves to these cutting-edge developments that will be mainstream in several years. The lecturers are all experts in their respective fields and I enjoyed attending their lectures. The workload is not bad at all: biweekly quizzes, a midterm and a final.",
    "Yes, you should definitely the class. Not too much work, fascinating material and a panel of great professors. It really demonstrates which you can do with with biology if you aren't interested in becoming a doctor. I loved the class and would take it again if I could! Tests were manageable, the papers were interesting and the quizzes were also generally okay. Other than that, there wasn't much work. If you need an upper-level credit, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this class."
