   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, it's very interesting and not too tough.",
    "YES. ENTHUSIASTICALLY.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this as a European seminar. Great Class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in WWI. Be aware, though, that some prior knowledge of the war is assumed. This course isn't meant to teach you about the details of the war itself, but rather to look at cultural aspects of the war -- like the role of women, the experience of French soldiers, or the societal effects of PTSD -- in order to bolster students' existing knowledge of the war. Also be aware that this is pretty much entirely cultural history, so if you don't like that, this course won't be fun for you. That being said, this was my favorite course at Yale so far. The discussions were really productive and the course offered an opportunity to look at the war from French and German perspectives, as well as British. The workload is very reasonable, especially for a junior seminar -- a few hours of reading each weekend and a 15-page final paper. If you have any interest in WWI at all, you'll enjoy this class.",
    "Yes; great class, wonderful professor, interesting subject. Take it.",
    "I think this class is definitely a must-take at Yale. If you have any interest in the subject, you will really like this course and learn a lot. Be aware that there is a large amount of reading, but other than in-class discussions, you are never tested on the material.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student who is interested in learning more about World War One -- I took this class while also taking Jay Winter's Europe in the Age of Total War, and the two classes complemented each other really well -- a lo of the readings overlapped.",
    "I would recommend it. An in depth analysis or a rather broad swash of WWI history. We discussed mostly broad topics, but they were interesting and eye opening. Not your typical military history of WWI.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. At the beginning of the semester, I had to choose between taking Cold War with Gaddis, before he left, or taking this seminar--I chose the seminar, initially with some regret at missing Cold War. However, by the end of the seminar, I have zero regret. It is a cultural history, so less about particular battles, etc. Yet, Professor Cabanes is very approachable and helpful. Furthermore, the workload for a seminar is very manageable--one 15 page paper and leading discussion on one of the readings (once or twice during the semester, depending on the number of people).",
    "I learned a lot about the cultural aspect of WW1 through this class. This course was informative as well as interesting. I espcially liked the assigned readings, as they included different voices among those who experienced the war, and also touched on various cultural subjects. This was my first time learning history through cultural perspective, and it was really rewarding and I feel that my understanding of WW1 has been enhanced through this course.",
    "Good class if you're interested in WWI. A fair amount of reading, but the subjects are mostly interesting.",
    "If you know that you are interested in World War I, it is a worthwhile course to take. It covers a wide spectrum of topics. Discussions are largely student-driven and reading-based.",
    "What intrigued me about this course was that it looked at WWI through various, atypical lenses - such as childhood and war and religion and war. The course itself required weekly readings, with one brief presentation on a reading during the semester, and a 15 page final paper. While the subject material was interesting, the class discussion were on the dull side. Professor Cabanes is a really nice person and very intelligent and learned. I'm ambivalent about this class, so I am hesitant to recommend it. It was good, it just wasn't gripping."
