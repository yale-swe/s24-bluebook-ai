    "This class provided a great international overview of various works of poetry since 1950 from England, America, and many other places. I was exposed to several different poets with really different approaches, and enjoyed spending time learning about both significant and lesser-known poets who have shaped contemporary poetry.",
    "I learned a lot about American and other Anglophone poetry in the post-war period! I also learned about how to approach poetry as a form.",
    "Nothing really, but it was just more exercise in poetry analysis.",
    "Basic information about poetry.",
    "This course is a great opportunity both to survey modern poets broadly and to focus more closely on several poets who interest you more deeply. It's also a good opportunity to learn how to write about poetry, and how to approach it generally.",
    "A great survey of postmodern poetry taught by someone who knows the subject welland even knows\/knew many of the poets personally.",
    "Deep familiarity with major themes in poetry since 1950, general skills for reading poetry",
    "This course was a great survey of the poetry and poetic movements from 1950 to the present. In particular, it helped me integrate historical and political moments with the corresponding poetry, and consider the importance of the poet's biography. The course encourages you to think of these secondary ideas in relation to the English department's close reading model, not in opposition to close reading.",
    "I developed a new appreciation for poets of the contemporary era, and gained a new perspective on the age we live in in general. This course also made poetry more accessible for me, because I learned how to dissect and understand it better.",
    "I learned how to read poetry critically and connect it to discussions of history and culture. I learned to think about the role poets play in narrating histories and scrutinizing language.",
    "Writing and analyzing poetry in tons of different ways!",
    "I gained a great understanding of late twentieth century poetic trends and topics.",
    "-I read poetry from a variety of eras and movements, including poetry in forms that I was not familiar with (e.g. ghazals) -I became well-informed about the lives of several important poets. The background information we learned about them informed our readings of their work -I also learned a lot of super interesting anecdotal information by reading up on the allusions in the poems we read! -I now have one of my favorite poems memorized, which is pretty cool!",
    "This is a great, if somewhat standard, survey introduction to the major poets of the era. Professor Hammer is great and the work on the syllabus is so, so, good!",
    "As its title indicates, this class introduced me to contemporary Anglophone poetry. It offered an in-depth examination of American poetry by drawing from the various schools and movements, while also providing a general overview of non-American Anglophone poetry from Ireland to the Caribbean. The course also developed my ability to analyze poetry especially in thematic and political ways. While attention was given to form, the class concentrated on linking poets to one another and to concerns in the world at large. This concentration allowed me to expand the range of poetic analysis that I feel comfortable doing.",
    "I developed an elementary knowledge of a number of influential poetic works and a deeper knowledge of those works which I wrote about in my papers, as well as a general appreciation for the functions of recent and current poetry. Having finished the course, I believe that I have developed the intuition to respond authentically to any poem I might come across in any of the styles we discussed; some styles that I used to find obscure and inaccessible I now find easily accessible.",
    "A survey of major poets (mostly American and British, though some international, particularly towards the end of the class) since 1950.",
    "Really interesting to learn about the friendships between poets since 1950. Evolution of modern and post-modern poetry, sound, rhythm, puns, pride of identity in work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the lectures felt a little disorganized in terms of the poems that were covered, but in general the syllabus was diverse and the semester covered a lot of time, space and materiala great survey of modern poetry.",
    "I loved this course as it is!",
    "Weakness is Hammer's lecture. He goes off topic all the time.",
    "Strengths are Hammer's interesting thoughts and accessible style. Section is useful though, as always, TFs should be more demanding and use the knowledge they have rather than accepting everyone's opinion.",
    "Strengths: A great survey of 20th-century English poetry, excellent diversity, etc. Weaknesses: It covers so much content that a lot of great poets get short shrift. Might make more sense to read only one poet a week, rather than two.",
    "Professor Hammer's enthusiasm about the content was amazing, but the class was a bit disorganized and didn't have much feedback or support.",
    "The only weakness that comes to mind is the midterm exam (a set of in-class, close-reading short-answer questions & identifications in 50 minutes). This class seemed to teach the benefits of careful, close analysis, but with only eight minutes to write on and read each given passage, the exam seemed somewhat counterproductive.",
    "The first half of this course (Bishop, New York School poets) was definitely more interesting than the latter half. I felt the second half of the course lacked the same sense of direction and message with relation to history, society, politics, etc.",
    "This is one of the best of the 30ish courses I've taken since coming to Yale. The lectures and workload are well-paced, clearly designed by a professor who has been doing this well for years. The syllabus is also phenomenal. Prof Hammer shows you how dynamic and diverse the genre of \"English-language poetry\" really is; his course gives attention to poets who have been unjustifiably sidelined in other courses on contemporary poetry. Wouldn't change anything about the course.",
    "I think the format of the class was perfect, with lecture to give an overview and section to look at specific poems in more depth. Professor Hammer has a particularly perceptive and insightful style of lecturing that lets you see the broader synthesis of ideas across time periods. One poet per class meeting or two class meetings was a good pace to give both breadth and depth. I actually think having three papers may be an improvement, because it takes some practice to write prose about poetry and this would allow for more feedback (perhaps instead of the midterm exam, which always feels like a less-intuitive way to understand literature).",
    "Prof. Hammer is a wonderful lecturer and was completely unscripted, which made it very organic. Nevertheless, he always stayed on track and made sure the class had a logical flow. Its only weakness was that sometimes deadlines and topics were not announced in enough time, which left me scrambling a bit at some points.",
    "The course provides an excellent survey of modern poetry, covering a breadth of poets in detail. Professor Hammer is an excellent lecturer and reader who considerably deepened my appreciation for the poets on the syllabus, and poetry in general. It might have been nice to have more historical readings on the syllabus to further contextualize each of the regional movements we discussed.",
    "The instructions for the papers were a bit confusing",
    "Amazing curriculum - I felt like lectures couldve been better organized even though I loved Professor Hammer.",
    "The strengths of the course are certainly Professor Hammer and the awesome syllabus. Section at times felt somewhat aimless and writing feedback was often not provided.",
    "Strengths: AMAZING poems, FANTASTIC lecturer, sections are a great opportunity to discuss your favorite works in depth, opportunity to memorize a poem of your choice (which is a really cool thing to have in your back pocket), ability to write your papers on topics that genuinely interest you... The list goes on Weaknesses: I really couldn't get into Seamus Heaney, but that's a matter of personal taste, I suppose",
    "Strengths: interesting reading, good survey of different poets weaknesses: weirdly formatted lecture so you never really knew what to expect, less focused on growth in your own poetry reading than listening to the professors reading of the poetry",
    "Because the class is an introduction to contemporary Anglophone poetry, the lecture format suits it well and constitutes one of its chief strengths. Hearing Professor Hammer give a general overview of the poets we were reading while also offering a few critical arguments helped to contextualize the readings and made seminar-like discussion in section more focused and productive. The only weakness that I can identify regards the final exam, which seemed superfluous and unnecessary. I understand that its intention is to make us reflect on some of the overall themes of the course, in contrast to the specific analysis called for by the two essays, but because we were limited to 600 words for each exam question, the analysis that I produced felt specious. I therefore wonder whether a better way of tying together the course in a final assessment might be found. Regardless of whether such a way can be found, I do think that the questions should continue to be given in advance. In-class essays, in my experience, are a waste of time.",
    "This was one of the most engaging and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale. The poets we covered presented a variety of styles, stories, and meanings, and Professor Hammer always had plenty to say during lecture. I never previously had any specific interest in studying poetry, but I still found the material consistently accessible, even if I enjoyed some poets more than others. The assignments were all very reasonable and the grading system was very fair, although I wish I could have gotten some feedback on my midterm and final exams. (I only received a letter grade, but no comments.) My only other criticism would be that we read so many poems that we never talked about in class, which sometimes made the reading feel unnecessary. I appreciated the poems listed on the course schedule that we did not discuss, but I think it might be helpful if the schedule specified which works we would be focusing on in class. My TF, Jae Rice, sent out an email to our discussion section specifying what we would be covering in class, and as a result I felt I was able to prepare for our discussions much better. Also, I am not sure if Professor Hammer ever explicitly discouraged students from asking (or answering) questions during lecture, but I rarely saw any students raise their hands and I wished we could have engaged a bit more as a class. I loved when he asked all the class to get up and howl together, and I also think it would have been fun if he added more details like that to add more variety and more engagement to the lectures.",
    "Strengths: you get to read a little bit by a lot of really wonderful poets, and get the lay of the land. It made poetry accessible to me when the genre had often felt intimidating. Lectures were fun. Professor Hammer obviously loves talking about these poets, and is immensely knowledgeable. Weaknesses: Prof. Hammer did an excellent job on lectures about poets he clearly cared about and had studied extensively, but seemed to give a little less thought and time to those that were newer for him -- often women (with the exception of Elizabeth Bishop) and poets of color. That isn't to say that he was disrespectful or dismissive, I just think he could prepare a little more for those classes.",
    "Professor Hammer's lectures were really calming and detailed and very enjoyable. Wish that he would do a bit more of analysis of poems during lectures. Also TF's were great and gave really good feedback on writing. Also loved the format of the final exam."

    "Definitely would recommend this to both English and non-English majors. Professor Hammer is the furthest thing from intimidating, and he creates a lecture environment that welcomes all levels of experience with English and poetry. Highly recommended if you want a survey-level insight on the state of modern poetry!",
    "Absolutely, especially if you're interested in poetry. Hammer is a fantastic lecturer and the class is well designed for student learning.",
    "No Hammer is just a bit loosey goosey.",
    "Yes, just a standard poetry course with great content and a talented, accessible professor.",
    "Yes! The readings are great, and Lanny is an awesome lecturer.",
    "Unless you've already read some of the books and want to be forced to read the rest for your own personal interest, no, not really. I did appreciate the massive list of works we ended up reading, but I didn't really feel like we explored each one enough to get anything tangible.",
    "Absolutely! This course is a great adventure through many different phases of modern poetry. One of my favorite aspects of the class is its biographical focus on modern poets--in addition to the focus on their written work. Professor Hammer is a joy to listen to during lectures. The assignments are interesting, well-presented, and quite manageable. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. One of the great lectures at Yale and (at 50ish students) it does not receive enough attention. You will walk away with a better ability to read poetry and a more empathetic worldview.",
    "Yes! This course would really be an appropriate choice for anyone - for non-majors it's quite an accessible and low-stress way to get exposure to modern and contemporary poetry, and improve at reading and understanding poetry. I'm an English major and love poetry and also got a lot out of it. If you're willing to read a bunch of poetry (and not much else), I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, if they are specifically interested in poetry. This era is often undertaught, and I think anyone with a genuine interest in poetry would find it beneficial.",
    "I would absolutely reccomend this course to another student. Any student, with any background in English or poetry, from a lot to none could enjoy this course. Professor Hammer's lectures are so engaging and were the best part of my week. They are good even if you haven't done all the reading, so it is an excellent class to take with not too much work. Professor Hammer is also incredibly approachable and speaking with him about the essays was helpful and enjoyable. One of the best lectures I've taken.",
    "This course is a great introduction to modern poetry. Professor Hammer is a quirky and passionate lecturer who brought me a renewed appreciation for most of the poets on the syllabus. There's great variety over the course of the semester; you won't get bored.",
    "Yes absolutely - fun and amazingly informative.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Those who are interested in poetry but need a crash course would greatly enjoy it.",
    "Absolutely, for both English majors like myself and non-majors! I deeply enjoyed many of the texts we read, and now count some of them among my favorites. I also loved the opportunity to delve into the histories of the poets themselves and explore their personal lives in connection with their works. The workload is very reasonable, as well; in fact, I had FUN doing every single assignment for this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to majors and non-majors alike. For majors, this course fills a major gap in the English curriculum, insofar as classes devoted to contemporary poetry are difficult to find. Before taking this course, I had had no opportunity to study figures like Lowell, Heaney, or Baraka, for example, in an academic context. For non-majors, this course is ideal for gaining an introduction into both the modes of analysis and the concerns of English and literature in general. Professor Hammer lectures in an accessible way with a bent towards cultural and political ideas, and his assignments have the explicit purpose of developing analytical skills. This class is, in short, a gem of the English major at Yale.",
    "Would deffo recommend. Prof. Hammer is a really interesting guy, which is my favorite quality in a professor. This is a great fifth class, particularly for poetry-minded English majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, especially to those who do not have previous experience studying poetry. I found all of the lectures accessible and illuminating, and I feel that I came a way with an appreciation for the reasons to read poetry in the present.",
    "I'd recommend it as an intro to modern poetry. It's a fair amount of work for a lecture (two papers, a midterm, and a final), but not very stressful, and you read really good stuff.",
    "I would recommend this class to all Yale students. It's an amazing survey of modern poetry but more importantly how to approach modern poetry. Professor Hammer's enthusiasm is really contagious."
