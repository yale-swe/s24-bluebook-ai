   "comments": [
    "I learned how to conduct literary analysis, and how to think critically about society and its people.",
    "I gained three important skills from this course: the first, knowledge regarding the history of refugee studies; the second, a new perspective; a critical perspective; in which I am now well versed in criticizing various portrayals and discussions regarding refugees; and the third, diplomacy in discourse regarding refugees in which I learned that it is equally important to consider and criticize the theoretical framework of refugee policy while considering the practical elements of the refugee discourse.",
    "Insights: sovereign states perform state power through determining the line between normal\/abnormal, refugees as sites of social rupture in revealing the centrality of citizenship to our understanding of the human, visual representations are always to be critiqued, it's important to be self-critical",
    "I learned so much both history and critical thinking about refugee issues! We read in so many genres - sociology, anthropology, straight theory, documentaries, websites, magazine articles - which meant I learned so much about the political circumstances that created refugees and got to think really critically about refugee representation, narratives of resettlement, and the way the state tries use the refugee to stabilize itself. Prof Tran never lets you forget the material consequences of all this theory in the lived experiences of refugees and always pushes you to think constructively.",
    "This is not a class on refugee policy or public health or humanitarian crises. On the contrary, this class challenges frameworks that limit our understanding of refugees as simply passive victims or problems in need of a solution.",
    "I learned how to read critical theorists. I learned a new way to view humanitarianism, not as a congregation of saints but as complex people who make mistakes. I learned the importance of refugee agency and voice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course does a great job of introducing theory to students. The Nyers text is especially helpful for this. The use of the discussion threads on Canvas was great for facilitating discussion and discovering how other people felt about the texts. It would be great if in the future, some words that are important to understanding some of the text, such as \"subaltern\", were defined. I realize that this is used in a lot of theory based classes, but this may be the first theory class many students take and because it is an introductory class, it would be helpful.",
    "The class was amazing, I would not change it. The discussions were highly engaging and the readings were interesting.",
    "Many strengths to list here. The readings, the multi medium forms of learning, tr flexibility of the final proy to ject proposal; professor Tran's availability to meet with students and her focused attentive during such meetings; guest speakers; and likely more. Some weaknesses included: organization of class readings - it felt at times that some readings didn't feel relevant to a particular week's theme. Another weakness was the professor's facilitation of group discussion. I felt there was not enough, which often STuckk with me at the end of class in this feeling of not having learned anything concrete.",
    "Great course, engaging and well taught. Very important issue and there are simply not enough courses specifically on refugees @yale.",
    "Everything in this course was wonderful. I think the primary strengths fall under the different theoretical frameworks we built over the course, as well as the understanding that we always needed to be critical about how we thought, spoke of, and represented refugees. I don't see this course as having any weaknesses--if it were to be taught again, it should be taught just like this one.",
    "I loved this class. It was my kind of random fifth class but it ended up totally gripping me. Prof Tran is a wonderful, thoughtful, and generous professor. The readings are really worthwhile and doable; I think students in the class really did do all the reading. A very self-selective group; you're there if you want to be. And if you care about issues of migration, or if you want to think about neoliberalism and sovereignty, this is a great class for you.",
    "I found the readings exceptionally challenging, which made some of the material difficult to engage with. The syllabus could benefit from fewer assigned pages and more types of sources in addition to critical refugee studies theory. That said, the course is essential for people wanting to work with refugees or on \"humanitarian crises\" because it will challenge your presumptions about aid and crisis alleviation and refugee policy.",
    "I would have liked to have more concrete assignments to better engage with the material."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course. It challenges you to think more critically about refugees and structural realities that \"create\" them. This is a great course for introducing critical theory to a subject if you have never had that chance before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While the topic is refugees, in the course, I learned more about questioning labels and identity.",
    "Yes",
    "yes, take it, especially if you are interested in the topic. Well taught, not too difficult. I enjoyed it despite a 9:25am time slot, which is a rarity.",
    "100% would recommend this course. Be aware that the course isn't so much discussing factual historical, social, political trends as it is a way for thinking through different theoretical lenses what it means to be a refugee. Professor Tran is wonderful, and I am only grateful to have been her student. If you can get into this course, definitely take it.",
    "Definitely! I really loved this class.",
    "I think this is an important class to take regardless of your interest. It would have been amazing to have other voices from backgrounds other than er&m to speak up and explain their thoughts more. If you are at all interested, you should take this class. You will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course you engage with a lot of interesting material, although the class period itself can be long. The readings are fantastic.",
    "Yes! Absolutely yes!",
    "This course is challenging -- a lot of theory and a lot of reading -- but it is essential for people wanting to work with refugees or on \"humanitarian crises\" because it will challenge your presumptions about aid and crisis alleviation and refugee policy.",
    "This is a great course, Tran is a wonderful professor. The readings can be long and dry, and so I wasn't able to give this as much time as I had hoped because I thought it would take alot less time to truly honor the work than it did."
