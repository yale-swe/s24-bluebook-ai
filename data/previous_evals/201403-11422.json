I went to Kevin's TA office hour mostly. In the beginning of the semester, I need to discuss with classmates to catch up what Kevin taught, because there were too many students asking questions at the same time. But after the midterm, I could easily understand what Kevin explained, especially for chemical equations. I think both of us improved a lot after mid-term.",
    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Troy, Veronique, and Kevin were all helpful, clear, and patient. Troy was exceptionally patient and good at conveying complicated subject matter in simple terms. Excellent field trip leader. Veronique was always willing to work through homework problems and truly cared about our understanding of the topics. Kevin was efficient and clear in grading homework assignments.",

    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Great office hours. I made time to go to almost all. Fair graders and great tutors.",
    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0All TF's for this class were great. Kevin was very committed, and I can tell he likes teaching. He clearly understands the material inside and out. Vero was very helpful with in class assignments.",
    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Helped answer questions in class when we were given time to work on problem sets.",

    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Kevin (and the entire TA corps) did a wonderful job of answering questions, facilitating the classroom, and returning assignments promptly with good feedback. Tough job, and they did great.",
    "Instructor: Troy Derek Hill \u00a0Kevin: is patient, and not intimidating. Two essential qualities. He really takes his time and asks several times if we understand and if we would like him to go over something again. He was also very encouraging in terms of sticking with the class. Sometimes it is hard for him to break a topic down for the student to understand. Some times he has great difficulty with realizing where the student is terms of understanding. However once he 'gets it' he does his best to explain from that point onward. If he does not get where the student is coming from he may start explaining from a more advanced point. He can do better to understand first, the point to which a student understands something.",

    "This course covers most of the basic scientific concepts that I'd like to explore throughout the two years. It's very helpful for me to figure out which area I shall dig into in the future. This course also supplement my other courses and reinforce some valuable topics. I've benefited a lot from Shimi's teaching.",
    "Question 8 - I'm a very hands-on learner and learn best (in the most lasting way) by doing or seeing up close. I loved the soils field trip, and would even vote to sacrifice some subject material if it meant time was made to do another very relevant field trip. Questions 3\/4 - This class was very, very well-taught. I would take another class from Dr. Anisfeld in a heartbeat. The workload was heavy, though. I would not change anything about the class, but I would also not recommend it be taken casually and without dedication and ample time.",
    "The concepts learned in this class were very relevant to my interests, but I think the course was more equation\/calculation based than necessary for student interested solely in management.",
    "Q13.Professor Anisfeld is a dedicated, knowledgeable, and caring professor, who makes great effort to cater to his students' learning style. Particularly this year - testing out the Flipped Classroom - he has sought and been attentive to our feedback, and has taken action to meet our requests and comments. I appreciate and respect him tremendously as an educator. Q15.. This is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at F&ES, in part because the information is so applicable and relevant for any path I may take in the future. I strongly think all students should have to take the course if they have had limited or no exposure to all or parts of the course's content.",
    "Very good overview of concepts that will be useful for my career and have been useful in understanding concepts introduced in other courses. I noticed a lot of overlap of content with other courses, which really solidified my understanding.",
    "Shimi's lectures (on-line and in-class) were very clear and followed a logical, understandable narrative, and always fed into and benefitted from the quantitative work on the problem sets.",
    "This course was crucial to my success in every class this semester. Coming from a non environmental science background, I would have been lost in other courses that did not explain the science concepts to the degree that this course did.",
    "Some of my responses may not be reflective of other students' experiences in the course. I came to the course with a fairly solid background in chemistry and physics. For students without math or science backgrounds, the course was likely much more difficult. I did have to explain a few basic chemistry concepts to a few of my friends in the course. It might be relevant in future courses to have a TA offer basic chemistry\/math sessions to students without these backgrounds.",
    "This class was a ton of information and lots of work, but I really enjoyed it! I think Shimi's dedication to the course and the students is what makes this course work. He is an excellent, dedicated, and patient professor. Another professor might not be able to pull it off!",
    "Shimi was a very dedicated professor and really went above and beyond to provide help to students who needed it. It was the first year doing a flipped classroom and Shimi would check in periodically with the class to see how it was going for everyone. He was very responsive to feedback and you could tell he genuinely wants students to come away from his class with a solid foundation of the physical sciences that students will then use as background for more specialized courses in their field. (Note that this answer is in place of subsequent questions as there would be a lot of overlap with my responses).",
    "I loved this course! Taking on the subject matter with no prior experience or knowledge at all was daunting and challenging but the teacher and TAs managed to make it incredibly engaging, relevant to real-life situations and observations, and a joy to learn about. I honestly looked forward to this class every week and felt that I always learned something new that I wasn't going to forget.",
    "#5 Vero - was amazing, but only an in-class and online TA. She was very clear in her explanation. Though sometimes intimidating, she has the ability to sit and explain a complicated topic problem set until you really understand it. I wish I could have had more time with her. Vero was also very very very encouraging.",
    "Shimi was incredibly accessible and helpful. His willingness to help students better understand the material was unmatched by any other professor I've had this semester.",
    "Professor Anisfeld is amazing. His passion for teaching is evident and it makes a big difference in the student experience. He makes this course one of the best I have ever taken as he clearly explains difficult concepts and happily answers questions."

   "comments": [
    "I really benefited from, and enjoyed the in class assignments\/problem sets. As this class was \"flipped\" there wasn't really an in-person lecture component leaving more time for questions and clarifications on concepts during class. While this required students to watch and synthesize the lecture material prior to class, I think that I ultimately learned more from this approach than I would have from the traditional structure. Shimi is incredibly accommodating, considerate of different learning styles, and ultimately you could tell that he really did care about the students' experience and outcomes in his class. Necessary to this class which covers a lot of topics at a broad level, he has a real skill in distilling down the important points and takeaways. I felt that I got an excellent big-picture understanding of how all these fields and phenomena relate to one-another.",
    "I like the flip-classroom setting. As an international student, I don't need to worry about if I can't keep pace with the professor's speaking or try to keep notes in a hurry. I also like the in-class exercises and working problem sets with classmates. Whenever I'm stuck on a question, I can always find helpers immediately.",
    "Extremely well-taught. Dr. Anisfeld knows the subject matter deeply and was able to answer convey complex materials in an understandable manner, all while keeping perspective on the time restraints of the course.",
    "I loved the flipped-classroom approach. The in-class time to work on problem sets with classmates and TAs was very helpful. Online lectures were great, because they provide greater flexibility in when and how you listen to them. Quizzes were helpful to pull everything together and to gage how well I was understanding concepts.",
    "Support for problem sets in class, and the opportunity to work with other students as part of the structure of the class was very helpful and enjoyable. I can't compare it to last year, but I think the Flipped Classroom worked well for this type of class, and found having access to lectures at my leisure to be extremely valuable. Great use of visuals and diagrams to illustrate concepts. The addition of \"main ideas\" (in the second half of the semester) to the beginning of every class lecture was also very helpful.",
    "I surprisingly enjoyed the online lectures. I was very skeptical of the format of the flipped class at the beginning, but in the end I found it to be a more helpful format to learn the material. I also enjoyed the field trip, which helped visualize soil horizons. I really appreciated the amount of extra resources provided by the instructor. They were very helpful for studying for the final and midterm.",
    "Very comprehensive material covered. At the end I feel like I understood how it all fits together.",
    "Flipped aspect, Shimi as a lecturer",
    "The broad subject matter that was discussed was very beneficial for someone like me who had minimal scientific background.",
    "Shimoni was an amazing professor and I found the flipped course format incredibly helpful.",
    "Professor Anisfeld is very helpful and considerate, and the flipped format allows you to learn at your own pace and convenience.",
    "The professor makes sure students understand the course. Great teacher.",
    "Shimi, subject matter",
    "Shimi as the instructor - I also liked the material covered during the \"atmosphere\" section and beyond (I like more big picture, less about the soil chemistry etc.)",
    "The in-class discussions around clicker questions were always enlightening and the fact that we could consider the material from the lectures and then engage with the teacher about them after we had had some time to think about and consider the topics was great. I think it just happened to tie in really well with my learning style, but for me this was the perfect way to structure the course.",
    "Carefully designed online lectures and quizzes, TONS of content presented clearly.",
    "Professor Anisfeld's use of class time and the flipped class format were both very effective. While he can move quickly through materials at times, he is extremely responsive to student questions and concerns and is a very knowledgable and fair professor.",
    "The breadth of the course. Covering the vast amount of topics that we did was great.",
    "It was especially helpful to provide real world applications, especially when doing problem sets, to understand how such work might apply to our career aspirations. Glad we reviewed the IPCC report!",

   "comments": [
    "The flipped-class model has a lot of benefits, but it does require a fair amount of time devoted to the class outside of actual class. There was a scaled-down lecture\/review component of class time where Shimi would go over some material, ask questions, and maybe dive into some new material. I felt like Shimi wasn't sure exactly how to do this, and its format changed throughout the semester.",
    "I feel the course load, such as the video length and reading, is greater after mid-term.",
    "A slower pace and less information would have made the course more accessible to me! I was often lost and overwhelmed.",
    "No major improvements to suggest.",
    "I know some of my classmates requested it, but I felt that going through the lecture slides in class was not particularly helpful. I would have rather spent the time on clicker questions, problem sets, and new material.",
    "Throughout the course Professor Anisfeld adapted to our comments, so by the end of the semester most of my concerns had been addressed. To reiterate them, I felt that some of the quizzes were focused on quantitative measures rather than concepts a bit too early in the course, I would have liked to see more problem sets outside of class, and some of the materials were spread out over different mediums (lecture notes, class notes, reading notes).",
    "Since there are so many small assignments that are graded in the course I think it would have helped to not have graded clicker questions. I often found myself thinking about the clicker questions ahead in lecture instead of listening to the explanation of the previous question. I would suggest to make clicker questions graded on participation instead.",
    "Office hours were sometimes a little inconvenient. More afternoon times would help! Also even though I know this is a science course, some real world applications for jobs in env management might be helpful, i.e. how environmental managers use this information. Maybe at the end of each section (water, air etc).",
    "I would have liked slightly longer or more frequent problem sets (even if they were optional) to drill some of the concepts in further.",
    "The flipped aspect, which Professor Anisfeld adapted and improved as the course went on.",
    "I think a take home problem set at the end of each section (air, water, etc) would be helpful.",
    "I think there needs to be an optional help session for students without chemistry and math backgrounds. I came to the course with a fairly solid background in chemistry, math, and physics, but a lot of my classmates did not and they struggled much more than I did. Rather than simply putting up readings on basic chemistry concepts, it might be more helpful to have a TA offer complementary chemistry\/physics\/math sessions during office hours for interested students.",
    "Slowing the pace a little.",
    "It was a lot of information. I know Shimi doesn't think it can be narrowed at all - but I would encourage him to consider it. That said, I'm not sure what I would leave out - maybe the energy unit. I was glad I had some background in some of the areas the course covered. If I had not, I think I would have been (more) overwhelmed.",
    "Determining how much is the \"right\" amount of material to cover so that students are introduced to a breadth of concepts, but that enough time is spent on any particular section to come away with real insights.",
    "The course could benefit from more field trips. Since we did return to the subject of Connecticut geology and landscape history several times, I wonder if it would be possible to build a field trip around the topic?",
    "So much content! Would love for this to be a 2-semester course. In-class sessions were not as interactive as they could be (more on the students than the professor)",
    "I do not believe the format for the exams (both the final and midterm) is beneficial or contributes much to student learning. They are entirely based on term memorization, and do little to further actual understanding of concepts covered during the semester.",
    "The class is very ambitious in trying to cover the breadth, depth quantitative and qualitative aspects of the topics. Each of these are valuable but challenging to attain. I find myself, now that the class is over, going back through the text book and the material to understand some concepts (of interest to me)more in depth. Integration to Management Skills: I would have liked to see more integration of the understanding of the systems we are learning in terms of how they relate to Environmental Management. Quantitative: I think the class should state very clearly that it is heavily based in Chemistry and Math and that the quantitative aspect is weighted more heavily. That being said: I would suggest a mini intro to chemistry course (possibly lead by one of the TA's) early in the course. Since this class is advertised as a foundations class and should be accessible to students of all academic concentration backgrounds, it should not be taken for granted that everyone has a solid basic chemistry background. The IMPORTANCE of the chemistry and math should be made very clear to students within the first few weeks of class so students can delve into this a lot during the first few weeks so they have a solid grounding for the rest of the class. Problem Sets Having multiple examples of one type of problem (for optional practice) would be very helpful in really understanding the concepts being taught through each problem set. If the amount of problem sets given will remain same, I think there is no need to do such heavy testing on them during the exams. I think understanding of the overall concepts is just as and with my focus even more important (but this depends on ones reason for taking the class). If there was not so much time spent on problem sets I would have been able to go deeper into some of the breadth covered in the class.",
    "While I understand the benefit of covering so many subject areas (to maximize utility), it came at the expense of really being able to understand a few of them with as much depth as I hoped.",
    "I think that the course is too ambitious, the only thing I'd change is the amount of topics we cover. It is hard to internalize all the information.",
    "There were a lot of different pieces with the class - click questions, online quizzes, videos, problem sets etc. It might be good to evaluate which pieces really bolster learning and focus on those."

    "This course gives a good foundation of the concepts that are needed to understand a lot of larger environmental issues like climate change, water resource management and energy issues. Before this class I had a general idea about the mechanisms underlying these environmental changes, but now I feel more confident to read about current research and have a better understanding of their methods.",
    "Not coming from a science background and so very helpful for comprehensive overview.",
    "Great to have a basic knowledge of science when working with environmental issues.",
    "Great foundational course. Will help me with other science courses I plan to take. Also, helpful to get back into the swing of using numbers and performing calculations.",
    "I'm hoping this course will prove to be useful in my future studies, but as a first year, this remains to be seen. Of course I think the material is important, my only question is given the limited number of courses I can take over 2 years, was this one worth it. The intent is that it will provide a foundation to scientific concepts so I think it will be useful but I can't be sure. There should be an evaluation just before graduation that asks which courses in particular were useful so that students can reflect on their time the past two years - or maybe there already is :)",
    "I took it to provide me with a strengthened grounding in the sciences for Environmental Management.",
    "I think this class is critical for every student graduating FES. It's material we will all be expected to know and this course provides an excellent overview."

    "I came to FES to get more of a science background, and this was a great first step. I learned a lot.",
    "To bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and environmental communication",
    "FES strongly recommended taking it, and I needed a refresher.",
    "It had been some time since I've taken a physical sciences course and I think a basic understanding is important for an environmental manager.",
    "Wanted a more formal education in the hard sciences.",
    "Came from a biological science background and was missing geology, hydrology and atmospheric science. I'm glad I had a good grasp of basic chemistry before taking this class.",
    "To get science fundamentals!",
    "I'd forgotten much of the material I'd learned in a similar, less comprehensive course in undergrad and wanted a better grasp of biogeochemical processes.",
    "I wanted to improve upon my weaknesses, mainly broadening my understand of the science behind the way the world works.",
    "I needed an introductory science course, and this class provided that and greatly exceeded my expectations.",
    "My academic adviser recommended that I take it, and I wanted to gain a better understanding of soil science, hydrology, and geology.",
    "To acquire scientific knowledge.",
    "Wanted the background material. Wanted to re-introduce myself to the scientific concepts. I heard Shimi was a great professor.",
    "answered above",
    "Needed to supplement relatively weak sciences background",
    "To learn management skills in some of the topic areas covered. To gain a deeper understanding of the science behind many environmental problems.",
    "I wanted to have a general idea about the physical and chemical processes underlaying the natural problems I'll be facing in the future.",
    "Fill gaps in physical science knowledge."

I gained a deeper understanding of only some of the science in the topics covered and a general understanding of all the science of the topics covered. I was not interested in the skills gained from the problem sets nor the quantitative aspect that was so heavy in this class. However acquiring these skills has already proved to be beneficial in other classes. I expected more applicability (Environmental Management) of the material learned.",

    "If you haven't had a lot of experience in chemistry, physics, hydrology, geology, soil science, atmospheric science, then this class is worthwhile and you will learn a lot. If you have some experience in these fields, you'll have to consider whether the new knowledge or strengthening of knowledge in fields is worth it. I had taken some of these classes before, and I definitely still learned a lot.",
    "No need to worry about laying behind. The quizzes and in-class clicker questions will ensure you are in the same pace with your classmates.",
    "Decide what you want to get out of the course before going in, and focus on those pieces. Also, continuously reviewing the material will be helpful not only for tests, but for fitting the pieces together.",
    "I would advise them to take it if they want to acquire a more solid background in physical sciences.",
    "Form study groups early, and review section materials as you go along. When it comes time for exams there is a lot of material to go through, so it is helpful to continuously review content as you go.",
    "Brush up on basic chemistry before taking this course especially acid base and redox reactions.",
    "It is a fast paced course, but you will learn a lot if you don't have a geological\/physical sciences background. Sometimes you may feel like important topics are being glossed over, so it is important to be thinking about how each of the covered topics are interrelated. I would certainly recommend the course for students who are looking to beef up on their science.",
    "The class is useful and Professor Anisfeld is very helpful and considerate. If you do not have a solid chemistry, math, or general science background, you should know that you will likely have more difficulties. You should try to interact with Professor Anisfeld and the TAs to get a basic conceptual understanding of chemistry and physics concepts that relate to the course throughout the course's progression.",
    "Read everything and ask Shimi if you do not understand something. He is always willing to help you understand. Be prepared to work a lot but learn a lot.",
    "It's a lot of work, and requires weekly work to stay on top of it. But I would take it again.",
    "Get a study group! Ask Shimi lots of questions!",
    "If you have taken courses in soil science, geology, geography, or similar subjects you could probably do without this course.",
    "Take this if you will need a lot of quantitative skills in your future career.",
    "If they have similar interests, they should definitely take it.",
    "Go to office hours!"
