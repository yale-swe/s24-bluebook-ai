   "comments": [
    "An enormous workload with an impressive payoff. Essentially guarantees a Light fellowship, which means an exciting and once-in-a-lifetime study abroad experience. Yale Japanese is fantastic!",
    "If you have ever wanted to learn Japanese for whatever reason, do so at Yale. The teaching staff is amazing, the class sizes are small, the assignments are fun (we watched parts of \"My Neighbor Totoro\" for class!!!), and the resources available for study-abroad are nothing short of unbelievable (I am going to Hakodate, Hokkaido this summer!)! Yes, do expect to have to dedicate a healthy chunk of your time to the cause, but which language is learned in a day?",
    "YES. if you want to learn japanese that is.",
    "Japanese 120 is essentially a continuation of Japanese 110, the course follows the same basic structure of homework and reviewing assignments.I would unconditionally recommend Japanese 120 for a fellow student. It was my favorite class this semester by far. The amount of Japanese I learned is staggering, and I could not have done it in a more enjoyable way.If you keep up with the course material, and pay listening homework proper attention, the written homework becomes substantially easier and the workload seems much less daunting.The teachers are all excellent, the amount of personal attention you receive is unrivaled.Take Japanese!",
    "Yes, take it, if you are very passionate about Japanese.",
    "This course is a fair amount of work and moves at a fast pace. However, if you are interested in Japanese, there are few better places to look and the course is definitely an overall positive experience.",
    "Japanese 120 really helps build on your Japanese language skills. By the end of the course, you really are very proficient in Japanese. It has a decent amount of work, as any foreign language class does, since it meets everyday, but it is manageable and a lot of fun.",
    "L2 was admittedly more difficult...but what you learn is truly worth the effort. Take care to absorb new grammar as much as possible. There is much more vocab in L2 than in L1, so don't get bogged down - make flashcards if you can. And most importantly, have fun! The sensei know how to teach, but are most enjoyable when they're having fun with you.",
    "If you have taken Japanese 110, then you probably will take 120 since it is necessary to gain credit for the first semester. This course is a good continuation of 110, using the next part of the JSL textbook series. The format is pretty much the same, with CC's to memorize for each class and Utilization to do for homework. Kanji memorization continues at a very reasonable 2 or 3 kanji a day. As with the first semester, if you keep up throughout the course, then the tests are manageable. By the end of Japanese 120, my Japanese may not be fluent yet, but has certainly improved tremendously.",
    "If you are taking Japanese 120, odds are you took Japanese 110. It is more of the same, which isn't a bad thing. The teachers are fun, friendly, and helpful. I learned a lot of Japanese this class, and I plan on continuing my Japanese studies this summer in Tokyo.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Japanese and Japanese culture.",
    "If you took Japanese L1, it's the same with a few alterations in homework assignments. If not, take it. There are fun, small classes with great professors.",
    "If you have a lot of time to dedicate to Japanese, go for it.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning the structure of another language. The faculty do a great job of mixing the practical with theoretical grammar",
    "great! be prepared for more work than first semester. though doing the utilizations gets a little tedious sometimes, it really helps you understand the material better in the end. plus the media assignments add a welcome change to the usual homework.",
    "Take Japanese. The professors are great and the fun atmosphere of class makes all the hard work worth it.",
    "Take it only if you actually want to learn Japanese. Cheap language credit this is not. If you want to learn the language and have fun doing it though, you've found the right course to start with. Class will not be as hardcore-strict as chinese, and so somewhat less stressful. However, the workload is actually the same or greater - it may actually detract from other classes if you are not careful since it demands preparation every day. Senseis are all sorts of fun, and your classmates will be more varied than you expect, not just heritage learners and anime fankids.Is it worth the work though? I think so, even if my gpa protests.",
    "Awesome class, pretty similar to first semester. You do watch more Japanese dramas and clips the second semester, which makes it more interesting. Grammar gets a little tricky toward the end, but again, worth it if you're serious about learning a new language.",
    "A very thorough introductory course to Japanese at Yale. Will learn a lot about written and spoken Japanese, even after a short time.",
    "If you're interested in Japanese (read: if you enjoy watching anime and reading manga), take this class. It'll be the best decision you've ever made.Also, because the classes are intended to make you laugh and enjoy the language, make sure you grab enough sleep the night before (seriously!)."
