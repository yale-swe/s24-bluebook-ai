    "This is not a review of the year-long senior essay, but rather of PLSC 490, the required accompanying course.PLSC 490 is pretty much a waste of time. I can see it being helpful in other departments, but Political Science is too sprawling for it to be useful. The theory is that the dozen or so students writing year-long essays can get together once a week to provide peer reviews of each other's work. The problem is that because Political Science is such a sprawling department, there is little shared knowledge from which to work. Many of us had no more than one or two courses in common, and most of us wrote on topics for which the other students had literally no scholarly basis from which to give advice.In other words, this course is no more useful than having your roommates or any other randomly selected group of students give feedback on your paper. A science major could likely have done just as good a job as anyone in the colloquium. This is not to knock the students. It's just that the nature of the course is that it compiles students with no real rhyme or reason, except to say that they are nominally studying the same academic discipline. This, of course, means nothing.Perhaps the department would be better served by splitting up into various units or by having a far more rigorous core curriculum?",
    "It's a good class to hear what other people are working on for their senior essays but I frankly did not find it extremely useful in helping me on my research or writing. The only real benefit that came from this course was the feedback on the one day I presented my topic and the general weekly reminder that I should be working on my essay.",
    "If you are an ambitious student who wants to write a yearlong senior thesis, and would like to have your topic critiqued beforehand, this is the class for you!",
    "If you intend to write a year-long senior essay in political science, you must take this class. It requires almost no work beyond the research you will be conducting for your own senior essay; you are simply required to review a few three-page proposals and abstracts each week from other students, and share your thoughts during class discussion. The most useful parts of the class were the occasions on which we shared resources (contact information for the Social Sciences Librarian, information about Human Subjects Committee approval, suggestions of additional research we'd seen on each others' topics).",
    "Do it.",
    "I would only take it if you have to or really feel you need the feedback. Some would rather have spent those two hours each week on research."
