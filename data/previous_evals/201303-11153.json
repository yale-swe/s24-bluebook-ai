   "comments": [
    "Yes! Theresa's class is the best German language class I've taken. Her teaching style is wonderful, and her curriculum is very solid.",
    "I would recommend it if they feel they have enough time and energy to put into the course.",
    "German 130 (especially with Theresa, who is the very best of the instructors) is a fine extension of the first two semesters of German at Yale. The class is more focused on building writing and speaking fluency than learning new grammatical forms or memorizing vocabulary, and as such, there are more speaking assessments and longer formal essays, but everything feels helpful and useful to actually building comfort with the language. In terms of workload of the class, there are always a lot of small pieces of things, so the workload never seems overbearing but is very persistent. It is important that you can stay on top of twelve or so deadlines per week, between online homework, class preparation and textbook exercises, discussion forums, exchange activities, journal entries, mini-projects, online speaking assessments (\"audio dropboxes\"), and essays and tests. The textbook, Stationen, is no where near as helpful or easy to follow as the book from 110-120, but we used it less frequently as a result. The mini-projects in class, and the group video project at the end, still exist and are more work than the education value we derive from them. Still, in spite of these drawbacks, this is a fun and engaging class in which we learned a lot, all became much more natural speakers, and were able to build friendships among our classmates. As I said, a solid next step in German at Yale.",
    "This is a great class to take, which will allow you to strengthen your German abilities, especially in the speaking component. There are a lot of interesting group discussions, and you will be able to enjoy the conversations with the German partners much more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 given your improved fluency. It is also a very fun class :-)",
    "If you are planningon taking German, you should try to take it with Professor Schenker. Her classes are very informative and never boring or mundane. She can explain any nuance of German grammar! I really enjoyed working on our final project which was the video about an American city(in German nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich!).",
    "The german department is nice, but it is not a Gut language."
