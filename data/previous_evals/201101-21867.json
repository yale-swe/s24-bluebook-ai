    "A continuation of 344, which automatically makes it awesome.Make sure you take both classes, because the fun just doesn't stop, and you will become incredibly close to the rest of your classmates in the second half of the course (if you didn't already during the first half).",
    "Awesome awesome awesome. You learn so much about not just biological research but also about how the scientific community\/research works! One of the best classes taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, but only if they are a science major. A general understanding of many scientific concepts is useful to understanding the experiments. More importantly, this is a great class for anyone who wishes to learn more about experimental procedures and how to use different lab tools. This class is much more personalized than any lab I have ever taken. I would highly recommend anyone who is genuinely interested in science to take this class.",
    "This is a great full-credit biology lab (great lab in general). I learned so much, in a relaxed and supportive and above all fun environment, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Definitely take this lab if you can. I would even recommend it if you don't need the lab credit. I can't believe I just said that. I hate labs. Except this one. But this class is one of the finest academic experiences I have ever had.",
    "Definitely take 345L - I thought it was even better than 344L. It's basically the same class with the same relaxed-but-productive atmosphere, but with the addition of student presentations. That sounds bad - who wants more work? - and of course it took a while to prepare for. However, this really made the class individualized, since everyone had to read and present their own paper (from a list that Professor Wolenski supplied), and it was kind of fun to learn about a studyand present it to the class. I think the most valuable thing that came out of that was that you could really tell who had put in the time and prepared for the presentation, and who knew what they were talking about. Everyone had the chance to see what makes a good presentation, which will be helpful even for the people who aren't planning to go into science.",
    "Yes, take it for the same reason I said to take 344. It is the best lab at Yale. You learn a ton, and gain an interest in lab work if you didn't already have it. Everything about this lab is awesome. You do put a lot of hours in on Mondays and Wednesdays, but these hours are enjoyable and totally worthwhile, even for me during my senior year spring.",
    "Great lab course",
    "Great lab, definitely the best I have taken at Yale. The focus is totally on learning, there are no lab reports, Professor Wolenski is really friendly and accessible, the experiments are interesting, and our class really bonded.The oral presentation on papers takes a fair amount of time to prepare, but understanding a paper and being able to talk about it is a good skill to work on.Sometimes the lab sessions can be long (up to 5 hours or so), but they are not usually very stressful.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. SIGN UP ASAP (1-1.5 years in advance) because it fills up quickly. So worth it if you get a spot though. Perfect way to fulfill a lab requirement"
