   "comments": [
    "The course provides a theoretical foundation to introductory statistical concepts. If you are looking to gain skills to do more applied work, look elsewhere. I would not recommend this course to another student. It is frustrating and your time could easily be better spent learning the material on your own with a good textbook and some open course videos.",
    "An excellent introduction to fundamental statistical principles, with a cogent and well-explained justification for the agnostic approach.",
    "PLSC 500 is designed to introduce students to statistics for social science. There are a series of bi-weekly problem sets and a midterm and a final, both of which have take-home and in-class portions. Reading is relatively light, but the problem sets can be tough and you'll be expected to know or learn how to code in R. Honestly, if you're serious about being a political scientist, you need to take this course. It might not be what you want to do, but understanding quantitative research is hugely important when it comes to being able to understand, question, and discuss the work of others.",
    "PSLC provides a useful foundation for statistical theory. Even more advanced students will be exposed to concepts introduced in a different way than they have seen them before.",
    "This is a course in probability and statistical analysis; it moves very quickly."

   "comments": [
    "This course introduces students to the fundamentals of statistics necessary to conduct social scientific research. It teaches students how to critically evaluate research in a constructive manner and fosters creativity. Honestly I wish every course in the department was like this. I felt like the field courses with weekly readings provided almost nothing in terms of skill formation by comparison. I suppose they are more about socialization whereas this course is more about research. I don't think it would be possible to write a serious dissertation without this course.",
    "Learning R has been hugely useful for starting in on dissertation research.",
    "I came into this course with a high-school level math background and while I'm not sure that I'm any better at calculus, I certainly understand a whole lot more about what statistics mean and how quantitative research works. Moreover, it's made me believe that I can use quantitative methods to improve my understanding of the world and gain better resolution on questions in political science.",
    "A very useful foundation---however, any students interested in pursuing quantitative research should continue the series.",
    "This was critical to my understanding of statistics and quantitative methods; but I often felt we moved to fast over concepts and needed to devote more time to reviewing homework."
