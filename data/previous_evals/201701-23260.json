    "The class is very interesting. It covers a different flavor of Math. Sometimes Aspnes is confused in class, and the notes this year are not as polished as his other courses. I would recommend spending more time outside class to read on other universities' lecture notes, and come to lecture for the intuition. Homework assignments are manageable but sometimes a bit trivial. Also note that Aspnes doesn't curve. If you don't get 95% you won't get an A.",
    "Fascinating concepts. Would prefer to spend more time on interactive complexity and less on circuits and descriptive complexity."
