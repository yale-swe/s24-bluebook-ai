   "comments": [
    "Take this to really deep-dive into some grammar you thought you knew but didn't, and to learn a lot of vocab really fast. We all have nightmares about red-faced, bribe-taking Russian customs officials, but with Kostya you'll breeze right into the Russian language like a VIP.",
    "A great follow up to first semester. We read Chekhov, Pushkin, and Nabokov and also finished Russian grammar. Professor Muravnik, as you already know, is a godly Russian professor. This semester was a bit more intensive than L5 part 1 only because the quizzes were more constant and the grammar was a bit more complex. That being said, same workload this course was quite similar to first semester in terms of assignment structures, grading, etc.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student looking to improve their proficiency. In addition to language, we spent time on literature, history, and politics, which I greatly appreciated. I learned a great deal, and the atmosphere was friendly, constructive, and fun.",
    "Professor Muravnik is spectacular. If you've come this far in the Russian department, there's no reason to stop. A very reasonable workload in a class that greatly improves all aspects of the language. Highly recommended."
