   "comments": [
    "Under the rubric of \"social theory of the city,\" each class covered a different topic and drew on an interdisciplinary range of social sciences. As someone with little social science training (but from an interdisciplinary field), I learned how to put these different approaches and perspectives in conversation with one another while also connecting the texts to both present-day and historical issues alike. This happened both in conversation in the classroom as well in weekly responses. The reading responses (more demanding than reading responses in other classes though still very manageable for a PhD student) definitely helped me get more comfortable both in synthesizing arguments and in preparing for classroom discussion. As a more humanities-oriented scholar, I felt that the course material in itself was very complementary to my research interests and will be useful to them in the future."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the syllabus and structure of the class (mostly conversational, with opening remarks from a presenter and additional guiding discussion questions from Professor Barraclough) were both excellent and conducive to truly interdisciplinary discussion, though the smaller size (6 students) was a factor. One minor improvement (which I always forgot to bring up): I think it would have been useful for each class to end with some remarks looking toward the following week's readings, just to help the transition between different topics."
