    "I mean this class will never be offered again probably. But if it is - it was good! Take it if you are interested in modern theatre!",
    "A word of advice: do not take a production seminar unless you truly want to know more about the subject(s) it will explore. I did not intend to learn as much about the 1920s as I did from this seminar, and if you hate the subject you would be studying it's worth it to pick another seminar as you will spend at least half the semester learning about the dramaturgy of the piece.",
    "Great class. Take production seminars! best classes the THST department has to offer.",
    "Every class was a joy, between the people in it, the professor and the material. Loved it!",
    "This was a senior project for Melinda Paul in which we prepared and performed Adding Machine: A Musical. If it could be taken again, I think there is a lot to be gained from this class. Apart from having the opportunity to perform a musical at the end of the class, one is able to survey a portion of 1920s history that is often neglected.",
    "Take this course. Paige is a wonderful professor and some of the topics are applicable to today's technological moment. Since the course is a seminar, the quality of discussion depends highly upon the amount of work that the class puts in.",
    "Yes, it was very worthwhile to be able to inform a performance with so much seminar work and I never flet like I was completing an unnecessary assignment. Being in rehearsals with the members of the course makes class have a family feel and getting performance feedback from a professer is Invaluable.",
    "Modern Drama and Modern Technologies is an exploration of a specific theme in American theater - the advent of modern technology - during a specific time period - the turn of the twentieth century - both from academic and performative perspectives, culminating in a full-fledged production of \"Adding Machine: A Musical\". This specific course cannot be repeated, at least probably not with \"Adding Machine: A Musical\" as its culmination, but the subject matter is important for any aspiring actor, dramaturg or plain-old theater enthusiast, and the format itself of \"senior project class-turned-performance\" is something I'd recommend to any Yale theater buff, whether he or she interested in being onstage or off."
