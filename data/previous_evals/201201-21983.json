    "A must-take. As a senior leaving Yale, this class was truly a transformative, eye-opening experience. No matter your level of art ability, you learn from your peers in a low-stress, but highly engaging environment. Anna, if you can get her, is a godsend. She puts serious effort into every single one of her classes. She goes around the room, offering spot on critiques of work done in the class and her commitment to her students does not go unnoticed. Both her and our TA (Gabby) were brilliant and pushed their students to learn more about art in the form of personal experience, second-hand experience with peer critiques, and regular visits to the Art Gallery for observing topical works of art.Brilliant class. Bravo, art department.",
    "YES! absolutely take it if you can.",
    "This is a fantastic class, especially with Anna Betbeze. I looked forward to it every week, classtime was well structured and always engaging, and the homeworks were interesting, meaningful, and not busy-work. I learned far more than I expected. The only downside is that you have to carry your drawing board and large paper to and from class, which can be a hassle if you have other classes before\/after or if it's raining. And the charcoal is hard to remove fully from your fingernails. But seriously, those are the only downsides I can think of.",
    "Basic Drawing was a really neat experience for those interested in art, or those just looking for a Humanities credit. It is definitely not a class to take it you are wanting a lot of creative freedom with an art class. It is mainly learning to draw what one sees well and building upon the technique of drawing rather than getting to express oneself creatively through drawing.",
    "If you're interested in putting in the time to learn how to draw its not a bad thing to do at all. If you're not going to spend on time on it, probably not a good idea.",
    "recommend",
    "Fantastic course, especially for non-art majors like myself. I'm really grateful that Yale offers such opportunities. As someone who was had some classical training in fine art before college, finally returning to drawing was one of the best decisions I made as a senior. To draw rapid-fire sketches was a good challenge that took me out of my box of slow, highly-rendered drawings. Definitely take this class with Anna Betbeze--she is wonderful! The only downside to this course is that we almost entirely stayed with charcoal, so if you are looking for pencil sketching, you may want to try another section or continue with art classes beyond basic drawing. I highly recommend it!",
    "Absolutely. Homework assignments can be annoying--but when aren't they, for any class? Spending 4 hours a week drawing is a fantastic switch from the kind of work most of us are doing the rest of the time. Not only does it engage a different part of the brain, but it (often) has a really satisfying end result. And Anna is perfect. Very warm and kind, but also incredibly honest and knowledgeable. Her instruction is deceptively casual--there aren't formal, old-fashioned exercises, but you are always learning. You'll almost certainly be a much stronger drawer at the end of the semester.",
    "Art 114 is a wonderful class! Take it if you can. I was already pretty confident about drawing, but I still learned a lot. I got better at relaxing and being confident that whatever I was drawing would probably turn out okay. We worked mainly with charcoal on huge paper. We also took a few trips to the art gallery to look at pictures there.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Take basic drawing early. A lot of seniors took it and were upset that they hadn't taken it earlier, because they've fallen in love with Yale's art department. We started out with charcoal in experimented a little bit with ink. Both were fantastic experiences and have really prompted to me to be more artistic on my own. Anna is probably one of the best instructors you can have for this course, especially if you're a beginner, because she's so warm.",
    "Art 114 is good course. You receive a sprinkling of instruction-not too much, possibly too little. Then you draw, draw, draw, and draw all sorts of different and interesting things. If you work hard, you can improve drastically. However, if you try to make Art 114 into a gut class, you won't get anywhere... and it will show.",
    "If you really want to take Basi Drawing before you graduate Anna is the professor to take she is so helpful, accepting, and encouraging."
