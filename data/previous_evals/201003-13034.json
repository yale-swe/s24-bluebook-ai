   "comments": [
    "You might be a little overwhelmed at first by the level of French that is expected of you; adapting to the fast tempo of a native French speaker was initially difficult for me, but what I struggled with most was actually minute errors in my writing (the teachers are incredibly nitpicky). However, by the end of the course, you will likely find that your French, both oral and written, is much more polished. The class can be challenging and time-consuming, but if you really hope to improve your French fluency, especially oral\/audial, you should probably take this class.",
    "French 160 is an interesting introduction to social and political issues in modern France. There is more writing required than the title \"culture and conversation\" would suggest. I would recommend this class to people who are alreadyconfident in their speaking and writing abilities,because there is no formal grammar instruction. It also helps to sincerely like french culture, otherwise the class will get boring pretty quickly. From talking to friends in different section, each section of this class is pretty different, so you will want to shop a few if you have time.The instructor and the make up of your class matters a lot for your overall enjoyment of the course.",
    "It was a really time-consuming course with a lot of work, especially because our teacher posted things the night before they were due. It felt like a class on political and social issues, only conducted in French - if you think you'd enjoy that, then you'll like the class. Some of the movies were actually really great, as were the discussions on them. Make sure you get a good teacher, it would have made my class much more enjoyable and less stressful. You don't work on actively improving your French (no grammar exercises), but basically just speak in French all the time. So make sure you're interested in the topics discussed in the class otherwise you will not have a good time."
