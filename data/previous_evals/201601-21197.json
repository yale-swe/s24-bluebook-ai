   "comments": [
    "if there were about 12 people in the class it would have been awesome. As it stands with 30, a total disaster",
    "An excellent course. There were a few kinks that needed to be worked out at the beginning, but overall, the course material was very interesting. Prof Rosenbluth and Prof Kang allowed too many people to get into the course this year, which made discussion a bit difficult, but overall, very good.",
    "This is a great class and there were great speakers that were brought in. It deepened my awareness of topics and debates in East Asia.",
    "Great course with a variety of interesting guest speakers; well-curated selection of readings; lecture portions of the class were equally as informative; would recommend",
    "I would say this course is a very engaging weekly discussion of salient topics on East Asia. There were also a lot of guest lecturers throughout the semester because both Professor Rosenbluth and Professor Kang know so many people in the field. I would recommend this course to another student who wants more of a survey course on East Asia rather than delve deeply into a specific facet. Just the opportunity to study with these professors made it a great class.",
    "I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in current affairs or history of the East Asian region, and I think it should be a requisite for the East Asian studies major given the comprehensive breadth of the topics surveyed.",
    "The structure for this class is a little strange because it is a 30-person seminar, co-taught by Frances Rosenbluth and Woo Chang Kang, who is a postdoc. The beginning of the semester, you do a lot of breakout group mini-research activities during class, which is a great way to get to know your classmates, but a bit limiting in what you learn because the content is always divided between group members. It's important to pay attention when everyone reconvenes so that you catch all the info. This class presupposes that you have some background in the history of the east Asian countries.",
    "Wonderful! An in-depth look at a relevant but complex part of the world from lots of different perspectives. Highly recommend if you're interested in economics, political institutions, their overlap, or East Asia. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and nice, and the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "If this class is taught again, you should DEFINITELY take it if you are looking to improve your understanding of the Asia-Pacific. Even if you have no knowledge of the politics of East Asia, you will be able to follow the class. There were 4 one page reading responses due throughout the semester, a short 5 page historical paper, and the final was either an exam or a 12-15 political science paper. The work was very manageable and never felt burdensome because the readings were interesting. Professor Rosenbluth is one of the best professors at Yale and is likewise one of the best in her field.",
    "This is a very interesting class on East Asia! It would probably be helpful to come in knowing some history or have background knowledge on the region, because the class itself moves very quickly from topic to topic.",
    "A solid course that introduces students to the fundamental political economic analysis of East Asian domestic and international politics \/ relations. Prof. Rosenbluth really knows her stuff and provided a great gateway into the literature, theories, and scholars on the region's past, present, and future. While billed as a seminar, the course is much more of a lecture with high amounts of participation - the class had nearly 35 students so it wasn't as valuable as I would've hoped but it worked out in the end. It would've been nicer to have had a smaller class size. Otherwise, I think i emerged with a pretty solid understanding of how politics works in east asia and what the future holds for the region. The guest speakers (3 weeks in a row) were a nice addition although it would've been helpful to space out their visits so as to be better able to digest their material. Definitely take this course if you want an intro to East Asia or access to Prof. Rosenbluth who I imagine is a fantastic advisor for paper writing and research! Not too much work but definitely average for a seminar -- 4-6 articles per week, 4 reading response, a 5-7 page paper, and a final exam or seminar paper.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about East Asian politics.",
    "A good summary of post-WWII Asia politics and economics. You'll learn a lot, and it's truly a regional course (relatively very little on mainland China, for example). Not too much work -- lots of readings, but only two papers (one 5-page, one 12-15 page)."
