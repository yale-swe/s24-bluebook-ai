    "A great foundation for natural science principles related to climate change and environmental health. There was a specific focus on soils. The course was supposed to be flipped, but we had essentially two lectures a week, one virtual and one in class, not a true flipped scenario.",
    "I became a lot better with unit conversions and generally learned a lot as a non-science person.",
    "A broad array of skills that pertain to the physical sciences.",
    "By taking this course, I have learned about how to use physical science concepts to approach environmental problems.",
    "Refreshed me on topics I learned in undergrad",
    "So much! The flipped classroom really enabled me to learn at my own pace. The course was structured in a way that the broad overview has been extremely helpful to review essential basic concepts of physical sciences.",
    "I learned so much from Shimi this semester and gained a lot of knowledge I didn't have before.",
    "Lots! I had never taken a physical science\/earth science course before so lots of the content and skills were new for me.",
    "hard science knowledge; great learning about soils and rocks!",
    "I learned about soil classifications and introductory hydrology in this course.",
    "Knowledge of basic earth science, chemistry, hydrology, and physical chemistry. It was a useful addition to my undergraduate training in geography and plant biology",
    "I re-established a foundation of chemistry and physical science",
    "I developed my knowledge of a range of physical science topics such as soils, water, energy, and climate change. I also learned about and practiced applying some calculations and conversions.",
    "I developed some basic knowledge of physical science processes which I feel was incredibly helpful and a good introduction and overview of the science behind many of the issues I will be learning about over the next year and a half.",
    "This course presented a great foundation of physical science. It was a great refresher from courses taken in high school and undergrad."

   "comments": [
    "This course was what I expected",
    "I knew the class would be challenging for me and hoped that I would learn a lot. While I did need to invest a lot of time, I really enjoyed the class and felt I learned a lot.",
    "I learned what I expected to learn and more-- the topics we covered were actually quite vast.",
    "Pretty well align with my expectations.",
    "The course taught me what I expected.",
    "Very well. It was useful class and even though I wasn't required to take the class, I'm really glad that I did. It's been so long since I have had some of these basic classes that I'm glad to have had a review of these concepts before I move on to more science classes.",
    "I honestly thought I would learn less and almost tried to test out of this course but I'm glad I didn't! I learned so much.",
    "Above what I expected.",
    "Better than expected",
    "Well. There is a lot to cover in this class and so much of it is relevant for environmental managers pursuing any specialization really. I think the overview we got aligned with my expectations and what was reasonable for the timeframe.",
    "On par with expectations. A mixture of topics I covered in high school and college with new material.",
    "I expected deeper engagement with the course materials, and the course was much more introductory than I expected.",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. I was expected a basic earth science class, but the content delivery and level of expertise displayed by Shimi was above and beyond what I expected from a foundation class.",
    "The amount of information I learned exceeded my expectations",
    "The knowledge and skills that I learned in this course were above my expectations. I learned so much given that it was a 1.5 credit course.",
    "It aligned very well with my expectations and even exceeded it at times, we went into greater depth than I originally expected which I really appreciated.",
    "This class packs in a lot of basic information and I really liked the Professor. However, this class did not align with my expectations of a graduate-level course. I understand why this course exists, it is a good foundation. But especially having taken both basic science courses I wish I could have done them over the summer and had 3 credits to use on a course that is more in line with what I think of a graduate-level education."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor, material organization Weaknesses: some of the problem set problems did not really align with subject matter from lecture",
    "Great class, Professor Anisfeld is fantastic at making complex topics digestible. I particularly enjoyed the reverse classroom setup. My only two paces of constructive criticism is that 1) I wish the answer sheet for the practice exam had been posted so students would confirm that they had the correct approach, 2) there are times when the professor would use scientific terms without defining them. While the terms were very basic to Professor Anisfeld, many of us from outside of the scientific field had to google them to keep up.",
    "The course was a solid foundation for all of the physical sciences we might be expected to know as environmental managers-- it was well structured and its pace was consistent. However, it was a lot of material to absorb, and towards the end of the semester, some of the topics merged with one another.",
    "The flipped class structure was a bit annoying as we ended up spending a decent amount of time on lecture anyways. It would be good to give the option on working on the problem sets right away if you'd like to.",
    "If we could have more practice questions for final that would be very helpful.",
    "I believe allowing time to work on problem sets in class was great.",
    "I enjoyed the flipped nature of this course and I feel that it was an effective use of my time - in class and with assignments.",
    "I loved Shimi's teaching style and it was great course content, I think my only feedback would be that the workload\/amount of material covered seemed to amount to more than other 1 or 1.5 unit classes I took this semester",
    "The structure of the course worked really well--having the online lectures and than going over them in class. The workload of the course was very high for a 1.5 credit class; some weeks I spent more time on this class than I did on a three unit course. I appreciated how well organized and thoughtful the lectures and quizzes were.",
    "Strengths: flipped classroom approach, Professor's availability and engagement, readings definitely complemented course material, Improvements: nothing -- I thought it was great!",
    "Hard to gauge - would like to have more in-depth class but that would defeat the purpose of the 1.5 units\/foundations structure. Was more work than anticipated for 1.5 units. Because of the pace and amount of work\/material covered, would be better to have a midterm to cover the first half of the class then a final to cover the second half - the amount of final prep to go over the whole course was a lot for a small unit course, especially if the goal is foundational applied knowledge. I felt that was achieved with the weekly module structure but that emphasis was lost with the long final.",
    "I felt like the flipped classroom, with lectures both online and in person, was redundant. Shimon is a great lecturer, but with the helpful online videos, I don't feel like I gained anything by attending the in-person lectures, and would have rather filled that time with another course. I appreciated Shimon's passion for teaching-- it was clear that he respects the process of learning, and I always felt like I could reach out with any questions I might have had.",
    "Strengths: - Course material is consistent year-to-year (with minor adjustments) that made it straightforward for the instructor to deliver the content - Shimi was engaging and patient with students' questions - Requiring that video lectures be viewed prior to class was useful in ensuring that class time was focused on ensuring understanding and reserved for questions from students Weakness: n\/a",
    "The course was very demanding for a once a week course.",
    "I really enjoyed completing the video lectures and subsequent quizzes before class because I could watch them at my own pace and around my busy schedule. I also thought that clicker questions were useful for maintaining student engagement during class. I think it could be improved by spending more time in class practicing calculations and conversions. I also wish there were a greater focus on the science of climate change given how it will affect every environmental issue and a little less of a focus on soils and sediment, which I found less relevant to my academic studies.",
    "I really liked the weekly assignments, it helped me make sure I was keeping up with the material and the general structure of the class that allowed us to start the PSET in class was great and very helpful. It made it feel as though it wasn't too much work. The only thing I might change is to split the final exam into two, one during the middle of the semester and one at the end. It's just a lot of material to go back and review so having two different exams might be helpful.",
    "The Professor is great and the online courses are engaging and informative. This course could be improved by being a summer online course. Most of the class is already online -- the lectures, problem sets, and quizzes are already digital. A platform like Piazza (used in a different course this semester) could accommodate students asking and answering each others questions."

   "comments": [
    "Do not be afraid to ask questions, particularly when working on the problem set. Professor Anisfeld is fantastic at diagnosing what mistake you are making and re framing your thought process so that you arrive at the correct answer.",
    "To be consistent with reading the book, it was a helpful addition! Also to take advantage of class time to work on the homework.",
    "Try finish the problem set during the class section so that you can ask Professor Anisfeld and TAs for questions.",
    "The work for this course can be challenging. But you are equipped to carry most of it out, and study groups are very useful. Also, having a running study guide from the first class to the last will be extremely useful for the overwhelmingly cumulative assessment at the end.",
    "Take your time to learn each section",
    "You can do the problem sets in class if you like, but if you feel you work better independently, feel free to work on them outside class at your own pace.",
    "Do the readings, watch the lecture, take the quizzes--in that order, every week.",
    "Make time for the module and stay to finish the problem set in class - so worth it to have that time. Work with students and take good notes throughout the class for easier final preparation - there is a ton of material covered to review in the end.",
    "Attempt to test out of this course if you feel like you have a precursory understanding of physical science. I wish that I had opted-out of this course.",
    "Make use of in-class time and office hours.",
    "Highly recommend taking the class even if you have some earth science background from undergrad - the class covers a wide range of material and Shimi's style of teaching ensures understanding and retention",
    "I would suggest to put the time in and really learn the material week by week-- fully understand the quiz materials and the problem sets.",
    "Expect to work more than you might expect for a 1.5 course class and work on problem sets with other students.",
    "If you keep up with the weekly assignments, you will be set. Make sure to find a good group of people to help you do the PSET, they're easier when done in a team and don't be afraid to use the professor for questions. And finally, start studying for the final exam early, it's just a lot of material!",
    "If you think you really need this course, it is a good class. But overall I recommend trying to get out of this and the ecology basic knowledge courses."
