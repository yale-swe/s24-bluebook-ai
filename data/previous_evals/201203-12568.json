   "comments": [
    "Great course! It is definitely very compelling to learn about ancient Egypt, especially if you have never taken a course on it. It's a wonderful introductory level class, and Professor Darnell does a terrific job at recreating the history for the students. Topics were always interesting, and the field trip to the Metwas awesome.",
    "This was an awesome class. Professor Darnell is great, and even though he never brought it up, he is actually a very accomplished Egyptologist, almost like a real-life Indiana Jones. This showed in quality of the class, which was my favorite of the semester. The class counts for either a Humanities or a writing credit, which is also nice.",
    "This is a very ambitious course, but one that gives an excellent and thorough overview of Egypt. There's a lot of material, but you don't have to be able to remember all of it.",
    "A great coverage of Ancient Egypt, especially of periods that aren't often covered in discussions. Very in-depth and informative, but still a lot more to learn. The projects were enjoyable and meshed well with the class.However, the readings\/hieroglyphic translations were a lot of work, more so than any other class. Time management skills need to be well applied, at least until the number of readings is decreased.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend taking this class. Whether you are thinking of pursuing a major and\/or career in Egyptology or are like me, a probable biomedical engineering major, I recommend taking this class. Dr. Darnell is phenomenal and the material is fascinating. The small seminar is also great for fostering a Q&A class.",
    "I would really recommend this seminar to students interested in learning about Ancient Egypt. No previous knowledge is necessary to follow the class, but there is a lot of reading, so do not take this course unless you are not motivated to do all the work.",
    "This freshman seminar is a great course if you are interested in studying Egyptology or NELC as a major, but also if you are just looking for something unique, something different from mainstream courses. I would definitely recommend it. You do not only get a comprehensive history of Northeast Africa, but you get the opportunity to work with and document archaeological material. Take it!",
    "Take this Class!! It is absolutely fantastic. If you have an interest in Egypt and want to learn more - this is teh class for you. There is quite a lot of reading, but most is really interesting and it is pretty easy to weed out the reading you don't really need to work on. The assignments are really interesting and there is always plenty of time given for each one. Professor Darnell is hugtely knowledgable and very enthusiastic in class. The trip to the MET was great! He moves pretty fast through a lot of the material, so you needa quick hand to take the notes, but don't be perturbed by this. I can't wait to take another one of his classes. The TA is always very willingly to help, if you get lost."
