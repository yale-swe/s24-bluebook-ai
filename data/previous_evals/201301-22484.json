   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it. It's super fun!",
    "good class..kind of dull at times, manageable work load.",
    "YES! Especially to HSAR majors, I feel that everyone would benefit from taking a class on this subject with prof. Cooke. It can take a few lectures to get used to Cooke's lecture style (beautiful but convoluted prose, not always to the point but very thorough), but once you do get used to it, it's so great, you can just sit back and enjoy...workload is well balanced, just 4 short museum labels and 1 medium length catalogue essay, two exams...section was the highlight of the course because you actually get to go to object study room in YUAG or furniture gallery to interact with, touch, and think about objects in front of you rather than mediated by ppt slide or readings!",
    "A course that provides an overview of how objects of ceramics, textiles, wood, and other materials are produced. Later, the class delves into objects' functions as tools for making our lives easier, guiding our daily activities, forming social bonds, etc. Sections in the Art Gallery and Furniture Study allow students to touch and discuss objects discussed in class.",
    "A fun, interesting, engaging course!",
    "Take it. So worthwhile. A different approach to decorative arts that needs to be made more known.",
    "Fun class, not too hard. You get to look at a lot of cool stuff.",
    "Wonderful class! Especially if you're not an art major, because it is so different from what you'd typically expect out of an art history class. very practical and relevant knowledge. the work load was very manageable and the assignments a ton of fun to write. the readings are long, but they're aren't necessary to do well in the class, but interesting if you have the time.",
    "This is a great class! Take it for a great overview of world decorative arts, even if you do not have any background in art history. If you want to learn how everyday objects are really the result of thousands of years of cross-cultural interactions, you should take this class. The workload is not bad, but be prepared to spend time revising even short writing assignments, as the goal of the writing assignments is to have truly polished pieces of writing. Section (even if it is on Friday, as it was for me) will be one of the best parts of your week. You get to handle real art objects in the YUAG. It is awesome. Take this class!!",
    "Decorative arts is a wonderful class. So interesting and a different take on art history that you wouldn't expect. The first half is definitely more boring than the second half but so worth it.",
    "Really interesting course on more functional kinds of arts-- textiles, ceramics, wood, metals, etc. Cooke is a really good lecturer and brings a lot of examples from his personal collection. Additionally, you look at works from all kinds of cultures and time periods which is cool. Workload isn't too bad and will reach you about writing for museum purposes (museum labels and catalogue entries).",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for anyone interested in Art History or Archaeology. You learn a lot of things that may seem useless, but the class gives you new ways to think about objects, how we think of art, and the importance of material culture to culture at large. Aside from the readings, everything about the class is amazing. The assignments are not difficult, and give you an excuse to go to the art gallery.",
    "This class has been my favorite at Yale. It was such a treat to go to the gallery for section and be able to handle things we were learning about. A fun, low pressure class. I liked that our assignments were object labels for the museum. No long overwhelming papers. Instead, they were small manageable assignments that you could really spend time on and perfect.",
    "Take it. You'll be surprised how much you learn. If you properly study the materials, which Prof. Cooke organizes well and tells you before midterm and final, you will be fine. If you are fast\/good at IDs, memorization, take it. Also, section every week, 4 short essays, 1 final essay. They DO take longer than you think, trust me :)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a really well-done introduction to a bit of an esoteric subject. The material is interesting, and the professor is great. This course gave me some new perspective on material culture.",
    "Take it! It's very interesting, sections are awesome because we get to go down to the object study rooms of the YUAG and handle historical objects. Plus, all the information you learn is just useful in life and being a more cultured\/well-rounded person.",
    "An art history class with a different perspective - Prof. Cooke gets you to think about art as more than just the paintings and sculptures in museums. This class brings in not only art, but social science and even a touch of physical science, to explore how everyday objects influence and reflect the societies in which they exist. I'm a science major just trying to get a humanities credit, but I nevertheless found this class extremely engaging and relevant to my life. Definitely one of the better classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend HSAR 110! As an overview of\/introduction to decorative arts, the class is definitely a bit unstructured (there is little chronological order), but I think that this is one of its strong points. Professor Cooke has organized the course thematically: the first half of the class focuses on common materials that objects are made of (ceramics, textiles, base metals, wood), and the second half focuses on analysis and examination of objects in a historical context. The best part of the class is the section requirement\u00e2\u0080\u0094we met once a week in the object study classrooms of the YUAG, and had the opportunity to interact with and discuss actual items from the collections. I looked forward to section every week, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know of any other class that provides the same incredible opportunity to examine objects firsthand. In terms of workload, the weekly readings are very long and sometimes impossible to finish completely--but the rest of the workload is fairly light. We wrote 4 museum labels (150 words each) and one catalogue entry (700 words), and had a midterm and final. The TAs were fantastic and always willing to help. Professor Cooke is also fantastic, and I definitely plan to take another class he teaches in the future. He is clearly very dedicated to and interested in the subject matter, and this enthusiasm permeates his lectures. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finish HSAR 110 with a solid knowledge of and understanding of decorative art, but this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the point of the class\u00e2\u0080\u0094the point is to acquire the skills and thought processes necessary to critically analyze objects and the role they play in daily life."
