    "This class introduced me to a lot of really useful and thought-provoking material on the intersection of race and affect, which I feel like is an oft looked-over intersection within the field of affect theory. The way in which the course was framed around personhood and people felt also very useful for thinking about how to conduct and interpret ethnographic work."

    "the small class size was a big strength for in depth conversation, but some weeks had too many readings to get to in conversation-consider paring down",
    "The strength of this course is also its weakness: I appreciated being exposed to so much material, but sometimes felt overwhelmed by the shear density and quantity of reading for the week. Also, submitting and reading response before class also weighed in on these anxieties."
