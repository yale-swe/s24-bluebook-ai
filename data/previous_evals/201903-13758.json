   "comments": [
    "all relevant field skills",
    "I learned about the geology and soils of the region, as well as land use history and forest species. I also learned how to dig and analyze soil pits, use a CWM transect, and work with a client over a long period.",
    "A thorough understanding of applying silviculture and forest management theory to a working property.",
    "I have developed skills in multiple aspects that prepare me to work on management plans and become a better forester. First of all, I gained a more in-depth insight on the geology, hydrology, and soil of the New England landscape. I also developed profound knowledge on the legacies of previous land use and their influences on the land. Throughout the second part of the course, I learned to evaluate a piece of landscape scientifically and present the results to people with little knowledge in forestry. The most valuable skills would be conveying our knowledge and recommendations to the landowners in a way that they can digest easily.",
    "I learned how to draft a management plan, from assessing the biophysical and social conditions of a property to making recommendations for various objectives.",
    "This course is basically a culmination of everything we have been learning in the MF track so far: dendrology, soils, watersheds, stand dynamics, silviculture, GIS, stakeholder analysis, sampling design, etc etc etc."

   "comments": [
    "very well",
    "Very well.",
    "Extremely well. This the most applied course Ive taken and expect to take; granted the capacity to work as a forester.",
    "There was a bit more than I expected originally. I learned more than foundational knowledge of reading the landscapes and creating recommendations, but the skills to communicate with landowners were out of my expectations. These skills include writing a report more approachable to landowners, engaging them with storytelling, and presenting with expertise confidently.",
    "The material itself was well aligned."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "lot of work, suggest student to manage and allocate time wisely",
    "The course is extremely strong in the breadth of topics you get exposed to, as well as the opportunity to work with a client outside of Yale. The greatest weakness, in my opinion, is the time demand. I believe, in large part because our property was an hour and a half away, that to do well all that the course requested required potentially even more than the 6 credits it is listed as.",
    "Was slightly unorganized: schedule was shifted around a few times, which caused some stress. I think that that kind of flexibility is required because the class is so self-scheduled, so maybe just better communication.",
    "The semester is too short! We have to squeeze in so many materials into one semester. I would prefer to have an Indesign workshop to work on the aesthetics of our management plan.",
    "This course covers a lot and results in such a practical and applied deliverable. However, it's a lot to fit into one semester. I think it might be better to extend this course into one year long class instead of a semester long one to allow for more time to deliver higher caliber work.",
    "I thought this was definitely the most valuable course I have taken at FES so far because of how it drew together all the skills I've been learning and applied them in a very tangible project. It certainly had a lot of weaknesses but that comes with the territory of attempting to bring together such a huge amount of skills - not every student is going to be on the same page and some will find the instruction on certain skills lacking. For example, I don't have much GIS experience and I found the GIS instruction lacking, but I have dendrology experience and found the dendro lessons to be overkill. So there is a balance required to bring everyone to the same page. However, the main weakness of this course is just the huge amount of work it requires. It requires way more work than the 6 credits calls for. But like I said, it's an immense learning experience and you get a great product out of it. I just had a job interview and this was the course I pointed to as the culmination of my forestry education."

   "comments": [
    "lot work, lot of learning",
    "Take the class, but be prepared to have effectively no weekends free for the whole semester. If you used weekends to get work done in semesters prior, find a way to restructure your time. Respect the 6 credits the course is listed as very seriously. If you're willing to give the course lots of your time and energy, you will receive an immense value of knowledge, skills, and memories.",
    "Pick your teammates wisely! I think a lot of people blamed the professor for things that could be better managed by effective team management.",
    "Prepare to spend most of your time on this course. Sit tight and Dr. A will take you to the next level.",
    "This course is a lot of work-- be prepared to devote the bulk of your semester to this and adjust your other commitments accordingly to account for it.",
    "Be ready to put in the work! The travel to and from the Quiet Corner is a lot. But I always enjoyed it. Get yourself a good partner and enjoy spending the time in the woods with them, or freezing your butts off in a cabin at Myers with them. And then be ready for the long hours in the computer lab with them when deadlines come at you fast and furious. It might be Thanksgiving, or even Christmas, or maybe even New Years, but you better be putting in the work on your plan!"
