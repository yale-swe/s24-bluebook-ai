    "heart deserves a place alongside reason",
    "I've learned that I've underestimated how much is lost in translation, and that you have to approach close-reading much differently with a text that isn't originally written in English. It surprised me how there are so few translations of important Vietnamese texts.",
    "This was an incredible class. I did not have much knowledge on the history of Vietnam before entering the class, and Professor Van and Tri were both incredible in guiding me through, along with creating meaningful class discussions that incorporated ideas across all cultures throughout history.",
    "We learned about a lot of Vietnam's history, different philosophical outlooks, poetry, notions of displacement, suffering, and maybe even more importantly we occasionally got to hear about Prof Quang's personal anecdotes.",
    "Before taking this course, I had no opportunity to dive deeper into my Vietnamese roots. Now that I have had the chance, I have really examined and even challenged some of the preexisting assumptions I had about Vietnam and about being Vietnamese. For most of my life, I was always taught one dominant narrative when it comes to the Vietnam War, one defining moment for all overseas Vietnamese. The South Vietnamese and their American allies were the \"good guys,\" and the North Vietnamese were the \"bad guys.\" However, as I have read in The Sympathizer, even the so called \"winners\" must pay a heavy price. Even though political piece came, many grudges have still gone unresolved. Complicated politics tie into the complicated reasons why thousands of people decided to uproot themselves and escape Vietnam. In addition, through the literature that I read and the discussions I had, being Vietnamese is more than just being on the pro-Communist or pro-democracy side. Moreover, the very concept of being Vietnamese that I before assumed every person of Vietnamese heritage would accept for himself does not apply universally."

   "comments": [
    "i enjoyed the readings and the analysis. i would have liked even more analysis of literature actually",
    "Strengths: the order and structure of the syllabus, the well-paced reflections, the encouraging seminar environment weaknesses: lecture\/seminar style of the class unpredictably fluctuates, so sometimes when the class is conducted in seminar-style, the class is not as well-prepared to have a productive conversation on the text",
    "I think the second half of the semester was super interesting and I wish we had more time to digest those texts. Perhaps rescheduling the time allotted to folklore and poetry so we could spend more time on the Sympathizer and Paradise of the Blind texts would be better. I really enjoyed the social media lecture and the guest lectures (particularly the monks). It felt very relevant and refreshing as it was broken up throughout the semester. I also really liked the films chosen and wish we had more time to finish them!",
    "I thought this class was phenomenal all around and do not have any suggestions for improvement.",
    "I really liked the freedom in this class, since it did not feel devoid of structure. Overall the course was incredibly enjoyable.",
    "A major strength of this program is that it is discussion based. Professor Quang does occasionally lecture; however, he allows us students the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with one another on the topic of discussion. And even though the class is titled as being about Vietnamese culture, literature, and values, Professor Quang structured the class in a way that could appeal to students of all backgrounds. All of the works of literature (i.e. novels, literature, and short stories) that we read were in English. Some may say that not reading in the original Vietnamese takes away from the authenticity. However, I argue that this is a major way to attract students with no little to no exposure to the Vietnamese language or culture. I have learned a lot, more even, from my classmates who do not identify as being Vietnamese. Some facet of the course must have personally resonated with them. There are absolutely no noticeable \"weaknesses\" that I can point out. If this course could be improved somehow, I really wished that our class met more often than two times a week. I felt that we moved a little too quickly through the larger novels. I wanted more time to dissect and discuss the works, but there were time constraints. If maybe perhaps the class could be at least three times a week, then we could have perhaps have had more time to discuss the works."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Definitely! Thay Quang is an amazing, caring, passionate lecturer and is often accommodates for student interests and learning styles. The assignments are well-paced and broad enough to facilitate personal growth and interests.",
    "Yes because it is a class that juxtaposes the western culture\/values\/literature that is abundant on campus. It is also a very relaxed discussion environment which facilitated supported discussions as a result.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a great space to grow and learn, for both yourself and regarding Vietnamese history.",
    "Absolutely! I learned so much about Vietnam, and as a non-Vietnamese student I never felt out of place or left out. A lot of what we learned got me thinking about my own life and how I approach it, and attending class always left me with something meaningful to reflect on. I wish similar courses were offered for more cultures. Prof Quang is amazing, nice, funny, and overall so deserving of respect. I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes if you're interested in learning about Vietnamese literature and culture!",
    "If learning more about Vietnamese culture and literature seems interesting to anyone, then I would absolutely recommend another student to take this course. Nonetheless, if larger topics of conflict, its aftermath, human migration, and resilience resonate with anyone, then that student must take this class. Sure this class will definitely teach one about Vietnamese culture, history, and literature. However, the larger lessons the class has taught me are that the struggles and aspirations of one particular ethnic group is not constrained to that group. Any other person would wish the best for him and his family. Any other person would do the best with what he can given dire circumstances. Finally, looking at the Vietnamese in particular is but one very human case of phenomena that touch the lives of all of us."
