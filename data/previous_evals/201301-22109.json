   "comments": [
    "It was good class and not to hard and not that much work.",
    "Its interesting but only fi you are interested in networks. Use of pajek is not hard but a little challenging if you're not into that kind of stuff",
    "A fun, low key class. You'll learn good quantitative concepts for network and statistical analysis. And the readings are fun and worth reading.",
    "I highly recommend this course to other students. Super interesting material about an area of study that is fairly new. The class was not difficult in the least and the TFs were always willing to meet and help students out with labs\/the final project.",
    "I would if they were sure they were interested in the class topics.",
    "SOCY 167 is a great course that teaches a lot of theory behind social movements, contagion, and diffusion of information\/people. You also get to learn some practical skills - how to use Pajek social analysis software. I would recommend this course, but with the caveat that they need to engage with the concepts that you are learning on Pajek (currently, you follow the instructions and produce the charts\/analyses, but you dont learn what those concepts\/analysis tools actually tell you about the social world youre studying that week)",
    "Take the course. Network analysis connects to almost any field of study or major, and it's importance will only increase over the coming years. This is a great way to see if you're interested in the field.",
    "The title defines the class: Social Network Analysis. You will explore social network analysis research. It is not about Facebook and Twitter and such (although the methods can be applied to it); rather, it is about actual connections among people or other components (countries, organizations, etc.) and the networks these form. The practical part of the class was great, and you learn to work with the network analysis program Pajek. The theoretical component of the class could have been better structured, and the readings were too dense. Expect 1 long reading response, and a research paper that really creeps up on you. Take it if you are interested in this type of network analysis for Sociology or other social sciences; if you are just looking for a SO credit, you will probably get bored or frustrated.",
    "learning how people interact and how information travels through a network",
    "Sociology 167 is a great course for people interested in sociology more in the context of social networks and network structures. Just know that the course is probably different from any other sociology course offered in that you have to use programming to generate networks and data structures."
