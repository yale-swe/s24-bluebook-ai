   "comments": [
    "You essentially learn stats but with an applied focus (so more numbers instead of proofing).",
    "Learning how to use STATA was useful in this class. If looking for a stats class, this is easy but there are better classes to take, like intro to stats with JRS which has different tracks.",
    "I learned how to interpret statistics and apply them to the real world which was a really cool skill",
    "It basically serves as an introduction to statistics.",
    "This course was excellent -- I learned a lot about statistical analysis with both Stata and theory! Highly recommended for all Yale students.",
    "I learned how to use statistical software (stata) and analyze data",
    "I gained a solid understanding of basic statistics, with a focus on really understanding and applying concepts rather than simply plugging values into equations.",
    "I learned statistical competence, and I now feel comfortable recognizing faulty studies.",
    "I understood how Statistics is used generally and have some way of evaluating research.",
    "This course taught me both how to read statistics for the social sciences and how to begin to think about doing research for issues of public policy. I gained a working knowledge of Stata, too.",
    "Learned how to conduct significance tests, construct confidence intervals, and calculate bivariate and multivariate regressions. Also was introduced to STATA and public policy evaluation.",
    "Gathered requisite skills in basic data analysis - by the end of the course I feel that, although we barely scratched the surface of statistics, I do have a couple very useful methods under my belt.",
    "I learned basic statistical skills, especially how to provide robust statistical analysis and how to evaluate similar studies. The Global Affairs-specific approach was also helpful in that the data we used were directly relevant to materials we study elsewhere.",
    "I learned how to effectively collect data and conduct thorough data analyses.",
    "- statistical methods in the social sciences: significance tests, regression analysis, comparison between groups and proportions, descriptive statistics...",
    "Indeed, I have a major in Statistics. However, it was approximately 10 years ago. It was good to review my knowledge. Since this course mostly focused on interpretation of statistics, it was really beneficial for me. As an international students, this course helped me to improve my understanding about some key definitions. This course covers main topics in a very detailed way. I was able to develop my knowledge on linear regression and OVB.",
    "Knowledge about descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and regression analysis. How to evaluate academic work containing statistics.",
    "You definitely develop STATA skills throughout the course. This course does a great job of combining both theoretical and practical knowledge of statistics.",
    "A strong, conceptual and practical understanding of statistics for the social sciences.",
    "Developed serious Stata skills along with skills in regression analysis and basic statistical proficiency.",
    "This class was amazing. I have taken another intro stats course at Yale and AQA far and away provided me with a better understanding of the most important introductory statistical concepts. Even if you aren't interested in global, I would really recommend this class for an intro stats class or even just a QR credit. The class not only teaches you the tools that enable you to approach and solve statistics-related questions, but also provides you with a really strong understanding of the theory and the knowledge of why the methods work.",
    "So much about preliminary statistical methods.",
    "Basic knowledge regarding how to compute statistics and determine how well they represent a data set.",
    "Important tools on data analysis. We also learned how to maneuver the STATA statistical software- which is a really important employable skill!",
    "I learned A LOT in this class. In addition to better learning basic statistical tools for evaluating a sample, I also learned how to evaluate data and STATA.",
    "Analytical skills that will serve to understand general stats",
    "I discovered for myself how interesting and useful quantitative research methods can be. I now understand how to read and analyze quantitative research as a result. I can also conduct a bit of research on my own.",
    "Basic stat",
    "I learned the basics of statstical analysis including finding measures of central tendency, performing statistical tests, and performing linear regression. This class also focuses strongly on the theoretical underpinnings of statistics, including central limit theorem and the law of large numbers. In addition, the class put a large focus on teaching students to use the stata statistical analysis platform.",
    "The regressions were really helpful, and the information about the nuances of sample sizes. I know I could have learned so many more skills and insights if I wasn't struggling so hard to keep up. The professor is great, it was just me, personally, who had a hard time.",
    "This course taught me several fundamental concepts regarding statistical analysis of data. From understanding basic ideas like central modes of concepts to more advanced understanding of confidence intervals and significance tests for many different types of scenarios (large, small, multi-variable, etc.), this course taught not only how to calculate statistics that help us understand our variable(s) of interest, but also the underlying concepts that might lead us to choose one methodology over the other. Additionally, I learned how to use Stata for the first time!",
    "I learned basic statistics, as well as OLS regressions and Stata (stats software). Really useful if you want to do or read any type of research in the social sciences. Not sure why this class isn't required for all social science students, rather than those in global affairs.",
    "This class is a basic stats class, which will be helpful as a foundation for work in data analysis or research. Therefore it's required for Global majors and I recommend taking this your first year so it doesn't feel as redundant once you're further in the major and have already done research.",
    "I learned how to criticize data and statistics and further understand its used and limitations. The applied math allows for a further exploration of globsl inequality and lets students think about where these actual statistical inequalities fall, and how to research this on the grounds.",
    "The course was useful to refresh some basic knowledge on statistics.",
    "I learned how to evaluate research and data. We learned the first few skills for stata, which could be useful in the future when working for a research program. On the whole, this course taught me everything it said it would.",
    "Learned in-depth statistical methods and methods of analysis. How to understand statistical evaluations and how to read research papers. Learned common mistakes and how to avoid them, also, how statistics look in the real world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor and the TA's are always available and eager to help out. However, getting our P-sets back always took a while so it was hard to review what we did on them.",
    "TFs should have a better grasp of the material and the lecture should be less bogged down in theory and slides of paragraphs. Rather, the stats should be presented in a concise manner that maintains the attention of the class.",
    "strength: teacher is awesome weakness: section just teaches you about stata - It would be helpful to also learn about the material covered in class",
    "I didn't find the material very interesting, but JT does a fantastic job of teaching it. He clearly cares a lot about teaching Jackson undergrads and does a good job of it.",
    "strengths - Justin Thomas is the most amazing lecturer I've ever had - incredibly engaging and relatable + he puts in solid effort to know every student in the class despite the large lecture size. weaknesses - Could have section before psets were due so we knew how to do them, clearer grading on psets, better explanation of stata - would recommend we get some sort of guide to relevant stata codes on canvas?",
    "The professor was very engaging and clear. He managed to make even quite dry topics interesting to learn. I felt like I didn't get very much out of section, however, and the way the problem sets were graded wasn't very clear.",
    "The first half of the semester was extremely easy, but in my opinion the second half was fairly difficult. If it is possible to go faster at the beginning then allow for a slightly slower second half, I believe it would be beneficial.",
    "the biggest strength is amazingly fun professor. The only weakness is I wish the formal P set solutions were posted at some point. (instead of relying on the psets handed back)",
    "The professor is absolutely incredible. The P-Sets are doable and great preparation for the exams. No weaknesses that I can think of, other than maybe section shouldn't be only STATA (and PSET prep)? Honestly it was a great course.",
    "Material is very well taught - but there wasn't much of it..we spent a whole semester on significance tests and regression analysis which I guess is just to ensure that Global majors are 100% on top of it. Tests and sets were too easy and so points were taken off for very petty things - bit of a lottery.",
    "The course was very well-structured, going through concepts step-by-step and making sure everyone had a firm grasp on the theoretical aspects. The emphasis on evaluating given statistical analysis was very helpful as well. Sometimes the problem sets felt repetitive, but they ultimately were helpful in that it really made sure that we understood the content.",
    "The class moved rather slowly throw some basic statistics concepts - z-scores, confidence intervals, etc. Would have liked to spend more time on regression concepts that were pushed to the end.",
    "I enjoyed the slower pace at which the course was taught. I felt the information taught in the latter half of the semester needed more time spent on it.",
    "Strengths: - Professor Thomas is engaging - Stata skills - Relevant material to everyday world Weaknesses: - Grading of psets should happen way earlier - Solutions for psets should be given as answer keys",
    "The strongest part of this course is Justine Thomas. He is a good teacher. The lecture was well-designed. It was interactive. The presentations were well-prepared. They can be counted as good sources. I believe that I can use them later. The problem sets were also well-designed and they all helped me to understand the topic of each week. Stata sessions also covered main syntax that were useful in statistical analysis. I did not see any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Professor Thomas is SO, so engaging! He tries so hard to make sure that everyone understands the material and his constant reassurance that \"no question is stupid\" is really heartening. Weaknesses: The lack of opportunities to meet with TA's before PSETS were due. This probably isn't true for everyone, but I had class during every single office-hour that TA's held. Though I was able to make individual appointments with my TA, it would have been really, really helpful if the class employed some sort of Piazza platform. Also, for the midterm\/final, there were a lot of theory questions. There was a lot of conversation during lecture about some of the theory topics, but they were not so in-depth that I felt super prepared to answer those questions.",
    "Strength: Definitely Professor Thomas. He presented the possibly very dull material with vigour and passion that mesmerised all students. He is always willing to answer any and all questions from students, both during the lecture and during office hours. Weakness: More office hours with TF's can be scheduled during more convenient times for students. The demand for office hours was high (especially for questions on Problem Sets), but they were often scheduled during very inconvenient times for many students (e.g. Tuesday morning and afternoon, when most students have other classes). Also, fair warning: problem sets tend to take quite long. Get an early start on those Psets.",
    "While I absolutely enjoyed this course and believe it is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale thus far, my one critique would be that the sample final was not designed necessarily for this course. While I probably shouldn't even be complaining (I mean, we have a sample final), I just wish that final was truly reflective of the course like the sample midterm was.",
    "JT is a very engaging and thorough lecturer. He is also very accessible and helpful (and patient) during office hours. The class moves at a good pace for students who haven't done much \/ any statistics before and the problem sets and midterm were graded in such a way was to give clear feedback for future work \/ the concepts. The textbook was especially good because it had lots of practice problems - with the resources JT posted on Canvas, this made reviewing \/ exam preparation very straightforward. The TFs varied, but mine was really great and I really enjoyed that they taught us to use Stata. Perhaps most importantly, the material feels very relevant \/ interesting if you're thinking of majoring in the social sciences (particularly if you're interested in the developing world).",
    "Professor Thomas is the best part of the course. Without him, going to lecture would have been very dull. However, the biggest weaknesses are two things. First, sometimes the problem sets were a bit tedious and repetitive, meaning that they felt like rote work. Second, the TF's were quite weak. They did not understand the material that well, which was very evident in the final review session. Additionally, on the practice final the answers of \"see notes\" were incredibly unhelpful, and left me, and many other students, confused.",
    "I really appreciated how much detail Professor Thomas went into with regards to the most important statistical methods. In comparison to a different intro stats course I have taken, I found that having an understanding of the theory and why the methods work really bettered my ability of solving and approaching problems. I no longer simply memorized the type of problems that require certain methods - I was much more able to adapt to different types of problems. The class really excels at driving into your brain the foundations of stats. I see no real weaknesses with the course.",
    "Section time felt like it could be more widely used to practice course material rather than Stata. Psets did not really help with practicing writing about the theoretical questions that were on the exam. Exams did feel fair and straightforward. It would have been helpful to have answers to the psets posted after they were returned so that they could be used to practice for exams. We were told to visit TFs if we had questions, but because they all took turns grading, it was difficult to get straight feedback.",
    "Using the textbook more or please just get rid of it.",
    "This class ran perfectly. The professor made it really easy to learn and it was a fun experience!",
    "This was a great course, the classes were educational and engaging and the PSETs were hard enough so that you actually learned. They were a tad long, though.",
    "Amazing professor, and material was very well taught. A bit more of a practical focus on stata from JT would have been helpful",
    "I wish the class moved a little faster at some points",
    "I feel that the class could have focused less on the use of the stata platform, which, while beneficial for some students, took up almost the entirety of section, and therefore took away from time that could have been spent on other facets of the class.",
    "I wish there were more ways to get help. There is section, and the professor has office hours (but those are only 15 minutes long, by appointment, and fill up within minutes of being posted), and the TAs will stay late to answer questions, but other than that, you're on your own. To get a tutor took me weeks, and she was great, but it was too late to bail out a sinking ship at that point. For other classes, such as physics, chem, math, etc. , there are drop-in hours, res college tutors, extra tutors set up, etc., but this class was so specific that none of those could apply.",
    "I thought the course was taught really well. The material was ordered in a logical fashion, such that each concept built upon the preceding material without being too overwhelming at once while also challenging us to incorporate all of our skillset and advancing it further. There was a lot of support regarding the problem sets and overall just understanding the more conceptual material, both on the part of the professor and the TFs.",
    "Not very many weaknesses. I do wish I could have learned even more skills I could apply to research, but that's not a fault of the class. We already learned so much in such a short period of time. Statistics can be kind of dry, but JT makes it fun, and not only is he great at explaining things, but he also shows you how the statistics concepts can be applied to social science research. Great class!",
    "This class moved so slowly that it was difficult to pay attention during lecture and the level of the Teaching Assistants varied drastically. JT is a really engaging person, but the course itself is pretty boring. I would have preferred more research \"applied\" examples using stata in class.",
    "Outside of the lecture, students were given freedom to connect with and get help from the professors and professional students. However, I think a lot of the learning, however, was independent. If you did well on the problem sets, you can keep up... if not it is hard to configure yourself in the flow of the course.",
    "In my opinion, this course only had strengths. The material was very interesting and the skills we learned very applicable. I enjoyed going to class and looked forward to completing the problem sets, something that does not always occur.",
    "The professor is great and delivers the information in a concise and easy to understand way, the only thing I would recommend is there being an official day of class dedicated to review of the material."

   "comments": [
    "Take if global\/easy QR. Otherwise no.",
    "I would not recommend this unless you are a Global Affairs major. Intro to Stats is a better class for learning the same material. If you are a prospective global affairs major, you should wait until admitted to the major before you take this class. Otherwise, it is a waste of time and does not provide adequate instruction in the material.",
    "not a basic statistics class but applies it to the real world, if Justin Thomas is teaching it, take it!!!! He makes the material super interesting",
    "It's a fine class, and if you're thinking about taking it you're probably applying to or are majoring in Global Affairs, so go for it.",
    "Any student who hasn't taken some sort of QR\/statistics class at Yale needs to take this. It's extremely helpful and gives practical skills (i.e. Stata and the ability to critically analyze research).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student - I think it's pretty important to have at least a basic understanding of statistics for most career paths, and this course really focused on the practical applications of statistics and really understanding and evaluating research results.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think it is important to have an understanding of statistics to have educated opinions about anything.",
    "Definitely recommend this as a fun statistics class. involves a lot of work, but you get as much out of it as you put in.",
    "Yes! This is a great class- qunatitative methods that are useful for pretty much everyone regardless of what you end up doing. Great, very engaging and easy to follow lectures. Straightforward and not overwhelming PSETS. JT is amazing. The bulk of the material is in the second half of the class though, post-midterm, so watch out for that. Also, definitely always opt for JTs office hours over the TFs, who are sometimes hit or miss regarding being able to answer your question.",
    "AQA is a great course for anybody interested in a decent QR with a very engaging professor. The content can sometimes get dry and lectures move relatively slow, but AQA teaches some useful skills. As a humanities major, I won't be doing statistical analyses anytime soon, but I found it rewarding to gain the skills necessary to evaluate research.",
    "Absolutely, 100% recommend to any students who want an introduction to statistics and to understand how to read regression tables and most research that's out there. This course prepares you for academia, life, and more. The professor, JT, is amazing, and the lectures are actually interesting for a subject that would otherwise seem difficult to comprehend\/pay attention to. The class is amazing.",
    "Do it if you have to - and you'll enjoy the Prof's teaching. But if you are considering studying statistics for anything other than Global Affairs then this course is probably too specific. Psets were tedious af (not hard just long) and arbitrarily graded by the mood of the TF.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course! I learned so much from this course and now feel much more confident in approaching statistical analyses and evaluating them. Professor Thomas is absolutely amazing and he will make sure you not only grasp the material but also enjoy it.",
    "Idk man. I think an intro class should have TA who are much much more helpful and approachable. Doessnt one of tthem TA a graduate class? I think she think she is dealing with professionals who just need a crash course\/.. Nah. Support students.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who do not have any background in statistics. Those who do might be better off taking a higher-level course, since this class spends a lot of time on basic concepts.",
    "Yes, because it helped me develop critical analysis skills necessary in every field of study.",
    "Yes, for global and non-global affairs students. It will introduce you to basic and advanced statistical skills, and will enhance your quantitative thinking skills in an applied relevant issues.",
    "Overall, it is a very good class. I strongly recommend this course for students who want to learn about statistics with its intuition. Generally, those types of courses include more quantitative methods and less interpretation. However, it is different and more beneficial.",
    "If a student is not required to take this class and is interested in learning statistics, I would probably recommend a STAT class instead. This is more geared towards the Global Major.",
    "Yeah! I would recommend you take this even if you aren't a global major. STATA is just a good skill to have, and JT is super engaging.",
    "Yes, this course was incredible, the material was interesting and the professor was amazing.",
    "If you wish to engage in any kind of social sciences-related research in the future, you should definitely take GLBL 121. It equips you with knowledge that is crucial in both producing your own research and evaluating others' work. The importance of statistics is growing these days, with the advent of Big Data. GLBL 121 presents statistics knowledge that any student would find interesting.",
    "Not unless it's a requirement for the major,",
    "YES!! While this may be a slightly difficult course if you are not used to mathematical\/statistical thinking, this is an excellent resum builder. Not only do you learn the basics of a statistical language, but you also develop key skills you can use to evaluate other's research. This is obviously not a course for someone who wants to major in statistics, but it is a great course for global\/political science majors who will have to evaluate other's research and maybe conduct some preliminary research on their own.",
    "100%. Really well taught and informative and, honestly, pretty fun.",
    "Yes, Professor Thomas is amazing and it was a great class.",
    "Even if you aren't interested in applying for Global Affairs - take this class! Professor Thomas is amazing and manages to make what seems to be a slightly boring subject really interesting and engaging. While the title of the class can make the material seem somewhat daunting - the class is not unnecessarily difficult of super challenging but it definitely forces you to really delve deeper into the material and gain a firmer grasp of the field. The weekly psets can take a while but are for the most part super straight forward. Overall, this class has been one of the highlights of my time at Yale.",
    "Wouldn't reccommend because I did not enjoy the material but if you have to take it or you like stats it really won't be that bad. Just stay up to date on material. JT is great. TFs were terrible.",
    "YES!!!!",
    "Yes - the knowledge and skills obtained from the course are useful and applicable to the real world. Also, Professor Thomas is an amazing teacher. Everyone should take a class with him and get to know him as a guy.",
    "I would recommend this course! An amazing QR and it provides you with skills that are really helpful in the working world! Also JT is AMAZING",
    "Yes, I would. This is a GREAT intro to statistics course. Professor Thomas is INCREDIBLY engaging.",
    "Absolutely, great for non STEM students",
    "Its a relatively easy class for Global affairs.",
    "i would recommend this course to any student who wants a basic understanding of statistics and has not taken statistics before colleges.",
    "Professor JT is great. He really is. He explains things clearly and using general English instead of \"Math\" and technical jargon. He's funny and really great with all of us in the class. That definitely helped. If you are able to keep up, then you'll do great and learn a lot, and it will be an amazing class. Get behind, and it's just about impossible for you to come back.",
    "I can honestly say that this class has made statistics interesting, and even enjoyable. From Justin Thomas, who is an incredible professor that made lectures fun and engaging, to the awesome TFs that helped out with this course, I felt like I learned so much through this course and learned a lot of analytical skills that have definitely helped me out in other classes I have taken as well. It is pretty awesome to do readings of scholarly articles for other classes and realize that I can understand their statistical methodologies--and even critique them in some areas! The work was manageable and the problem sets really helped set you up for success on the tests; everything was definitely very fair, and if you had a good grasp of the problem sets and the concepts discussed in class (go to lecture!!), then you will be just fine.",
    "Yes of course! JT is great, and statistics is really important for anyone going into the social sciences.",
    "This course is required for Global majors and is a reasonable quant class to fulfill distributional requirements--don't take this class for fun or for intellectual stimulation.",
    "It is a good QR. It allows students to think about how math and sciences are actually useful beyond college. However, it isnt necessarily interesting if you are looking for a class that makes you think critically beyond understanding some mthemaical theory and formulas. JT and the TAs are great and will help if you seek it. This is one of the best possible lecture math classes you can take. The exams are okay- the math is easy, but sometimes the theory came as a surprise. It was never hard, but unclear what possible questions and scopes would be asked and in what depth.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student that wants to learn the skills of statistics and how to evaluate research. I would also recommend this course to anyone looking for a QR credit, since its interesting and fun.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in statistics and statistical methods this is a great introductory course."
