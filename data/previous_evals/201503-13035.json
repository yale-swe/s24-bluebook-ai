   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it.",
    "A great overview of theory and research related to various psychopathologies.",
    "This course discusses the etiology of major psychological disorders and changes from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5. I highly recommend it because this information is very valuable for both clinical work and research.",
    "Yes. it is a great intro to psychopathology",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend it, because it is very interesting.",
    "Psyc 539 is a great peak at advanced psychopathology. Though you could dedicate entire courses let alone individual lectures to many disorders discussed, this meant for a very rich discussion in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those in their first year. It is very helpful in that it provides a broad overview of psychopathology without being superficial -- you don't just learn the DSM criteria, but you really delve into current conceptualizations of the disorders on a deeper, more mechanistic level. It is definitely a course worth taking.",
    "I would recommend it for any clinical graduate student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. However, I would recommend it more to a first or second year graduate student (or even an advanced undergrad\/RA), more than to an advanced graduate student. That said, taking it in later years of graduate school is somewhat nice as you realize how well the models reflect actual patients, and it was fun to hear about older students' clinical experiences in relation to the research."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Broadened my understanding of psychopathologies I am less aware of and highlighted the connections between them.",
    "Through this course I developed a greater understanding of the shared etiologies between the disorder I study and other disorders, which gives me fodder for future research ideas. Also, understanding the changes in the DSM-5 is really helpful for clinical work and for planning future research projects using these new criteria.",
    "This course taught about psychopathology. I will treat psychopathology and do research about it for years to come. Understanding it will help me do that.",
    "While other clinical courses have focused on the diagnostic criteria of disorders (which was helpful for clinical work), this course exposed us much more to the theoretical conceptualizations of disorders and the big picture questions that the field is grappling with in terms of diagnosis and treatment of psychopathology (which I see as more helpful for pointing us toward interesting research questions).",
    "We read far-reaching articles by leaders in the field. We got the chance to practice writing a research proposal.",
    "Understanding the politics behind changes to the DSM, as well as critically evaluating the RDoc model will surely help me moving forward, as will practice with grant writing.",
    "Parts of this course directly related to my research, and other parts related in ways that I did not realize before taking the course. Overall, it was very helpful in providing a foundation for my future research, as well as some interesting new ideas.",
    "This course led me to consider ways in which the disorder I primarily study may share common mechanisms with other disorders.",
    "I understand that students enrolled in this class have different levels of training and background.In the future, it would be more beneficial for students if the instructor assume that students know the basic material and spend more time on discussing difficult case examples, different assessment approaches, and research development."
