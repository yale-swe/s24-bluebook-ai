    "Why not?",
    "I would recommend this class for someone interested in statistics but who doesn't want to jump into a more rigorous course right away. The math is easy, if you know basic algebra you will be fine. The workload is light too, 6 problem sets in total and two tests.",
    "I would probably recommend a course in the STAT 100-106 sequence.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially if the student has trouble with math. For the most part, the math was not VERY challenging, though there definitely were some harder concepts. I think this is a class that makes it easy to succeed, even if you have trouble.",
    "I would recommend it if you need a QR.",
    "BEST POSSIBLE QR CLASS--great class for people who don't really love math because it's quantitative reasoning applied to actually interesting issues",
    "Yes definitely is you are looking for a manageable QR class. The textbook is actually really good-explains everything very well with interesting examples. Work-wise, the class is not too bad. Not a lot of reading and every other week a problem set. The problem sets can be difficult, however, so it helps if you form a study group. Donegan is a really nice professor. He is always willing to get together with his students and go over anything that is confusing. The midterm and final are really difficult.",
    "read the description. not a gut, but not hard either. if youre not strong with math and think stat has some interesting implications then take it",
    "I would recommend it to any student not inclined towards math.",
    "Recommended if you are bad at math."
