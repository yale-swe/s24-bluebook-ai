    "You learn a lot of new vocabulary that allows you to converse about a myriad of social topics relevant to China.",

   "comments": [
    "The course is very self-directed and large, which is both a strength and a weakness. You could get by fine without doing much of the work and speaking a handful of times when the professor cold calls you, but if you really put the work in you'll get a lot of the class, both in terms of knowledge and language skills. Could feel a bit impersonal. Readings aren't from textbooks but actual news articles and op-eds, which is nice. Important phrases and sayings are always explained thoroughly, which is nice as well.",
    "This course was very good all around. I think that the nature of the material covered was highly relevant and I enjoyed having the opportunity to talk about it in class.",
    "The professor is the strength. Zhou Laoshi cares so much about his students and his teaching reflects that.",
    "The course is graded in a way that is tailored towards the individual levels of each student as each student is of different levels. The readings are digestible and interesting. Perhaps the scheduling of presentations could be improved as they usually clash with other deadlines, but other than that I have no major qualms with the course.",
    "The course material is interesting and a great way to improve ones reading comprehension. The strength is no doubt the professor; Zhou laoshi is a caring and approachable teacher who always thinks of the students wellbeing first. Im so glad to have met him and shared a semester of Chinese with him!",
    "Weakness - class could have been more stimulating Strength - very enjoyable",
    "Great class, Zhou Laoshi is amazing."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to further their study of Chinese.",
