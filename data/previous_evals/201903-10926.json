   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn how to write in a productive and nonjudgmental place this is the class for you.",
    "I learned the mechanics of plot structure- how to create scenes of escalating beats and turn those scenes into a coherent story. I learned about the importance of sound in poetry.",
    "I learned how to be a writer. Through a focus on the forms of poetry, drama, and fiction, the course taught me fundamental skills that apply to all areas of creative writing and will form the foundation for further learning. I learned how to view other creative works through the lens of a writer (which is much different from the lens of a reader!) and began to develop an individual writing style. A few specific areas of strong creative writing the course focused on were the development of conflict, the use of sound, the creation of complex characters, and the use of externalization to convey information.",
    "I learned a ton about viewing writing as a craft, and how to use simple, widely-used methods to tell stories. This class made writing seem a lot more accessible to me after deconstructing great pieces of literature, as well as film and TV scripts and scenes.",
    "I gained skills in creative writing and voice.",
    "I learned the basics of writing fiction, poetry, and drama.",
    "I developed a passion and appreciation for different forms of creative writing that I hadn't considered as potential mediums for storytelling before. The course was very thoughtfully presented in a way that allowed for observation and exploration of different practices of writing. I know that many of these stories and poems will influence my writing for years to come, as well as the writing I watched and read from my classmates.",
    "I learned so much about a solid foundational approach to creative writing.",
    "Great class - learned the fundamentals of writing short stories, poems, and plays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was led by a productive and encouraging professor who inspired students to not be afraid of taking risks.",
    "I liked the workshops, I felt like the feedback I received was useful. If anything I could have done with a bit more negative feedback bc the course was extremely positive.",
    "This course is the best class I have ever taken. I really feel as if the way I view writing (and, not to be dramatic, but the world) has changed. I was amazed with how formulaic good creative writing can be, and appreciated being in a class environment that embraced the demystification of it. The structure of the coursea combination of workshop, seminar, and lecturewas effective in providing a broad introduction to creative writing as a field and the creative writing program at Yale (as well as exposing students to several true experts in the areas of poetry, fiction, and drama). The strongest part of the class was, of course, Professor Green. He is not only a very talented writer, but an amazing instructor. He treated every student like a fellow writer from day one, and was able to fit a remarkable amount of content and learning into a semester. I am hard-pressed to think of ways to improve this course.",
    "I don't think there were any weaknesses in this class.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Green is an incredible teacher, and his ability to enhance the writing of his students is incredible. Weaknesses: I think having a few more writing exercises would've been helpful.",
    "The entire course was lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and every class was a joy. Please continue offering this class! However, it is unfortunate that it does not count as a writing credit, even though every assignment for this class was writing in some way. Having this class count as a writing credit would make it more accessible to students who want to take the course but have to choose another class instead because they need to fulfill a writing credit distributional requirement. Another strength of this course is the small class size. The intimate nature of the class lends itself towards growth and comfort when sharing stories and ideas. The Plenary group lectures were also very well done and nice beginnings for each unit. The structure of the three units was effective and straight-forward. I honestly wouldn't change a thing.",
    "I thought this course was incredible and one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I loved how, throughout the course, we studied three different types of writing. It allowed me to explore forms of writing that I might not otherwise have and it was really nice seeing the connections between the different units. I also found reading and discussing pieces, particularly those of fellow classmates during workshops, to be extremely valuable. Every exercise we did was extremely valuable, both in and of itself and as preparation for the final piece of the unit",
    "Strengths: Amazingly designed, opportunity to talk with people who make their livings as writers, fluid classroom setting and empathetic teachers, amazing classmates who are passionate but not pretentious about creative writing, exploring writing for film with an experienced teacher Weaknesses: Some of the assignments could be better articulated in terms of expectation (how long is a monologue?), the requirement for reflection after attending a reading was unclear, some of the feedback can feel overly positive (but that's also a strength, especially if you're nervous about writing)",
    "I believe this course was incredibly strong because with our smaller class size, every person received individual feedback and opportunity to improve their writing.",
    "Awesome guest speakers. Excellent teaching from Prof. Green. Fun to do the work if you enjoy writing."

   "comments": [
    "You won't regret it. I think it's one of the best taught classes at Yale.",
    "I would! If you like creative writing this is the place to start. Or if you dont know if you like creative writing but want to find out, it is also a good choice.",
    "Take this class (and take it with Professor Green if you can)! It is structured to be enjoyable and accessible to students from all academic backgrounds and interests, whether that be a STEM major who is terrified of the humanities or an English major who wishes to become a writer (and everything in between). You will not regret it.",
    "Yes absolutely! It makes creative writing accessible to anyone who is interested, even if you don't have much prior experience!",
    "Yes! I think any student should take this course. If you are interested in creative writing or English, this course is a phenomenal way to get introduced to the creative writing scene and faculty on campus. If you are a student who has limited experience with the area (like me), this course is a great way to relieve stress and try something new.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to another student. I loved every minute of class. As a STEM student, this class was a wonderful break from my usual pset work. I loved the small size of the class and we all became quite close and even did writing exercises together outside of the classroom. If you like creative writing in any way, whether you write fiction, poetry, drama, or screenplays, this class is a must take. Even if you don't have much prior experience in creative writing (I had no formal experience prior to this class) take it! It is so much fun.",
    "I would highly highly recommend this course to another student. The class changed the way I think about creative writing and made me eager to continue pursing creative writing in the future.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student for a comfortable yet rigorous environment to explore a passion for writing.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in creative writing.",
    "Definitely recommend. Took as a junior. Professor Green is excellent. Homework is more writing than reading - I enjoyed it. Not necessarily an easy A, but hard work can get an A- for sure."
