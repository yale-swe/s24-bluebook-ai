    "Zigler Lecture Series: Weekly, hour-long Friday lectures with some amazing speakers. Varies each semester given the nature of the course. Definitely recommended - low time commitment, manageable workload (choice between weekly responses and a final paper, introduce a speaker of your choice).",
    "She's teaching it again as Thinking 479. Take it!",
    "Great way to do some psyc research at yale!!",
    "Yes!",
    "Research for credit -- choose a good lab!",
    "If you're looking for research experience but want less of a time commitment or fewer pages to write at the end (or you're worried you'll run out of allowed research credits that you can use for the psych major), then enroll in this half-credit course! The experience will vary greatly depending on what lab you work in, so it's hard to say whether I'd recommend it, but research experience is useful and can be super fun so go for it!",
    "Good class engaging how we (mistakenly) think about things and how we can improve our thinking in the future. Quizzes were very fair (compared to last semester when they were a bit trickier!). Readings and questions this semester were very reasonable and very fairly\/nicely graded. Some questions were a little open-ended\/ambiguous and were sometimes a pain to answer. Other questions tried to incorporate WAY too much material to fit into the 1000-character limit. Otherwise, very useful (and fun!) class that will be one of my fonder memories of classes at Yale :)",
    "I would recommend. The time commitment is six hours per week, which is not that great. It was also incredible to feel that I was working in my field of interest and not just learning about it.",
    "I highly recommend it if you are interested in research.",
    "Definitely would recommend this to anyone who is interested in this topic.",
    "Great opportunity to do research. Make sure to pick an advisor and a lab that you really connect with. Overall great experience. I really connected with the graduate student that I was working with and I learned a lot working in the lab.",
    "The half-credit directed research course is the best way to prepare for the senior project.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE A RESEARCH TOPICS CLASS if you are a freshman or sophomore thinking about majoring in psychology or cognitive science. A half-credit, it will allow you to get your feet wet in a lab while preserving a good portion of your three lab credits available to you as a psychology major. The course's hands-on experience is useful in helping one to apply information learned in psychology lecture and seminar courses to experimental practice and its setup facilitates one's association with a new group of individuals who share the same interests."
