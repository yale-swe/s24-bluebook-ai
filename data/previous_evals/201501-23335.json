    "It was like a reading seminar. It was interesting to talk about a variety of different topics but we didn't cover any in too much depth. We had some great discussions.",
    "Strengths: well structured, catered to student interest, discussion based Weaknesses: Discussion was sometimes around the same points, just focused on a different scenario.",
    "Maybe have more of a mix-up of assignments- weekly write-ups become predictable.. discussions were really good though!",
    "Great topic, but I thought it was odd that we finished an hour early every week, and that the sole focus of the class appeared to be critiquing one article each week. I would have preferred the instructor to give more lectures, especially given her strong background in\/vast knowledge of perinatal epidemiology. I would have also liked for student-led introductions to the topic to take place the week before the article was due, so that we had some background information before reading the article.",
    "This class helped me become better at reading and evaluating epidemiology papers, but I believe there is still room for improvement in this regard. We spent most classtime just discussing the topics relevant to the paper each week, but I think the experience could have been improved by allocating some time each week to discuss and reinforce general epidemiology topics (e.g., misclassification, publication bias, quality of prenatal data) as they relate to the study of prenatal health.",
    "Heavily discussion based, it is an ideal course for anyone interested in discussing various topics related to perinatal health."

    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0Always willing to provide additional information on any subject matter that interests you, she was an ideal instructor for someone looking for more information on perinatal topics. She's also got a great sense of humor and is very approachable."
