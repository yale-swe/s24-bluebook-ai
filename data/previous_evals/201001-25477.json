    "Good material, good teaching, not too difficult but the material is useful in the sense that you start understanding what is going on when you read the newspaper. I would take it if I was a freshman again.",

    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS NO MATTER WHAT REASON. Professor alonso is good hearted person but she is a terrible teacher. Not only can she not communicate the material but actually confused me. The material is interesting but her lectures are truly PAINFUL. Supposedly this class has an easier curve, but getting a better grade is absolutely not worth this class.. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Do not take it if you are with Alonso. Try taking the other seminar if you want to learn something. Taking intermediate Macro would be more helpful. Or reading a macro book in your free time will tons more beneficial than listening to Alonso",
    "I would take this seminar, because it is comparatively better than the big lecture. Also, if this is a prerequisite for other courses that you would like to take, then I would take the course.",
    "quite an easy class.",
    "I would recommend taking it if you want to do a little bit more math in your intro class than in the lecture. It's pretty easy though if you have any intuition for how economics works.",
    "I would only recommend it if you want an easier class while also learning less. Otherwise take the lecture or take the seminar with another professor."
