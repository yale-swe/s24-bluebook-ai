   "comments": [
    "Logical arguments. Reading primary philosophy texts.",
    "I learned about a lot of different philosophers that I'd only heard of but never really taken any time to find out more about. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper, which was really good as it made me write much more clearly than most other papers have asked me to.",
    "By reading the works of Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Conway, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant, I learned some of the main philosophical ideas of these masterminds in philosophical history and developed my skill of writing critical essays and analyzing arguments.",
    "Think philosophically and critically. Knowledge of metaphysics.",
    "A better knowledge of this period of philosophy",
    "I got better at reconstructing arguments and started thinking about philosophers in terms of their systems.",
    "I learned a lot about the strategies employed by metaphysicians in this period. One example is the principle of sufficient reason: that everything has explanation. Another example is parsimony (Occham's razor), whereby one does not posit more entities than is necessary. I feel like I have a good understanding of how people might use these principles to try to answer questions you might think are beyond the human capacity to answer.",
    "AMAZING!!! This class totally penetrated my thinking about things faraway from philosophy. I've become a much better reasoner and clearer writer in all classes.",
    "Learned a lot about some key philosophers from the early modern period, and did a lot of argument reconstruction, if I had to name one specific skill.",
    "Great introduction to all the major modern philosophers\/schools of thought",
    "This course changed my view on what I have always taken as granted facts. We went over what it means to exist or what does it means for something to be a substance. It was a lot of metaphysics but I learned a lot taking a class that was out of my comfort zone and getting more acquainted with more challenging philosophical readings.",
    "Philosophical analysis was very new to me, and I've learned how to navigate through it.",
    "I was introduced to the field of philosophy",
    "I got a great introduction to Early Modern Philosophy.",
    "I learned what many early philosophers thought about various topics. However, I did not learn well how to analyze these ideas or critique them. I gained knowledge but not necessarily critical thinking or writing skills.",
    "I learned how to write philosophy papers and interpret philosophical texts.",
    "I learned a lot about both the thoughts and arguments of modern philosophers, and about the nature of philosophical thinking and writing.",
    "Developed skill of writing papers, built knowledge of notable and important philosophers",
    "Great overview of modern philosophy, from Descaretes to Kant.",
    "This class is a great one to help students delve into the world of philosophy and teach us how to discuss philosophy well and how to write papers.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of metaphysical and epistemological views of modern philosophers Descartes through Kant.",
    "I learned the basics of philosophy and read works from classic philosophers. I learned how to read and write philosophical papers and how to question basic facts and assumptions of life.",
    "This was an excellent survey course of the key philosophers of the 17th century to the 20th century and their foundational ideas of metaphysics.",
    "This course allowed me to develop knowledge about and insights into important philosophical themes in modern philosophy, such as skepticism and idealism. I also learned how to write philosophy papers.",
    "Philosophical arguments, how to write a philosophical paper, intro to major philosophical themes and early modern philosophers",
    "This class covers Early Modern Philosophy in detail, and is most beneficial to a student that desires to understand how philosophical arguments and philosophical papers are developed.",
    "This class taught me about what modern philosophers thought and about how to approach metaphysical issues and arguments.",
    "I learned about the ideas and methods of modern philosophy through lectures and rigorous papers and productive sections.",
    "I learned a lot about Descares, Leibniz, Kant, Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and some other philosophers.",
    "-Analyze texts philosophically -Compare philosophers on key issues",
    "Carefully curated overview of a broad swath of philosophical history, providing a necessary familiarity with the most important terms, the most influential figures, and the approach to philosophy at the dawn of modernity. Left with a better understanding of how to write in philosophy, and perhaps even how to reason. Essential building block for a well-rounded education, and something I wish I'd had much earlier (I'm a engineer-turned-medical student).",
    "I developed my general view of all the other things with philosophy class. It was not an easy experience as I already had my views. the course helped me to think through with the help from professor Della Rocca."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of the material just seems completely unrelated to real life, which turned me off a bit. I think MDR is extremely knowledgeable about the material and is probably the best person to learn from, but the material was just incredibly inapplicable to real life in my opinion. If this type of philosophy is intrinsically interesting to you, I think it's probably a good course, though.",
    "I think this course is great! Even though we were not able to get into great details to the philosophy of each philosophers due to time constraint, I think it is a fair trade off for us to have a broad survey of modern philosophy. (Definitely take more philosophy course to know each of the philosopher bette!)",
    "The course is well-taught. Very engaging and interesting.",
    "The paper topics are so based on reconstructing arguments (which were reconstructed in class\/section) and providing counterarguments (which was also done in section) that they were really just an exercise in regurgitation and did not improve my understanding of the material at all",
    "Strengths: GREAT lectures! Clear, organized, and entertaining! I am glad that actual world is one in which MMTC exists and MDR taught Intro to Modern Phil in Spring 2017! Weakness: Will was a good TF, but maybe section would have gone more smoothly if he was given some direction about how many sections to dedicate to each philosopher. Things moved quickly at the end of the semester and our schedule was pushed back because of the make up schedule but we never even mentioned Kant!",
    "Excellent instructor and T.A. The class brings a variety of motivated students together to study humanities, which I think is awesome. The material feels quite a bit closer to heart than the material in Intro Ancient Philosophy. Having just two assignments encouraged me to put a lot of careful thought into them.",
    "Amazing course. The only thing that felt frustrating was that in both essays and class discussions, very little room for personal opinion (or in essays, a conclusion that had some food for thought). Anything other than analysis of the texts was considered superfluous. However, for the an intro course, this was a really good skill to develop. Overall, material is fascinating, MDR is incredible, and my writing and thinking improved greatly.",
    "Great lectures, and a solid choice of readings. The \"Finest Hour\" parts were a great highlight, and I know that that's going to stick with me. I would recommend paper topics that are a bit less specific, though it really wasn't much of a problem.",
    "Prof. Della Rocca's enthusiasm is contagious and he's a great lecturer",
    "This course was so well taught that even if I would go to lectures without understanding the reading, I would get out with a solid grasp of what we were discussing and how it was connected to what we had previously read.",
    "I loved Introduction to Modern Philosophy!",
    "I think Professor Della Rocca was a great lecturer and kept the course organized and interesting. I would have appreciated more guidance on the papers though. I know it's not a writing course, but some explanations during lecture of what makes a good philosophy paper would have been good, rather than learning by doing. Overall a great course with a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "Professor Della Rocca is very passionate and knowledgeable. However, I did not find myself very engaged during lectures, perhaps because I did not share these passions. In my opinion, too much of the class was spent answering questions that didn't help students learn, only satisfied the egos of class members. The two papers were unhelpful, and only required the ability to summarize arguments and respond to very limited and specific prompts, not to think critically about these philosophers' ideas and their implications. At times, the material seemed more like science than philosophy, and I was disappointed to spend a lot of time talking about science that has long been disproven rather than exciting philosophical ideas. Section was helpful in terms of reconstructing arguments, but not necessarily in terms of critiquing ideas or placing them in context. The course in general lacked context for these ideas, which I think is one of the most interesting parts of studying philosophy, especially if the ideas are about science that has long been disproven. Without this context, material seems irrelevant.",
    "I think the course does a great job of giving a survey of philosophers and their thought; lecture is great for summarizing, and section great for discussion. I did find that there was not a lot of guidance with writing the papers, and I wish I had been able to receive more feedback as well.",
    "This course is fantastic; Prof. Della Rocca is a great lecturer, and he also seemed to really care about his students. Perhaps the only weakness was a lack of feedback on writing: we wrote only two essays, and after the first received a paragraph of feedback, but that was all. For me, that wasn't enough to really learn how to improve my philosophical writing.",
    "MDR and Reier were both awesome. The syllabus was well constructed.",
    "It was nice to have main points down on the board, but you didn't always make it clear which point you were talking about, or you skipped through certain points. Other than that it was great.",
    "This course focuses on the two paper assignments as well as the final exams, but it is sometimes difficult to judge your performance during the bulk of the course. Without any printed reference papers, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of review topics.",
    "Strengths: The professor. He really helps bring the course to life with his very active voice that draws your attention to what he's saying. He honestly helps make the class very enjoyable for me. The class is also very organized and harkens back very often to past philosophers, which really helps consolidate the course into my memory. Weaknesses: I just wish we had more time in the semester to talk about more philosophy.",
    "Fascinating lectures and interesting essay topics.",
    "The class had very little outside work. Only 3 papers and the readings. MDR is great at explaining the material and is very familiar with the subject matter. I think this course could be improved in organization. I was sometimes confused as to what the readings were for a certain week.",
    "The lecture format is fantastic. Professor Della Rocca does an awesome job of structuring his content in lecture that made review both for writing essays and studying for the final low stress and efficient. Furthermore, the information in the lectures is perfect in forming an understanding of each philosopher and informing section discussion and essays. There is not much I would change about the course!",
    "This course was a great introduction to modern philosophy. It covered a lot of important topics and lectures were always interesting and engaging. Professor Della Rocca was a phenomenal professor.",
    "By nature of the course couldn't go into much depth with each philosopher. But a very good introduction overall. Della Roca is great and section was useful and interesting",
    "I feel that the philosophers chosen for this class are great choices to represent the time period. I feel that Dr. Della Rocca does an excellenct job of explaining these arguments using examples and visual depictions. At the same time, I feel like this class should be named \"Intro to Modern Metaphysics\" instead of philosophy. Almost all, if not all, philosophy that we studies at length involved metaphysical arguments, no ethics, aesthetics, or political philosophy.",
    "This class is a fun introduction to modern philosophers. Readings were well thought out and planned. It could use better organization, however.",
    "The lectures were very effective. I think section could have been a little more directed in the discussions.",
    "Lectures by Della Rocca are clear and engaging. TA ran section BEAUTIFULLY--was always a productive and enlightening conversation without being competitive.",
    "I wish the presentation of the philosophers had been more thematic, and less organized by discrete philosophers.",
    "The course focused more on what various philosophers believed and less on the philosophical viability of their beliefs. I would have appreciated engagement with more recent secondary.",
    "This course is really good at conveying what each philosopher thought, but wasn't as engaging in encouraging students to write from original positions, which makes sense given that it's a History of Philosophy course.",
    "-Great continuity of philosophers -Lectures were always engaging",
    "Professor is extraordinary. Discussion group adds a lot, letting students play with the discussed ideas on their own. Very strong survey course. Course materials cover an appropriate amount of ground, offering enough depth to keep content interesting and useful, without sacrificing the breadth required of a survey course.",
    "Clear guidelines in every courses, sections, office hours and help from TF."

   "comments": [
    "If they are interested in philosophy, then yes without a doubt. However, if they don't like philosophy or are ambivalent about it, then no.",
    "If you have to take it, then what are you gonna do. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't really interested in philosophy, or if you like your classes to be readily applicable to real life. It's pretty abstract which can be angering. MDR is a great teacher, though, and you'll definitely learn things.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to another student. The ability of critical thinking is important no matter which major you are going to pursue. Taking a philosophy course requires you to read critically and actively. It is also super fun.",
    "Yes. Take this class to learn about metaphysics and modern philosophy. MDR is such a great professor.",
    "If you're interested in this era of philosophy, or philosophy in general, take this class. MDR's lectures are engaging, and the readings aren't too bad. The weakness of the course, however, is that it is a survey course, so you do very little in-depth work and the paper topics are terribly boring, basically regurgitating arguments and objections you've already read and heard in lecture and section.",
    "If you took FOL in the fall, this class is pretty straight forward. You get an overview of Descartes, Conway, Malabranche, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant. We spent around 2~3 weeks on Descartes. I wish we spent less time on him so we could spend more time on Kant, but I thought it was necessary to ease freshman and nonmajors to the class. If you are a nonmajor and just interested in learning about early modern philosophy, this class was REALLY accessible with MDR. I cannot recommend him enough. His lectures are clear and organized. MDR is also hilarious in his own way. I looked forward to lectures. Two papers (30% each), final (30%), and section (10%) make up your grade. The papers are straightforward. You are given the choice of 5~7 prompts on 2~3 philosophers.",
    "PSR: Everything is intelligible. Everything has an explanation for why it is or is not. If you think trying to answer metaphysical questions with a premise like that is a worthy endeavor, take this class. If you're generally interested in how people have gone about trying to answer metaphysical questions, take this class. Really enjoyed it, especially the Berkeley.",
    "YES!! If you're not a philosophy major but interested in dabbling, this is a great course for you.",
    "Yes, this is material that everyone should know, and this is a clear and concise way to learn a good deal about it.",
    "Yeeees, if you are interested in philosophy and not just ethics , but also some of the most challenging questions regarding the nature of substance and existence. I would warn however that most of the course was focused on metaphysics, and that it might become a bit repetitive.",
    "Would definitely recommend! Course content is interesting, and Professor Della Rocca does an amazing job of making it more accessible.",
    "Great survey course of famous philosophers and their key ideas",
    "Great course studying intro to philosophy. Some material (like most of the metaphysics) can be boring on the surface but is really interesting and engaging if you think about the ways it affects our thinking all the time. Michael Della Rocca does a great job at helping with this thing. As for the papers, try to get some criticism from your peers or during office hours before submitting, as it can be hard to write a philosophy paper if you've never done one before. The final isn't too bad, just make sure you understand the themes of the course on a broader scale.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has to take it for the philosophy major, but not to anyone who wants to take a fun\/interesting class. Professor was good but the structure of the class and some of the material was not engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student mildly interested in philosophy because the readings are all essential and well summarized by MDR. I also found the level of critical analysis important for my own intellectual growth and ability to construct an argument\/objection.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a fascinating topic, taught extremely well by Michael Della Rocca.",
    "This course is what it says on the box, taught thoroughly and well.",
    "Great survey class. You don't necessarily have to do the readings, just pay attention in class, and your essays can be written about one of the topics covered. The readings are a great supplement if the argument is detailed, but the professor does a great job of explaining.",
    "An excellent course in modern philosophy, taught by a brilliant professor. The lectures were highly engaging, and Professor Della Rocca makes himself very accessible both after class and during his office hours. I came in with no background in philosophy whatsoever, and I was able to thoroughly enjoy the concepts and arguments embodied in this course. The papers are reasonable and the final exam was fair in all regards, although they definitely were not a piece of cake either.",
    "If you're interested in learning something about philosophy, take it. However, be warned that #1 it's harder to get an A in philosophy than other departments (ask Shelly Kagan about this), and #2 it's just not going to be as good if Professor Della Rocca is not teaching it.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Yes! Modern Philosophy with MDR was incredible. Every lecture is engaging and thought provoking.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you think you are interested in philosophy. I found through taking this course that philosophy is not my favorite subject area, but I am still grateful I took it because I was able to learn the most classic philosophical beliefs. If you don't think you like philosophy, I wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course! It is definitely not what I was expecting from an intro philosophy course, as I was thinking it would be less metaphysics based than it turned out to be, but once I looked passed this and engaged with the material, it was a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a fantastic introduction to modern philosophy, with important philosophers and themes. Professor Della Rocca was a phenomenal professor and was accessible and an engaging lecturer. I think philosophy is an extremely important subject for everyone to be exposed to.",
    "Definitely. I had never taken philosophy before and found the class a great introduction to the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to take a single philosophy class - it will allow him or her to understand how philosophy is argued.",
    "Ok fifth credit. Lectures could be a bit disorganized, but we got some good resources to tie things together in the end. The policy that TA's aren't allowed to read rough drafts is a bit ridiculous--if you put in the work, you should be allowed to show that.",
    "This course really helped me practice clear thinking strategies which I think will be useful. It is not a gut, but the workload is fairly light, depending on how much you read.",
    "Yes, this course helped me get a good scope of philosophy I was unfamiliar with, and that I think paves the way for understanding of further philosophy.",
    "-Absolutely! This course is great, and it provides you with a clear background of key thinkers in modern philosophy.",
    "Absolutely recommend; crucial component of a foundational knowledge in the humanities, well-taught by an obviously-capable orator.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend any students who interested in AI to take the course to have fundamental knowledge."
