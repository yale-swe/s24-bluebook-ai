    "You'll know the first day of shopping if it's your kind of thing.",
    "No. It's an easy CS credit but I didn't learn anything. The psets were kinda cool in retrospect and the workload was VERY low (esp for CS) but it's kind of a waste of a class.",
    "I rarely went to lecture and when I did I barely paid attention. Rokhlin says that he lectures so as to make people not show up, and it works.So you just worry about the problem sets, and to get the insights you need for that you just interact with the TA, who does a good job teaching very cool algorithms for the psets. But they have nothing to do with the class. This course only has 3-4 programming problem sets, and that's it.",
    "Didn't really do much for this class, only had a few problem sets, no exams at all. If that's the load you get, go for it. It's as much as you want to take out of it, and the Russian prof is pretty hilarious if you end up going to the lectures."
