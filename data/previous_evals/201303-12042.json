    "TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T. Seriously, it's just one of those classes everyone should take before they leave Yale. For non-history majors, it's a fairly easy introduction to a history class and for people who are history majors, it's just a wonderful class to take. Seriously the highest recommendations for this class-take it!",
    "Fun, educational, thought provoking",
    "I would recommend it ridiculously highly. One of the most enjoyable classes I've ever taken.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. If you're at all interested in LGBT\/social history in America, you will love this course. It will profoundly change the way you view the LGBT movements of today, both at Yale and in America as a whole. Fantastic class.",
    "Must-take class.",
    "Amazing class. Definitely one to take credit D if you are taking it as your 5th class because their is a lot of reading and the midterm is difficult.",
    "Excellent course! Not only is the material interesting, but it's presented in a cohesive and clear way that even a science major like myself can understand. The sections are incredibly helpful at further exploring the material; overall it's a great Hu credit. Only 2 5-6 page papers, a midterm, and a final, and all of those aren't too difficult to handle. For one of the papers you get to interview your parents andgrandparents about homosexuality and relate what they say to what you learned was going on during those time periods. I definitely suggest taking this course if you are at all interested in the material!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!It's really amazing. Chauncey's lectures are more like stories than anything else. There is a good amount of reading but it's manageable and it's interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much that will shatter your preconceived notions, broaden your view of gay and lesbian history, and shape how you think about gender and sexuality issues in contemporary America. It is a fun, engaging course with kind and caring teachers and students who are interested in learning about the material.",
    "US Lesbian& Gay History is a survey course of LGBTQ+ history in the United States since the Puritans. You seriously learn EVERYTHING, romantic friendships between men and women in the 1700s and 1800s, flappers, gender roles, mannish women, butch\/femme relationships, lesbian feminism and separatism, the lavender scare, AIDS, sexual revolution, the influence of the christian right, the marriage issue, Harvey Milk. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone and anyone. It is fantastic. You learn so much. You think differently. You love Chauncey. Just take it.",
    "Great class! I would definitely recommend it. One of the best at Yale. A great learning experience with a great professor. Papers aren't too bad. Midterm is graded fairly. Section is really interesting. This class is a must take.",
    "AMST 135 is a comprehensive study of gay and lesbian history from the earliest records of same-sex attraction in Greek and colonial times, through the present-day homophile movement. It is such a fascinating, relevant, and important part of history, and I absolutely LOVED this clase. PLEASE take this class you will not regret it!! Everyone should know this stuff, and the course is taught in such an incredible way I looked forward to the lectures every day.",
    "This is a general survey of US mostly white gay and sometimes lesbian history. I enjoyed the course but as a senior American Studies\/ERM major found it a bit repetitive and did not really offer me anything new.",
    "Excellent survey of gay activism and the plight of queers starting in the late 19th century. Chauncey is such a compelling lecturer who has had so much of a role in participating in the gay movement that it would be a mistake not to take this course before you graduate. Take it from a senior.",
    "A fantastic class. There is no reason why you shouldn't take it. The readings are interesting - I loved doing them because it didn't feel like homework. Chauncey is an amazing lecturer, I loved going to class. The workload in general is pretty light with only two papers, a midterm, and a final. I only wish the lectures were longer! Seriously take it.",
    "A manageable but tough class that truly gets you to reevaluate how you understand issues of sexuality and American society.",
    "Take this class. It's fascinating, informative, and a type of history that you probably won't learn anywhere else. Prof. Chauncey is amazing. The only downside to it is that there isn't a \"Part 2\"!!",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to everyone at Yale. Whether or not it sounds interesting, take it. You will enjoy the material and class time will fly by; you will want more time with Chauncey! The assignments are unique and really force you to explore more personal connections to historical narratives. One of the best courses Yale offers with arguably Yale's best professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to every single Yale student so they could be less ignorant on very important issues that consistently get pushed to a dark corner. This course explores US history in a completely different way and shows that LGBT history did NOT begin at Stonewall.",
    "AWESOME CLASS. A MUST-TAKE. Chauncey is incredible and the course is really worth it. The workload is very reasonable. Though it is probably not necessary to do all the reading to do well, it is fascinating material and worth reading. The exams and papers are reasonable and fair. A great introduction to LGBT history for LGBT students and anyone else interested in the topics.",
    "US Lesbian and Gay History is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Even if you think you know the material of the course, you don't. I promise. It's amazing--Chauncey is at the center of his field, his lectures are clear, sweeping, and powerful. I highly recommend you, yes you, take this before you graduate.",
    "AMST 135 is an overview of sexuality--and the interaction between 'mainstream' culture and the developing 'gay' culture--from colonial times to the present. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's one of the most incredible, transformative courses I have taken at Yale. This class convinced me to be an American Studies major.",
    "Great class! Brilliant lectures. The essays are really dumb though and pointless so I'd say audit this one. A don't miss in terms of lectures, but the rest is really not necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! If you are at all interested in the subject matter, it is amazing and you learn so much that you never knew before! It is not a ton of work and the lectures and Professor Chauncey are amazing! It is a great class to take with friends, so find a group and convince them to all take it with you.",
    "Absolutely. It lives up to its reputation.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone.",
    "Yes, take it. You won't regret it.",
    "I recommend this class to everyone! It's one of those classes that you must take before graduating. The lectures are wonderful, and flow perfectly. The material is very eye opening and interesting. It's a great course!",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter, take the course. Its a twice a week lecture, with generally manageable levels of reading that you discuss once a week in section. Two paper, a midterm, and a final. If you've taken an American studies class before this one, you know what this looks like.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History was the best lecture class I took at Yale and for someone with either a stake in the subject matter it was incredibly compelling and moving. Even for non-LGBTQ students the class offers an alternative historical understanding of America during the twentieth century, as seen through the eyes of a sexual minority, and offers context not found in any other classes at Yale.",
    "Yes, it's a very interesting and relevant class to our generation. Not only will you learn about the history of homosexuality, but you will also learn how heterosexuality emerged in relation to homosexuality. Chauncey is great and I highly recommend the class.",
    "An interesting history course with a lot of cool and meaningful lessons.",
    "Take it take it take it. This is basically the class that made me want to be an AmStud major!!",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "All I can say is, TAKE THIS CLASS. Or, just shop it - because if you go to the first lecture you'll be hooked. You'll get to listen to a lot of music, watch some amazing movies, laugh a lot at Professor Chauncey's fantastic sense of humor... and actually learn. A lot. I retained so much information that I took notes on in lecture that studying for the final was relatively easy, because the material actually is that interesting. And your mind will continuously be blown by how many important historical events you've never heard about, because this history isn't even mentioned in high school. Fix those gaping holes in your knowledge of US history - take this class!",
    "A great overview of US gay and lesbian history taught by one of the best professors in the field. Lectures are required, readings are amazing, and the material is interesting to everyone.",
    "This is a comprehensive survey of Gay and Lesbian history in the US from about 1850 to the present. If you are looking for a class that only focuses on Gay Liberation movement as we have known it since 1969, this is not exactly it. While theclass does cover a huge amount of that era, there is also a massive amount of historical change that occurs in the century prior. I feel that everyone should take this course - regardless of your orientation - because it reveals the struggles that so many people endured over the generations. Chauncey is undoubtedly one of the best lecturers at Yale, so the class is worth it for that alone. Unfortunately, he doesn't share his materials, so taking good notes is essential (there's no wi-fi connection to tempt you away...a big plus of taking class in the YUAG auditorium). Take this class!",
    "A must take before graduating! Super relevant to current affairs and it really allows you to understand the background leading up to DOMA and gay marriage debates, etc. I'm a history major and it was interesting how interrelated the",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic. The lectures are fun and the professor is amazing.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Everyone should take this course at some point in their four years.",
    "This course is a remarkable journey through the history of same-sex attraction and relationships in America. It covers everything you likely ever wondered about gay men or lesbians and then explains the historical origins of what it covered. Every class starts and ends with music that fits the theme of the lecture, and the mood and energy level never drop from there. Professor Chauncey is a truly amazing lecturer and his lectures and slideshows are a rich presentation of a subject about which he knows an astounding amount.To anyone interested in this course because of personal experience (identity; past activism; anything like that): you will get a bit of review of what you already know from your own experiences, but this course will enrich your knowledge ten times over. I took this course after a good deal of activism and found my fundamental perception of sexuality to be a little different by the end of the course (no--the course didn't turn me gay; it made me see sexual orientation in a historical light as well as in its modern context).I can't speak for courses I haven't taken, but from my experience of this course and from public opinion I've heard I can say that this is one of Yale's finest courses. Come on--take it! You know you want to.",
    "I would strongly recommend US Lesbian and Gay History to anyone interested in thinking about how society organizes sexuality and relationships over time--not just to lgbt students.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. This course presented a side of history that is not often discussed, but ESSENTIAL to understanding the way this country functions today.",
    "This class is amazing in that you are able to learn so much about a topic that many people don't know exist. Heterosexual and homosexual students alike can benefit from a course like this. Very interesting and changes your views on things. If you can take this class, do it.",
    "This an outstanding course. Professor Chauncey's knowledge of the subject is unparalleled, and lectures are fascinating. Even if you have prior interest in or knowledge of the topic, you will likely find yourself quite surprised by much of the information covered. This course led me to question our classic presentation of history and place the gay rights movement in historical context. It is a worthwhile class for anybody, regardless of major, and I would highly recommend it. There is certainly a fair amount of work (lengthy readings for which you will be held accountable at section), but it is all interesting and worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students. It is a transformative class in which you learn about a history that is almost never spoken about.",
    "Amazing class. Of all the courses I've taken at Yale (I'm a DS alumna History major), this one changed my perspective on life the most. Chauncey basically reveals a whole hidden history, a side of America you never knew existed. His lectures are really interesting, too: every class starts with a song, and every lecture is super organized and therefore easy to follow.Two papers based on the reading and material covered in class, and one interview-based paper at the end, as well as a midterm and final. Totally manageable amount of material, and all the reading is so interesting that I didn't even notice I was doing classwork.You have every reason to take this class.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. The lectures are extremely well organized and interesting. Chauncey is an amazing professor, and this class is a great introduction to a typical history\/american studies lecture. You don't have to do all the readings but some of them are super cool.",
    "Take it! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The papers are a bit tricky, and it's not a gut by any means. It's a great class to take credit\/D.",
    "Take it if you can or are interested in the topic. I wouldnt say its a can't miss though.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone",
    "This class is so awesome, one of those classes that just really influences how you think. I don't like calling classes \"must takes,\" but I very seriously recommend taking this sometime before you graduate! Even if you cred\/d it (like I did), you'll get a lot out of it. Really engaging lectures and interesting reading (if you do them), and not a horrible amount of work-- 1reflection, 2 papers, a midterm, and a final.",
    "I went from identifying as gay to not identifying as gay anymore. I also don't identify anyone else as gay or straight after taking this class.This may be bordering platitude, but my entire life changed after taking this class.Just when you think you know everything about human sexuality (e.g. omni-sexuals, ace communities, intersex, objectum sexuals, etc.) you have no idea how much your knowledge base of sex, gender, sexuality, and sexual identity will change after taking this class. And you'll realize that you were ignorant for thinking you knew it all...because you don't. Trust me.You learn a body of critical knowledge otherwise unattainable because this selective history was reconstructed by Professor Chauncey who is one of the ONLY people in this world who has this wealth of knowledge on this topic. He is a crucial artifact in the passing down of his wisdom on this topic.If you want to have your mind blown and your whole life changed forever, take this class--your life will never be the same...ever...ever again. (In an amazing way).",
    "Just amazing. Take it. Nothing else.",
    "YES TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!! Prof. Chauncey is SUCH a good lecturer, and this class is such a fascinating take on much of the historical events you're most likely alreadyfamiliar with. The readings are not too much to handle, and plus they're just so fun to read that you hardly even notice. I looked forward to every single lecture for this course, and every lecture delivered. Also the assignments are pretty fun and not too hard. Basically a very manageable, thoroughly rewarding, engaging, fascinating class. TAKE IT!!! There's literally no reason not to.",
    "Even if you don't think you want to take it, take it. I only shopped it because I was dragged into the room by a friend, and it became my favorite class of the semester. Take it. Take it now.",
    "Take this course! You will learn so much, and you will understand the America of today so much better as a result. If you are conservative and worried that you will feel unwelcome, don't. Professor Chauncey addresses all viewpoints respectfully.",
    "I would recommend this course to absolutely anyone. As a science major with minimal experience with history classes, this course provided me with incredible historical knowledge and I came out of it feeling like I had learned more than I have from nearly any other course. Every lecture is engaging and and nearly all of the readings are enjoyable. Take it!",
    "Incredible! One of\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not the\u00e2\u0080\u0094best run lectures I've taken. Subject material is fascination and Professor Chauncey is really engaging. The first and last written assignments are different and enjoyable, exams aren't bad. A really fun course.",
    "Take it! A bit heavier on the reading than you'd expect, but I think most find ways to cope.",
    "Take it.",
    "Definitely recommended, regardless of your major or areas of academic interest. A great class for any student.",
    "AMAZING course -- easily the best one I took this semester. Accessible, interesting and relevant for history and other majors alike. Great take home message to not take events and conditions today for granted, but as a process of fascinating historical developments.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY TAKE THIS CLASS. Take it if you are straight, and especially if you are not. Chauncey is a god among men, and I've never been more in love with a lecture class. Take it take it take it.",
    "I would summarize the class as a history of difference. It is relevant to all students and I think it should be a required class before graduating, both from a context perspective and because I believe every student should have the honor of being a part of that class.",
    "absolutely.",
    "Yes",
    "My favorite class at Yale so far! So engaging and inspiring. Definitely take this class!",
    "An excellent course, stressing continuities and discontinuities in queer identity and movements over the course of the 20th century. Professor Chauncey is a superb lecturer and almost all of the readings are gripping. Section can get a little vague, but mine improved over the course of the semester. I'm coming out of the class with a new sense of my own identity as a queer person.",
    "Incredible course on a topic most people know nothing about. Not only fascinating because you learn about the evolution of queer people over time, but also because you get to see US social history in general from a new perspective.",
    "This class is inspiring for all students -- gay and straight. Even for students who are not particularly into WGSS, this class was truly moving for me and made me grow more as person.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it addresses a very current issue and teaches a part of history that is not normally discussed.",
    "Learn about lesbian and gay history and how it ties into american history as a whole. There are a lot of similarities between gays and other disenfranchised groups of people. I took the course primarily to understand the culture a bit, where it came from, and to become more comfortable around gay people. The class definitely helped me in those regards.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it's a topic that isn't widely discussed and is new to students.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a good lecture.",
    "This is a must-take class at Yale. Every single lecture is fascinating and I felt far more engaged than I have in any other class. The reading isn't fully necessary to get a good grade but is still usually quite interesting. The papers are also quite interesting, and the exams are often fairly intuitive if you've paid attention in lecture.",
    "ABSOLUTELY a must-take. Prof Chauncey is the best lecturer I've seen at Yale, and the course content is extremely interesting and well-selected. The overall structure of the course is superb, and I loved the readings and section discussions. The workload and assignments are also very reasonable. Overall an incredible course!",
    "Terrific course, you will learn so much history that you never got a chance to explore in high school history courses. It allows you to embrace a different perspective to things, and to thnk critically about gender and sexuality. Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely! A must take. Chauncey is amazing-- great lecturer, awesome person. Lectures are always fascinating and super well organized. Each has kind of a mini thesis that ties into the larger themes of the course. Papers are very reasonable and the midterm and final were fair (although a few of the terms are a little obscure, as long you study your notes you'll probably be fine because there's a lot of choice). Take it!",
    "Take it. Terrific history class covering an incredibly interesting chunk of US history. The lectures are terrific and the readings are terrific. All around awesome.",
    "The best course of my semester. Really changed my view of history in general, about fluidity of social structures, how fear and reactions can shape a large chunk of historical progress",
    "I would definitely recommend it, though sometimes it felt more like NYC white gay history than US lesbian and gay history.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is unbelievable that I haven't been required to learn the things we learned this semester before. Walking through U.S. History with a totally different lens is unbelievably interesting, and I left feeling like my views about homosexuality and gender issues were very, very different, and I was already pretty liberal.(You don't need to be gay to take this class.)",
    "Yes! It's a simple formula where a professor is truly passionate about what they are teaching, they are eloquent and intelligent, and they have TA's who are likewise competent and passionate. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, especially with how relevant course material is in the rise of gay and lesbian rights!",
    "YES!! Take this class!! Any and everyone! You don't have to know much about LGBTQ history, in fact that's probably the best time to take this course. It was such a great experience and not overwhelming in any way. I really enjoyed this course and I think any student would. Every class was entertaining and fun and Chauncey is such a great and impressive lecturer. You'll be missing out big time if you don't take this class before you graduate!",
    "This class is an overview of LGBT history from 1600to the present day in the US and it is also an introduction to the concepts of sexuality and gender. TAKE THIS CLASS! Chauncey is not only an incredible lecturer and teacher but also an incredible human being. He takes the time to get to know every student in his lecture hall. He picks the perfect readings to complement his lectures. He chooses incredible TA's and makes them ask for feedback all the time so they improve their teaching skills. The class is incredibly well organized. I WILL NEVER LOOK AT SEXUALITY AND GENDER THE SAME WAY AGAIN.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is a fantastic course. Its strength comes from an exploration of history that is extremely relevant to life in the present day. Professor Chauncey is one of the best professors at Yale. Not only does he read two papers written by every single student, but he also manages to connect on a personal level with the vast majority of students in a very large lecture course.",
    "American Studies 135 is a great course if interested in gay and lesbian history in the United States. All of the concepts are easy to understand so no matter what experience you have with WGSS subjects, it will be an enjoyable class. I would recommend the class wholeheartedly. It made me want to continue queer studies and become an American Studies major. It is quite a bit of workload. Lots of readings which are necessary to fully understanding the subject. However, there are only two essays which are not very long.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a perfect Credit\/D class because the lectures are really interesting and the readings are a mixed bag, so if you take it Credit\/D you'll get a lot out of the class even if you don't do all the readings.",
    "Sadly, no. I really thought this was going to be one of my favorite classes. I took it credit\/d and the reading was still not manageable.",
    "Take it, especially if you have the gays.",
    "I would absolutely recommend U.S. Lesbian and Gay History to another student! Professor Chauncey is an incredible lecturer and the material is truly fascinating! It explains how the concept of homosexuality has changed in America over time.",
    "Absolutely recommended. If you are interested in the subject, it's an obvious decision, but if you know nothing about gender or sexuality studies, it's fascinating to learn about the story of gays and lesbians through the years.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student! The lectures are ALL great and interesting and the topic is very relevant to our lifeat Yale and the current 'hot topics' in politics. I think every student at Yale should take this class - it will help LGBTQ students understand the movement that has paved the way for them to live as they do now and it will help anyone else understand an important movement in American history that has shaped American culture today. I really enjoyed this class - make sure you get a good TA, but it will be great!!",
    "great survey of gay\/lesbian history in the United States from before the terminology had even been invented to the overturn of DOMA in 2013. Chauncey is an excellent lecturer. everyone should take this class to understand a history rarely addressed in mainstream classes",
    "I would suggest this course to anyone, really. It's one of those quintessential \"Yale\" courses - the information is interesting, and the class is accessible to anyone. If you want a course that summarizes American gay history--or that generally gives an alternate view of American history--then take this course.",
    "Definitely take it! It's worth it! Chauncey is great and the topic is so relevant! Please try and get Chris Kramaric as a TA, he is so great and one of the most caring and helpful TAs and does a good job reviewing class content!",
    "Great class! Not too hard, interesting readings, engaging lectures. Take it!",
    "A must-take at Yale. The best lecture I've had at Yale. Yes, take it.",
    "Take this class! I took it because everyone raved about how great it was every time I mentioned it. While I wouldn't go to that extent, I really did enjoy this class and learned a ton from it. I took it credit\/d, but the workload is not bad at all aside from a good amount of reading. Chauncey's lectures are awesome though, and that alone is reason enough to take US Lesbian&Gay history. If Ally is still a TF for this class, she is incredible. Make sure you're in her section - you will thank me.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Everyone in our generation needs to know the material, and every student at Yale needs to know Chauncey.",
    "Definitely my favorite lecture class at Yale! Great for people of any major, not just WGSS. Little warning though, there is a personal ethnography due BEFORE the end of reading period, so you should try to decide early into reading week if you're taking the class or not. On the papers, you have to write 5 pages for 2 out of 3 paper options. The 1st option this year is due right after reading period ends, so once again, you should know if you're taking the class early enough so you can write this paper.",
    "Take it!! It's been one of my favorite courses at Yale. Some weeks can be a bit heavy with the reading, but most of them are so interesting and enjoyable that it doesn't really feel like work. You'll be amazed at how much you learn.",
    "General survey of LGBTQ history with a main focus on gay white men of middle and upper classes, especially elite institutions such as Yale. Some great lectures too.",
    "Absolutely amazing, wonderful class. Take it before you graduate, take it before anything else. George Chauncey is a treasure of Yale. He manages to be all at once an incredible lecturer, a brilliant historian and a truly caring human being. I learned so much from this class, not only about the development of the gay rights movement over the last several hundred years, but also about activism, American history, and human dignity. It's one of those classes that sticks with you, that everyone is always talking about, that could perhaps change the way you think altogether -- AND has an utterly painless workload with just two papers, one of which is involves conducting an interview, throughout the semester. Then there's a midterm and a final, which you will be prepared for as long as you read and review the readings and pay attention in lectures. And you will want to do both of these things, so this class shouldn't be anything but a joy. Honestly, I just wish I could take it again!!"
