    "Golden Age Theater is pretty awesome. We read a lot of plays that actually changed the way I was seeing the real world, which has never happened for me before in Spanish. Profesora Byrne is one of the nicest instructors I've had, with a great sense of humor and an always enjoyable presence.",
    "I think that this is one of the best L5 classes you can take as a freshman. Because it's a freshman seminar, you won't generally be overwhelmed by other students having a superior knowledge of Spanish and the pace of the class is generally just more chill. You read essentially one act of a play for each class (about 45 min to an hour of reading) and get to read a variety of interesting works including Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Cervantes, and Tirso de Molina. There's one short and one long paper (2pg and 10 pg respectively) and a pretty easy midterm (if you've been keeping up with reading, which you have to do in order to participate, another part of your grade). Sra. Byrne is the sweetest teacher and really made this class enjoyable for me.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend it. It's the perfect amount of work and discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. As a freshman seminar it is a low-stress environment, and Prof. Byrne makes the class very enjoyable.",
    "This is a good course that explores Spanish Golden Age theater. The readings are drawn from very strong works and authors and the class mostly revolves around reviewing the reading and what happened to tease out some of the themes in the play.",
    "I would recommend this as an enjoyable way to fulfill your L5 Spanish credit if you enjoy reading Spanish literature\/plays; this class isn't much of an avenue to practice your grammar or vocabulary, if that's what you're looking for. It's much more about application of the foundations of Spanish that you've learned before, to gain an understanding of one facet of Spanish culture."
