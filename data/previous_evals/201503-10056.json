   "comments": [
    "She was excellent!! great at managing role plays and talking about them afterwards would've been nice to have a more formal way to see your own strengths and weaknesses in evaluation nice to have someone who was able to talk about real life experiences they had",
    "Her leadership in small group was very good. She was consistently encouraging, rarely critical, though when she did offer criticism it was constructive and judiciously offered",
    "Kris was a great practicum leader. She was warm, encouraging and had great suggestions and advice for us. I felt like we could ask her very specific questions about ministry and she would try to engage with us on whatever we wanted to discuss. Kris gave us positive support and helpful feedback on how to improve our pastoral skills. It was a pleasure having Kris as our group leader.",
    "She was very caring and professional. She guided the sections well and modeled pastoral care in her leading the group.",
    "Very knowledgeable. Strong communicator.",
    "Direct n clear speech Experience w pastoral care cases",
    "She is an amazing fellow.",
    "She was absolutely amazing. She listened to the concerns we had about certain topics. She made sure we had time to debrief the material that was very sensitive. Then after role plays she provided insightful critics on our performance and also raise our awareness to other way situations may occur.",
    "The practice sessions and role-plays have been challenging for me; however, I persevered. I did not know how incredibly hard it was to offer sensitive caregiving. For example, in a scenario, I offered care to a woman who had lost her husband - everything she saw in the house, or would do, reminded her of her husband. It was hard for me to only have a listening hear and be present in the moment because it would have been easier to jump to a solution. I have grown immensely over the past two months, and I am able to offer more sensitive caregiving. Reverend Shaffert was very helpful in lending his expertise in CPE to us.",
    "The Reverend Willis McCaw is an excellent instructor. His teaching and role-modelling are very practical, informative and fun. He drew on his experiences when teaching and this was very valuable to students. He showed genuine concern for his students and encouraged questions and class participation."
