   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you want research paper practice or already know Professor Freeman. Otherwise, the reading is cumbersome and pointless since the paper is totally unrelated, there is no class discussion structure, and Professor Freeman always needs to reschedule. That said, the material is fascinating and Professor Freeman is a very nice\/engaging teacher.",
    "There were a lot of things I liked about this course, and definitely some things that could be improved. Make sure you like the format, since if you're not really into reading 30 letters from Hamilton and Jefferson every week, you'll quickly get bored. This is not a class about the colonial era (Freeman teaches others along those lines), it really is a class *about* Hamilton and Jefferson as people, almost to the exclusion of all else. Be sure you're really into that before signing up.On the positive side, Freeman herself is energetic and excited to teach you--she clearly knows the history like the back of her hand. She lets you write about pretty much whatever you want for the term paper, and her comments on the first draft are very helpful. So probably one of the better history seminars out there, but I wouldn't say it's for everyone.",
    "As is, this class is quite disjointed. You read letters from Hamilton and Jefferson about a certain (very) loose topic each week and then come into class and basically just share your observations about it. It's not quite a history class, because we don't so much discuss historical events. And so I was disappointed by this class. I think it has the potential to be better, though. The best part of the class was writing the big paper, which was a good experience, although very time consuming and difficult. The problem was that your paper topic needn't have had anything at all to do with anything we discussed in the class. Several people's papers had nothing to do with Hamilton or Jefferson. And it felt like most of the learning I did in the class came through the paper, so I learned more about my paper topic than about Hamilton and Jefferson, I would say. Unfortunately, I believe that I would not recommend this class.",
    "Yes, if you know you want to be reading only primary sources (letters) for the entire semester with no other readings. After the third week or so, they start to become similar since the course is not organized chronologically. Freeman is a great professor and the way she taught the final paper was excellent.",
    "It's not a great seminar. I haven't taken a lecture with Joanne Freeman, but I think she'd be a great lecturer. The discussions are not structured, so we just ramble for two hours. I didn't feel like I understood the letters we read significantly better after class. The other problem is that we only read two biographies and then solely letters, so we have very little context with which to evaluate the letters. I think it'd be good to take in addition to a Freeman lecture though.",
    "I was really excited coming in but this was a disappointing course. Freeman is enthusiastic and really helpful with papers but class discussion was often unsatisfying. Most classes began with the question \"What struck you about this week's readings?,\" which I don't think was specific enough to move us towards a focused discussion of the texts. class wasn't able to improve upon the basic generalities we started with at the beginning of the semester (the stereotype that Hamilton was bullish and Jefferson a starry-eyed dreamer).So take the course to get lots of good advice about how to write a research paper but don't be too optimistic about discussion.",
    "People say this sort of thing a lot, but this class REALLY is 'what you make of it.' Great readings (lots of them) are separated into very general themes. It is difficult to keep up on all of them, but you will get much more out of the discussion, and Prof. Freeman's awesome historical anecdotes, if you do.One important thing to remember is that the term paper is due in rough draft EARLY in the semester (November 10 or so this year) - get an early start on it, and avail yourself of Prof. Freeman's office hours to help you hone it.",
    "Yes -- this is a great junior seminar that will let you write an amazing paper. The letters themselves become a tad boring by the end of the semester, but Professor Freeman really makes sure you walk away from this course a better writer and a better historian.",
    "This seminar is useful in fulfilling American and pre-industrial requirements in the history major and getting practice for the senior essay. Otherwise, only take this class if you are deeply interested in the founding period and enjoy reading ONLY primary resources for a semester and hearing what your peers think about them.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to all history majors. Professor Freeman makes the writing of the final paper a central focus of the class, something most professors do not. She'll ask for a prospectus in mid-October, a first draft in November, and then the final paper in the first week of December. While this sounds like a lot, this is a much better system. By drawing out the process, you learn how to research archives better (there are microfilms involved!) and write a better essay.I say all this to explain why I think this is a class geared towards the history major, primarily. Professor Freeman, as she says herself, is training people on how to write their senior theses. The history we learn is great. But history majors will be able to take better advantage of the course in its entirety.",
    "This is a course with really interesting material, but a disappointingly undedicated professor. It's a lot of work, and the reading is interesting, but you don't get a lot out of class discussion because Prof. Freeman doesn't come to class with much preparation. She is one of the leading experts on Hamilton, her stories are wonderful, her research is amazing, and she is really nice and easy to talk to. That being said, I think with all the other stuff she has going on (writing a new book, etc.), she thought that her starpower alone could carry the discussion. Classtime ends up kind of being a free-for-all. Take it for Freeman, but if you're expecting a great history seminar, look elsewhere",
    "Definite recommend! Worth it even at 9:25 in the morning (I'd never successfully taken a 9am class before this one)"
