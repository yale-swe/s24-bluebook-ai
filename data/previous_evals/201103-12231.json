    "Overall, a pretty good seminar and a classic Pabst class. she rocks. because it seems like she doesn't like teaching that much, she's flexible with class. however, she does expect top-notch essays and critical engagement; this is not an easy A unless you know her well and read carefully and write well.",
    "We read novels by black women and talked about the themes. I would recommend this class, particularly if you want to read some interesting novels.",
    "Absolutely take this class, especially as a fifth class or if you wish to truly enjoy your weekly reading for once! Discussions are laid back but meaningful, the work load is exceptionally reasonable (a book per week, two 2-4 page reading responses, and a 10-12 page pager), and Professor Pabst is an interesting and enlightening person to spend an hour and a half with every week. Take this class because you love the authors or because you have never read them before but always wanted to. The syllabus is very well balanced and each book takes you on an exciting journey. Professor Pabst describes the class as the best book club you will ever participate in and this characterization is spot on!Enjoy!",
    "The class is interesting, but it's frustrating if there are more than 15 people in the class. This semester, there were 20 people and everyone was just fighting to get a word in.",
    "Take this class. The reading is enjoyable and you'll have fun dealing with the hurricane\/hot mess that is naomi pabst.",
    "It is a great overview of Black female writers. You get to read well-known authors such as Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker in addition to a few more obscure authors. I would recommend this class because the novels covered in the course all tell a different story so there is a character or text for everyone to relate to.",
    "About one book a week. Two short reading responses (3-4 pages) and one final research paper (10-12 pages) on a topic of your choice (you can write basically on anything as long as it kinda relates to the course). The reading list for the course is great! I really loved every single book we read. Class discussions were sometimes a bit too simplistic, and not enough time was spent actually analyzing the text. But overall, good course to take. Not a lot of work and the readings are very enjoyable. And Noami Pabst is great.",
    "It is a great class to read and discuss very interesting books. I would definitely recommend it to another student because the course material is very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes. I recommend it if you like to read and discuss issues relevant to the Black Community.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is willing to read enjoyable books every week.",
    "Great take this class. The work load is manageable, and interesting. I loved the opportunity to read these books. The class is structured like a reading club, read one novel a week, and then discuss. The papers served to clarify our themes for the course. Excellent!"
