    "This isn't really a class, it's a colloquium. If you are already doing research at the Rudd Center, you can get credit for attending the lecture series. All of the lectures are really interesting!",
    "Yes, if you are very interesting in food and nutrition. No work outside of class, and the speakers are interesting. You might not get as much out of it as you'd hoped.",
    "A great course for students interested in food policy. All of the speakers were both interesting and inspiring to students who wish to pursue their interests in this field.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to Pscyhology 395 to fellow students, but only to students who have specified research topics of interest since the class is contingent upon doing research independently. Guidance is minimal.My advisor, Tatiana, was also extremely responsive and very accessible. She provided very helpful input throughout the research process."
