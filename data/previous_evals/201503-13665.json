    "EP&E 496 was a unique seminar in that it covered a wide array of business-government interactions in many different countries and then proceeded to cover privatization of U.S. governmental functions. I felt as if I became somewhat of an expert after each session, as the reading is great, the guest lecturers are true experts, and the class discussions are fascinating. I would definitely recommend EP&E 496 to another student.",
    "If you are interested in looking at case studies around the world that look at the interaction of business and government, then take this class. IF you are looking for an in-depth look at post-communist transitions, don't take it.",
    "If you are interested in learning about current events with Ian Shapiro and having guest lecturers who are experts in their respective fields, take this class. If you are interested in learning about the methodological relationship between states and businesses in post-communist regimes, this is probably not the class for you. The syllabus veers away from post-communist regimes about halfway through the semester, which is fine if you are interested in healthcare, the subprime mortgage crisis, and military privatization, but again, not if you are studying post-communist regimes. The class is also 60% SOM students and grad students, which adds some \"real-world experience\" to the mix. The readings are pretty light-moderate, and the assignments give you plenty of choice to write about the subjects that interest you.",
    "This course had a lot of promise, and approached some interesting topics, but didn't quite come together. A little disorganized at times.",
    "Prof. Shapiro's lectures were really insightful and exciting. He recognized that we had a different amount of familiarity on some of the topics and began each lecture with a helpful background that solidified a strong foundation that allowed us to follow his lead in a deeper discussion of each topic. Prof. Shapiro also brought in really exciting speakers to supplement some of the topics. Prof. Shapiro was really helpful and supportive in allowing you to shape the course to your interests. He provided us with a lot of information and questions to debate on a range of topics, but also really gave us the space to delve into the topics of our choosing. Overall this course was really memorable in my academic career at Yale, and I highly recommend this class!!"
