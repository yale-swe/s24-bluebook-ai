   "comments": [
    "The course gives you an insight in how the law treats children and why it does so, and also gives you the chance to question past and current provisions and Supreme Court decisions.",
    "This class is really interesting. Even if you don't have much of a legal background, reading the cases will completely prepare you for class. That said, the reading load is quite heavy. It's worth it though to be able to participate in the great discussions each week.",
    "This class is fantastic if you are interested in issues involving children or law. You get to read lots of really interesting cases and discuss them. Professor Garfinkel is extremely knowledgable and willing to speak to you outside of class. There are lots of papers, but you get to write them about basically whatever you want and you sort of set your own deadlines. One of the better classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Garfinkel is genuinely interested in all of his students and is extremely passionate about teaching. If you can, take this class. It doesn't matter if you're not interested in law (I'm pre-med), because Professor Garfinkel tailors it to meet everyone's interests. Also, he's extremely fair about grading. You have five short (2-3 pg) papers due during the semester and they can literally be on any topic from the reading or class discussions. The final paper was great because it could also be on a topic of your choice, so you really have to chance to write about something you care about and something that you find interesting.",
    "It's a great seminar if you enjoy reading legal cases and writing responses\/analyses to them. The workload isn't too much, just five 2-3 page papers and then a 10-15 page final paper (the lengths of papers can be shuffled around, though). It's a great topic and has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. Definitely recommend it if you get in!",
    "Absolutely, highly recommended. Judge Garfinkel makes himself very available outside class, and it's worth it just to learn from him. Note that the class is a mix of riffing on the topics and actual legal analysis.",
    "This prof is amazing, seriously -- an all-around great guy with a clear passion for his subject and for teaching. I wish every single one of my profs were as dedicated and approachable. I was a second-semester senior taking this course to fulfill my last graduation requirement, and I'm SO glad I chose it instead of anonymous lecture course. The subject matter is fascinating, the workload is fun without being at all overwhelming, and Prof. Garfinkel is really, really kind.",
    "I think everyone should take this class. I had no prior knowledge in this field, but there are so many interesting and relevant topics covered. It's a good crash course in child law.",
    "The class is not too much work, and the grading is pretty fair. It honestly depends on how much you put in. Child and family law is incredibly interesting and affects us all intimately, and Garfinkel is a very caring and endearing teacher, but be aware that he talks a lot and doesn't give much room for student input. It's also easy to get him on tangential topics, so if you haven't done the reading, you can usually get away with it, which is both a good and bad thing. Class ran late every week, though, so make sure you say something early if it seems like your class is doing the same at the beginning, because it only gets worse every week.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class this semester and probably one of my top two favorite classes at Yale. Professor Garfinkel knows so much about this area and he clearly loves discussing the cases and speaking to students. His guests add so much to the class because we get to speak to people who take what we have read and apply it to their jobs int he real world. Also, even though he is not a full-time professor, he makes an effort to get to know his students. In short, take it if you can get in!",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Garfinkel is a wonderful professor, and the material is very thought-provoking.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Professor Garfinkel is great, the speakers were all very interesting, and the readings were engaging."
