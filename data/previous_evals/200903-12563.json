   "comments": [
    "Recommended if you're interested in Kant and the third Critique.",
    "It is a class that is mostly lecture based which sometimes stops for brief questions. It can be dry, but if you're into Kant that is what you get--pure and simple. The critique of pure reason and the critique of judgment. This was an amazing class really, but it could be a little boring at times.",
    "I would recommend it because I just really like hearing what Harries has to say, but it was not always as engaging as I would have liked.",
    "If you love Kant, which I do, this is a great class. Deals with really crazy idea-exactly what you would want from a philosophy class that you often don't get. But the material is pretty difficult so it's good to have a background in Kant.",
    "This is a very intense course on Kant. You will know the Critique of Judgment when you are done, and you will know this text in great detail. Keep this in mind. The information is great, but if you're not philosophy-inclined, listening for two hours about a very particular detail of Kant's nearly indecipherable ideas can be tough. But if you're willing to work, it's definitely worth it for the true philosopher, and this course brings up wonderful questions.",
    "The class was very interesting overall, and the paper topics were challenging and thought-provoking. Don't underestimate how much time you'll need to work on the papers; they'll require some real effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the subject. Particularly, I enjoyed the format of the class with two different instructors--an experienced graduate student and a well established professor. I think that this really added depth to the seminar and allowed the student to get as much help as was needed\/desired.",
    "Yes, one of the best philosophy courses offered for undergrads at Yale. Unfortunately I don't think it will be offered again. However, I advise taking a course (any course) with Karsten Harries at some point. He does a philosophy different from most of the philosophy offered at Yale.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are interested in philosophy and theology, or if you question the limits and the legitimacy of the scientific world picture. Or just read Harries' notes.",
    "Yes i would"
