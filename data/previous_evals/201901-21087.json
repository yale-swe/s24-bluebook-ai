    "Learned about history of reformation in Europe, the interaction of many different parties and factions. Had a good understanding of the ways Catholics splintered from each other, could see how the material in this time period and context would be interpreted in a broader context of early modern history. Became better at writing skills.",
    "The course is such an interesting intersection of religion and history, and Prof. Eire does an incredible job of providing a clear chronological survey of the time period whilst also embellishing the material with details and comparing more philosophical\/theological principles.",
    "I have learned a lot about Reformation and European history during this time period.",
    "The ability to analyze and discuss primary sources from 1450 onwards, write more concisely and look at history in a more holistic manner than before.",
    "I learned how to think about a given part of history from a variety of different angles, of different events as part of a holistic formation of a zeitgeist.",
    "This class really helped me develop the way I read primary source documents, and through that and listening to brillant lectures each week, I gained an insight into the events surrounding the Protestant Reformation.",
    "I learned what is entailed by the study of history, as well as the theological specifics of the Reformation.",
    "A much better understanding of the history of the period and the effects of the Reformations.",
    "I learned more about the Protestant Reformation and Catholic counter-reformation.",
    "Fascinating insight into the causes and, more importantly, the consequences of the religious reformations. I gained awareness of how the Protestant and Catholic Reformations literally changed the world and all of history, especially in the West, and can see its effects today.",
    "A knowledge of the causes and historical events of European Christian movements of the post-Middle Ages"

   "comments": [
    "Very entertaining lectures, generally good organization, more time for test preparation and review session before the final exam would be helpful.",
    "This is truly an excellent class, and is likely my favorite I have taken at Yale thus far. Prof. Eire is incredibly knowledgable, the material is always both fascinating and presented clearly (which is not always the case with entertaining history lectures). Though the class is a thorough historical and theological review of the Protestant\/Catholic Reformations in its Early Modern context, I feel that it is also so informative of the current state of the world, and serves to explain so much of today's religions and cultures. I felt like I was learning and thinking a lot, yet I never felt too overwhelmed. It was also very impressive that the course could cater to extremely religious Christians and non-Christians with no background at all.",
    "Carlos is a fantastic lecturer and keeps the whole class engaged.",
    "Strengths include our wonderful Professor, TA and willingness to meet and discuss at anytime. Weaknesses are the lack of guidance for the paper from the Professor himself.",
    "I think the final should be longer. It seemed like way too short a time to be tested on our knowledge for the semester.",
    "strengths: the instructors were friendly and intelligent, and good at explaining weaknesses: the readings were sometimes longer than a Yale student will typically actually read. I, for one, often ended up doing none of a given reading if it was too long, whereas I would have liked to read a shorter selection of the important bits.",
    "The strengths are numerous, including the interesting and captivating lectures, well-selected content, and feasible work load.",
    "The course was extremely theology-focused rather than history-focused. It had an odd student demographic, in that the majority of the class seemed to have a fairly strong personal stake in the theological discussions, which not only pushed many of the discussion sections to a more argumentative place than I would have liked, but also meant that as someone who hasnt studied religion before in-depth, I felt that it was impossible to catch up with the formidable background knowledge of my classmates, which ultimately discouraged me from participating. This is not really a strength or weakness of the classhowever, I dont know that I can do a very good job of assessing the strengths\/weaknesses of the class because of this.",
    "Great narrative focus, but it often felt too spread near the end. We spent very little time on things like the religious wars and residual reformations, which I felt needed more attention and a tighter focus.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Each class was engaging and interesting.",
    "There is not much pressure to complete a thorough review of all the assigned readings. Many lectures are highly intriguing. No weaknesses of the course to report.",
    "Very good overview; Would have been nice to dive a little deeper into particular topics. It was a general survey, so I can't begrudge it too much"

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Catholic Tradition and the Reformation, would take. over 90% of the class was religious, so it may feel like you don't fit in if you are not religious during discussion section.",
    "Yes. The workload is completely manageable, with weekly readings and 2 tests (equally weighed midterm and final) and one paper. The exams are not trying to trick you at all, as Prof Eire releases a list of terms to study and the general essay topic beforehand, so they genuinely let you show what you know\/studied. Take this class if you are interested in European history and the historical consequences of religion, as even a non-Christian can fully appreciate this class with no prior religious knowledge.",
    "YES! Lecture was very interesting and the class is very organized. The professor is super nice.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to learn about history in an interesting, multifaceted and engaged way, take this course. Professor Eire's passion for the subject is contagious, and gives one the ability to connect history to today's world.",
    "Yes! Its a great way to learn about an incredibly influential religion (Protestant versions of Christianity) and inspire a love of history. Professor Eire makes the period of the Reformations come to life.",
    "Excellent course by a total legend and EXPERT in his field. Eire has great erudition and is a great and funny guy. Lectures are a tad slow but you get used to it. Excellent readings and textbook.",
    "I would recommend itCarlos Eire is a brilliant professor and this is his area of expertise. It is also fascinating to learn about how the middle ages transformed into the Enlightenmentthe purview of the course is that crucial link.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale: information is fascinating (the historical figures of the Reformation are super wacky and fun), teaching is fantastic, and its not very difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course to a religious studies major wanting to explore history. Otherwise, probably not.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class. I had never taken a religious history class before, but Professor Eire is an expert on all things Protestant Reformation and his material was always interesting.",
    "Yes, this is a great mixture of history and theology, which I believe is necessary to get a real understanding of the forces at work and their effects.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was interesting and one of the best I have taken in my time at Yale so far.",
    "Yes! This was the best class I have taken at Yale so far. Carlos Eire did a magnificent job integrating significant authors, text, political events, cultural contexts, and micro-histories to give a well- rounded view of the Reformations. The TA's are all very interesting and give their own lectures occasionally so you learn about their dissertations. The grading is fair and the readings are interesting. What more could you want?",
    "Yes. The Reformation period is exciting to learn about simply because you will encounter new people, ideas, historical events, etc., that you may have never heard of before. The course content is amazing, since you learn about the dramatic and little-known effects of the Reformations on the modern world.",
    "If you have an interest in the subject but not a ton of knowledge, then yes; If not, go to the Div School"
