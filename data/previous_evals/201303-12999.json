   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to a fellow student who has at least some background in thinking about images in terms of the 20th century and its technologies and epistemologies. Given the sweeping nature of the course, it can be difficult taking up each week's discussions in a historical context if one is completely unfamiliar with the period.",
    "Collage was interesting and open-ended; if you need a directed and straightforward seminar, or if you don't have a background in modern\/contemporary, you might feel a bit destabilized. But if you come in with an open mind, and feel flexible, you will learn an enormous amount."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped provide another angle for thinking about similar questions to those we took up in David Joselit's seminar on painting last fall. I feel like it helped flesh out my knowledge of the art and critics writing about this period. It did feel though as if many of the same figures and artists recurred; I would have liked to do more expanding into less canonical figures (even though I know the canon is important as well). The course provided an excellent framework for me to conduct original research that has been very helpful in thinking through dissertation prospects.",
    "I am keenly interested in the fate of the image in the 20th and 21st centuries. A broad yet sufficiently thorough grounding in issues of montage, assemblage, circulation--the idea of collage as a kind of socioeconomic formation--is exceptionally helpful toward further development of such thought.",
    "It is unclear to what extent the content of this course will contribute to my dissertation.",
    "I know feel much more competent in 20th c. materials. Before the course, I was shaky at best in this period. The course was definitely a struggle for me, but I feel like I grew immensely from it. It was a learning experience that challenged me, but I'm glad I chose to take the seminar."
