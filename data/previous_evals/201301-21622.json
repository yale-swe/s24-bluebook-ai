   "comments": [
    "Decent class, but not great. Took this Credit\/D\/F as a senior MCDB major already into medical school, which was a great way to do it. Test difficulty changes from year to year, and there are a couple gunner Juniors in the class, but in general it is very interesting. Five tests, drop one, which is very nice. Class in general seems to be A\/B curve as the average is curved to a B+. Lecture clarity and test difficulty varied between lecturers.As a premed I found this class fascinating - as a student, I sometimes found this class frustrating. Cr\/D\/F was a great option for me.",
    "The tests are fair and not too difficult if you study hard. The lectures can get boring, but the material is absolutely fascinating. There's also no textbook, which makes the reading easy. Each professor also makes detailed notes that you can study in preparation for the test.",
    "Fantastic course that teaches you a lot about the disordered physiology found in injury. Would definitely recommend whether or not you are premed. Only 5 tests and can drop the lowest one.",
    "If you like the material, take it! The tests are really really easy, so long as you attend class and pay attention. And, I feel like I learned a lot.Also, we got to look at preserved human organs several times throughout the course. It was incredible.",
    "Team-taught in 5 units, each with 5 exams. The nice thing is that there's nothing cumulative you have to do, but the last exam is the dayafter spring fling which was hard to get through. This was a GREAT pre-med class.",
    "Yep. 'Tis a pretty straightforward, low-intensity course that brings together a lot of material from other courses and makes them seem more relevant. Especially for health-care or human research-oriented people.",
    "Take it after you have some background in physiology. Grading in this class is a bit easier than other premed-packed classes, I would say, but there is still a lot of material - most of which you wouldn't want to be seeing for the absolute first time.",
    "This class is great, and is an excellent followup to MCDB Physiology. This class explores more pathophysiology, giving it a \"med school\" feel. A definite must take if you are MCDB\/pre-med.",
    "This course was an absolutely phenomenal course. You learn an incredible amount. The only thing I could ask for is a bit more standardization in terms of grading.",
    "Take this course! One of my favorites at Yale. I would also recommend taking Physiological Systems before this class, as the two tie together very effectively; it makes sense to learn the normal physiology of the body and then study what happens when systems are injured. Highly recommended!",
    "An interesting compilation of five blocks, each covering a different body system\/concept in relation to how things can go wrong. The professors vary in how engaging their lectures are though, and each one has a different testing style so it's rather tough to prepare for each block exam. It's a tough but rewarding class.",
    "Biological Reaction to Injury was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It is a wonderful marriage of several fields of biology (cell, genetics, physiology, etc.) in a nifty medical\/human biology package. If you're even considering taking this course, just take it. It is very manageable (5 exams and an optional paper) and fascinating. The work is so spread out and the lecturers change often, keeping the class fresh. A hidden gem. Perfect for pre-meds or anyone who loves biology. Ideal for juniors and seniors (a lot of the groundwork will already be laid and you can just enjoy).",
    "Reaction toInjury is a fantastic class and especially great to take after Physiology in the Fall. There are 5 blocks each taught by a professor that specializes in that field- everyone was really great and lecture was very engaging- you won't just be sitting and listening in this class. At the end of each block there is an exam, no final.",
    "A class that I would not recommend.Because the topic is rather boring.",
    "5 tests sound intimidating, but its not that bad in that each test is limited in the material it covers. Thecourse material is interesting and the exposure to professors from the medical school was fun.",
    "Good class, I'd recommend it. Be ready for a lot of rote memorization, and you have to guess what will be on the tests a bit, but it's very interesting and worthwhile.",
    "A class about how the body handles injury -- I'd recommend it if you're looking to gain a broader understanding of the topic, but not if you're looking for a particularly in depth understanding of a certain area.",
    "Recommend if interested in the human body, med school, etc. not a lot of work but the tests every two weeks can be tough. Option to write paper to boost your grade is really cool, although I personally didn't take advantage of that.",
    "I'd definitely recommend MCDB315, but only to someone who is prepared to have a test every two weeks. It helps space out the workload during the semester, but it depends on how you prefer to take your classes.",
    "DEFINITELY take physio first...",
    "Don't not take this class especially if you're in MCDB. Organismal biology is important and if you don't get a chance to take physiology, this is a must.",
    "I took this class cr\/d and it was a great one for that. Esp because after the 4th midterm, you don't have to take the last one if you're satisfied (this year, it came on the day after spring fling!). Interesting material, and seemed like what med school will be like."
