    "Jonathan was a fantastic professor. His dedication to his students' learning shows in the many office hours both in-person, and via Skype, phone, email, etc, he offered to students every week. I really appreciate his making an introductory course feel challenging (in a positive way). I feel that I have learnt a lot about statistics that I can now carry with me throughout my future professional career.",
    "Jonathan RS sets up this class for multiple learning styles with video, in person class time, practical time, and is accessible personally more than any other professor. TFs were accessible, Jonathan Harris in particular.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. Jonathan Reuning-Scherer is an excellent teacher, and his experience shows. He usually anticipates our questions and knows which concepts will be more or less difficult to understand. He often has multiple ways of explaining the same concept and if a student does not understand one explanation, he can quickly change gears and use a different example that demonstrates the concept in a different way. I like that he has found a series of datasets which are best for explaining each concept and is able to consistently refer to them."

    "Lots of hands-on activities which made theoretical material much more digestible. Jonathan was always available to assist students as necessary, which was very gracious of him.",
    "All of the practice we had on the computer. How available Jonathan was for questions. The videos were awesome because you could pause him when he was going a million miles per hour.",
    "The flipped version increased the amount of one-on-one time we had working both with the software and with Jonathan, which was very helpful. I appreciated the multi-faceted approaches to learning via video, in-class review\/lectures, and homework. All this weekly exposure helped the information sink in so I was able to keep up with the learning curve.",
    "Real examples and practice.",
    "I really liked the videos. They are very clear and well put-together. I wish I could have a copy of them to refer to in the future--although I suppose the lecture notes will do. Jonathan's understanding of how people learn statistics allows him to create an accessible, logical flow for each video."

   "comments": [
    "More in-class working through problems that are similar to the homework. While there were opportunities for this (which were good), sometimes the homework problems seemed to be a bit further afield than notes and lecture covered. Perhaps the burden is on us, the students, to explore more problems in the suggested textbooks. However, problems with solutions available similar to homework problems would have help my comprehension and overall grade.",
    "I really like the lab component and would recommend that it be kept in some way in future iterations, even if the flipped version of the course is discontinued.",
    "I think you could force us to come to your office hours if you cut out the time in beginning of class to answer questions. It's rarely useful to the whole class and the time could be better spent working on the computer.",
    "Problem set length. Some of the problem sets took much longer than others. Perhaps a more standardized length would help students keep better track of how much time they need to dedicate to it since they are weekly assignments.",
    "Maybe trying to relate the different tools leaner in the class (Tree diagram at the end) with some of the homework we had, by making a more explicit connection with the chart.",
    "More hands on class time.",

    "When there were difficult homework assignments issued, the TA sessions were often so busy it was difficult to get help in the time allotted. Much of the time, the TA had spent a good portion of time answering the very questions you were bringing before you got there. Perhaps a video run-through of FAQ for the homework assignments might help alleviate some of the pressure on the TAs that often answer the same questions over and over.",
    "Yes - clear explanation of theory during lectures and the opportunity to apply right afterward during lab was great.",
    "see above. keep videos.",
    "Jonathan Harris was an amazing TA. He was always very helpful and never gave answers away too easily; rather, he would come up with other examples and work with you one-on-one until it finally clicked. I'm not sure I would have succeeded as much as I did in this course if it were not for his help. Thank you!",
    "Lectures directly lined up with labs\/Q and A.",
    "I really like that we started each class by discussing any questions anyone might have about the material covered in the videos. I thought the homework was very effective at tying the concepts together, and I appreciate how accessible Jonathan is for any questions that may arise."
