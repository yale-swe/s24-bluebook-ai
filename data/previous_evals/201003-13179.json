    "DS philosophy is a wonderful class, but be prepared to leave section with as many questions as you entered with. The readings--especially Aristotle--are difficult but fascinating, and section with John Hare is something I always looked forward to. Writing philosophy papers is hard and unlike anything I'd ever done before. If you're ready for a whirlwind of reading with little time to reflect, then DS is right for you.",
    "I would recommend DS Philosophy to someone in the same way and with the same qualifications as I would recommend DS as a program: It is a great way to understand the development of the Western intellectual tradition without producing a solid grasp of any individual writer.",
    "I love Directed Studies! Be aware that you really won't get to spend much time on a single work, which can be frustrating, and the workload is intense, but it's such a fulfilling experience. My philosophy teacher (John Hare) described it the best: it's like the tour at an art museum. You take the tour to look at everything with a well-rounded expert, but then you can go back to look at those one or two paintings that most drew your eye. The same is true for DS: you get to read so many of the great works of philosophy. Not all of them will be appealing, but trust me, you will fall in love withat least a few (for me it was the Euthyphro), and those sparks of inspiration will guide your future studies. (Note: this is the same answer that I have in Question 1)",
    "The reading load is very intense and the works are often difficult to understand, so the pace of reading makes it very hard to get a strong grasp on the material. The works we read were all important philosophical works, but this class felt more like an overview of ancient philosophy than a means to gaining a deep understanding of it.",
    "Philosophy up to Augustine and Aquinas! I suspect you already know what's covered in DS if you're reading this page.",
    "DS is a wonderful and challenging program that incoming Yale students should consider. Professor Hare provides a fantastic section!",
    "This class was great. Some of the Aristotle stuff was really hard to understand, but it was nonetheless a great selection of works. Also, John Hare is an absolutely amazing professor. He is probably just as awesome of a person as he is of a philosopher.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend DS to another student. It is incredibly difficult, but the rewards are infinite.",
    "If Prof. Hare is teaching a section, switch into it. A wise man once said \"We:Prof. Hare :: Prof. Hare:God\"Ok, maybe that doesn't persuade you, maybe it strikes you as fanboy propaganda. Fine. How about this: Prof. Hare can answer any question. You'll have a flash of insight, you'll raise your hand thinking you've struck upon the nub of the issue. Prof. Hare might laugh and say \"yes, that's right.\" He'll think for a beat and--every time--answer with a brilliant but sympathetic reading of the philosopher in question. That's not to say that he thinks anyone you read is infallible; he knows problems when he sees them, and he'll guide you so that you see them on your own. But his first job is always understanding. Prof. Hare is very good at understanding.",
    "You read and discuss the foundational texts of the Western philosophical tradition. I would highly recommend this course to another student because reading these texts helps one to understand other philosophy, and the lecturers do a very good job of illustrating how each text fits into the big picture.",
    "This is a survey of Western Philosophy from Plato through Aquinas. Approximately a third of the course covers Plato, another third covers Aristotle, and the final third covers various post-Aristotelian philosophers. Check out the reading list on the DS website.As far as the recommendation:First, there is the question of whether or not to take DS. It's a personal decision, and there's no right answer for everyone. I recommend it, but with reservations. The seminars are slightly too large to be as effective as they might otherwise be; you read each work so quickly that you don't really have time to contemplate it and write each paper so quickly that you don't have time to revise it. But the lectures tend to be exciting (the big question among the DSers is always, \"How did this week's lecture compare to last week's?\"), and the professors are excellent. The DS community is a wonderful asset--it's as if you're part of a second residential college, and you have instant conversation material with any of the other students. And of course, there is the fact that you are reading the greatest works of Western Canon...So you have decided to take DS. You are now wondering what professors you want to have. There is a lot of talk about David Possen, and having not had him, I can't say whether or not you should give him up for John Hare. However, I can say with confidence that I would not give up John Hare for David Possen (or for anyone else). This is a section you should fight to be in.Relative to other DS sections, I think that Hare has less free-form discussion. Classes take more the form of a lecture or a question-and-answer session, but I would not have wanted it any other way. Hare is brilliant. He explains difficult points with a wonderful clarity, and he'll bring in ideas from other authors and periods in order to sketch out both how the texts we are reading relate to other texts and how they relate to his own opinions on the philosophical points discussed. Hare\u0092s personal experiences are as incredible as they are varied, and they are a great asset to him in his teaching."
