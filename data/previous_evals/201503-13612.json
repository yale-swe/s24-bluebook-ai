   "comments": [
    "The course is an interesting survey into economic models of social learning. The material is really cool if you're into models of social learning and communication, but be warned in that it can get very mathematically dense at times. I'd encourage prospective students to shop the course to see if the math parts of the course are doable, but otherwise it's a rewarding experience!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material was interesting and different from all other econ classes, which was refreshing. There was also a lot of math which I enjoyed. Professor Frick is incredibly knowledgeable and kind, and can explain difficult concepts seemingly effortlessly. Overall a great way to learn about a new subfield of economics I would otherwise have never been exposed to.",
    "Each class consists of two student presentations. Each student presents an economic paper that they were assigned and teaches the class about it, then everyone chimes in to make the presentations a collaborative learning experience. Super classic seminar experience.",
    "Definitely recommend; subject material was very interesting and I really enjoyed it",
    "A pretty decent class, not too heavy of a workload. Best if you're a bit wonky and really want to engage with economic models. The readings are interesting and reasonable in volume. One problem is that the class (as currently structured) is almost nothing but student presentations, so she'll hopefully make some more room for discussions next year.",
    "If they offer this class again, I would recommend it for anyone with even a little curiosity about graduate study in economics. This is one of the few undergrad classed where you'll get to deal with modern economic theory papers. The class mostly consists of student lead presentations, which is actually really fun and a useful experience if you think you might be presenting papers of your own someday! Professor Frick was enormously helpful and is one of the better instructors I have seen in the economics department. She somehow managed to guide us all through these often extremely technical and complicated papers, which are generally very interesting and show how useful economic theory can be. The workload was light and the grading was generous.",
    "Take this. One of the best seminars.",
    "Yes would recommend. Learned a lot about econ research I didn't have a chance to learn in other econ classes."
