   "comments": [
    "I loved loved loved this class. The opportunity to spend a semester pondering Austen's entire oeuvre was a dream come true for me. Markovits facilitates discussion well and is incredibly nice. Take it, but be aware of the large reading load (but it's Austen, so it's all enjoyable)!",
    "Definitely a must-take for anyone looking to read Jane Austen's novels for credit! DON'T take this with another class that's heavy on the readings, you'll have a hundred or some odd pages to read for each class and it can be stressful to balance that. It's a lot of reading, but very enjoyable and class discussion can be fun.",
    "English 010 is an amazing class for anyone who enjoys Austen. Professor Markovits knows many interesting tidbits about Austen's life and the novels, the reading load is manageable, and the only actual work other than the midterm and final papers are small one-page reflections that must be completed for each novel. However, keep in mind that the downside of having few written assignments due is that you need to stay on top of the major papers when they're assigned, as together they are worth 70% of your grade!",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Take this course only if you are very passionate about Austen's novels.",
    "This class was great and I would recommend it to anyone--especially to Austen fans. It's very fun and you'll learn a lot.",
    "It is a very discussion-based class with a good amount of day-to-day work. I would recommend this course to a student as long as he\/she is willing to put in the time necessary to read and analyze what is assigned.",
    "It is a class based solely on Jane Austen's works. Throughout the semester, we read all of Jane Austen's works including her shorter and unfinished pieces. I would recommend this class to another student unless you are certain that you absolutely do not like Austen (her pieces are not for everyone). This class is difficult to get a seat in--if you get in, take it!",
    "The course is very fun and entertaining if you have any interest in Jane Austen. We read every piece of fiction she ever wrote and analyze them as a class. Markovitz is a great discussion leader. If you are going to take the class, though, you should be confident in your essay writing abilities, as most of your grade will depend on those.",
    "Take this class. Great freshman seminar, good way to read all of Jane Austen's works.",
    "Yes, if you have a strong interest in Jane Austen and preferably some background in the works surrounding her own. ENGL 010 gives the opportunity to study literature from the perspective of Jane Austen's entire collection of works rather than from the perspective of a period with its individual key works. This different approach, where you can see the author's personal life develop alongside her works, offered a very fulfilling course. Personally I found the reading workload\/speed a bit exhausting (unlike a textbook, Austen cannot easily be skimmed) and with a class discussion focused on very specific points in the novels it was at times difficult to actively participate.",
    "English 010 is an excellent close study of Jane Austen\u0092s works, including her lesser known juvenilia. It pays special attention to the relationship between manners and morals, to literary techniques, to issues of convention, frameworks of knowledge and learning, and to the role of history in the novels. It intensively explores Austen\u0092s attitudes toward both the social structures of gender and class and to such narrative structures as the Bildungsroman and the courtship plot. No prior reading of Austen is assumed. I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in literature and the close study of novels. I had never read any of Austen's works prior to taking the course. I came out of the course with a greater appreciation for the author and the times she wrote in.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Class discussions were very interesting, and the novels and short works were assigned in a way to recognize similarities and differences in Austen's writing.",
    "This class really was exactly what it sounds like: an in depth examination of Jane Austen and her work, both minor and major, including other media such as criticism and film. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student, but that is also because I just love anything Austen related.",
    "I would recommend English 010 to another student. You will look at Austen's work in a very different way than you probably have before, and come to appreciate her profound talents and concerns. However, be aware that even for those who love Austen, it can become tedious to read only one author for an entire semester. (Needless to say, if you don't like Jane Austen, this class would be a very poor choice."
