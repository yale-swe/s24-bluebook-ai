    "ENGL 410 provides an extensive look at the works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. There's a play assigned every week, so the amount of reading is significant. It's worth it, though, as the discussions are both stimulating and fun.",
    "It's a fun, interesting class, and it's nice to know a little about the other Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists. I wouldn't say that you'll absolutely love every play and class, though.",
    "Solid course involving several of the lesser-knowns. Shakespeare-in-context shines forth in all his glory much more strongly than he does when treated as some canonical primum movens. And what's not to love about Marlowe, who rightly said that \"All they that love not tobacco and boys are fools.\"?",
    "I would recommend the course. It's really enjoyable, discussion was great, and readings were interesting and manageable.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and probably the only chance you'll get to read all the Elizabethans who aren't Shakespeare. I've come to believe that studying Shakespeare in the context of his contemporaries the only way to truly appreciate the quality and quantity of his genius-- and besides that, the other plays are actually pretty great! Prof. Walsh is an enthusiastic and approachable teacher, and he works hard to make the syllabus cohere-- which it does, beautifully. If you like Shakespeare, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a hidden gem.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. I've taken a large number of courses in the English major and this was one of my favorites. Professor Walsh is really, really nice and laid back -- but that's not why I say the course was great -- it would have been just as good were he extremely strict and far less affable. The course was great because the material was exciting and the discussion sections, unlike most, were genuinely entertaining and interactive. I learned a lot in this class about one of the most important topics in English literature. If you are an English major who is serious about English lit then take the course.",
    "ENGL 410 introduces students to Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. I would recommend it for students who wish to learn more than Shakespeare. I think that they will find it rewarding. Be prepared to read at least one play per week in addition to supplementary readings."
