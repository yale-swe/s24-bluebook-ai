    "This course encouraged me to think deeply about what scientists really mean when they use the term \"trade off\". I feel more clear on the relationship between the concepts constraints, trade offs, and conflict. I have more knowledge about the many ways in which researchers have conceptualized and measured trade offs. My current insight on the matter is that all concepts of trade offs should be unified by a causal relationship between the two (or more traits) involved in the trade off.",
    "I've deepened my understanding on different perspectives about life history by discussing various topics with the class. It definitely help me to think about this subject from different angles.",
    "What I most learned from this course was how evolutionary biologists have thought about trade-offs, and some ways we could think about them differently to move forward with the subject. While I'm not sure that these connections were clarified in my mind, I certainly gained insight into how scientists think."

   "comments": [
    "This was a graduate course that was mainly directed by the interests of the students, which is exactly the kind of course I wanted to take. I preferred the second half of the course (presentations and discussion of ideas) to the first half (discussing papers and related ideas). I also liked the two days where the students met without the professor. It prompted a different flow of conversation that was very productive.",
    "I think one of the strength of this course is the openness of discussion and exchanging ideas.",
    "The course was a great way to talk about the evolution of trade-offs with colleagues. However, there was a general lack of structure that we were not able to overcome as a group. I think the seminar could have been improved by including slightly more structure and guidance from the professor of our goals and how we could achieve them."

    "Yes I think this course is very inspiring and students who takes this course will have the chance to discuss interesting questions in the field of life history with fellow students and Steve. I definitely believe that it will benefit the student's own research and his\/her understanding of relevant topics",
    "Yes. This course, or a similar one taught by Professor Stearns, is a great way to learn how to work through unsolved problems in evolutionary biology."
