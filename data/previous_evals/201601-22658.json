   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course to both philosophy students and students with an interest in philosophy. This course had something to offer to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise in the topic.",
    "This course offered a fairly deep overview of the work of Rousseau, Smith, and Marx, and their moment both in the history of commercial society and in the history of political thought. The focus was on these thinkers' writings with only a secondary look at secondary literature (except for a more in-depth reading of Hirschmann and Hont). I would and will recommend this course for anyone interested in these thinkers or in prepping for the political theory exam, as well as anyone interested in critical theory because of how it unsettles contemporary debates about Marx and the genealogy of capitalism.",
    "This is a great opportunity to read fundamental texts for the first time, or to re-read them in conversation with one another on a specific theme. I would recommend it to graduate students in political theory."

   "comments": [
    "The thinkers covered in this course, as well as the debates in which they were situated, were largely gaps in my knowledge to a large extent and so I learned a lot. This course will help me think in a more historically rich way in my research about legal theory and political economy.",
    "This course gave me the opportunity to revisit some texts that brought me into political theory while also reading other canonical texts for the first time. In consultation with the professors, I was able to develop a paper idea that I found genuinely exciting and that I will continue to work on."
