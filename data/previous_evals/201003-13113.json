   "comments": [
    "Autobiographies is a fun class where you get to read and discuss both actual autobiographies and theoretical texts surrounding them. Make sure you're okay with reading theory before taking this class. If you are, it's a fun class to take.",
    "Do not take this class. It really is not worth it.",
    "I would never recommend this class to another student. In fact, this review is my warning to other students at Yale: don't take this class. It sounds interesting in the course description and on the syllabus, but it is nothing like what you think. Professor Chanda is a terrible communicator; she assigns impossible papers and expects you to read her mind about what she wants. Class with her was the worst; she made sweeping assumptions about all kinds of people (Americans, Asians, etc.), and then seemed surprised when people disagreed or became offended. I spent the entire semester trying not to scream during class, and just counting down the minutes until it was over. I genuinely believe this is the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I came into this class thinking it would be the best thing ever. Don't be fooled.NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR.Chanda created an intimidating atmosphere because she always had an agenda with every discussion. She always wanted to lead things one way or the other, and never let students discuss things freely. There was always an air of tension in the room because everyone was obsessed with pleasing her rather than discussing the texts earnestly. She also shoots you down if she doesn't agree with your points.IF YOU ARE HETEROSEXUAL, WHITE, AND OR\/MALE: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.-I was really disgusted to see how obvious her emotions were. If she wanted to pick on a student because of their perceived gender or race she made no attempt to hide it. She once turned to a white girl in class and asked \"What's YOUR subject position?\" (i.e. as a rich white girl with no issues, what the hell do you have to say?) She didn't ask anyone else that question. Then she would make broad generalizations saying things like \"For someone like you... (x is true)\" to one student who was basically the only straight guy in the class. She has no shame.The class becomes about her opinions and her beliefs and her interpretations. If you're interested in the class do yourself a favor. Print the syllabus and read the books over your vacation. This class is NOT worth an entire semester of suffering.-I was also disappointed at how small the class was. Listening to same people over and over who still haven't done the reading gets very tiring.-also late papers never fly with this lady. one guy was stuck in a grounded airplane physically unable to send her the paper electronically and had a delayed flight. did she accept the paper ? NO. He had to DROP THE CLASS 3 WEEKS BEFORE THE FINAL.",
    "This class was extremely insightful on how individuals construct their identities from their pasts. The topic, autobiography, may seem straight-forward but the evolution of the literary genre mimics the evolution of social representation of minorities in the United States. I would recommend this class to anyone looking to understand how individuals from different cultures understand their subject position and how marginalized genres in literature differs from the \"white standard\".",
    "Definitely take this course, just be aware of the syllabus and all of the reading you will be expected to complete and discuss in seminar."
