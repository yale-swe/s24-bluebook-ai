   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It is so so so great. I mean don't take it if you don't have time for a whole whole lot of work. Admittedly there is only one paper at the end but you will want to do the readings or class with just not be interesting and there is quite a bit of reading and the final paper is really loads of work. But I think the class is super worth it. Professor Gilmore is amazing and you should just absolutely take this with her.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course, though incoming students ought be aware of the strong focus on issues of gender in the course materials, which surprised me. Further, the course has a much more cultural focus overall with much less political history.",
    "Awesome class! This is a really entertaining course! The readings were interesting, the course was structured well, and Prof. Gilmore was really nice and funny. A great way to understand the history and modern foundations for the South. A lot of reading, but pretty much your entire grade was based on a single 20-25 page paper, which sounds intense maybe, but you'll really appreciate it. The grading is very fair, and Prof. Gilmore is very helpful; she makes sure you get started on the paper with enough time to let it be something you're really proud of.",
    "Intense but very rewarding seminar with focus on cultural and economic history. Lots of reading, but it's generally worth it - you'll get to read some very seminal material as well as more recent scholarship on civil rights and labor history. Professor Gilmore is really an expert, full of anecdotes and very helpful when it comes to the final paper. I'd definitely recommend this class to any serious history student.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get in. It's a lot of work, especially towards the end of the semester. The paper, if you put real effort into it, can take forever and there's a lot of weekly reading until the very last day, but the material is interesting. Professor Gilmore is fantastic- she's funny and nice and keeps the class really balanced between being student\/discussion led and having direction from the professor. She also always has a funny or interesting anecdote to bring in. Obviously it depends a lot on your class, but I felt like the class this year- because it's an advanced history class- was really engaged and everyone always had interesting things to say. Definitely worth it, both for what you'll learn about the South and American in general, and for how it'll improve your righting and communication skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar to another student! Professor Gilmore is one Yale's best history professors, and this class was my favorite history seminar I've had so far. Class was always engaging, and often very entertaining. Professor Gilmore finds the perfect balance between student discussion and teaching. She is so knowledgeable on the subject, but still lets students take an active role in leading the discussion. On another note, the content and readings for this course are usually very interesting. The paper is a lot of work,and Gilmore expects a lot from each of her students, but you'll feel very proud of all the research you conducted once you're done. Take this course if you get in!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It is a TON of work so beware. The reading is often very interesting and contributes to really interesting discussions. Really make sure to not let your paper wait until April - get as much done before\/during Spring Break as possible. Professor Gilmore is seriously the best.",
    "I'd recommend it. Good range of readings (though lots and lots of pages), good discussions. The professor brought her own expertise to the discussions, so it wasn't just students fumbling around with speculations about the material. The paper was a doozie, but so it goes.",
    "I would summarize the course as an overview of topics in the American South between the Civil War and present. Each week we focused on a book relating to an important issue (e.g. sharecropping, Southern factories, the rise of Walmart) and discussed it as a class.I would HIGHLY recommend this course, as the other students were very engaged and Professor Gilmore was an excellent teacher. She is so well-read and understands this period so deeply it was an absolute joy to be in her class. There was always a large number of students trying to discuss every topic with insightful points--as is not always the case in seminars.",
    "The way the class is taught can be frustrating and all the books are low-key friends of Gilmore's but it's interesting material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "American South is a broad look at the postbellum history of the South. Each week covers a different topic as the class moves chronologically from the Civil War through turn of the twenty-first century. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, but would add that the course can sometimes feel somewhat disjointed from week to week since the syllabus covers such a diversity if topics. With that aside, Professor Gilmore is brilliant, knowledgable, and enthusiastic, making in-class discussions informative and interesting. The syllabus is also fantastic and many of the books (especially Radio Free Dixie) are amazing!"
