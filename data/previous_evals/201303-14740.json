   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend it. It helps people get a full and deep understanding of all aspects of Arctic.",
    "very useful and interesting",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT. Not another normal science class. You read and discuss interesting current (and controversial!) topics relating to the Arctic. Each week the paper is presented by a student, who leads the discussion and becomes the expert of the topic. However, the presentations are very low-key and conversational. Mary-Louise is an EXCELLENT (and kind!!) professor who never makes you feel stupid or intimidated. It's an open and free environment to really grapple with key issues going on in the Arctic that will ultimately affect our future!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend GG742 to another student. This class is a great way to learn about Arctic processes. You read a paper or two a week, write a short response, and then discuss in class. Undergraduates taking the course also write a term paper. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and you learn a lot! Mary-Louise is a great instructor with an immense knowledge of the Arctic."

    "It helped me a lot. The course is arranged to contain nearly every aspects of Arctic and connected it to climate change.",
    "it broadens and deepens my understanding in Arctic ocean and climate change",
    "I knew little to nothing about the Arctic, other than about sea ice. I've always LOVED learning about climate science, and the Arctic is the best place to study. I am conducting research on Arctic sea ice, and this class gave me insights to the greater scope of what's going on in the Arctic.",
    "This course is very helpful in understanding various Arctic processes."
