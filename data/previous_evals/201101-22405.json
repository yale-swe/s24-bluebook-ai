    "I would recommend this course for a student interested in the topic. The workload isn't bad, though there is a lot of reading. The structure of the course definitely enables the student to pursue and explore her specific interest in the course. The workload was about 1 book a week, with a midterm comprised of 2 8-10 page papers and a final 20-page paper.",
    "This is a really fun class with fascinating readings. If religious nationalism is something you are interested in or follow in the news, definitely take this class as you will get to read a lot of case studies and theoretical works about the relationship between religion and nationalism. If you are an undergrad, just know that the class is majority grad students who, as far as I could tell, approach seminars in a pretty different way. The discussion is not too directed, which I found kind of challenging. There is a fair amount of work - a book a week- but the readings are definitely worth it. There is also a ton of flexibility with the final paper, so you can really write about whatever interests you."
