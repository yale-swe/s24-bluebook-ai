    "So good",
    "It is a really good history seminar, and helps improve your writing and research skills a lot..",
    "Good class to learn about orientalism and how it contributes to a modern day understanding of the Middle East. Really interesting and Amanat is a really good, nice professor.",
    "Overall, I'm very happy I took this course. The subject matter was incredibly interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. My one complaint is that the course did feel somewhat disorganized and lacking in structure at times - as in it felt like we were jumping around from specific topic to specific topic without really trying to tie everything together into a larger picture. Professor Amanat is a wonderful professor who has a lot of good insight to offer on such complicated and current topics. He cares deeply about each of his students yet he is always pushing students to do better and to stand behind what they say, which I think is really great. My only complaint is that he often spent too much time at the beginning of class going over organizational things when we could have used the time for class discussion. But overall, if you have an interest in the Middle East and some background in its history, I definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with genuine interest in the Middle East in general, and especially regarding perceptions of it.",
    "A great course for learning more about why the Middle East looks as it does now.",
    "Yes. Professor Amanat is great, and youll get a solid grounding in modern Middle Eastern history. It helps to go in with some background, but I came in with virtually none and still got a lot out of the course. Readings were generally interesting, and discussion flowed well.",
    "I would recommend this course. Especially now, this area of history is very relevant."
