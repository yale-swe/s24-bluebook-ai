    "Loved the course; hated the course paper. Didn't find it helpful for learning. Maybe if it was a group assignment, could have had learned better.",
    "Overall interesting course. We talk about some interesting topics an the Professor asks each students' interests so she can tailor the syllabus accordingly.",
    "Perinatal Epidemiology is great, but I would have enjoyed a learning experience outside of the classroom! The speakers that came to class were a nice touch.",
    "This was excellent course for an introduction in the various topics and subfields of perinatal epidemiology. Strengths: -I really enjoyed the different speakers who came to discuss their areas of expertise. It was also really valuable to have these individuals stay for the journal club discussions, as they provided unique insights and I learned a lot from their contributions. -I thought the longer assignments we had were pretty interesting and were a good way to engage with the course material on a deeper level. -I also really enjoyed the journal club discussions, as I feel like they challenged me to think critically and creatively and were a great opportunity to engage with the skills and content knowledge we gained from the class. -The weekly readings and summaries were very reasonable. Weaknesses: -Because things got really busy at the end of the semester, I think it would have been helpful to get one \"freebie\" week where we didn't have to submit a summary (in addition to the week we got off for when we were leading the discussion). I think this would have been a useful tool for those of us who experienced differing levels of stress throughout the semester.",
    "Great readings, great lectures, great speakers, great professor, and a great cohort!"

    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Amazing. Pays excellent attention to students and very accommodating. Always available for questions and just general guidance.",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Anne Marie Jukic is ridiculously smart. YSPH is lucky to have her teaching.",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Anne Marie is an excellent professor. I really appreciate the calm and confident way that she conducts herself in the classroom, and I think her level-headedness was a huge asset when we got really into discussing some of the papers in journal club. She is also extremely positive and kind--I had the opportunity to meet with her individually to discuss some ideas I had for my final project, and she was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Anne Marie Jukic \u00a0Ann Marie is very engaging, and is very passionate about the topics. She helped make me interested in perinatal health! One of the best professors Ive had!!"

    "Strongly recommend. Great, small class with awesome, knowledgeable instructor.",
    "It an ok course - the content is interesting and it's not too much work. It's a good option if your workload is demanding and you need a more manageable class in your schedule. I'm glad I took it as my knowledge in the topic has expanded.",
    "Perinatal Epidemiology is a extremely informative course. It is also intimate. YSPH students who are interested in women's health should take it before graduating.",
    "This course is a great course for those interested in exploring maternal and child health with an epi lens. You have a lot of freedom with the course paper to make it your own and to pick something truly interesting to you. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in maternal child health, both for the content matter and for the opportunity to work with\/learn from Anne Marie.",
    "Yes, I get a full understanding of maternal health and found it was really interesting",
    "Even if you arent currently much interested in the topic, you will become invested in it as you attend class. Strongly recommend!"
