   "comments": [
    "Above everything--FUN! You will grow as a writer, reader and person. Take it Cr\/D, though.",
    "Yes! There is no other class at Yale that will improve your writing to the same extent as ENGL 469. You will enjoy writing and revising your pieces, and you will get to know a truly remarkable group of students.",
    "Take 469! If you have read any past evaluations, you probably already know that this class is great, but the reviews are not over-hyping the class. This class will help you to become a better writer and to enjoy writing more.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it. Response above.",
    "If you get in, you must take this class. It will consume you in the best possible way. I've never had such a personalized experience with my writing instruction. Everyone in the class got really close. You will create work that you will be more proud of than anything else you've ever written. TAKE THIS.",
    "I'd definitely recommend 469 to another student. I absolutely loved our final project, and Anne is a lovely professor \/ writer \/ human being.",
    "Expect to dedicate a LOT of mental and emotional energy to this class, and to have exorbitantly high standards for yourself whether you take it Cred\/D or for a gradebut it's absolutely worth it. Anne has thought through every single detail of her syllabus, every moment in the classroom, and this class is a really rich learning experience because of it. Your writing will get a ton of in-person, one-on-one feedback. And if this semester is any indication, you'll be in it with a crew of rockstar writers and individuals! TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Great professor. Great course. Sometimes feels a little too much like a performance though.",
    "This is the best class I have ever taken, at Yale or anywhere else. Anne Fadiman is just a brilliant and exuberant person, and a perfect professor. The class is full of amazing writers, who stretch you in new directions, inspire you, and push you to your creative limits. At the same time, the class manages to feel entirely collaborative and not at all cut-throat or competitive. The class is designed to foster your individual growth as a writer. You learn to find a style of writing that feels natural and appealing to you. You learn to take pleasure in the differences of the other writers in the room, their foibles and their triumphs. Anne is committed to her role as an educator in a way that I have never seen from any other professor at Yale. She takes the time to really get to know you personally, and to get to know your writing. Not only does this translate into a sense of trust and mentorship in your relationship with her, it also translates to a safe, honest, and committed workshop environment. She also knows her shit. This is the only class at Yale where I can guarantee you will come out a significantly better writer than when you went in. TAKE IT. You will not regret it.",
    "Absolutely take it if you have the opportunity."
