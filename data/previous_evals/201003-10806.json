    "It is a great introduction to physiology, which is the big picture material that students in the biomedical sciences don't always understand, but which is important for making their work medically relevant.",

    "I would recommend this course for another students if they were looking for a \"big picture\" view of physiology.",
    "I would recommend it to people that have bio background; this class is very helpful, but if you can't put in a big chunk of your time, you might end up failing this class and other classes you're taking as well"
