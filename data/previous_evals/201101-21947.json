   "comments": [
    "390 is hard, probably the only really hard class you'll take in the classics major. There isn't really much of a reason to take it unless you're a classics major. It will make you much better at composing and translating Latin, and you will learn rules that you either forgot or never knew. The compositions are hard and you probably shouldn't expect to get an A in this class unless you are willing to make it your top priority and spend many many hours every week on the compositions.",
    "Exactly as advertised. It's an extremely, extremely difficult class (I think the hardest I've taken at Yale) but it's also ridiculously satisfying when you get the hang of it. You have to do it for the major so might as well embrace it. Be prepared for huge time expenditures, and go in with a lot of patience.",
    "Really hard and a lot of work. I would recommend it to another student only if they were an upperclassman classics major. Non-classics majors should not take the class. Really, there is no reason to. There are so many easier ways to get rid of your language requirement. Do not make my same mistake! I would also recommend that people wait until their senior year to take it to be as prepared as possible.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course, it's probably because you are required to do so as a Classics major. Please know that this course is so difficult and the grading policies are so harsh that it is probably one of the best reasons out there not to be a Classics major. If however, you are a Latin philologist in the truest sense of the word, then you will probably find this course extremely rewarding and worthwhile.",
    "The work isn't easy, but it will get you into shape with your Latin fast. And if you can put up with the workload it's actually fairly enjoyable. Well worth taking.",
    "You have to be aware what you are getting yourself into--a laborious overview of Latin grammar and style--but yes, I would recommend this course. The weekly translation exercises can sometimes be a little tedious, but your ability to read Latin will improve quite a bit.",
    "I ended up liking this course quite a bit. Professor Solodow is a good professor and a fair grader. This is not a course that you can coast along in. Really have to be there every lecture and do all of the assigned reading."
