   "comments": [
    "I thought it was very strong considering the teacher I had. When I took it last semester and didn't follow to completion, the professor didn't engage me as well in the class as my professor this semester. He did a great way of explaining and allowing me to ask questions in class. He also sat down and talked me through the tests so that I understood them better before\/after. I think if all of the professors for this course could be like him, the class would be much better.",
    "the course itself was well-structured. I liked that we knew what to expect every week. the way the course grading goes is also really nice because its designed to maximize your grade, which is thoughtful and feels good. WebAssign was a little tricky I liked it over all, but some of the questions it asked were hard to know how to answer or the accuracy it wanted wasn't clear.",
    "It's pretty fast paced and luckily I had already taken calc AB in high school a couple years before taking this class. But, even already being familiar with the material, I had to work very hard to do well. So I don't think this class should be labeled as an introductory math class because for someone who has never seen calc material before, even if they work really hard they will probably not do very well. That being said, Dr. Hall was a good teacher who really cared about helping students, and I am sure that if someone needed extra help that he was helpful to them.",
    "Perfect",
    "I think it was taught well and there was a lot of practice to enhance our skills. Sometimes the exams were much more difficult than the material we learned, though.",
    "The course is way too fast for someone who has never taken calculus before. Strongly recommend you review online to have some idea of the material before going in.",
    "Great class. However, I feel like it was a little fast-paced and rushed at times.",
    "Strengths of this course include going in-depth in the calculus techniques, however, I think there should be more emphasis on the general themes, big picture ideas in the course, there should be better feedback to the students, in terms of psets, classwork,",
    "Great professor; however difficult to study for exam with resources available."

    "If they need it for further classes, yes.",
    "absolutely! youll learn a ton and feel really good about the work you put in youll enjoy the class and feel like your hard work is rewarded.",
    "I'd only recommend this class if you have to take it for your major or pre-med, etc. If you take it, Prof. Hall is great so try to take it with him! At the end of the semester, I feel like I have developed a solid set of calc skills that I won't easily forget because we had so much practice--that being said, a lot of practice means a lot of work (2 web assignments and 1 paper p-set per week). They don't take a ton of time but you definitely have to figure out how to manage your time and plan ahead to get all the work done.",
    "Yes! Nice and sinple",
    "Yes, I would. I think it is necessary to learn these skills to have a more comprehensive understanding of math and calculus. It'll certainly help with higher levels of math classes here at Yale.",
    "I would only recommend this course if John Hall is the professor that is teaching it. Everyone else complained about their professors and that they hated the course, but I loved the course because of Prof. Hall! I'm so lucky to have had him. He's amazing!",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Its not fun and very challenging. If you do, though, make sure you take it with John Hall. He is the best!!",
    "Yes. Definitely start out in Math 112 if you took Calc AB senior year of high school.",
    "take it, but make sure you teacher is good and engaging like lake bookman, i mean i went to one review session of his and he was so good.",
    "Only if required for a prerequisite."
