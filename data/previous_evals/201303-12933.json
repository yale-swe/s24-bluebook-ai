    "I would recommend the course to someone who wants to expand on an underlying understanding of macro econ concepts and apply them to real world international situations. There is more of a focus on shorter term monetary policy than longer term growth drivers and fiscal policy.",
    "Yes, if the student was looking to gain some general understanding of the world economy and apply technical knowledge.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to fellow students. In fact, I have already done so.I would summarize the course as follows: It is an innovative, case-based macroeconomics course, dealing with some of the most important macroeconomic topics of our time, e.g., the global financial crisis, the Euro crisis, and the Chinese growth miracle.",
    "Recommended to students with little or no background in Macroeconomics and International Economics.",
    "for undegraduate students who want just a surface gist of global economies, to stimulate one's interest. not for one who is seeking to learn concrete knowledge and skills in this area."

   "comments": [
    "Provided general understanding of the world economy.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of macroeconomics, in particular, because of its case-based approach. Moreover, it reminded me of my passion for topics in macroeconomics, international economics, and international political economy. Finally, the paper requirement allowed me to delve deeper into economic issues that I have been wanting to understand better for a while. Thank you very much for all that!",
    "Not much, basically serves to get beginners interested in the area of macroeconomics. too qualitative with hardly any useful quantitative skills."
