    "If you are reading this, it probably means you need to take the class because you are a WGSS major! In this class, you'll start to plan your senior essay project. First, congrats on choosing the best major! Second, the way to make the most out of this class is to 1) not be afraid of throwing yourself into a project-- commit yourself to it, 2) not be afraid of totally changing directions, because you will, and 3) be open to critique from other students and from the professor, who will say smart things to you. This class was really helpful in terms of planning for the senior essay next year-- we're definitely lucky to have a three-semester thesis, even though I initially thought it was crazy to start thinking about this so early!",
    "Amazing course! If you're taking this class, you're a WGSS major, so good job for making the right decision.",
    "This class is only for WGSS juniors, so no need to shop it if you're not. The style and quality of the course definitely depends on the professor, so it will be a little different every year. Juniors, definitely make the most of this really fun opportunity to know other peers in the major and start brainstorming on your thesis! It can be such a rewarding and intimate experience, and it's definitely my favorite class at Yale!",
    "you will only be in this class if you are a WGSS major. if you are a WGSS major you are better than everyone else because you know you aren't better than everyyone else because you read about why in the stuff you read as a WGSS major. Joe brought donuts a lot it was neat!",
    "A weekly working group for the junior WGSS majors. You develop your own research project, learn about each other and everyone's various interests, and become a better thinker in the process. Definitely a class in the WGSS major to look forward to!"
