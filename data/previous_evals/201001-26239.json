    "One of the better courses in EPH. Good variety of assignments and team taught by professors who actually do this for a living. In that sense, it is a very practical course.",
    "The class exercises as well the homework assignments helped to strengthen epidemiological skill necessary for investigating an outbreak.",
    "Very practical and implementation based.",
    "VERY interesting, applicable, and thorough. The case studies were very insightful.",
    "Strengths: This course offered me a view of how an epidemiologist would react and work during an outbreak. The course was also taught by CT's head epidemiologist who was also an EIS officer (very cool).Weaknesses: There were four professors\/lecturers in the classroom. I did not know what some of their roles were, and some did not provide helpful information when students asked questions.",
    "I think there are too many teachers for the course.I also think that there is a lot of great information but it gets a little repetitive toward the end of the course and so it might be important to think of some other topics that are more different.",
    "Too much busy work.",
    "Essential course for anyone interested in outbreak investigation. Extremely practical focus and interesting material.",
    "The exercises on past outbreaks were very useful.The papers on the book was a very creative way to learn how to apply the things we were taught.",
    "Strengths: learned many of the techniques used by field epidemiologists from experts as well as other important considerations, such as understanding the legal implications of public health",
    "I thought it was a great course. We learned a lot of excellent practical skills, applied them, and we were taught by experts in the field.",
    "The course was a great introduction into the operation of the state health department along with the general outbreak investigations led by epidemiologists.",
    "The course was very practical and really focused on thinking like a public health professional."

    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0There is no doubt that Dr. Cartter is an expert in the field of outbreak epidemiology. Teaching could be improved by including smaller group assignments and forcing students to participate.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All the instructors were great. They had a lot of real-life anecdotes that really made the class interesting, and showed how they applied the concepts they were teaching us in class. They were very receptive to suggestions, and had a great rapport with the class.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Matthew along with the State Health Department officials worked as a great team of professional epidemiologists sharing there experiences and improving out Outbreak investigation skills to help prepare the students for real life epidemiological investigations and case studies.",

   "comments": [
    "The course introduces how to investigate outbreaks and related issues (i.e. bioterroism, legal issues, etc.) It is a good follow-up to the intro epi classes",
    "I would highly recommend this course.The expertise of the health care professionals allows the students to learn from individuals who have actually investigated outbreaks. The students aretaught how to critically work in this type of emergency situation as well as learn the issues concerning an outbreak.",
    "I enjoyed this class - it's not your typical lecture each week. The Plague assignments were always a bit of a shot in the dark - I'm never sure I write what they are looking for, and it largely depends on which two instructors read your work.",
    "Yes, this course is one of the better EMD courses. The case studies are also enjoyable (if they did not take so long). Some of the information is common sense, but there is also a good review of past epi courses.",
    "overview of how to define and approach an outbreak investigation. The course is taught by practitioners rather than academics and for this reason it is a very practical course on field epidemiology and what actually happens in the \"real world.\"",
    "Best course I've taken so far - instructors use a variety of mediums (case study, online course, films, books, presentations) to teach the material so classis never boring. Very practical focus and interesting subject material.",
    "I definitely recommend it to people who are interested in applied epidemiology. I felt that it was one of the most useful classes taught in the program.We gained real life skills that could be used in an actual working environment. This was one of the most interactive classes I had. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to students interested in disaster management and infectious diseaseepidemiology.",
    "This class is amazing, especially if you are interested in pursuing outbreak investigation as a career. The instructors are very experienced and knowledgeable, and give you multiple opportunities to apply skills taught in class through case studies and table tops.",
    "The course was highly enjoyable and very relevant to my future public health practice goals. I really enjoyed the interactive teaching style of this small class.",
    "This course covered a variety of public health issues including case findings, outbreak control, legal issues, and public health training. Yes I would recommend this course."
