    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel is an impeccable scholar, and I have enjoyed what short time I've had to study with him. He is by far the best TF I've had at YDS: his knowledge is vast, he has a vested interested in his students, is passionate about what he does, and has insightful and original ideas \/ interpretations. My knowledge of Plato and Aristotle has grown ten fold between John Hare and Samuel Loncar. In short, Samuel embodies the spirit of an excellent teacher: a) care for students, b) intentional pedagogy, c) vast knowledge. I look forward to seeing where his career goes; he is an asset to this institution.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Well prepared and very clear thinker.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Thanks, Samuel! I had a nice semester with you!",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0The TF system at Yale is broken! Too many TFs assigned to subject areas they have no expertise in and they are really botching our academic experience and affecting our grades. Samuel is a remarkable exception! He could flat out teach the course himself. He is incredibly smart, well read, and has written extensively. His section emphasized helping each student make sense of the preceding class lecture. His sections were low key to reduce anxiety. My only rec is that he talk a wee bit slower. Yale is fortunate to have him! He is really good. I can see him one day being one of the cornerstones of the Yale theology department.He is that good.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0By far, Samuel Loncar has been the most knowledgeable and well articulate TF in my three years at Yale. Sometimes. The only area for improvement I can see is how to take concepts that may be foreign to his audience and make them accessible.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel has an incredible grasp of the material and was able to provide insightful comparison and contrasts with Dr. Hare in interpreting key texts, demonstrating how the legacy of these two figures is wrought with disagreement. Yet, Samuel always handled differing issues of interpretation thoughtfully and tactfully, providing balanced readings of all the texts. Samuel was incredibly generous with his time and an excellent conversation partner in refining paper topics and ideas. He gave of his time and energy to help improve my thought. Discussion section turned into lecture at times, however, this also became necessary from time to time given the composition of the class and the difficulty of the material.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Strengths: Makes cogent arguments; able to communicate complex theoretical issues in understandable way Weaknesses: Lectured more than facilitated discussion; made sections about his argument regarding the text rather than encouraging students to develop their own thought",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Sam was an excellent teaching fellow, especially for the M.A.R. students who had a background in Plato, Aristotle, or Western philosophy generally. Two areas of improvement, though: 1) Sam could have communicated the expectations regarding our first paper better. 2) Sam has a tendency to get very excited by what he is teaching, especially Aristotle on hylomorphism. This is a great thing for a teacher; however, he sometimes would let his excitement get the best of him and proceed too quickly for many of the students in the class.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0S. Loncar was the best teaching fellow I have had in my career at Yale. He is incredibly smart, committed to helping students learn more effectively, and is an excellent teacher. He facilitated sections impeccably. I have learned so much from S Loncar and would not have thrived in this difficult class without his excellent tutoring.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Sam was great!!",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0He was knowledgeable about the material and approachable; occasionally, his polemical stance clouded the needed discussion about the material.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel is adept at encouraging class participation. As a result, the sections 'flew by' and NEVER seemed long enough. Samuel always made himself available for in-depth questions and discussions. He can provide both levity and a staggering intellect and he remains very approachable. He is clearly in complete command of the subject matter and was instrumental in helping me find my way through some of the labyrinthian thinking in some of the works we read. Finally, Samuel's guidance on papers as well as comments once those papers were graded, were extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Mr. Loncar was Great! His pedagogical style truly allowed the student to fully understand the complexity of issues surrounding the subject matter.His sections where a real delight to attend, Yale is very fortunate to have him.In the future he should provide additional reading list to aid in his lectures."
