   "comments": [
    "It's three books by each author, alternating week by week. It's a fast-paced class, and you should actually do the reading to get what's happening in lecture. Dimock is amazing and will always have something (many things) that are interesting to say. If you're interested in history, Post World War I art and literature, psychology, just about anything, chances are the Dimock with hit them for you. Absolutely wonderful, definitely recommend.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. This is a must for anyone with an interest in 20th century American literature, or anyone looking for great books to read. If you hear some people saying the lectures for this course are hit-or-miss, don't listen to them! Professor Dimock does a great job of analyzing these books closely and will make you a better reader\/writer for it.",
    "You will read great books, be bored in lecture, be engaged in section, and come out liking the class overall. Take it.",
    "If you like the books on the list, take it, but make sure you actually have time to read them because I struggled a lot to fit it all in",
    "Loved this class!!! The reading list alone is incredible and while some may find Professor Dimock a bit dry, she has such a different way of looking at things that I always looked forward to lecture.",
    "Great books, not much work, good TA decent lecture",
    "If you like English and the authors, take it, but lectures aren't the best.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it for an interesting class that's not too much work.",
    "You read very very very good literature. It's a lot sometimes; there are some weeks when reading a novel is just not a priority. But otherwise, very little work. The essays are pretty fun to write.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. The reading list is SO GOOD. If you actually do the reading lectures are also REALLY interesting. Also, in terms of work, it is relatively little for a writing credit. Yes there is a lot of reading, but if you do that than the rest is pretty straight forward.",
    "Loved the class. One of my first English courses at Yale so it was an intro for me. Professor Dimock's lectures are very interesting and can teach you more about the three authors and reading literature in general.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Simply put, the reading list is wonderful. When else do students have an excuse to read the authors that were arguably the most (and certainly among the most) influential writers of the Modernist movement and of the 20th century. Beyond the reading list, however, Professor Dimock's lectures focus on close readings. Each close reading provides a holistic examination of both character and theme, with emphasis placed on intertextuality. Students are encouraged not only to examine each work individually, but also within the context of contemporary works. Take this course; you will not regret it!",
    "I would recommend this class as a class you take because you are motivated by the reading. Lecture, when I took this class, was quite boring at times. That being said though, I enjoyed the readings and the papers for this class; section was pleasant; the workload was very manageable. Take this information as you will and evaluate if such an experience would be a powerful part of your schedule.",
    "It's a great intro to these three authors.",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy the authors listed in the title. If not, move on.",
    "Good class overall. Take it if you like the authors being discussed. The Faulkner reading is a bit dense and sometimes lecture can be a bit abstract and difficult to follow. But in general not too much work (only 2 papers and keeping up with the reading).",
    "Yes! This course is great. People in past evaluations have not given it enough credit. 1. The books are incredible; reading them does not even seem like homework. 2. If you actually listen carefully, Professor Dimock's analyses are extremely cogent and her lectures are really interesting and easy to follow. Great for English and non-English majors and definitely a very manageable workload.",
    "Great reading list but lots of reading to do. Its not too much writing for a writing credit and its about literature so its not a research paper that you need to find sources for, but that doesn't make it necessarily easy.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AN ENGLISH OR AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR. A bunch of my friends took this class and none of us were majors in either of those departments, but this class is very accessible even to non-majors and is a great option for non-majors who'd like to take a literature class before graduating but are intimidated by some of the other offerings. There's a lot of reading (roughly a book a week) but most of it moves really quickly and is actually really enjoyable (minus the Faulkner, which is crazy if you've never read him, but don't worry, everyone is in the same boat there). It's a great option if you need a writing credit--a 5-page paper, a 10-page paper, and a final. A lot of people didn't like Professor Dimock but I really did--I thought her lectures were very clear and interesting, though sometimes a bit of a stretch (but then again, when are English classes ever NOT a bit of a stretch?). If nothing else, the books you read are totally worth it,and you'll be really glad you read them.",
    "I read a lot of bad reviews before taking this class. I had heard it was good readings, but lecture was awful. After shopping the class, I knew I wanted to take it. I can understand where those reviews come from- Prof. Dimock doesn't have the most exciting lectures, as far as her delivery goes. However, she is the most brilliant professor I've had. Every lecture was full of gems as she close read the classics, often bringing in other works, such as Calvin, Picasso, and many others to talk about the works in a new light. My TF was incredible and there was a lot of opportunity to make my writing better, even in a lecture class. I'd highly recommend this class, or at least shopping it. You might just find yourself blown away.",
    "Great reading list and good discussions on the books, but the lectures are horrible.",
    "Good books; lecture wasn't too enlightening but is worth going to because it'll make the final really easy. The workload isn't bad-- two papers (5 and 10 pages), a final, and usually weekly reading responses or something for discussion section. Worth taking as a C\/D\/F just as a chance to read and discuss some famous books."
