    "Great course. Mark Mellman is a 10\/10 professor.",
    "I gained brand-new insight into the Election of 2016 and also the way campaigns are organized and run in general. This was the first time I had taken a political science class and so the first time I had to analyze polling data in an academic context, which is a useful skill to have. I definitely learned a lot of new and surprising information about American politics.",
    "None",
    "Data analysis skill Basic poli-sci knowledge",
    "I think this course taught me to look at campaigns more closely, paying attention to things I would not have otherwise noticed before.",
    "Learned a lot about the campaign of 2016 and the fundamentals of political forecasting and campaigning."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: digestible material, fun and engaging lectures, genuinely interesting content. Weaknesses: not a lot of opportunities for discussion or participation, and limited feedback on writing assignments (only 1 graded paper returned).",
    "It is a lecture",
    "Strength: low time commitment Weakness: the class is not organized and the materials tend to be boring",
    "This class should have been a 50-minute lecture class. Was not structured to be a seminar. Strengths: taught by a knowledgeable instructor.",
    "The course was supposedly a seminar, yet the teacher taught it like a lecture. There were absolutely no discussions for the two hours each week, he merely showed slides of his own studies and findings and did nothing to engage the students. We also got one grade back the entire semester and the teacher and TA were extremely irresponsive to student's emails. The course lacked structure, engagement, and transparency entirely.He advertised a final project as the final assignment for the class in which we create our own in-depth campaign (and I think this assignment was the reason a lot of students took the course) but he changed that to an individual final paper during reading week, giving us two final papers to hand in. We had just ONE graded assignment all semester so there was no way of tracking any improvement and the students received zero feedback. I recommend that it is not taught again.",
    "In my opinion the course should be taught as a lecture rather than a seminar. The teacher's lectures didn't really have enough depth to fill 2 hours so the lectures were a LOT of repeated information presented in different circumstances. Furthermore there was very little class discussion, as well as too many people in the class. Making this class into a 50-minute lecture would be perfect. As it is right now the class is a little boring (for the reason I mentioned and because it comes right after lunch, which is just unlucky). Also the lectures very rarely relied on a knowledge of the reading to be accessible, nor did we ever really discuss the reading in class..."

    "Take it. Fascinating look at inner workings of campaigns.",

    "I would not. The course should have focused more on the nuts and bolts of a campaign rather than individual polling statistics.",
    "Would not recommend this course to another student. Because the course is not well organized, and the materials tend to make students fall asleep in class.",
    "No. I did not enjoy this class very much. We did not learn anything universal about campaigns that I will take away to remember for the rest of my life.",
    "absolutely not.",
    "No - the class lectures are difficult to sit through and there is little opportunity to debate or otherwise engage with the material, apart from occasionally writing a paper."
