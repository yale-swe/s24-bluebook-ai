   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes I would recommend this class. It is a shame that Professor Winter is retiring, however! I am one of the lucky ones.",
    "Amazing lecture, Jay Winter is a legend.",
    "Take it. You will learn about the pivotal years of 1914-45, which everyone needs to know about. That brief high school unit on the World Wars is not enough....take this class if you want to be an informed citizen of the world",
    "I would recommend HIST 273 to fellow students, mainly because of the professor. I, personally, find the topic fascinating, but the professor made the class. Professor Winter is extremely good at what he does, and because of this I am sad to see him retire. I don't know how this class will be run in the future, but this class was great because of Professor Winter. The only red flag with this course is that there is an incredible amount of reading.",
    "I'd recommend this to any student, but especially people comfortable with and used to history courses.",
    "Amazing. Best class ever.",
    "Jay Winter is an absolute beast! I'm sure aristocrats all over the world pay good money to hear him lecture-you get to do it for the measly sum of a Yale tuition! This class is an incredibly thorough examination of the war years in Europe in the 20th century, with every lecture being a totally unique argument ranging from Shell Shock to Fascism. The lectures are almost always an intense emotional experience. You leave feeling like you have gone head first through a carwash with your eyes open, and are all the better for it. This course probably has more reading than anyone with half a life could do, but luckily you don't need to do all of it. The midterm essay will add two full length memoirs to the already enormous reading load, and the final takes about 3 days to adequately study for. I would guess this is the hardest history course at Yale. With all of that being said, though, I would take this class again in an instant for the sole purpose of going to the lectures. Winter clearly comes from the \"Yale old boys club\" of history professors, but that doesn't make him any less of a God in his field-the guy edited the three volume 1800 page Cambridge history of the First World War! I feel totally blessed to have gotten to take his class and I will always remember that the legacy of the war in Europe is to never forget!",
    "Absolutely. If they assign a new prof to teach this, be wary, because it won't be the same course at all without Winter. But it could still be great, especially the new guy follows his blueprint.",
    "Great class!!",
    "I would, though not sure what it's going to be like without Winter...",
    "This class explores the age of total war from very interesting perspectives. Winter discusses different strategies of commemoration, the effectiveness of resistance, the societal impact of the loss of soldiers and civilians, contested views on the beginning of the Holocaust, and more. It's the bomb.",
    "Take this class. It is a once in a lifetime experience.",
    "If Jay Winter ever teaches this course again, drop everything and take it. You will not regret it, no matter what you have to put off, no matter your major. It is phenomenal and had a distinct impact on my academic and personal growth!",
    "This is a very cool, dramatic history lecture, but you will work way, way, way more than a course like this should demand (six 4 page reading responses and often up to 1,000 pages of reading a week). Professor Winter's entertaining lectures made it just worth it to do that work.",
    "Total War with Prof. Winter is a really incredible class. In each class, Prof. Winter put forward an argument about a topic of time period that we were covering that he had developed over his decades of working in and studying WWI and WWII history, and the lectures were invariably engaging and incredibly interesting. It's true that the reading is impossible to keep up with, which is just silly because then at least I was more inclined to not do it at all, instead of, if the reading had been 100 pgs a week instead of 200, I would have done the 100 pgs because that would have been a manageable amount -- the way it is, it's so long that it seems like there's no use even trying. Reading aside, the workload is manageable, and I'm not sure what the class will be like without Prof. Winter, or even if it'll be offered, but if it's anything like it was with Prof. Winter, I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely life-changing and I'd say take it, but I wonder if anyone will take it over with Jay Winter's retiring. It certainly wouldn't be the same without him. It's a ton of work but so enriching if you're able to get through it all. I loved the idea of reading novels for the midterm rather than do a research paper. Final exam is a toughie but again, worth the experience of studying the material with such a critical eye and listening to the amazing lectures.",
    "An excellent lecture by an excellent lecturer on the 1914-1945 period. I would definitely recommend taking the course.",
    "A classic Yale course you should have taken.",
    "I highly recommend this course to a student who is looking to explore European history, or world history for that matter, and expand his knowledge of a crucial period in history. A lot of work, but if it interests you, go after it.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. It's the best class I've taken so far at Yale. It's a lot of work but totally worth it as you will learn so much and Professor Winter is excellent.",
    "This is an outstanding class that focuses not so much on the logistics of the two world wars, but more on the cultural impact of the wars. Winter managed to demonstrate the true scope of total war, far beyond simple memorization of generals and battle. The real value of the class, however, was in Professor Winter himself. And he just retired. So I'd recommend the course based on its content, but unfortunately future students won't have Winter to make the class truly amazing.",
    "So happy I got to take this class before Jay Winter left. It was amazing to learn from someone so renowned in his field."
