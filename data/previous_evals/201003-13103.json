    "This class is a perfect introduction to calculus and linear algebra from a proof-based perspective. I was \"good\" atmath in high school, but had little exposure to proofs, which are, after all, the bread and butter of all mathematics. This course thus provided me with just the basis necessary for further study in mathematics; it also significantly improved my formal intuition about math.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\A few caveats: Unfortunately, this course does not cover applications much at all, and if you are planning on taking PHYS 260a or a class requiring similar mathematical sophistication, you may be better off taking MATH 120 (assuming you haven't had an applications-based multivar class in high school or something). Also, this course sort of jumps right into formalizing arithmetic on the reals, so if you haven't had much exposure to mathematical proofs, you'll probably have a hard time starting out.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\This course starts out pretty difficult, but it gets better (kind of). Even if you struggle in the beginning (constructing the reals from the rationals from the integers from the naturals [but not constructing the naturals from the empty set, thank god]), take heart, because the class quickly moves on to more standard linear algebra material.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\Grading in this course is not terrible; if you have some idea of what you're doing, you'll probably get a B or better. Be warned that the weekly problem sets take a bloody long time (at least from my vantage point as a first-semester freshman), but are graded moderately leniently.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\This class is at the unholy hour of 9:25 am; for this reason, I often overslept and missed class. Don't do this; the textbook (Hubbard's Vector Cal, Lin Alg, and Differential Forms) is not the best when it comes to explaining things. It might not hurt to locate a cheap traditional introductory linear algebra textbook for supplemental help.OVERALL ASSESSMENT: much greater work; excellent quality. Any student who already has an applications-based vector calc OR linear algebra class under their belt should take strongly consider taking this class if interested in mathematics (assuming you aren't some sort of prodigy who also has already taken analysis).",
    "Your definitely going to need a strong love of math in order to get through the problem sets, but those who are willing to do the work will find it extremely rewarding.",
    "If you've got what it takes, it's a rewarding course.",
    "This is an extremely challenging class but nevertheless extremely fun. If nothing else, the class is great bonding time with other students.",
    "Take it if you are sure you love math. I thought I was good at math, turns out I was DEAD WRONG.",
    "Everyone knows that Math 230 is a tough class. I will be honest: it is very tough. However, if you are interested in mathematics, then you should take it because you will learn a ton about math over the semester.Math 230 is proof-based, so if you don't like proofs then you probably won't like 230. Although note that the proofs I'm talking about are not the \"proofs\" that you might have done in geometry. In other words, don't get turned off by the word proof.If you are just a person that likes math but that isn't serious about doing math at an accelerated pace, do not take this class. If you are sure you want to major in math or are considering some math\/science major, then I would definitely recommend shopping the course.The course will be harder in the first two weeks than it is for the rest of the semester, so stick it out until the 3rd week unless you are absolutely overwhelmed.I loved the class and I would recommend it for anyone interested in math.",
    "If you really love math and plan on majoring in the sciences or maths at Yale, then this course is definitely a must-take. It requires no knowledge of linear algebra or multivariable calculus, but knowing these will certainly not make the class boring, because the treatment of the material will be far different than the way you learned the material before. In this course, you will build upeverything you learn from the basic axioms, and if that sounds like something that excites you, then you will have an amazing time, especially if Professor Biringer is teaching it.The one caveat, as everyone has surely pointed out - the workload is ridiculous. Problem sets were often 10-15 hours a week, although as the semester went on, they did get a bit shorter. But if you are willing to make math your hardest class, then this is definitely something to at least shop.",
    "Definitely try it out but ultimately you have to know your priorities and schedule.The first few problem sets took more time to complete but generally got much more manageable. If you have experience with proofs and solving problems,the class will probably not be too difficult. The midterm and final were also straightforward provided you did the homework and learned the material (no surprises and all the problems had been previously touched on). If you haven't encountered proofs before, then it entirely depends so shop it.Personally I didn't find the first semester material that interesting, but you have to start somewhere and get a good grasp of the basics before you can learn harder and cooler things.I think one thing to keep in mind while taking the class is that how much you get out of it depends on how much you put in. A lot of important material is contained in the problem sets so not only should you solve the problems but make sure you know the results too.",
    "Math 230 is a very intense but very rewarding course. It was by far the most difficult and time-consuming of my classes, but if you are willing to put in the time and effort then you will learn an incredible amount. If you do not have experience in proof-based math, you will have a lot of catching up to do in the first month--by which I mean spending 15-20 hours or more on the problem sets. But once I became more familiar with writing proofs, the workload became more manageable, and I was glad that I suffered through that first month. Professor Biringer is excellent at explaining and illustrating concepts, and the lectures were usually interesting and easy to follow. (Also, GO TO OFFICE HOURS!) If you are debating between 230 and 120, you have until the midterm to drop down, which is what most people end up doing (my class started out at 70 on the first day and was down to 25 by the midterm). If you have the time and patience to devote to this class, definitely take it, but it's not for the faint of heart.",
    "It is a very demanding course, and the problem sets each week can take up to 20 hours depending on one's familiarity with the course material. So be prepared for a lot of work, but there is a lot to learn in this class also. Also, if you are more into applied math, or if proofs are not your thing, then the workload might be too much too bear, so think about whether so much math is worth your time before choosing the course.",
    "Math 230 includes topics from linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Some specific topics that I found really interesting were the introductions to topology and graph theory. I would recommend this class if you're willing to make a significant time commitment and are comfortable with the proof-based format.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who really enjoy math. It is more focused on proofs than on computation, and is really usefull for understanding the fundamentals of mathmatics.",
    "A lot of homework",
    "If you have a lot of free time and want to understand the ground-roots theory of multivariable calc, take this class.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wishes for the most rigorous freshman year math class. But for anyone who does not wish to major in math or is not seriously interested in pursuing a degree that requires higher math, I would not recommend this class. It requires longer hours than any of my other classes. I do not think this class should be required as a concurrent class with Physics 260.",
    "Math 230 is an awesome course for the freshmen\/sophomore interested in an introduction to real mathematics. That being said, this course is not your high school Calculus BC or Multivariable Calculus course. The problems are all proofs, and the rigor and pace of the course demands complete understanding of the material. Luckily, Professor Biringer is a great professor who holds long office hours and will help you to understand the problems in just about anyway possible. He is also a great lecturer, emphasizing a lot of the exciting qualities about mathematics. Problem sets are long, often difficult, and often require cooperation among peers. Biringer wanted to keep the sets at around 10-14 hours to complete, but they would sometimes take 20 or more hours, depending on the subject material that week. It might seem overwhelming at first, but stick it out and you'll learn so much. If you're interested in any sort of math-related major (especially if you are interested in pure math), then at least shop this course. It may seem difficult during the first week or two, but once the class size drops down, the homework will get a little easier and you will actually begin to build a personal relationship with Professor Biringer, which helps. This is a great math class, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with work ethic and a passion for math.",
    "It's a difficult course with weekly problem sets that take about 10 hours to complete, but if you did well in high school math and have any interest in learning higher level mathematics, you should definitely try out the course during shopping period. There are going to be a lot of \"uh, what\" moments when you try to do the first few homework sets (actually pretty much all of them throughout the semester, at least for me), but if you keep at them, you'll find that they're usually manageable and not as completely ridiculous as they seem. Definitely go to office hours if you can, and work with other students, as there is invariably someone in the class who is smarter than you.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 only to those interested in math\/science who really want to learn how mathematics actually works and how to construct mathematical proofs. This class gives you wonderful insight into the world of mathematics, and it will revolutionize the way you think about math and just about every other subject you will take at Yale. You will not only learn theorems, techniques, etc., but you also will, most importantly, learn how to prove them rigorously. The problem sets are hard, but incredibly rewarding. The only drawback of this class is the lack of application that is taught in Math 120\/Math 225.",
    "This is an intensive introduction to higher-level mathematics. The emphasis is on understanding the fundamental concepts behind mulivariable calculus and linear algebra rather than on computation. A majority of the students in the class are freshmen. Although the class only requires the equivalent of AP Calc BC, students have a mix of math backgrounds. I had a semester of multi when I was in high school, but most of this course has been new material for me.For the student who is willing to put the time in that the class requires (weekly problem sets are supposed to take 14 to 20 hours and can sometimes take more), I definitely recommend this class. Ian Biringer is absolutely fabulous, and I think that the integrated approach makes the material easier to comprehend. Concepts build beautifully. And because the workload is fairly intense, problem sets become a bonding experience.A few comments for students choosing between Math 230 and Math 225:The text we used (Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach, by John Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard) is incredibly readable for a math textbook--while Math 225 is taught with a very dense text (or at least was this semester). When I shopped both classes, my impression was that Math 225 had a much smaller homework load but that the class sessions themselves required more concentration--because of the textbook difference, but more because Howard Garland's style made him more difficult to follow than Ian Biringer is.The other thing to consider is that the workload in Math 230 became more manageable after the first few weeks, as Biringer adjusted the homework load to better suit the class, an as we fell into our study groups. It may take more than two weeks for you to decide whether or not this is the right math class for you."
