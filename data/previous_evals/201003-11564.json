    "Question 7c: The TA was out of the country for the majority of the course. He was still able to grade homework, however he was obviously not available for questions or to offer extra help to the students.",
    "Q2 Prof. Gregoire clearly knows the subject matter, but spends much too long explaining concepts in a circular fashion.Q7c Christian was only present for the first few weeks of the course. He taught one class and was excellent. Very clear and concise. Unfortunately, for a majority of the course he was in Brazil and unavailable.",
    "I will expound on how the readings and the professor's style may be improved in the next questions.",
    "Question 7: This course had no prereqs. It should. These are serious statistical concepts that are very difficult to grasp without a prior knowledge of statistics. Tim has been teaching the material for so long that it seems difficult for him to explain concepts to those without prior statistical knowledge.",
    "I think the class is too abstract. I think it would be improved tremendously to actually practice the sampling methods discussed and not only talk about the probability issues and techniques.",
    "3) Number of homework assignments were perfect.6) Wish we could have spent more time on the material taught at the end of the class: plots, line sampling, etc. Especially since it's particularly relevant to many people's research planning.7c) I had the hardest time getting the TA to respond to emails and would have really appreciated having a TA on campus in person to ask questions of. In one particular case the TA did not respond to a question I asked for close to two months, in spite of multiple reminders. This was extremely frustrating and didn't seem justified by their remote location.10) I think that this should be a required course for all MFS students and should be highly encouraged for their first semester at FES."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "It would be very helpful if the class went into the field for practical application of sampling techniques.",
    "This course has much potential to be informative and useful for many students. However the focus and format this year spent much too long on explaining relatively simple concepts without much focus on sampling methods and application.This course should not spend several weeks on simple random sampling nor a majority of each class period explain the formula associated with each method. An introductory stats course should be a prerequisite allowing this course to spend more time actually teaching sampling methodologies and their applications. Instead of its theoretic focus, this course should be problem based and focus on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different sampling methods under different circumstances.",
    "Perhaps devote part of the class in sampling in areas other than natural resources to see how the techniques can be applied in those areas.",
    "I would suggest that the readings and the style of teaching could be improved, especially when considered together. The in-class instruction seemed to be targeted towards students who already knew what was going on in class. Most of the people I spoke to over the course of the semester to get extra help from said they also never know what's going on in class. Perhaps starting off the semester with slightly slower instruction, breakdown of the variables, the goals, the methods, and repetition of that during the semester would be helpful. Even recurring themes, like the Horwitz-Thompson estimator, I still feel unclear about. It would have been nice to get a clearly laid out explanation of what that is, what it does, why it's important, and how it was derived. Along those lines, it would have been nice to start lectures out with a big-picture explanation of what's going on before drilling into the details. That helps students with my learning style. Also, it might be nice to get summary pages with the important statistical equations for each type of methodology and whether each one is biased, if it's precise, if it's helped by pairing with auxiliary variables, etc. For one, that would help me keep it straight; secondly, it would help me follow along in class because I would know what to look for in the lecture that explains why; and thirdly, it would help me keep my memory sharp after the class about what we learned.Given all that, I felt that the textbook didn't clarify the questions I had from class. It seemed jumbled and sometimes gave the information I needed for a certain methodology and sometimes it didn't. or it wasn't clear if it did. It would be nice to have the lectures be clear about those things I listed, so that the book may be a good supplemental resource.",
    "We could have benefited more from field demonstrations.",
    "Would have been good to include a brief discussion of some of the more mundane, yet practical and necessary details about actually putting these ideas into practice. Although we got a solid grounding in the theoretical underpinnings of these sampling methodologies, I do not necessarily feel prepared to put them into practice at the moment.",
    "Teaching style. There is a strong need to make the material more accessible to the lay person.",
    "See above.",
    "TA support for homework. Would have loved for several review sessions to be offered leading up to the midterm and\/or several example questions reviewed in classes leading up to the midterm."

    "Availability of the instructor was outstanding. The instructor offered extra review sessions and was readily available to students seeking extra help. The TA was out of country and was not available for extra help.",

    "Statistics are essential for many fields of research and management, and so this course was an excellent foundation for future coursework and employment by teaching methodology that I have not been exposed to before.",

I hope to employ the sampling methods learned in this class conducting research during a career in forestry research. While I'm glad that I took Reuning-Scherer's introductory statistics class and it provided an important foundation to allow me to better understand the material in this class, I wish I had been able to take both (not concurrently) in my first year. As such, I'd recommend considering moving this class to spring semester so that students can take both Reuning-Schere and Gregoire's classes before conducting their summer research."

Don't be intimidated.Make sure that next fall Stand Dynamics and this course do not overlap."
