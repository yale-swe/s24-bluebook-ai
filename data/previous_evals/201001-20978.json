   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to another student, but not many. The small class size was one of the course's strong points.",
    "The course looks theories regarding the use of violence, including the ways in which violence is used, why violence is used, and (in)effective responses to this violence. I would highly recommend the class to fellow students.",
    "International Relations 654 is a great way to understand issues in civil war and violence. It is a good overview political science class and it introduces you to the debates in the field. I would highly recommend the class because it is a fascinating subject taught by an excellent professor.",
    "Yes I would. While the course did not provide practical solutions to future policy makers\/analysts (which includes many, if not all of the students in the IR M.A. program), I did find it a very interesting academic view of a critically important topic that increased my understanding of it.",
    "Great if you're into research, though not as much so if you only want a class on policy."

   "comments": [
    "While I've studied conflict before, this was the first course that I've taken to focus singularly on the use of violence and theories surrounding why and how violence is used. In this sense it was extremely helpful for me, particularly if I hope to do work with conflict resolution or peace building.",
    "Since my discipline is International Relations, this course was directly related to that. My focus within it is International Development and although there wasn't a direct connection there, because of the connection between civil war and economic factors I think it was useful to get a better understanding of the issues.",
    "It provided a useful look at the interactions and issues found in interstate conflicts, which will be very useful background for me to have in my future career. It also allowed me to take a more academically focused class on the issues that interest me.",
    "I find myself thinking of violence in very different, more skeptical ways than I otherwise would (as far as reasons for violence, etc). Great class."
