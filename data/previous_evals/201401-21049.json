   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a window into a world of literature that I never knew existed in the arab world. I would recommend this class to those that are comfortable reading both intellectual and difficult texts and novels.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student thinking of taking it. Even if you are not confident in your Arabic ability, Professor Elbousty will go out of his way to assist you throughout the course.",
    "North African Lit is a good class to take if you want to keep up \/ improve your ability to read in Arabic. The readings are challenging, and you will definitely want to have good dictionary skills to help you, but they're worth the effort. The books deal with important cultural, societal, and political issues in North Africa, and Youness's perspective as someone from Morocco is a great addition to the texts.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. It is a great course and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend Arabic 164 01 to another student. The readings were extremely interesting, and the professor is an excellent teacher. The readings do take quite a bit of time, but I learned a lot from all of the time and effort I put in for this class.",
    "Absolutely. For all of the reasons above. But, I'd tell them to make time to do the readings, as it can take awhile.",
    "Students should definitely take this class! Arabic lit classes usually focus on Egyptian literature, however few focus solely on North African literature, and that is why this class was so interesting. Furthermore, the way the class was thought made it so that all students were always engaged in the discussion and made for interesting conversations about the books!"
