    "In this class we worked through a text with supplemental readings from other works to better understand the central text. It felt super in depth because we stuck to one theory, and as a result it is a theory I can apply to my daily understanding of the world as well as my academic work.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking this course as an introduction to anthropology or religious studies, or as a continuation of studies in those areas. The course was enriching, not stressful and a great experience overall.",
    "Cool seminar talking about how we view and understand life, through the lens of ritual. Can be taken by anyone, regardless of experience. Very chill."
