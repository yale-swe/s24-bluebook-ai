    "This was a very insightful class with regards to archaeological theory. Seeing Prof. McIntosh's approach to the class - starting it in the Enlightenment - expanded my understanding of the antiquity of these debates, and was quite helpful. Class time was also well-spent for the lectures and discussions we had about the readings for the week and the importance of them in the larger scheme of the history of archaeological theory.",

It functions both as a good class for understanding archaeological theory and also as a \"cohort-bonding-exercise\", as people in the department commonly take it at the same point in their graduate careers.",
    "Absolutely! Every student in archaeology should take this course."
