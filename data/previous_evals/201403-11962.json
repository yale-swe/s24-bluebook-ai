   "comments": [
    "I loved this course even though it was hard for a non-native speaker. You may or may not be behind because native speakers do take this class because it may be easy for them, but don't let that stop you. There is daily homework, but it's great practice. You will need to do work outside of class because it's a fast paced course. The professors have so much enthusiasm when teaching and that's what gets you by. The textbook is also a great resource and you can catch on even when you don't understand what's happening in class.",
    "This class takes a fine tooth comb through Spanish grammar and picks up on all the details that are brushed over in lower levels. There is no real speaking aspect to the class other than asking questions, so of you're looking to improve those skills I would suggest another L5 class. If you enjoy learning through repetition, then this might be what you're looking for. Profesora Ramos-Ruano is awesome-so passionate and helpful. Take it with her!",
    "A course dedicated to reviewing and improving Spanish grammar. I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a application based\/real-life relevant class.",
    "Lots of busy work, but it does help you learn the material. I took it to brush up on my grammar before taking more writing\/reading focused L5 classes and I think it definitely helped in that regard. You definitely want Juliana, she's so sweet and energetic, but don't expect to get an A because she's a strict grader. The material was understandably dry (it is a grammar class) but Juliana somehow made it bearable.",
    "Juliana is a very happy and upbeat professor, she will put a smile on your face every single day! If you get to know her on a personal level you will realize how amazing she is. There is a lot of work for this class, however it is not \"difficult\" just somewhat tedious, it doesn't take very long either. You will learn a lot of things that may seem very arbitrary to the language, and probably things that you don't even know about grammar in English. However, it is a very useful class, my Spanish has bettered significantly. Beware, Juliana is a difficult grader and will take points for many little things. Also if you are a native speaker, many of the native phrases or words you use given your nationality might cost you some points because they aren't considered standard Spanish.",
    "A great class if you really want to improve your Spanish. That being said, if you really want to improve your Spanish, you have to put in the work and it is a lot of work. The work could be taken as mindless busywork but to actually improve, you can't just consider it mindless busywork. Don't take this class if you don't actually care about Spanish and need to fulfill your language requirement. Also Prof Ramos Ruano is awesome and hilarious. She will keep you engaged and help you as best as she can to improve.",
    "Do yourself a favor and avoid this class. There is an insufferable amount of busywork, and let's be honest, nobody likes grammar. However, if you absolutely have to take this course, make sure you take it with Professor Ramos-Ruano; she's great.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone looking to learn how to write professionally in Spanish.",
    "This is a good class, but it depends on who you are and what you are looking for. I came into this class with weak Spanish skills, and that made this class very challenging. For reference, I got a B in L4 and had taken a semester off. The course's detailed grammatical bent is difficult to master already, so think twice if you will also struggle, like I did, to understand the more basic foundation material. That said, this course will keep you working constantly on your Spanish, and I do think I got better at writing and reading the language, as well as my intuitive and mechanical understanding of subtle grammatical points. But that comes due to lots of worksheets and stuff, and picky grading, that will make this class a constant struggle of some sort, no matter who you are. Also, don't think \"oh, its not a conversation course, but I'm sure I will get some speaking experience\". I still have zero spoken proficiency. What makes the difference in this class is the professor. I think most of the Profs are great, but we had Juliana, and she was simply amazing. She was incredibly helpful and made the class enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "Hard, but worth the work if you want to improve your command of the language."
