    "If you're taking it, you most likely have to. Neither hard nor interesting; get through it for the requirement.",
    "Spanish 140 is an average Spanish class. It covers fairly complex Spanish grammar and allows students to broaden their knowledge of the Spanish language. It makes use of various media such as readings, movies, lectures, and group projects to help students learn the material better. Students gain a better understanding of Latin American cultures as well through readings and movies and the preparation that is associated with them. Professora Valle was a good professor. She is extremely nice and understanding of the students. She relates well to them and enjoys listening to the stories they have to tell. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compassionate and clearly cares about each student. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny, and keeps the morale of the class high. Her accent is authentic and easily comprehended, and she speaks at a reasonable speed for the ability of the students. She is very good about following the curriculum and makes good use of class time. However, she does not seem to know some of the material particularly well and often is unable to give a clear answer or explanation to students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. Overall a good class that I would recommend. However, review the syllabus beforehand and make sure this is the correct level for you. I took the placement test and ended up in this class even though I had already learned all of the material. I wish I would have taken an L5 course.",
    "It's spanish. If you have to take it, then you have to take it, but it's not a particularly enjoyable experience.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this section. Sonia Valle is a wonderful instructor, who brings much warmth to the classroom. She really cares about students and wants to help them learn.Spanish 140 is much more difficult than 130 in terms of concepts as it has a much bigger focus on advanced grammar. I think it would make more sense for the department to spread out some of the concepts from 140 to 130 so there isn't as large an imbalance. That said, the tests each seemed to cover a decent scope of material so that they were not too overwhelming and grading was generally very fair.",
    "I didn't find it significantly more challenging than 130. Maybe it's a little more rigorous, and you will spend at least three weeks reading a novella in Spanish at the end of the semester. Prof. Sonia Valle was as kind and helpful as previous reviews said. I would recommend her as a teacher. She didn't have the strict, no-nonsense teaching style that many people find effective, although she was quick to correct any spoken errors in class and tried hard to encourage meaningful participation from the entire class.",
    "I would summarize the class as an in-depth look into advanced grammar concepts and an interesting overview ofhistory of the Spanish speaking-world in the second half of the 20th century. I would recommend this class to those looking for an L4 class because the professor was engaging and the topics were interesting. I would only note that the homework was redundant at times.",
    "Spanish 140 is a continuation of the material learned in 130 and is basically the final stage in learning and reviewing basic and intermediate Spanish grammar. It has a fairly substantial workload like all other Spanish courses and an excessive amount of oral presentations and exercises. Yet, it does include a large cultural portion that is a great supplement to understanding the Spanish language. If you plan to take this course, definitely take it with Professor Valle. She is easygoing, kind, and very willing to help her students in any way. She actually makes an early morning class enjoyable.",
    "More work than previous Spanish courses, and you should feel like you're much more conversational by the end of it!"
