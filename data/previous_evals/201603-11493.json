   "comments": [
    "An incredibly comprehensive knowledge about election rules, the rules about making election rules, and the rules about making the rules that make election rules. I also learned many pathways for strategic campaign reactions to these rules. Hersh provides a very realist (and somewhat pessimistic) approach to rules: they're not for the common good, only for one agent's gain. This is quite a useful lens through which to view American politics. Also were consistently forced out of the liberal bubble to consider issues from multiple persoectives, which was refreshing.",
    "This course delves into many election laws, but focuses more heavily on how these laws affect campaign strategy and results. As you read the material throughout the semester, you find yourself noticing nuances within the articles and creating your own hypotheses about the law and its possible implications. The course encourages students to look more deeply at not only campaign strategy, but how it impacts the course of America's future and how we can all play a role in it.",
    "I have a much better understanding of election laws and voting issues. Stuff like gerrymandering, ballot access, the Voting Rights Act, Citizens United, data laws, etc. The class makes you realize that things are a lot more complicated than you thought and there are few easily solutions to problems.",
    "An understanding of the impacts that different election laws\/rules have on the way campaigns behave and the outcomes of elections. How campaigns use different strategies to do their best to win, under these regulations.",
    "Learned more about politics and political system",
    "I garnered a better and fuller understanding of the electoral system in the United States and the various factors that are at play when considering the political climate during the election cycle.",
    "I learned a good deal about how political science is conducted, and how political concerns dominate every aspect of campaign law and practice.",
    "I learned a lot about election law and memorized over a dozen court cases. I am much more aware of the election process and the strategies campaigns use in order to encourage voter turnout and win.",
    "I learned a lot about the American election system through the lenses of Supreme Court decisions, laws, and general election philosophy. It was especially interesting to learn this during the presidential election cycle, which prompted lots of discussion.",
    "I learned how election rules impact the strategies, and therefore outcomes, of political actors and events. Starting with the Constitution, and then with political parties, nomination systems, redistricting, etc., we learned how rules constrain the behavior of the political elite and can often explain observed effects. I also learned a lot about the methodology behind political science research and how to interpret results of studies (I had never really read any political science scholarship before this class). I also felt I learned a lot from reading the actual court decisions that we were discussing, including the entire Citizens United opinion. I learned about the judicial process and how the Constitution impacts the application of rules in the election system (the effects and tensions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for example).",
    "This was a really thorough examination of the factors that politicians must consider when they seek office. It taught me to carefully examine all potential ramifications of any political decision, as it can have profound (or even not so profound) impacts on the way campaigns can be run.",
    "I learned a lot about, this may be obvious but it is true, election rules and campaign strategy. I really had almost no political science background before the class except for the use of data in campaigns, so I learned a lot. Also, I learned how to write in a different manner than how I was writing in my English class.",
    "As a whole, I learned how to think about political science. More specifically, I discovered how to carefully think about the way campaigns functions. We thoroughly examined the behavior that led to action in campaigns -- and that was a satisfying feeling.",
    "I learnt about election rules and election laws in great detail during this class. Professor Hersh also gave great insights about the 2016 US elections.",
    "Through the course, I learned some refined techniques in data analysis, but most importantly I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about the American election system. I think that Professor Hersh laid out the course in a fascinating way where I was able to really understand American electoral politics from very different perspectives. The course provided me a good base of theoretical, experimental, and practical knowledge regarding the topic.",
    "Gained knowledge about campaigns and election strategy.",
    "Taking this class during the 2016 election cycle was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. I learned a lot about politics, especially because of current events and the way that we discussed them in class and section. I developed a great appreciation for our political system and the way it works.",
    "Through this course I learned about the various complexities and intricacies of election law in the United States and saw how these rules impacted the behavior of candidates, politicians, and voters. I also gained at least a rudimentary understanding of some larger contentious political issues, such as gerrymandering, campaign finance, and the role race plays in the electoral system. With the election happening this semester as well, we also had time to discuss how this election differed from previous elections and how it raised questions about the validity of some of the theories we were studying."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: topicality and comprehensiveness. Weaknesses: I was unclear about how much the course wanted us to focus on social science methodology and how it is often wrong. Also this course should have been allotted 75 minutes, not 50. I've taken 75-minute courses that don't even cover half the material we do in 50, but often it means rushing at the end. Improvements: clarify the purpose of the course regarding how much methodology vs. conclusions to focus on. Make the course 75 minutes.",
    "The professor was not really interested in hearing others' opinions. If you disagreed with him, he was dismissive and only really explained his thought process. In addition, it was hard to follow the class at times because he did not put up any slides to guide the discussion and class seemed disorganized.",
    "The course was amazing, and I do not have suggestions.",
    "The strengths are the interesting nature of the material and Hersh'a really engaging lectures. Weaknesses were probably the vague nature of the essay assignments (and the information about the final). Heath doesn't seem super interested in assignments\/pedagogical techniques. Also he assigns long things you definitely do not have to read. He's just kind of like \"here's some interesting stuff let's talk about it,\" which is great but also means the class sometimes lacks structure.",
    "Classes are engaging and interesting. As are the discussion sections. A great mix of analysis of readings\/concepts and discussion time with Professor\/TA. There was some confusion around the papers as the briefs were given verbally, but other than that, no improvements.",
    "Only weakness of course was no powerpoints. Made hard to take notes and professor is sporadic on topics",
    "I believe that both the instructor and the TA were great at teaching the material and they both had great attitudes which made learning all the more better.",
    "I thought the course was very well-run and the material engaging. I feel like more focus could have been given to identity-driven inequalities within politics\/campaigns: Melis having a week to talk about women made it kind of feel like a special lecture instead of part of the curriculum and it seemed central to all of the types of themes we were discussing. To see more about how members of racial minorities faired in elections (do they, like women, do better in party-centered campaigns over candidate-centered campaigns?) would have been valuable.",
    "Some of the readings were very dry and it would have helped if we had gone over them a little more in depth in class.",
    "The strengths of this class are that it covers engaging, relevant material; is taught by a dynamic professor; and offers a new, interesting perspective on a commonly discussed topic. In terms of things to improve, I think it would have been helpful to have a little bit more structure and feedback on the papers. I enjoyed how the assignments were open-ended, and I thought the topics were interesting, but I think there might have been a better way to integrate what we learned throughout the semester into the papers. I loved the lectures and I gained a lot from the class as a whole, but I think there could have been a better way to connect the papers to the coursework to get more out of them. I did enjoy going to a political event; I think it was important for us to be pushed to get out and engage.",
    "I think the class was well balanced between lecture and the ability to have discussions with the professor. The second paper kinda pushed me out of my comfort zone,not necessarily politically, but allowed me to realize how independent was as a freshman which I really enjoyed.",
    "The professor was constantly engaged and was happy to take in student input, despite the fact that it was lecture. I was really happy to be in this class. He also integrated the readings into the discussion, which was nice. He could of spent less time summarizing and more time providing his own analysis.",
    "Strengths: Expert knowledge of election procedures, election laws and election rules. Good foundation in political science and research - the course is supported by well-researched material. Professor Hersh is interesting and engaging. Weaknesses: Not enough focus on campaign strategy and perhaps campaign case experiences as suggested by the course name.",
    "I think the course's strengths were its interesting selection (and not too burdensome) selection of readings. I think that Professor Hersh gave a reasonable amount of readings each week, no reading ever felt excessive, and all provided a tremendous amount of insight, so I think the planned curriculum of readings was a great strength. Another great strength was Professor Hersh himself as I really enjoyed his teaching passion, his opinionated rants every so often, and his interactions with members of the class. Ultimately, this was a fun classroom to be in and the homeworks were enjoyable which made the course pretty great. Professor Hersh knows the course's biggest weakness, but he fights over students with it so it is usesless to talk about. Professor Hersh loves to pass on important class news by word of mouth to encourage attendance to lecture, I understand that, but sometimes important information was missed and it was impossible to know.",
    "Exciting and interesting course! Honestly, Professor Hersh and Melis were what made it so great; their energy and outstanding teaching style facilitated interesting and exciting discussion. They were some of, perhaps the, best professor and TA I've had at Yale. I'm also really glad to have taken this during the 2016 election; I'm happy that we were able to discuss and try to make sense of the election during class. I could go on and on about how I loved this course and Professor Hersh, but thought I may as well cut right to the (few) routes for improvement. One issue is that I feel like I'm not really going to take away much from the course. Perhaps it's because I had some political background, but I already knew the basics of, for instance, Bush v. Gore, incumbency advantage, gerrymandering, and other concepts. Perhaps this course should have been listed as an introductory Political Science course. While I'm glad I took it and had a great time in lecture and section, I feel like I didn't really end up learning as much as I would have liked. Another way the course could be improved is in the written evaluations of the essays. I was frustrated with some of the feedback on the essay because it seemed like it was unnecessarily picking apart tiny and at times nonexistent errors. For instance, one evaluation said that I did not explain a possible counter-argument (and then detailed that one particular counter-argument). It is virtually impossible to debunk every counter-argument, and I did address the main counter-point claims. Therefore criticism such as that felt unnecessary and not well explained.",
    "I think Professor Hersh's lectures were incredibly interesting and very topical, so I think that those were definitely the strength of the course. He was very open and willing to take questions and get the class engaged. I also think that the readings were also very manageable and tied into the lectures very well.",
    "Professor Hersh's engaging lecture style was certainly one of the strongest aspects of the course. He brought lots of energy and encouraged students to disagree with him to elicit a deeper understanding of the issues. The readings were also fascinating, raising questions that I had never thought of before and highlighting the intersection between a range of election issues. I also appreciated the mix of empirical papers and court cases, which provided variety of perspectives and approaches to examining elections and campaigns. The weakest aspects of the course were the poor instructions and confusing nature of the written assignments. I found these papers frustrating to write, as I was often unsure of what was expected."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Although it probably won't the same outside of an election year, it was still incredibly comprehensive and inspiring. I want to continue studying political science because of professor Hersh and this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in American politics, or believes they know all the answers. The course challenges assumptions about reforms and prompts a deeper understanding of the system in which we live. Students who are alright reading a decent amount each week (75-175 pgs) will gain the most from the instruction. The papers you will right force you to think through the role election rules play on campaigns and the role campaigns or citizens play on outcomes. This course is a manageable, well structured class if you want it to be.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's really interesting, it makes you think, and lectures are well delivered and engaging.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course. It's an exciting and engaging way to understand politics in the context of election campaigns, whether you've had a lot of experience in campaigns or are coming to the issue for the first time.",
    "If you love politics take it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in the political process. I would recommend he\/she take it during an important election cycle, but regardless take it!",
    "No I wouldn't. The teacher just states his opinion and the final was very difficult for no reason.",
    "I absolutely would recommend the class, Professor Hersh is a great political scientist and lecturer and the material is fascinating and useful for understanding the most-frequently-seen side of politics",
    "This was a great course, especially during an election year. It's a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time and a lot of readings, but it's very manageable.",
    "This is an incredibly informative political science class. Professor Hersh is an engaging and dynamic lecturer and every class I found myself focused and interested. His lectures moves quickly and he doesn't use slides or visual aides. I would say it's best to have taken a more basic poli sci class beforehand, but it's not necessary.",
    "I'd recommend the course to another student. The discussions and lectures were engaging and I gained a deeper knowledge of American political system than I had prior to the class.",
    "This is a great class that I would definitely recommend. Professor Hersh is a really engaging, dynamic professor, and although at times he may rant a little bit, his opinions are different from the standard of what you might expect, so I think they added something to the course. I gained a new, more comprehensive understanding of the U.S. political system and was exposed to really interesting research going on right now in the field. I'm really glad I took the class!",
    "Yes, this course was a fantastic overview of how campaigns are run and the impacts",
    "Yes, I thought it was extremely interesting and I learned a lot. For anyone interested in political science or wanting to understand more about politics just in general, I think this would be a perfect class to take. The class doesn't require you to be fully immersed in the political world before you take the class, but for me really opened my eyes a little bit more to what was going on around me. For me, the post election week of discussions were some of the best and most interesting I had had on campus.",
    "YES. If you are interested in electoral politics or campaigns, take it. This class will help you understand your campaign experiences and in my opinion, will make you even more motivated to get involved in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 229 to other prospective students. The course provides an interesting take on the different actors in the American electoral system and combines a good mix of poli-sci theory and data to form its core. If you're interested in politics, want to learn more about our political system, or want to take a class with one of the best young professors at all of Yale, then PLSC 229 is definitely a class you should check out.",
    "Professor Hersh is outstanding!! If you don't have much of a background in elections\/campaigns, I would highly recommend this course! Both lecture, section, and readings are interesting and exciting.",
    "I definitely think everyone should take this class. It is crucial for a deeper understanding of politics in the United States and the way that campaigns and elections are run. I think that this is important information for every Yale student to know.",
    "I would recommend this course if a student is interested in the topic. The course was thought-provoking and Professor Hersh was an engaging lecturer. He could be a bit combative at times, but ultimately I think this strengthened my understanding of the topics and forced me to reconsider some of my values. However, the course seemed a bit disorganized at times and the lack of clear instructions made the assignments more difficult than they needed to be."
