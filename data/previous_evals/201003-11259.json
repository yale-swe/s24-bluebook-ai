    "'The 1730s' may at first seem like an odd way to approach Bach studies, but this era reveals a number of interesting aspects about Bach's personality, output, and approach to life, faith and music alike. This course is engaging but students who wish to get the most out of this course and to push their understanding to the deepest level may wish to dig into the scholarly repertoire on Bach's life and works and cultural life in 18th-century Germany in advance so as to appreciate some of the elisions and contradictions in the literature.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. The small assignments throughout the semester mean that you are constantly exercised in thinking about the course for yourself, and that you become confident in relation to what the professor wants, long before the final assignment. It is also really nice to have a course that looks at manuscripts and the composer's compositional process. You find yourself learning a great deal through this kind of course."

   "comments": [
    "Although this course was not directly related to my own research, it did demonstrate some pitfalls in scholarship (such as the problems associated with narrowness of vision or lack of cross-referencing) that it would be well to be aware of. Understanding the way in which Bach has been constructed in the scholarly discourse - and the contradictions between that and some of the evidence available - is also (a) a timely reminder for my own work and (b) useful to bear in mind for future teaching."
