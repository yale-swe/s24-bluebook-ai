   "comments": [
    "Yes you'll learn Chinese, but it is a big time commitment.",
    "I would recommend the class for a student who is very serious about learning Chinese. Based on the workload and pace, it is not a class that you should take to simply fulfill a language requirement. However, for someone who is interested in becoming fluent in Chinese, the class is a great first step toward that goal.",
    "This is a very difficult course, but probably the best introduction to Chinese you will get in your life. Highly recommend for those who are willing to take on the challenge.",
    "Super good class! Take it! But remember it is a lot of work.",
    "Chinese 110 is a beginning level language course that I would necessarily recommend to beginners. Many students come into the class with experience with Chinese or a similar language, which is quite frustrating for those who have never taken Chinese before. The workload is a lot, but you get into a pattern throughout the term that makes it more manageable. This is a great class if you are highly interested in Chinese and willing to put in the time. However, if you just have a slight interest in learning the language, beware... you will be putting a lot of time in. Yet, if you are putting the work in, you will see your language skills improve drastically.",
    "The Chinese program at Yale is very intense. If you're not serious about learning the language you shouldn't take this course. It's a lot of work but it gives students a basic understanding of the language.",
    "Absolutely take it. Great teachers, great program, opportunity for light. Definitely a time commitment, but people tend to over-exaggerate its difficulty. The syllabus says 2-3 hours a night, but I would usually spend around 1-1.5 hours. It's also easier than other Yale classes in the sense that you know exactly what you need to do to succeed. You know exactly what you'll need to know for each test and quiz, and as long as you put in the proper amount of time, you'll do well. It's not like a science course for example, where you can understand the concepts but still do poorly on the test. It helps you stay on schedule since you have to get out of bed and go to class every day. Homework every night ensures that you will never have a huge buildup of work for the test. For each test, you pretty much only need to review how to write the characters, since homework and class have already prepared you. You'll get to know the people in your class well. I'm good friends with everyone in my class. Overall great experience. If you're willing to commit the time, definitely do it.",
    "People said Chinese would be hard, especially having never taken the languages before. Chinese L1 was not easy, but it wasn't hard. The course requires you to put a lot of work into the class -around 1-1.5 hrs of homework a day (I'm not the fastest worker) and about 30 minutes of studying for daily quizzes. They say at Yale that Chinese isn't a class - it's a lifestyle. In each class there were about 7-10 kids and we had 4 teachers, each one taught for 1-2 weeks and rotated between sections. The Chinese teachers are amazing and the department overall is great.",
    "I feel Chinese 110 is an excellent introduction to becoming fluent in chinese.",
    "CHNS 110 01 is a difficult class with a heavy workload and should only be taken if you are truly interested in the language. The course, however, is taught by an amazing group of teachers who strive to increase student understanding as much as possible. I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Chinese is much easier to learn if you have prior exposure to characters through Japanese and maybe Korean. If you don't know any characters already it will be a very heavy time commitment.",
    "CHNS 110 was rigorous, but taught a lot. I would recommend it if someone truly wishes to learn to speak, but not if they are trying to just get a requirement fulfilled.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 110 to another student, if he\/she is very serious about learning Chinese and is willing to devote 2 hours to the course. It is so rewarding, and you do really get what you signed up for- an intensive Chinese learning experience. And the great thing about Chinese is that the work you put in mirrors the results that come out, so commitment and willingness are really the main factors.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn chinese - a bit work but great opportunity!",
    "Highly recommended for interested students, high time dedication, but class is extremely well taught.",
    "Take this class! I began this class on a whim, deciding not to continue with Spanish after high school. After the first day I knew I loved it. If you have never learned an Asian language, Chinese is absolutely the way to start. The teachers are all phenomenal (they rotate every week) and each offers something different. You are expected to learn six characters per night and a dialogue every two days, with a quiz to start each class. In the first weeks it seems like a lot, but you get used to it and the characters become more and more fun to learn and to practice. Tones are difficult, but the one-on-one half-hour practice tutorials with a TA native speaker every week help infinitely. The Chinese department offers so much to learn so quickly; by the end of level one you will be able to carry out basic conversations and to survive in a Chinese-only environment. The class asks a lot, but the more you put in the more you get out. TAKE CHINESE."
