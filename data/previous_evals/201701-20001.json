   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James commanded the discussion sections well, and tried to encourage and facilitate as much conversation as possible. All around, no weaknesses.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James Nati is an exceptional TF whom I greatly admire and appreciate. He organizes section well, and is able to change his instruction style on a dime if the class needs a different perspective or seems to be having trouble grasping the material. He is kind and very accessible. I would absolutely take a class of which he is the sole instructor.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0Did not really have James...info about T.J. in the practicum section",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was a great section leader. His strengths were many and include being organized, communicating via email, writing the objective of the section on the board, grading fairly (and in the case of the exegesis, constructively), and directing the section discussions. Do I have to name any weaknesses? He was quite good. Perhaps James could work on projecting his voice more boisterously.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James Nati is an excellent teacher. He challenges students to develop their scholarship.",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James was excellent. I appreciated his frequent and consistent communication, and sections were well organized. I have two minor complaints, only one of which is related to James. The first is about section readings (I assume Professor Collins assigned them). I did not find them to be integrated with the rest of the course material and there were very few that I thought were useful. The second relates to the changing of the section times in the second half of the course. Though I'm sure it was done for good reasons, it was incredibly inconvenient to rearrange my schedule. Overall, though, James was an exceptionally good TF",
    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James is an exceptional TF. He is consistently patient with the students, available, listens carefully, and adjusts his teaching to meet the flow of a discussion. His passion for teaching is clear.

    "Instructor: James Edward Nati \u00a0James Nati was NOT my teaching fellow - the form would not let me submit my response without checking that he was my teaching fellow, but I actually had John Thames as my teaching fellow. My comments about him are in my additional comments about the course below - I want to avoid any confusion, because I was disappointed in John Thames and I do not want my negative comments to be associated with James Nati. Thank you!",

    "John is highly personable and has a welcoming character. He was easily accessible for meeting for extra help outside of discussion sections. The one area for potential improvement pertains to his discussion planning- Section meetings often seemed rather improvised. At the same time, John was skilled at facilitating contentious discussions in a civil and diplomatic manner. I very much enjoyed working with him this semester!",
    "TJ led lively discussions that definitely allowed space for questions, student leadership and clarifying of material from lecture. In the future, TJ can more precisely plan midterm and final review sessions so they don't feel as rushed and stressful to copy so much material down in a short amount of time.",
    "I thought T.J. was a very helpful TF, particularly in terms of willing to challenge our thinking and arguments in discussions and opening up substantial conversations about the Bible.",
    "-extremely knowledgeable, funny, and engaging (easily has command of the classroom) -sometimes cut off people when they were talking or challenged what they were saying in a way that came off as rude (this was in no way T.J.'s intent, he is a great person, I think some people were just taken aback by his tone on occasion)",
    "He was fantastic at facilitating discussion; he was one of the best TFs I have ever had in that regard. He was able to think about the implications of different interpretive choices, which was helpful. While this did not dominate section, I appreciated the few times when he gave his own opinion in regards to how convincing an article's argument was.",
    "TJ was a great TF--good discussion leader, paid close attention to what the class was interested in talking about, made it fun. Very available over email and phone when necessary. Very glad to have had TJ as my TF this semester!"
