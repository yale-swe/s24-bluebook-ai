    "Yes. Begin write code as soon as possible.",
    "You will learn how to program scientific methods correctly, and you will unlearn many bad habits. You will understand what things like condition number, SVD, nearest neighbors, spectrum, Newton's method, etc. actually mean and why they are useful. If you are motivated and want to make an extra effort to learn the material, you will benefit greatly from this course.",

Many fundamental numerical and data mining techniques were covered which are essential to scientific computing in general. I will very likely have to use many of the methods we implemented for this class in my research and future coursework.",
