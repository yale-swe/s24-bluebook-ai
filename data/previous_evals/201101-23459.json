    "This was not a great course. First of all, Dr. Leaderer only actually taught two of the classes. The rest of the classes were just given by guest lecturers, some of whom were better than others, but none of whom were good enough to keep Dr. Leaderer's attention- he rarely stayed throughout classes. Furthermore, the outlines that were assigned for homework were nothing but busy work. Wish I had learned more.",
    "kind of boring. it's like a seminar, but it repeats a lot of the concepts we've learned in other ehs courses.",
    "Interesting class! The best way to improve this class is if Dr. Leaderer's wife could cook for every class...",
    "The class consisted of outside lecturers throughout the course of the semester. Most of these lecturers were interesting and engaging. The workload was relatively light. However, I learned very little in this class. I only learned new concepts and vocabulary during the first couple lectures taught by Brian Leaderer. Otherwise, although the outside speakers were interesting, I didn't take a whole lot away from the course.",
    "The course is riddled with a lot of busy work which really is annoying and unhelpful. The reading material is interesting at first but then gets very redundant. Some of the speakers were terrible lecturers. I think many people have high expectations of this class, so it's not that the class is bad, it's just disappointing."

    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0I wish that Dr. Leaderer had taught more of the classes and that we had learned more about exposure assessment. It just seems sort of like cheating to have all the classes taught by guest lecturers. Also, the outline assignments seemed like a waste of time.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Professor Leaderer is an intelligent man and very accomplished in the field, but seems detached from this course and his students.Students would benefit from a more engaged style of lecture, or even a less-established-but-more-engaged lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Brian is a great instructor, but this class uses mostly guest lecturers. would like Brian to do more of the teaching--he's more interesting than a lot of the lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Very knowledgeable teacher, great class.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0He is smart and engaging, and responsive to student concerns. However, he didn't teach that much during the semester so there's not much more I can say about him. The midterm was pretty fair although we never got it back. The few assignments we did during the semester. were also never returned. Also, he seemed somewhat unavailable. All questions, concerns, and assignments were directed to his assistant Jodi. That just made it seem like he didn't have time for his students.",
    "Instructor: Brian Leaderer \u00a0Professor Leaderer is a great professor, he is great at explaining things and it is wonderful to absorb his knowledge. Although feedback on our work from him would be very helpful, it would be great for the class if he did more of the teaching and there were less guest lecturers, because we would really love to hear more from him."

    "Great!!",
    "Take it if you're looking for a light-workload type of course. Having a new outside speaker during each class also keeps it interesting, although many of them covered similar topics which made it rather repetitive.",
    "Read the reading we're goingto critique, and get started on your term paper early. There are a lot of 'weekly discussion pieces', which is basically just worthless busywork. Participate in class and be respectful to the speakers (even if they suck)."
