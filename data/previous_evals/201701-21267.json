    "Can't imagine a better introduction to modern Chinese. 10\/10.",
    "beginner chinese vocabulary, grammar, more fluency",
    "Chinese in many contexts that is useful in every day conversations.",
    "I learned beginning Chinese. Chinese 120 was definitely harder than first semester, but it was very worthwhile. This course is very rigorous but you learn so much from this class. I really appreciate all the support I got from my teacher and TF during this semester. There is a lot of work and a quiz every day, but the structure of this class is very similar to how it was first semester. It challenges you to be on top of your homework and make sure that you know the material so you don't fall behind in class. I am very passionate about learning Chinese because I took this class.",
    "I learned a great deal of fundamental and useful Mandarin Chinese (speaking, reading, writing, and listening), as well as a lot about Chinese culture.",
    "Rigorous development of all language skills. Attention paid to vocabulary, writing, pronunciation, conversation, reading, writing and listening.",
    "I developed the kind of multi-dimensional thinking necessary for language study",
    "A better understanding and mastery of the fundamentals of the Chinese language and culture.",
    "I developed basic command of Mandarin Chinese: speaking, reading, writing and listening."

   "comments": [
    "Well-paced class with reasonable homework load and very committed and engagement instructors.",
    "The teachers were all really great, and it was also nice to switch teachers every week or so because each one had different things they liked to concentrate on.",
    "good instruction, organized",
    "It's a great course that requires a daily commitment of work.",
    "This course is very rigorous. There is homework and a quiz every day. There are chapter tests every two weeks, and every lesson has an oral presentation. There is also a final oral presentation. I think sometimes the online homework is not necessarily accurate, and that can be confusing especially when online homework counts for a grade. The strengths are that the teachers are very passionate about the course and are willing and able to answer any questions that I have. The class size is small so people get a lot of time to practice and engage with the classroom material.",
    "Very few complaints about the Yale Chinese program. Know what you're getting into. This is an extremely rigorous course which demands your attention every day. You cannot slack off, as you will be quizzed daily. The rewards are great, however, and if you really want to learn Chinese this is the place to do it.",
    "The rigor of the class and the consistency in homework, daily quizzes, and regular exams means that the workload is fairly high every day but that you really learn the material and that, come finals, it isn't as overwhelming as it is in other classes.",
    "The course is good at getting through a lot of material quickly. It could improve by having better reviews before exams or by creating study guides for chapter tests.",
    "Strengths: 1) Intensity 2) Great support from teachers 3) Very good teaching material 4) Great structure of the course Weaknesses: 1) We did not have a lot of opportunities to practice unscripted speaking."

    "East Asian language courses at Yale are unlike any other! Take the course, get a Light Fellowship, and see where your language skills take you. Highly recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!",
    "yes!",
    "It is a great course for learning Chinese.",
    "Yes, this class is a great way to learn Chinese. Yale definitely has one of the best Chinese departments and it is easy to see why. You are guaranteed to learn a lot by enrolling in this course. The work you put in will be worth it especially if you decide to study abroad in China or continue your language study in later years. Great and fun class. Learn very applicable Chinese skills.",
    "I would. It's a very well-designed language class, and Mandarin is a very useful language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, provided you know what you're getting into. This will take a lot of time, both in and out of the class. Your Chinese will improve markedly though, and the course staff are extremely talented, endearing, and professional.",
    "Absolutely! It's a hard course but definitely an important skill and a very well-taught class.",
    "I would recommend it, it's a very comprehensive introduction to the language. Chinese is also one of the most useful languages to learn, so I think the benefit of taking this class is very high.",
    "If you are interested in learning Chinese, definitely take this course. Arguably, this is the best introduction to the Chinese language."
