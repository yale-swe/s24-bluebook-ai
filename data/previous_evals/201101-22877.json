   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It's a pretty low workload (just participation and a final paper). Every student also does a 12-minute presentation at the end on their paper topic, but this is more just for feedback and not really for a grade.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. We read two landmark papers each week, meet first with just the students to work out the details behind experiments and such, and then meet with the profs to discuss the logic and reasoning behind each paper. Not too much work, fantastically helpful, and overall very interesting and fun.",
    "Methods and Logic is an excellent course and will teach you how to think about science in a very critical manner. There is no other undergraduate course within MB&B that has the same level of intellectual intensity. The workload of this course is not heavy. With that said, reading the articles in the way that the professors expect requires a great deal of time and dedication. Both the final presentation and paper were stressful, and appear suddenly following spring break. Just time yourself accordingly. The class size this year was much larger than previous years, but I suspect the professors will restrict the seminar to a smaller number of students in future semesters. Take this course before you graduate form Yale, you will not regret it.",
    "All MBB majors should take this course. It tests all you've learned, and also fills in all the small holes in science knowledge that accumulates through the years. Very challenging, but rewarding.",
    "Absolutely. You can really feel your brain growing during class. Hopefully they cap the class next year.",
    "This is a great course! Workload is not too hard, and you will learn a ton by the end of the course. Expect to be challenged by the amount of background you are expected to know, however, as lab experience is useful for discussion of techniques in this class.",
    "Absolutely. I think you should take it if you are ever a MBB major -- you will definitely enjoy it and gain a lot of insights.",
    "Read two biochemistry papers (often famous ones, published sometime between 1940's and 1990's) per week, discuss them with the class for two hours. At the end of the semester, give a presentation and write a final paper on your proposal of some follow-up experiments for one of the papers. It's a good course, and the people who take it are generally very competent and very interested in the material, which makes the discussion interesting. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, take this course! You'll learn to think more critically. Class discussions were fun and a great opportunity to get to know other students and faculty.",
    "Take it if you are willing to put in the effort of actually reading the papers. If you do not read them, you will get ripped apart during class and find the semester miserable. If you do read the papers, the class is very enjoyable with little workload.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend Methods and Logic. This course is all about learning to read papers critically, and invaluable skill, and one that is not often taught well. The course is not too much work, and the discussions are often fascinating."
