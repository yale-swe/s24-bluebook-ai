    "Yes! Take it!",
    "This is a good senior seminar. The reading list contained many interesting books and exposed me to a variety of authors (Singer, Morrison, DeLillo) whom I had not read before. Getting through \"Waverly\" at the beginning of the course may be tough, but it gets much better after that. Prof. Miller is a great teacher and definitely worth having at some point.",
    "Yes. Great course. Professor Miller is a great facilitator and his willingness to meet one-on-one throughout the term makes the final paper so much easier. The works you read span everything from traditional historical fiction to books you might never have thought to include in the genre.",
    "Take it for your senior requirement if you're an English major - it's a great class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. You read Waverley, Tale of Two Cities, Orlando, Beloved, Libra, Enemies (a love story), among others. The course is a senior seminar, so is a small class size, about 10. It is great for discussion, an ideal english course environment.",
    "If you enjoy history or novels, you should take this course.",
    "A fantastic survey of an exciting breed of literature. You study a wealth of time periods (Romantic Britain, contemporary America), which may seem scattered for a small seminar but actually becomes a very sensical method of approaching the historical novel. Prof. Miller is a devoted teacher, as well."
