    "I would summarize History of Art 588 01 as a great seminar on medieval sculpture that focused on questions of physicality and representation of the human body. I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "The course engaged more with thematic topics in the history of sculpture rather than a systematic look at this history, which I expected coming in to it as a seminar as opposed to a lecture course, so I would recommend it to someone with at least something of a background in medieval sculpture or medieval art more generally."

    "This course deepened my knowledge of monuments, literature, and problems in the field of medieval art.",
    "This course helped me relate my probable dissertation topic to other areas of medieval sculpture in ways I might not have had the opportunity to do as of yet. I also very much appreciated Prof. Jung's supplemental bibliographies as these will no doubt be valuable in the very near future."
