   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "It's a tough class, you have homework every day and you will spend a lot of time on it, but you learn a lot.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to anyone interested in spanish",
    "This is an essential class for your development of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. However, it is very fast paced and you must be willing to allocate at least an hour to homework and studying on a nightly basis. The grading is very harsh and marks are taken off for minor errors.Do it with Professor Ramos if possible, she is amazing!",
    "Spanish 120 is a great review of basic grammar and vocab. We spent the first week or two reviewing L1 material and went from there. This class reviews preterite\/imperfect, subjunctive, imperative, etc. If you put time into this course, you will see yourself improve in speaking and writing. The workload is not difficult; you receive about an assignment each night, much akin to a high school structured course. This is a very enjoyable course, and I would recommend that you take it with Sra. Ramos-Ruano.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great time, not a lot of work and pretty easy to get an A in as long as you do all your homework and study a little bit for quizzes and tests.",
    "This class is a great way to strengthen your basic Spanish and set the groundwork for more complex aspects of the language. I would strongly recommend it to anyone hoping to improve their Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone because it is a great way to build knowledge of the Spanish language and culture",
    "This level 2 class is a great class to take after having a background taking the language. It was a comfortable level with a great teacher and strongly advances one's knowledge of the language. I would definitely recommend this class to somebody interested in Spanish because learning a different language is a great opportunity and Spanish is spoken all over the world and would be a good choice."
