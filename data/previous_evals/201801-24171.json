    "Very free course - you get from it what you put in to it. Of course the course completely rests on Paul. Without him this course doesn't make any sense.",
    "I appreciated the project-focused alignment of this course as a follow up to Narratives to Networks from the fall -- the structure allowed me to pick up where I had left off last semester and design a project that would help me practice skills of specific interest to me. I think that the structure of class meetings for the course could be improved if they had some more structure to them. Some days different groups presented on their process, and other days Paul lectured on topics that related but not necessarily to every group. I wonder if it could have been useful to have different groups check in with each other rather than check in with Paul each week -- it could have been helpful to talk through my project with others who were struggling with similar issues, or to get to advise other students on their process. I wonder if the course could be structured more like a workshop -- every other week, perhaps, students go around the room and share an update as well as a question they have for the group, and other class members are able to support them. I do think that Paul has the tendency to take up more time than he means to with his comments in class, so this format could be a means of making sure that students have more voice in the room. I also think the class could have been improved by quickly reviewing network strategy for all participants from the beginning -- those of us who had taken the fall semester course clearly had an easier time understanding the projects and moving forward on them. Even one or two weeks of lectures to build a common class language would have been very beneficial to some of the students in the room.",
    "The strength is that since it was a clinic course there was a lot of interactions with the stakeholders and you learnt as you worked. It made me overcome a lot of my fears, and I grew a lot. Sometimes it felt like I was in the eye of the hurricane though, because there was so much going on at the same time and it often felt like there were so many angles we worked on but it just dissipated over time, for no reason.",
    "Strengths Allows students to solve environmental problems by working on real projects Students forge relationships with the different stakeholders involved An opportunity to customize the project and provide effective solutions through network mapping Weaknesses Lack of proper organization"

   "comments": [
    "Only take if you are ready to put in some independent work. If you are in the game mainly for the grades or to check boxes this is not the class for you.",
    "If there is a client project that is of interest to you, this course can provide you with a great experience of exploring network strategy as it relates to that project. If you have yet to take a class from Paul Lussier, recognize that he has a very specific way of teaching and engaging and you may feel you're playing catch-up to understand his ideas.",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class doing research on your own. Most of the times, you may be on your own with clients. This can especially be difficult for people for whom English is their second language.",
    "Be dynamic and open minded. Be ready to learn and be challenged."
