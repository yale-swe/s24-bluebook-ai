    "Great class to learn how to work with a client and work on an issue related to corporate sustainability.",
    "Consulting skills and knowledge of specific project",
    "Practical skills from working with the client.",
    "Learned\/improved my teamwork, team management, client management, project scoping skills.",
    "This course helped me organize the way I deliver a consulting document, focusing on the message that needs to be conveyed. Clients have certain expectations that need to be addressed in the deliverables. How the product of the work is presented is as important or even more, than the findings themselves.",
    "Interpersonal team dyanamic",
    "team work is the major part of this course and I learned a lot from my peers",
    "Gained more experience managing the client\/consultant relationship.",
    "Learned new insights specific to my client project. Honed existing research and analysis skills. Gained some new skills on team dynamics and leadership. Some new insight into the consulting sector.",
    "I got a taste of what it is like to be in business consulting. Most of what I learned was the mechanics of environmental initiatives and not so much business strategy.",
    "Leadership, client engagement, team management",
    "You learn a broad overview of what environmental and sustainability consulting are and what the (somewhat outdated) best practices in the field are.",
    "Helpful practice in drilling into unfamiliar subject matter on behalf of a client. Good experience for consulting."

   "comments": [
    "very well.",
    "Very well",
    "The knowledge and insight from class lectures or speakers was disappointing. The real value in the course was the client project.",
    "I was disappointed with the guest lectures. Many of them weren't relevant to our project, and some weren't relevant to any of the projects in the class.",
    "They aligned somewhat, not entirely. I expected to engage more on the financial side of the evaluation we would make, but the expectations from the client were fully qualitative. It didn't take me long to adjust to this and I ended up learning a lot about managing clients expectations.",
    "A bit below expectations",
    "I had very different expectations and ended up learning something really different.",
    "Did not meet expectations",
    "It was great to have a chance to actually work with companies while studying in the school and help to solve their real life problems",
    "I took the class just wanting to gain more experience working with a client, and that happened, so I'm happy about that.",
    "They aligned fairly well. The client project very closely aligned with my interests.",
    "I hoped to learn a bit more about business strategy. My project didn't really lend itself to that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Class overall was less structured than I hoped - less direct feedback and contact with Maureen than I expected. Client relationship was much stronger than I expected - very friendly and helpful, and seemed to be very motivated by our final presentation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "this class was great - much of it depends on the client you have and the team you work with through the semester.",
    "Great speakers. Improve by bringing in a speaker in accordance to each group project across the semester.",
    "Strengths are the quality of project. Weaknesses are lack of helpful guidance from Maureen.",
    "Strengths: Opportunity to lead peers and navigate flat group structure. Opportunity to write scope of work and navigate client management. Weaknesses: Maureen's \"business 101\" lectures were useless, and even gave us bad advice that don't match how the corporations we've worked with do their work (internships\/pre-FES). Guest lectures weren't useful. Maureen's process requirements didn't match the deliverables for our client, and so we had to redo work to meet her criteria. Strength of project REALLY depends on strength and reliability of the group members.",
    "The work done outside the classroom and Maureen's inputs are the best part of the class. The lectures aren't as engaging as I expected them to be. The guest lecturers bring their slides and give their pre-made presentations. Perhaps they should learn about what students are tackling generally, so they can cater their presentations to those themes.",
    "Strengths: good team work and project management experience weaknesses: some speakers were not engaging, understanding client expectations\/asks wasn't easy",
    "It is what is states it will be.",
    "The in class material is the same as any of the other B&E classes so is repetitive. There could've been more in class time on advising other groups, working through issues together as a class or sharing how work was going, soft skill development",
    "This is a good course to practice consulting skills and teamwork spirits. The only thing isbecause of the uncertainties of flexible plans and schedules from the companies who are the project ownersthe communications with them are not always smooth enough to meet the original expectations.",
    "Strengths - getting the chance to work with an external client Weaknesses - I did not find most of the classes helpful to my work with my client. Some of the classes were interesting to me personally, so I was happy to go, but some of the classes had nothing to do with my client work and did not interest me personally.",
    "I had a very positive experience, but it seems that this can really vary group by group. Having midterm deliverables and bi-weekly client calls really helped move the project along. I did not like the professor's emphasis on using a one-dimensional \"readability\" program to evaluate our writing. Some words and concepts are widely known in the industry or could not have been avoided in our writing (for instance, our client's name, which has four syllables), but this lowered the overall readability score. I felt like modifying our deliverables to conform to this metric required much more effort and produced overly simplistic, unengaging writing.",
    "Maureen is really helpful and generally gives good advice. The guest speakers were interesting and helped provide insights into their jobs which was helpful for me as someone considering going the business route. I wish my project had been geared a little bit more towards the nuts and bolts of corporate strategy, marketing, or finance, to get an idea of how the environmental initiatives we were researching fit into the business process.",
    "Strength- client relationships Room for improvement - Slides seem old. Would benefit from more hands-on guidance from Professor.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is that you are essentially given free reign to work on a consulting project with an interesting client. The biggest weakness of the course is that you are trapped into working within the confines of the way the course is structured, which seems very outdated.",
    "Several of the guest lectures had overlapping material, and on the whole they did not feel necessary to the successful completion of the client project. I would recommend one fewer presentation from a consultant about their work, and a little more one-on-one meeting time with Maureen to talk about how to align with the client on project scope. Course requires complete student self-direction."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course - make sure you have a good team.",
    "Adaptation of certain group projects. For example, if a group has to provide a slide deck with notes only to a client as their \"report.\" It's double work creating a report that the client didn't ask for.",
    "Take this course for the opportunity to work on a client project but do not expect to learn helpful skills in the class setting.",
    "What you get out of the class really depends on the client and your groupmates. It could be a great experience with mature, competent, trustworthy peers who prioritize the work similarly to you. We highly recommend regular team check-ins (which the MBA students and alumni of \"Fundamentals of Working with People\" would be good at leading). Those conversations about norms, expectations, etc. will help avoid last-minute disasters. You won't get a lot out of the guest lectures.",
    "Use Maureen as a resource, especially if you are looking to go into consulting.",
    "Good course, especially if you have very little work experience.",
    "you will learn very useful client-facing skills that you can probably apply in any job after graduating!",
    "Pick a client and topic you are genuinely excited to work with as that works out well",
    "good opportunity to learn by doing",
    "Take this for the client experience. Keep an eye out for the potential clients, and try and get matched with someone you may or may not want to work for in the future.",
    "Make sure you are really motivated by the client and the project they propose before committing to the course.",
    "The class is very dependent on the project. Make sure you get a good understanding of what you actually may be doing before taking it.",
    "Develop team norms, switch leadership roles every week, spend first weeks ironing out project expectations (it is important to be very clear)",
    "Only take this course if you get assigned a great project with a strong team of people. If you have consulting experience, this class will not serve you.",
    "Good practice if you've never had consulting experience, Maureen provides some very basic frameworks for the job. If you've done some consulting work before and you want to improve, be prepared to mostly grow from your own initiative."
