    "How to conduct qualitative research!",
    "I learned a lot about what it means to do an IRB study, especially with respect to interview methodology, qualitative coding, field notes, etc. I also gained insight into how to write an effective academic article and give a compelling presentation about it.",
    "How to do formal, qualitative social science research, and the care each step in the process requires; how to manage my time to slowly chip away at a long-term project; and above all, how to critically engage with a line of inquiry and then convey my thoughts and findings to a general audience."

   "comments": [
    "Successfully structured enough to make the capstone project rigorous yet manageable.",
    "The strength is certainly being surrounded by a community of your fellow Ed Studies Scholars - they helped push my research in really helpful ways. The deadlines could be improved though: the 20-25 page draft deadline felt very early, and I wish there could have been a smaller, middle deadline. I also wish there was more support around giving our final presentations: giving a mock presentation almost a month before the actual one didn't feel very productive. Something a little closer to the actual colloquium would probably be more valuable.",
    "Strengths: Meeting every other week was a useful form of accountability and helped build camaraderie among the EDST seniors, who were supporting each other all year throughout the capstone process. All the EDST advisors were phenomenal, too. Weaknesses: I liked the goal-setting and writing sprint we did in class near the end of the semester and wish we could have done more together earlier on."

   "comments": [
    "If you're an ed studies scholar, you have to, but it's completely worth it, so yes!",
    "If you are the kind of person who really benefits from deadlines, definitely take this over the independent study. I gained so much from the structure of the course and being able to bounce ideas of my peers. I can't imagine having finished my capstone without this seminar!",
    "Yes! All EDST seniors should devise a capstone project that they 1) think is urgent to do for themselves and\/or for someone else and 2) is endlessly interesting to them, and then commit the time and energy to doing it justice. It'll be a worthwhile experience that will teach you a lot about your topic, yourself, especially how you like to engage with the world and questions that interest you."
