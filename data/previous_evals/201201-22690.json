    "If you want to keep up\/improve your spanish speaking abilities, take this!",
    "it's a good class to improve speech, although it is a little more work than you'd expect. id recommend it to a student who was qualified enough but wanted to become a more fluid speaker.",
    "I took this class Credit-D and I'm not sure I would really recommend it if you don't. The readings are interesting, but somehow the vocab quizzes are always hard and the homeworks becomes very time consuming by the end of the year. The oral exams, presentations, and debates are fun tough, and not too much work.",
    "It's a great way to improve your speaking abilities, although the content of the course is not particularly fascinating.",
    "The course is mainly reading based with weekly reading assignments and occasional homework assignments and quizzes which correspond with the reading. The conversation generated based on the reading.",
    "It will help you to maintain your speaking ability, but not to improve it much. Fun class if you readings are on topics you're interested in. A bit boring if you don't enjoy those topics.",
    "I would highly recommend Advanced Conversational Spanish for any student who wants to improve their verbal fluency in the language. I was a little surprised how much work the course had, but you can get away with not doing it sometimes, and overall the assignments are interesting. Professor Carballal was an excellent leader for the class.",
    "Overall, this was a good class, and my confidence in speaking Spanish has definitely grown. The readings and discussions were diverse and interesting, so it didn't really feel as though we were doing the same thing over and over again. Also, reading the book (in our case Chronicle of a Death Foretold) was a great experience, as I had never read an entire novel in a language other than English. The one big weakness of this class was the work distribution. Some weeks would have very light reading, while others would have multiple written assignments, discussion preparation, and quizzes all packed at the same time. This needs to be addressed for the future."
