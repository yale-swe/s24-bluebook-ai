   "comments": [
    "This class is an introduction to Portuguese grammar with lots of cultural activities woven into the curriculum. It moves quickly, but in a manageable way. It covers most verb tenses and is heavy on speaking.",
    "This is a great course for students who have a strong background in romance languages and wish to quickly learn Portuguese. This course has a strong emphasis on grammar as well as conversational Portuguese. While the workload is low, the speed of the course can sometimes be a burden. This course is especially good for those that can pick up languages quickly. If you are a slow learner of languages, however, this course is not for you.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are willing to put in the work, you get a lot out of the class. My class was only 6 people and we bonded well over the course of the semester as we faced trials and tribulations from the coursework. Expect tons of inside jokes, laughter, learning, and a good time during this course."
