    "ART 138 asks a lot and gives -- a good amount. The hands-on nature of this class means that you will have to work hard, but the work will be active. For most people, that means it's more enjoyable. That was true for me, as I found the actual process of making photographs rewarding and fascinating. I see the world differently now. That said, the work:development reward tilts less generously for this class. Expect to spend a lot of time walking around with a camera or sitting in the DMCA.",
    "This class taught me to use a DSLR digital camera in Manual Mode to shoot in raw, to edit photos in CameraRaw and Photoshop, and to print photos on matte and gloss paper. Beyond that this course changed the way I see the world. It taught me to think and talk about visual art in a way that I didn't have the means to before.",
    "Technical foundations; photographic seeing; a language for thinking about photography.",
    "amaozng",
    "Photography basics. Digital processing. Photography as art.",
    "Photoshop and how to use a DSLR camera. Basic techniques in photo editing and printing. Did not learn as much about how to actually compose a 'good' photograph as I had hoped."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: active learning, group critiques, demanding workload Weaknesses: Ka-Man can be redundant and unclear in class, and the learning felt less-than-intentional sometimes.",
    "Strengths - So many, but the main is that the professor (Ka-Man) is really invested in each student and offers feedback that is clear and relatable. This class offers students a way to express and challenge themselves that no other class has for me. Weakness - all I can really think of is the financial barrier associated with the class. From start-up costs, to printing it ended up being much more expensive than I expected.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you're a self-starter.",
    "Yes, Digital Photography, especially with Ka-Man, helps you see the world in a completely different way. I'm more aware of everything around me and notice relationships within the world that I otherwise wouldn't.",
    "Take this class if you have time to invest in it. If you don't give it everything, you'll probably wish you weren't in it. Know that taking this will make your life much harder because afterward you will realize that it is impossible to photograph everything.",
    "yes",
    "If you are dedicated to improving your photography, this is an amazing course. The workload is not all that much higher than other courses, but it does require consecutive hours of work. I loved this course.",
    "Yes, great intro course.",
    "Yes, definitely. Ka-Man managed to create an environment where we could talk about each other's work without fear of feeling self-conscious or judged (which is no small feat). We talked about photographs and learned stuff along the way. By the end of the semester, I found that the distribution of time recommended (4 hours shooting, 4 hours editing) would be better served by more time shooting and less time editing; there's only so much you can do to a medium photograph. This class was different from any other I've taken at Yale. No idea what my grade is, though. Every student in the class was amazing, both as a person and a photographer, so one of the best parts was getting to spend time with them in class and in the lab."
