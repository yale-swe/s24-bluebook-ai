   "comments": [
    "This is a great class - take it if you're at all interested in gender! It gives a great foundation for future WGSS or other social science classes. The reading topics were sometimes all over the place, but it was just to incorporate so many concepts into this one pretty broad class. Readings, take home midterm, paper, final, and a few blog posts during the semester - really not too bad!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It is a great way for a non WGSS major to fulfill the social science credit. Overall a very intriguing class, and the workload is relatively light.",
    "i would recommend this class if you're interested in the ways in which gender plays a role in everday life around the world. the readings weren't bad but you do have to do them.",
    "If you need an easy soc credit, maybe. It's kind of boring, and if you know anything about WGSS or if you're a progressive person, you probably won't get too much out of this class. I took this class because I had read one of Inderpal's papers on transnational feminism and it was brilliant and fascinating, and I thought that the class would be eually brilliant and fascinating. It wasn't. It was waaaaay dumbed down. It's chill and easy, though, and a cool topic.",
    "If you're at all interested in global issues, from agriculture to tourism to the internet, this is a fantastic choice. It was a \"lecture,\" but the narrow topic meant a very small class full of very passionate students, which made for great class discussions. DO THE READING; there's not a lot, but it's all important, and pretty interesting!",
    "don't do it. remedial. if you can answer the question \"what is the state?\", you're over-qualified for this course",
    "This class is okay. I took it for fun (started credit\/d and then switched to a grade), and I learned some things. I will say it didn't radically change the way I thought about the world, but it was certainly tolerable. Sometimes you have to take things Grewal\/the other students say with a grain of salt\u0097people get excited about their disdain for America, which can be annoying. But it's not awful. It's an okay class. And the workload is manageable. If you need a humanities credit, this could be your place. If you're really excited about gender issues and expressing disdain for America\/rich people, this is totally your place.",
    "Decent course. The course is more about the man\/woman gender divide than it is about unconventional gender identities. Professor Grewal consistently ran 10 minutes over the class end time, which was annoying. This class required minimal work and made a great fifth credit.",
    "This class has a lot to say that a lot of people in college should know about, especially if they want to create change in the world. It's an excellent place to start building a foundation of crucial facts and perspectives to have. The workload is interesting and more than manageable and your work will be received with enthusiasm if you put actual thought into it. The readings can creep up on you if you start to fall behind so that's the only place you should focus on keeping your head above water in.",
    "A relevant, comprehensive and great introduction to the WGSS major and WGSS concepts. It's an interesting, eye-opening and compelling course that often encourages you to find evidence of WGSS concepts in your own life. Great teacher, great discussions, and you will learn a lot."
