   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Honestly, this class taught concepts I learned in middle school on a middle school level. All of the assignments required looking up terms and reporting back on finds in a \"book report\" style. No assignment in the class required analysis, synthesis, or an understanding of the concepts beyond their basic definition. Considering this is a graduate level course, I expected more. On this note: the test question assignment really infuriated me. As someone with former teaching experience, I would like to say that it is impossible to write a multiple choice question that requires \"synthesizing\" and\/or \"analyzing\" data. Multiple choice questions by definition require regurgitating facts (knowledge and comprehension) not synthesis, analysis, and evaluation (where the focus of graduate level work should be). The course material could easily lend to the use of case studies that allow us to develop solutions and explore complex environmental issues. It could have involved us bringing concepts from Epi, Policy, Biostats, and using those skills to propose solutions. What we did in class that was considered a \"case\" was to sit there and listen to a lecture about a study that was done. This required no thought. Also, the second half of the class involved a lot of guest lectures - too many guest lectures. There were also way to many assignments in this class and no assignment was worth more than 25% of the final grade. Would have rather have had 2 big assignments than 6 small ones. The syllabus also changed regularly and it was difficult to know when assignments were due. Finally, there were a few attempts throughout the semester to \"boost attendance.\" Honestly, if you want students to attend your class, you need to make it worth their time, especially if class starts at 8:30am. Make attendance or participation mandatory\/part of your grade. Pass around a sign in sheet, etc. The lecture format, where slides contain all the information you need to do well, gives us no incentive to attend class.",
    "Strengths: It is a general overview of environmental health, and touches on a lot of important and relevant topics. It was a great class, I really enjoyed it. Weaknesses: It was too early in the morning",
    "Weakness: unlike other courses that are part of the core graduation requirements, I'm not sure that this course adds to my broader understanding of public health issues; a lot of the information seemed like common sense; the deliverables were not a good use of time and did not teach core concepts, it felt like busy work; did not understand the logic of the policy on submitting homework (hard copies in person), given the electronic resources that are available through Yale (e.g. classesv2)",
    "This is a good course. Most of the lectures were well taught and focused on interesting topics. I really enjoyed the guest lectures. The only weakness was the course assignments. They felt like busy work, and I don't think I really learned anything from completing them.",
    "Classroom material could have been more engaging. Less reading off slides. More group projects.",
    "A case study approach to the class could be more interesting.",
    "Strengths: Range of Topics! Great coverage of the broad concerns and achievements in environmental health Weakness: Wish it was a smaller class, not in winslow. The professor tried to engage everyone in conversations - but it ended up being the same people every time. If the size was smaller, we may have heard different voices provide some unique perspectives or ask good questions. I wish the clicker system wasn't abandoned so quickly because I would have loved to see the questions that would be asked and the answers given. It's a cool way to get engaged in the topics.",
    "Strength: Interesting Subject Weakness: Could use more cohesion",
    "It gave a helpful overview of various aspects of environmental health. The guest lecturers were on the whole quite interesting; some of them were overly technical.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Deziel's slides were applicable and enjoyable Weaknesses: The topics were so broad it was hard to have a take away message. The Learning Objectives helped but didn't solve the problem of how vast the material was.",
    "Poorly organized, surface level material for the most part, not an engaging lecturer, inability to answer good student questions in class, lack of participation or attendance requirement so lecture hall is 3\/4 empty. This course could be decent, but a much bigger effort needs to go into making this a good course. For me, it was my least favorite course at YSPH and I am disappointed that I had to take it.",
    "The class seamed very basic. We did not dive deep into any of the topics. Attendance was very poor, I was often one of 20 people in the lecture hall. The instructor is petty biased about her opinion's. I think presenting both sides of an argument is essential as a professor at a university. Students should be encouraged to draw their own conclusions about the facts being presented. IE missing from the conversation about every topic presented was the economic aspect of the discussion. For example I agree that hydraulic fracturing poses the potential for significant environmental damage- however, it has led to the price of natural gas in the US being 700% cheaper than the global index price. This has many down stream effect ETC. I feel the instructor presents all topics in a black and white fashion, she needs to do a better job of acknowledging the grey.",
    "Interesting but not my focus and so not my favorite.",
    "Strengths: broad overview of many different topics in environmental health, some of which were really interesting. Interesting guest speakers Weaknesses: most of the assignments seemed like tedious unnecessary work that didn't really challenge us on the concepts; also, some of the lectures covered way too much information.",
    "A strength of the course is that the material was inherently interesting. Unfortunately, it was taught in a boring and disorganized manner. It could be improved with better organization, which would involve less guest lecturers and a greater emphasis on important topics.",
    "I liked the guest speakers. I liked Dr. Diezel.",
    "Really great introductory course well designed for non-majors and individuals who might not have a strong background in environmental health.",
    "This course seems to be flawed in a number of ways and should definitely be re-examined. As a whole, the content did not seem to spark enthusiasm in students (in many cases it may have done the opposite, even), the teaching methods were not conducive to application, and the course instructor did not \"own\" the material. As a whole, the opportunity cost of being required to take this course makes it difficult not to be frustrated. During the brief and finite amount of time an MPH student has in the Yale program, to require this course as opposed to one of the other applicable, more thought-provoking courses is a true travesty. Although it is well-accepted that environmental health is a critical component to the true public health perspective of a nation or community, this particular course failed to deliver that.",
    "It's a good introduction course in environmental health. However, lecture slides uploaded online are incomplete which made it harder to study after class. Instead of using incomplete lecture slides as a way to attract students to attend lecture, the class could be designed to be more interesting. Also, homeworks could be designed better and actually requires some thinking and learning (other than gathering information online without really understand those knowledge). This class is required to every MPH student but people in policy and management track find it nearly irrelevant to their field of study. Future class could make it more attractive to students other than environmental health by allowing students to do projects related to their study.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content Weaknesses: Time, ability to answer complicated questions, lack of incentive to attend",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot about environmental health and its importance in today's culture weaknesses: would have appreciated more practical knowledge rather theoretical",
    "I thought this was a good overview of different environmental health topics, and a fair assessment of our knowledge of the topics.",
    "Strength - diversity of topics Weakness - WAY too many guest lecturers. Dr. D did really cool stuff and knows A TON! Teach us more! We trust you. A lot of the guest lecturers were also so heavily scientific they were irrelevant for the class and audience.",
    "this course was not my favorite... I think it was Dr. D's first time teaching the course, and you can tell that she tried really hard to make it interesting, I'm just not sure that it was valuable for my learning. So much of the material seemed a little bit unnecessary...but I'm glad we covered some more important topics at the tail end of the semester (fracking, global warming, etc). The grading seemed a lit bit arbitrary as well...and Dr. D should really just get rid of the test questions assignment. That homework was graded unnecessarily hard and it really didn't add to my learning. I'd rather write another paper on a new set of topics than that test questions assignment... And please rethink some of the guest lectures for next year. Many of them were good (environmental justice, obesity, epigenetics, work place hazards) but others kind of missed the mark (sevesco, NHL) and went a little outside the scope of this course (NHL).",
    "This course was very frustrating. With the exception of maybe two lectures, the material was irrelevant to what I want to do with my career. I recognize the importance of learning about all aspects of public health to become more well-rounded, but I do not feel like this course contributed to that at all. Additionally, it was frustrating to come to class almost every day and be one of only a few people there. Dr. Deziel tried to make attendance a priority at the beginning of the semester by having us get clickers, but after one failed attempt to use them she became frazzled and did not use them again.",
    "I thought the course was a bit boring and often times hard to pay attention",
    "Have some kind of skill that comes out of it to strengthen concepts. Maybe have a critique of an an environmental hazard identification or writing the basis for one.",
    "Strengths: Professor Deziel's slides were very comprehensive. Weaknesses: I think much of the material covered in this class was too simple to be really engaging. Often, I felt like I was taking an undergraduate class, or sometimes even a high school level class. While I was one of the few who went to every lecture, the majority of the class stopped attending lectures. I think there needs to be some in-class component so that students attend. Also, while some of the guest speakers were engaging, some went very in depth into detailed biological topics that were not very engaging\/did not seem relevant. In terms of the guest lectures, it also would have been helpful if we had the learning objectives ahead of time. Often learning objectives for guest lectures were posted weeks after they spoke, making it difficult to remember the necessary information even with detailed notes.",
    "I think this course is really great as an intro course for those who have not been exposed to env health. Some students believed the course was not challenging enough, but since I have never taken environmental health, I felt that I learned a lot of interesting, useful concepts. This class exposed me to all these ways the environment affects us, even ways I had not considered previously.",
    "I don't think there was any incentive to go to lecture. The material seemed pretty elementary.",
    "I think since this class was meant to be an overview there should not be so many guest lecturers who often present very specific in-depth material when we could be spending that class time covering a broader topic. I also hated the blank slides as I do not think that they did what they were meant to (made sure people came to class) but just made me feel as though answers were hidden.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course was the disparity between what was taught, what was required, and how that work was assessed. A lot of information was covered in lectures, only a fraction of which students needed to know to complete any test or assignment. However, while the assignments were elementary in nature, the grading\/assessment was rigorous and a little random.",
    "-Really interesting material -As a non-EHS student I feel prepared to talk about issues in environmental health confidently -I attended every class (literally did not miss any) and still felt penalized by the professor's practice of including blank slides in the uploaded PDF's. I was following along, yet when I had to study for a test I never had enough info on the missing pages. I feel like there are better ways to account for student absences.",
    "Overall, this course gives a great overview of many areas of environmental health and is able to incorporate guest speakers that can provide expert insight into some of these areas. The difficulty level of assignments and exams I think was lower than most courses I've taken, but this is likely because most students do not have background in environmental health, so the goal of this course was to give them a basic understand of the elementary concepts. A strength is that learning objectives are presented for the lectures that guides students to know which topics the professor feels are most important for us to know. A weakness is that especially during the second half of the course, lectures and learning objectives were often not posted ahead of time. To sit through an entire lecture without slides or any indication of what information is especially relevant it is basically impossible to take notes effectively. I think this was done sometimes because the professor thought this would get students to attend class --which I think is very misguided. Why hinder the learning of students that do go to class? If participation is an issue then incorporate that into the grade in some way via clicker questions or something rather than make it more difficult for all students to learn and be engaged in class.",
    "great to bring in specialists in the field, but often presentations were unconnected to learning objectives. would have loved more discussion built into the class (or input on topics presented, after the basics), similar to how engaged the class got in the final few weeks (because we were genuinely interested!)",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Despite what others may say in their evaluations, I truly felt this was beneficial to my knowledge of environmental health issues. We covered a wide variety of topics and I was never bored by the subjects. I really appreciated that the professor invited guest speakers to talk about topics they specialize in. That really enriched the learning experience. Being an 8:30 am class, it was unfortunate that attendance was often low, but I enjoyed coming to class.",
    "The class provided a decent overview of many different environmental health issues going on today, but at times the content felt very very basic and obvious. Class would have been a bit more interesting if it focused a little more on what the main issues are surrounding these issues, and what can\/is being done (or what options are being considered). Being asked to physically hand in homework did not make a lot of sense (vs submitting to v2), especially given the \"environment\" aspect of the class.",
    "Grading is so messed up. Friends did poorly on assignments without explanation. Frustrating. I guess subjective grading is just an inevitable aspect of this class",
    "-- If it were not at 8:30am, people would have attended class. I promise. Please make this class NOT at 8:30am. -- Way too many guest lectures; it is hard to learn the material well if you have a guest lecture and then are tested on the material but the Professor isn't the one who taught it in the first place. -- The exams were really easy. I felt like the answers to the questions were pretty obvious, so I regretted even studying. -- 'Final paper' assignment took me about 1 hour... I just read the abstract of my article and summarized that... -- Pesticides question assignment felt juvenile, in terms of just exploring the difference between conventional and organic foods. Overall, the assignments should be at a MASTER'S DEGREE LEVEL. I am paying tuition to get a master's degree! So this class needs to actually teach me something beyond the facts. It would have been SO MUCH BETTER if there were more emphasis on the nuances of different study design in environmental health, conducting research in the various areas, etc... -- Another thing that felt juvenile was the obesity lecture. We are in a public health program. There is no need to spend half the lecture going through what a 'big problem' obesity is in the united states... we've all seen those CDC graphs. Perhaps 1 slide at most on that. Overall, the class has SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but isn't quite there yet. My recommendations are (a) have it not at 8:30am, whatever you do, (b) have most of the lectures be taught by the Professor, (c) have much more nuanced assignments and final paper; (d) be in touch with the level of the students. We're all here for our master's degrees, and we can handle a bit more difficult material. Convey more nuance about all topics in the lectures, perhaps focusing on the challenges of doing various types of research, etc.",
    "Strength: Provides the basic, overall information that is necessary for all public health students to have, whether or not they like environmental topics. Topics had a great range from occupational health to fracturing to pollutants. Weakness: There should be better organization of the topics such that they correlate a bit more. For example Environmental Health Genomics should go with Environmental Carcinogenesis.",
    "class is fine as an introductory class.",
    "I don't see any significance having this course as required.",
    "Gave me a basic understanding of many topics I did not know about. I felt like we could have gone much deeper and that the class could have been more engaging. A discussion section may have helped.",
    "It was a good survey course- covered many, many subjects in a short period of time. I thought the lectures were comprehensive. Some guest lecturers were better than others. The environmental carcinogens lecturer was impossible to understand by the average person. The grading was incredibly arbitrary. On some assignments I received 99\/100, while some I received much lower with minimal feedback. Please standardize the grading in this course. It would benefit everyone if there were rubrics to follow for each assignment.",
    "The course was fine. Probably interesting for those in the environmental sciences concentration, but a little bit boring for others. The material was straightforward, though, and easy, so overall the experience was fine.",
    "Because this was an introductory course I know it was difficult to really delve deeper into some of the topics covered. With that said, I enjoyed the second half the semester's material better than the first half and feel that perhaps we could have gone through the basics in the first half a little faster in order to spend more time on the more specific topics we covered later in the semester.",
    "Good for what it is, a survey course of environmental health topics. I found some topics quite interesting and others I've already been exposed to as an undergrad and graduate student. A highlight was the guest lecturers.",
    "Being a required class, this is hard to say. A lot of the topics covered are relevant to other fields so it should be applicable to everyone. The worst part of the class was the parade of guest lecturers after spring break. Many of these talks were well above the intro level that is expected and not helpful in learning the general aspects of the topics. It creates a disjointed atmosphere and can really turn people off. Dr.D could have them brief her or spend some time talking about one part of their research after the general concept is introduced.",
    "Strength - Good lecture topics and interesting lectures. Appreciate the inclusion of interesting guest lectures as well Weakness - Assignments were creative and worthwhile, but had limited connection to course material.",
    "Too early in the morning. However, I liked some of the assignments because it gives freedom to students to be creative.",
    "Everyone rags on this class but I thought it was great. You've got to give the instructor a break and remember that she is trying to spark your interest in a topic that she is more or less obliged to teach to a room full of students who don't necessarily have a passion for the subject matter because it's just a required course. The fact is the course I, however, really like it and I'm not an EHS person, though I now am beginning to entertain the idea of becoming more",
    "The course should be better framed toward the interests of students going into a diversity of fields.",
    "From what I heard about last year's EHS course, this course is an incredible improvement. Professor Deziel is a very nice professor, but she does get frustrated by having to explain things repeatedly, which is understandable. The range of subjects we covered in the course was great. The guest speakers were not always engaging, and their presentations were a little hard to follow. The clickers we had to get never worked, so I was carrying that thing around the entire semester for no reason.",
    "The course was the most useless course I had taken at YSPH. The material was designed in a very unchallenging way, the exams and homework only tested one component: class attendance. This is best exhibited by the final which asked questions starting with the phrase, \"as we discussed in class\" on multiple questions. The course was designed at a level maybe fit for a second year in an undergraduate course of study (200 level or below), but was not at all fit for a rigorous course of graduate study. As the only course in environmental health I took at YSPH, I expected better.",
    "the class did a good job of covering a lot of environmental health topics in an organized way. the biggest issue was it being an 8:30am required course that second years took in their last semester. it should be required the first year.",
    "I love learning about the environment so I thought it was great and very informative.",
    "Strengths: well organized Weaknesses: covers too many topics. Lack of connection for the guest lectures for the second half of the semester",
    "Some topics were interesting, but I thought that sometimes the guest speakers were a little bit too technical and hard to understand. I felt that the assignments could be improved, and maybe more challenging?",
    "I appreciate that environmental health is integral to the public health curriculum. Dr Deziel did a good job in teaching the material; I learned more than I thought I would from the class. The class strengths were that it was broad and covered most of the introductory concepts of environmental health. However, I do think that some of the molecular epigenetics lessons scared some non-science majors (I am not one but I know people who are). Perhaps next time start small and then build on it. There is a lot of material to cover for the class especially when studying for the midterm and final exam. Some questions were especially specific.",
    "Lectures are clear and easy to follow. I appreciated that there were learning objectives for each of the guest lectures or it may have been overwhelming trying to figure out what was or wasn't important to understand. Assignments and tests were straightforward and fair. I think this class would be much more fulfilling if it involved a discussion piece. Maybe breaking up into small groups for discussion. I would have also liked some more in-depth examples and studies, sometimes the lectures felt too much like a summary of the topic.",
    "The course did a great job of laying out the field of environmental health.",
    "Too broad, a little bit too much technical information provided for students lacking a science background. There were too many topics that were briefly touched upon and while she was trying to go into depth in those this is basically impossible.",
    "The material was generally interesting and important. I think we learned a lot about the interconnectedness of a lot of environmental health issues. I think having guest lecturers was also generally beneficial, but some of them were too wonky.",
    "Good class to learn about environmental health"

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel would benefit from a mentor relationship with an older faculty member. She seemed unprepared to teach at a graduate level, and unsure of how to present material to student's pursuing their master's degree. I can tell that Dr. Deziel is passionate about her research, but I would like if some of that were translated to the classroom. She alternated between reading word-for-word off her slides and attempting to lead awkward class level discussions in a huge auditorium setting. At one point attendance got so low that there were fewer than 20 people attending class. That is not the case for other required core classes like Epidemiology 2 or Biostatistics 2, which are also early in the morning twice a week. This was a clear reflection of Dr. Deziel's failure to present material that could not be gained equally as (if not more) effectively from simply reading her slides.",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is clearly very bright. However, she is obviously a very new teacher. She needs to do a better job in general of owning the material and not just reading off the slides. \"Death by PowerPoint\" is an often used quip about the class. Her skills in presentation and teaching will likely come with further experience teaching a graduate level course. I did find her to be generally very nice and approachable during my limited interactions with her.",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is definitely knowledgeable and passionate about this subject. Since she is new, I think she was overly optimistic about how often people would come to class though (especially early in the morning). I never had a chance to speak with her in person but she seems like a really nice lady.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is one of the poorer Yale professors I have experienced. She is a kind lady, but this was her first time teaching the course (I think) and it showed. Sometimes it felt as though she was learning along with us, and there were several instances where she could not adequately respond to questions that students raised about the material. I do not know if the lecture slides were purposely uninformative to try to con students into coming to class or if she really was that disorganized, but it was another con of the class. Overall - nice lady, but almost aloof and ditzy.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very nice, however the class did not seem to require much work that really helped me learn. The assignments were very simple and did not enhance my understanding of the material. The pollutions assignment in particular was extremely easy, I felt as though I was just copying material from the CDC website.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole did a great job engaging students in her lectures, especially considering the large lecture hall set up and early morning time. Her lectures were all very interesting and I appreciated how she was able to make many of the topics relevant\/applicable to everyday life by tying in current and historical events",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is obviously incredibly intelligent, her research is impressive, and I have had nothing but great interactions with her. In fact, I found her interview for the YSPH webpage to be most-interesting. However, the way that this course was taught was truly not effective, and I believe it stemmed from her lack of \"ownership\" of the material (as opposed to the examples set forth by our guest lecturers). This led to a number of difficulties including excessive PowerPoint usage, reading from slides, and students feeling that they could just as effectively \"teach themselves\" as attend class. When students did attend class and discussion on topics ensued, Professor Deziel typically didn't do a great job of stimulating dialogue and appreciation for the complexities and nuances of arguments. I felt this way personally when I shared a contradicting thought to what was being presented and was quickly moved on from without even acknowledgment of the validity (or limitations for that matter) of my believe. This was also seen in the homework assignments. It became obvious to students that taking opposing viewpoints in homework assignments resulted in far-more critical grading and critiques than simply \"following suit\". Although this may be an issue with the TF's grading structure, it was a theme which seemed to hold true across the entire cohort of students taking the course and may have been due to a misconceived grading rubric. I feel all of this is problematic because it robs students of the incentive to push boundaries and try to explore different avenues to these extremely complex issues. Additionally, a proper debate and demonstration of prevailing arguments was never seen in-action, and students seemed to feel \"force-fed\" one person's thoughts. Again, it should be highlighted that Professor Deziel is extremely accomplished in her own right and a fantastic asset to the faculty team of YSPH. Beyond this, many of the things from above will likely be developed over time and future iterations of this course will surely be vast improvements. However, in an attempt to provide constructive insights, I felt it critical to give this student's perspectives.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: passionate about the subjects Weaknesses: I found her a little pretentious",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Overall, I think Dr. Deziel did a good job for teaching the course for the first time. There are definitely some kinks that need to be ironed out (easy\/difficulty of exams), but I did learn a lot from the course.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D was really nice, and clearly worked hard on the lecturers that she gave, however, grading was super arbitrary for papers.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D tried really hard to make this class interesting, and really took students' feedback to heart. I appreciated that about her. You could see how discouraging it was that attendance was so low for her course. It might be best if she added an attendance policy or did random polling on days\/clicker questions to gauge attendance. I think the course could use improvement, but it wasn't that bad. Thank you for not making the midterm or final too challenging...in that they didn't cover the nit-picky details of the lecture. I like that they summarized broad concepts and provided a variety of ways to answer the questions (short answer, fill in the blank, matching). Taking her tests was almost fun...!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Apparently this was Dr. Deziel's first semester teaching (I don't know if that is true), so I understand that there were probably plenty of road blocks that had to be overcome and many things that she had to figure out on her feet. Still, her attitude left something to be desired. Many times it felt like she was totally unreceptive to class feedback, which was very frustrating because we've been in more courses at YSPH than she has taught and we probably had some great advice. Also, when it came time for exams the way she treated us was very belittling. Although I know YSPH has been facing academic integrity issues, FAR more often than not, students are NOT cheating. Strolling up and down the sides of Winslow, glaring at us while we take exams (and having TAs do the same) made me feel like I was back in freshman general chemistry. We are definitely too old for that.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0It was clear the professor was knowledgable and cared about the subject. Lectures were some what boring",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I feel the teacher just needs to get comfortable in her role. Meeting in office hours I learned a lot, but a lot of times in class she just did not feel confident and spent too much time correcting things. Finding a way to emphasize areas she knows best about will be crucial.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Friendly, engaging, understanding, she makes an effort to reach out to students. This was her first course taught at YSPH, so she really did a good job considering that, as well. The only improvement I can suggest is becoming more comfortable at answering students questions in class. She did a great job this semester, but this can always be improved, especially regarding questions she did not guest lecture on.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think she was very knowledgeable but the lectures weren't very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She sounds nice, but is not very responsive to students. She is also not a very engaging lecturer. Finally, it was frustrating that an environmental health professor did not understand topics like environmental justice before the guest lecture.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Good professor, would prefer if she relied less on the powerpoints, because she has expert knowledge on many of the topics but sometimes I didn't feel like I learned more than I could by visiting the EPA website.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0\"Dr. D\" is the only professor I've had at Yale that insists on being called \"Dr.\" and always refers to herself as such, and this felt very odd. Her strengths are that her slides are well organized and well presented. I think she gears the class at an appropriate difficulty level. A weakness is that she is insensitive to students' schedules as evidenced by the fact that we were not even given a date for the final until about a month into the course and that we had 8 versions of the syllabus. Many students plan their schedule around their syllabi and when it is changed it can be a big issues and whether or not these changes were out of her hands, she seemed a bit too unapologetic about it.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0she is sweet, but disliked that we never actually used our clickers and having blank sides inputted into her uploaded slides.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel was a good professor. She was very knowledgeable on specific environmental health issues, and really opened up lecture into a discussion about the topics. Which I appreciated. I've nothing bad to say about her teaching style, or assignment formats. I thoroughly enjoyed her and the course.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Good professor, though the posted slides were not very helpful (blank slides, missing information).",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel was good and made herself available to students. My main comments have to do with the structure of the class and the level of the material, so please see the previous section. One thing that could be improved would be for Prof. Deziel to have lectures be NOT just what is on the slides. It was hard to be motivated to get up for a 8:30am class since she was just going through the slides. The clickers would have been good.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strength: Very understanding and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths overall: The class itself is interesting. Professor Diezel truly wanted to teach students and for students to get something out of the course. Weaknesses overall: Despite the fact that Professor Diezel tried very hard, there are many weaknesses to the overall course. 1. It is kind of counterintuitive for an Environmental Health Sciences course to REQUIRE us to PRINT all of our work and submit instead of online submission 2. There were too many guest lectures in a row. I understand that Professor Diezel wanted to bring in outside opinions and dive deeper into subjects, but you cannot expect students to stay engaged if there are so many TECHNICAL guest lectures. Additionally, many of the subjects the guest lecturers presented on were subjects Professor Diezel did not cover prior to the guest lecturers, and she subsequently presented on the topics and gave us a background information regarding the subject AFTER the guest lecture. Very counterintuitive. 3. I think it's completely unacceptable to give students an assignment to think up test questions. It makes the professor seem lazy and is not a challenging enough homework assignment for a graduate level course 4. If the professor would like participation and attendance to be mandatory, she should implement some kind of method for students to stay engaged (e.g. give out pop quizzes like SBS does, etc). 5. The homework assignments were fine, but they were also very leading. You cannot give a prompt for students to argue one way or another when the paper and the prompt the students are expected to write about is very leading an expected to be written a certain way. 6. I would have preferred for the lectures not to be so high level. If you want students to really learn the material, try engaging the students with a bit harder material, but not rush through it. For example, some of the waste management material could have gone more in depth, but go a little slower for students to truly understand what the material is trying to teach. 7. Do not put information regarding studies on your slides to make a point when you do not know\/understand the entire study yourself.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She has a great general knowledge about many topics. She's very pleasant, but does not command respect from students. While we respect her academic knowledge, she is not particularly authoritative. I think she would benefit from setting stricter ground rules in class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole is nice, attentive, and clear.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think Professor Deziel did a good job this semester. I recognize that teaching an introductory course like this is rather difficult, but by the end of the semester I felt I had learned a lot from the class. I felt Professor Deziel's lectures were superior to that of our guest lecturers. It would have been nice if we could had more discussions about the material, but the setting and size of class made that a little difficult. I wish we had continued using the clickers throughout the duration of the class. They help me stayed engaged in the lecture and would have made participating a bit easier for the whole class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nice, helpful, strong grasp of material",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think she did a great job for first time teaching this course. She seemed genuinely eager to help students as much as possible and she was very organized.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I like Dr. D a lot. She is knowledgeable in her area of research and really did try to engage the class. It was too bad the clickers did not work out too well. It would be better if she conveyed some more confidence in what she was presenting, because I think that is when the class is more likely to turn on a professor. A little more refining of those things and less guest lectures would go a long way for this class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths - Quick and valuable feedback. Expert knowledge of course subject matter. Weakness - Withholding information from students on presentation slides is not a good nor fair method to encourage attendance at lectures. My opinion is that lectures should be valuable in terms of helping to understand complex material.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is an incredibly nice professor who genuinely care about the material and our learning it. She seems a bit shy and nervous on stage but her learning objectives are very clear and her exams are incredibly clear and fair.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The professor grades with a bias toward certain opinions with unclear conclusions based on data. Many of the issues discussed in the topics of the course have no clear answer given the complexity of the problem. Students who favored certain answers, that the professor preferred, scored higher on assignments than students who favored answers opposite to professor's opinions.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel really tried to make a lecture course more engaging by posing questions to the class. She tried to get feedback earlier in the semester, which was appreciated. Her lectures are easy to follow, and they were more engaging than some of the guest lecturers she brought in.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think the instructor came across as diffident, however she was attentive to student needs and competent in her understanding of Environmental health.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0very nice and explains things clearly!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very knowledgable and always available to answer questions and meet\/help students.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strength: takes this course seriously Weaknesses: when asking Dr. Deziel clarifying questions for lectures and homework assignments, she answers in a punitive tone; which discourages me from seeking further help. Even from our very first encounter, she did not seem friendly or approachable. A number of students had trouble downloading\/opening lecture slides in PDF forms. She did not want to upload the lectures in PPT form because she was afarid that her work will be copied. I think copying is still possible in PDF form as well. So it appears, at times, as if she is going out of her way to make it difficult for students.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0she is a nice person. She tried to have an engaging class with clickers but that dint last for the the whole semester.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Not the most exciting lecturer, but office hours were helpful.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr Deziel is clearly passionate about the material. I liked her energy and her level of organization.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0A good and clear lecturer. Tries to engage the class, not always successfully, but I'm sure its hard to do in Winslow at 8:30 in the morning. Overall, I thought Dr. Deziel did a good job covering the material for an intro EHS course in a lecture setting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The professor clearly has the interest of students at heart and she demonstrates this in the wide array of visiting lecturers that she brings to the class. This diversity helped to enrich the learning environment. Area of improvement: I will suggest that the professor requires less and less of hardcopy assignments. This might as well save the environment.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel definitely picked up steam later in the semester. For awhile it felt like she was just reading her presentation slides to us, and, whether she was or was not, she seemed nervous even though it was obvious she knows her stuff. Later on she got better about generating discussions, which more helpful and enjoyable."

There were also guest lecturers which showed their really interesting and innovative research!! I really enjoyed the course, learned a lot, and definitely learned many things I didn't even know and that are fundamental to know as a public health professional.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, but, unfortunately, it fulfills a graduation requirement. There are better, more interesting courses, that students can take to learn about the public health impacts of environmental factors, such as coursework at FES.",
    "If this is going to be a required course, there needs to be some serious re-working of the format, presentation, and material.",
    "It's ok. Not for me because I am not in EHS.",
    "Because it was a requirement, the whole attitude about the course from students was kind of bad, but Nicole made the best of it.",
    "I would not recommend this course at all if nothing changes. There is no oral\/speaking\/participation component, and you just drift through poorly organized, simplified material all semester.",
    "This is a core class.",
    "It was required so no recommendations.",
    "A good overview course on many topics in environmental health. I hear it was a huge improvement from when the course was taught in previous years",
    "Take this course if it is recommended, otherwise I suggest you look into more interesting courses with professors with good reviews. It is not tortuous nor strenuous, but at times you will get frustrated with how erroneous some of the material feels and with how \"out-of-it\" Dr. Deziel often seems.",
    "It is a required course but I would recommend testing out if you are able to. I am a healthcare management student so it is not particularly relevant to my concentration or in line with myinterests.",
    "As someone who is not concentrating in environmental health, I was not particularly enthusiastic about taking this required course. However, Nicole Deziel did a fantastic job making the content accessible and the lectures engaging for students coming from all backgrounds. I also really appreciated the variety of assignments given which allowed me to learn the material in different creative ways. Overall, Nicole is a great teacher and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this course.",
    "As it currently stands, I would not recommend this course to another student: the methods of delivery, content, and instruction methods are overall not effective and with all the other amazing opportunities available at Yale, spending time in this course is not the best use of a student's time.",
    "Okay course, wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't mandatory",
    "Good course",
    "Super easy good intro to environmental health. Low effort and straightforward.",
    "I would recommend this class over toxicology, because the work load is much less! You probably don't need to attend all of the lectures to understand the material for this course, but most of them were interesting to listen to. Overall, not my favorite class at YSPH, but its possible to get an H with just doing the work and going to class, so I can appreciate it for that.",
    "I've heard worse things about Toxicology than I experienced in Intro to Environmental Health, so I would recommend it instead of the alternative.",
    "Basic overview of EHS",
    "This is a required course that will give you a very broad overview of environmental health.",
    "We are all required to take this course, so you have to take this class anyways. You will enjoy it if you do not have much knowledge on environmental health. If you do, then this class might not be as challenging. I enjoyed this class a lot, I learned many interesting things.",
    "It provides a good foundation in environmental health but if you studied science prior to the class it was very repetitive.",
    "It's a really helpful course to learn more about the environment, I am happy I took it because I am prepared, as a policy student, to incorporate some of this content into my considerations of health policy.",
    "recommend it, but it could be improved. required course. better than toxicology.",
    "The course covers a wide range of environmental health issues. Material is interesting and engaging, and assignments bring together various course materials. It's a class worth taking and attending.",
    "Kinda lame but better than toxicology",
    "A MUCH BETTER OPTION THAN TOX. Take this one for sure.",
    "This introductory course provides an introduction to a wide variety of subjects in environmental health. This course can serve as a way to determine where interests in environmental health may lie to then determine which upper level courses to take on that topic.",
    "fine core class.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Definitely better than the toxicology course, but you may not learn very much in this class. It's fine though.",
    "Good survey, useful information. A bit too science-heavy for me, but that's a low bar.",
    "Survey course of EHS. It's a requirement.",
    "As a required course, this is just something you have to get through. The topics are interesting and definitely cross into other sectors of public health. It is fine for what it is.",
    "This is a relatively easy course as a requirement. Some of the topics are interesting but the course definitely has the potential to be improved.",
    "It's easy for those who have taken some undergrad environmental toxicology course.",
    "Even if it's not what you think you're interested in long term, give this course a chance. I though it was really interesting and besides, it's a low level of work so why not?!",
    "I thought most of the course content was very interesting. Of all the required courses we have had to take, this is one of the better ones.",
    "interesting class that's well organized with nice instructor.",
    "Great intro course on environmental health. A lot of interesting and novel topics were introduced to me and I definitely plan to implement a lot of what I learned in my everyday life and in my extracurricular activities.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student for several reasons. First, I didn't find the instructor approachable. Her punitive tone discourages students from seeking further help. Second, the course covers a broad range of topics; while some of them are fitting for the difficulty levels of a Master's course, others are not--which gives people one more reason to not show up to an early class. Third, the themes of this course should be streamlined, such that they can be divided into parts that focus on the environment (physical, food, etc), environmental disasters, occupational health. The topics are too scattered and could be organized better. They can help students to study for the course. I respect the fact Dr. Deizel takes this course seriously and has put in efforts to organize the material. However, the ways in which she implements these changes can be greatly improved.",
    "ok for an intro course less guest speakers and more lectures by professor have a book with the course",
    "I feel like this class has potential to be more interesting. It's a fairly easy, straightforward class.",
    "It's a good introductory class to environmental health. I appreciated having taken it.",
    "A good survey course of environmental health issues. With some nice exposure to other Yale professors working in the field. I think it's worth being aware of these key issues in environmental health as a public health professional.",
    "I would recommend the course. The course provides a useful introduction to the environmental health body of knowledge."
