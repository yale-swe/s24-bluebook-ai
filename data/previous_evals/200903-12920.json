   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is not an easy course but, well-taught, it has interesting material and worthwhile applications for those interested in math and sciences. There is a lot to think about for those who just enjoy thinking.",
    "It's a good class if you are willing to work hard. Some of the math is pretty cool, even if you can't visualize it.",
    "I highly recommend this class only if the student has a great background in the concepts presented in Calc 2. The class gets more difficult as it progresses because more abstract ideas are presented.",
    "Depends on how your background in mathematics is.",
    "Multivarible Calc at its most fundamental. Take it for what it is. The problem sets can be challenging, as can be the tests. The other students are generally very adept at math. If you're willing to put in the necessary hours and are genuinely interesting in math, absolutely go for it.",
    "Math 120 is a basic multivariable calculus course. If you have taken Calc BC in high school, Math 115 is nearly entirely review, and Math 120 follows more or less directly from the Calc BC material. Homework in this course is not too difficult and is very helpful for understanding and being able to apply the material. Exams are relatively fair as well, though they account for a disproportionately large percent of your grade.",
    "Chances are, if you are taking Math 120, you need it as a major requirement. As such, it is a fine course. You will learn the material. The workload is not overwhelming on a weekly basis, though I found that the tests required more extensive studying than for other courses. I would also note that a Calc AB background was adequate for beginning this course.",
    "Necessary for me, not amazing, but not difficult.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a course that effectively exposes you to multivariate calculus and teaches the essential, core concepts needed for other fields of study. Multivariate calculus is essential in many fields, so I would recommend this course for all who wish to attain the crux of the subject. However, I would not recommend this class for those who wish for a more theoretical, proof oriented class since more time is spent learning a wide range of techniques and theorems.",
    "I would not recommend Math 120 to another student. Only take it if you absolutely need it as a prerequisite for a major or another course. This class has an incredibly difficult midterm and final exam and the TA teaching the section will make or break the course. Most of my lectures were unbearably boring and dry and simply involved copying down endlessnotes from the blackboard, which can just as easily be learned by reading the textbook. The towards the end become long grinds that just show you can plug in an equation. Math 120 was taught too quickly to learn any concepts in-depth and didn't greatly improve my math skills.",
    "This class is pretty challenging. Don't be afraid to ask for help!",
    "I'd recommend it as it's a necessary stepping stone for anyone interested at all in math."
