   "comments": [
    "I love math, and I enjoyed the class. Ebrahimian's section is as good as Frame's.",
    "Starts easy, ends harder. It's all about practice problems before tests. Advice: (1) make study groups to check pset answers. It can't hurt. (2) do a lot of practice problems before tests. You want to basically have a reflex for answering certain types of questions. The tests take concepts to a higher level than they are in the book, so you need to really know your stuff.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it for something else.",
    "Most people need it for higher level courses and have no other option. Psets do not take long. Tests are difficult, especially the final.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN'T EXPOSED TO CALC iii BEFOREHAND. I did. Huge mistake. You'll be in a class full of people who already know the stuff and don't need to teachers, many of whom can be quite crappy. Plus the class is curved big time, which in this case can really work against you.",
    "Overall, Math120 was a very disappointing course in that the class was poorly organized and the teaching of material was highly ineffective. In addition, certain particularly USEFUL multivariable concepts (such as the Lagrangian or Jacobian) that I have had to apply in other courses, such as Economics and Physics, were not covered at all, which was very unfortunate. On the other hand, seemingly impractical concepts (such as going over the volume of a parallelepiped) caused deviations in the focus of the course. In general, I think that Math120 should only be taken if necessary (which is often the case).",
    "Very different to 115. More theoretical and less application. Interesting material especially if you are interested in Physics.",
    "I think it is practical and effective, and the work load is ok.",
    "The material is not particularly exciting. Its not the sort of class I would take just for fun. Also, I would not recommend taking this class with Roohollah.",
    "Yes, if they need Multivariable Calc.",
    "I would recommend it if the person was interested in math or needed the class for a major requirement.",
    "MATH 120 covers the basics of three-dimensional space, vector fields, partial and directional derivatives of multivariable functions, extreme values, double and triple integrals, line integrals, and surface integrals. The main theorems are Clairaut's Theorem, Fubini's Theorem, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. There are also some problems in cylindrical and spherical coordinates and problems using Mathematica software. I had a lot of fun taking the course, especially sketching all the three-dimensional solids and surfaces, but it wasn't exactly intellectually rewarding. There turned out to be a lot of learning problem-solving techniques, and there wasn't much time in class to talk about the concepts themselves. If you have to take the course, Prof. Ebrahimian is absolutely the professor you want - he is extraordinarily clear and very helpful.",
    "Tough class. Go to class and do the work, and you'll learn the material. But no matter what, the tests are killer.",
    "Yes. I like diversifying my schedule with a math course or two. Professor Ebrahimian was a good teacher--easy to understand and generous with his time if you are willing to go see him. Math 120 does not merit the reputation it carries; it is a decent class!"
