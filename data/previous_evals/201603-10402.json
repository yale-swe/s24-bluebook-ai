    "I learned so much about taking pictures!",

    "I am much better at framing photographs, and I am also much more aware of light and the role in plays in photography.",
    "I learned how to use an old film camera--more than one actually. I also learned a lot about old and contemporary photographers. I learned to develop and print. Taking this class made me see photography differently and improved my composition and the work I produced. I also learned a lot about New Haven from walking around and more about my peers than I did in any other class.",

    "Great course.",
    "I cannot understate how important it is to provide financial support for this class (and other courses with high associated expenses). I would estimate that I spent $500 on materials for this course, not including the $150 lab fee, and not including a camera, which I borrowed. The lab fee alone, never mind the materials expenses, is prohibitive for lower- and middle-income students, and had I known how expensive the class was going to be, I likely would not have enrolled. I'm very glad to have taken the class, and grateful I had savings to put towards this course, but it is unreasonable to expect all photo students (and art students generally) to bear the full burden of these fees. I'm concerned that the lack of diversity in art classes and in my photo class in particular is in part due to the cost -- in my class, I was one of two students of color, and the other student was a graduate student. Please, please, please consider heavily subsidizing students' materials fees, and waiving lab fees for students on financial aid. This course was transformative to me, and I would hate to have other students unable to access the class because of the financial burden. In terms of the course itself, it was excellent -- one of the most important classes I've taken during my five semesters at Yale. Lisa is an expert, thoughtful, and empathetic instructor and mentor. The time commitment was unusually large -- the largest I've had at Yale -- and I would not have been able to enjoy this class as much had I been taking 5 credits or had heavier coursework in my other classes. This is something to consider moving forward. Additionally, I would have appreciated more feedback earlier in the semester and throughout the term. Learning more about other photographers' work; I enjoyed the lectures on \"the greats.\" Overall, excellent course. A must-take at Yale.",
    "I honestly believe this class is set up masterfully. Critiques were honest. Assignments were grounding. And both Lisa and Anna were great sources of information and inspiration.",
    "This course was very strenuous and forced me into new situations that I had not been exposed to as a photographer.",
    "Strengths of this course are the fully functioning darkroom, Lisa's enthusiasm and articulation and knowledge about photo, my peer's willingness to share and help out, and the way that the class builds from a very basic foundation. I thought it was super fun and the freedom to photograph whatever we wanted was great. It would be nice if it cost less money, but all the money goes to chemicals or materials.",

    "Absolutely. Learned so much.",
    "1) Black and White Photo is amazing -- one of the best (if not the best) I've taken at Yale. Take it if you get in. 2) This class is beginner-friendly! Don't worry about not having experience -- most students in my class weren't art majors, and nearly everyone had never worked in film photography at all. 3) If you're taking 5 credits or have a hard semester, think about if you'd rather take this class another semester. It is inevitably very time consuming (many hours spent shooting and in the darkroom), and you'll enjoy it more if you're not sacrificing your other classes. 4) Don't take the class Credit\/D -- it's a ton of work either way, so take it, do the work, take it seriously, and you'll find it really rewarding. 5) Ask your professor about fellowships available to help cover materials expenses -- the class is very expensive ($150 lab fee plus $400+ in materials fees), so ask for help if you see the cost as being prohibitive.",
    "Yes. Teaches you not only about photography, but also about life.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, anyone interested in photography in any form should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. It was incredibly fun, I met fantastic people, and I was encouraged to explore the world around me and my own thoughts in a fantastic new way. That said, this course should not be taken on a whim. It is a huge amount of work and is very expensive.",
    "great yes"
