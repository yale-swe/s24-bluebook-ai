    "I would definitely recommend this class. Prof Peirano is great and you get to work closely with her. I had never taken a literary criticism course and found it of great use and enjoyment - excellent readings and worthwhile discussions. It is quite a bit of writing, even for a WR credit, which is not meant to discourage (its totally worth it) but only to prepare one considering it.",
    "Pretty good look at the beginnings of literary criticism in the West. You read quite a few interesting and important works that you might not have looked into otherwise. At times the class seemed a little bit unfocused.",
    "I would, although I would caution you that this is more a class on literary criticism than literature itself, just so you know what you're getting into.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! The texts are more relevant than you think and Professor Peirano is wonderful. The course is a lot of work though."
