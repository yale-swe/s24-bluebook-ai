   "comments": [
    "This course covers goes into depth in a wide range of topics in developmental biology. Students are expected to learn a great deal of information for each weekly quiz, but thankfully, the midterm exams are not cumulative. The course expands on many of the topics mentioned in BIOL 103, but goes into far more mechanistic detail.",
    "I learned a lot about developmental biology and fundamentals in science. Everything was clearly explained so I think I learned a ton that will be helpful in many other science classes and a career in a related field.",
    "Developmental Biology provided students with a wealth of amazing knowledge concerning the embryonic development of animals (and plants, briefly). This knowledge came more or less out of the textbook, and weekly quizzes may have helped to reinforce concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about the development of many model systems in biology like zebrafish, drosophila, arapidopsis, frogs, and mice. I also realized that developmental biology was definitely not what I expected it to be, as it is essentially a microlevel reproductive biology."

   "comments": [
    "The course material is very interesting and both Holley and Irish are very clear lecturers. The quizzes and exams expect students to know a great deal of detail and often are quite difficult. The course definitely could be improved by the addition of a discussion section to go over confusing subjects and provide students with an opportunity to process the material further.",
    "The small size of the class was great for asking questions. Some of the lectures could possibly be a little more organized.",
    "Professor Holley was fantastic, organized, approachable, and an amazing teacher. Professor Kankel was disorganized, uncomfortable, and boring.",
    "Like many in the biological sciences, the course is a memorization course, for better or for worse. The weekly quizzes often served more to cover specific topics that would NOT be covered on exams (i.e. they were graded practice for the hardest quiz questions, but their material was for the most part not retested on exams) than to reinforce taught concepts or information. Since it was co-taught by three professors, the teaching style varied. Holley's style was straightforward and organized; Kankel's was a little scattered; Irish's was organized but fast. TA-led review sessions just prior to each exam really helped to clarify and organize the material that was going to be tested. With the overwhelming amount of memorizable and testable information, these sessions crucially helped to narrow down what to study.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot of information in a short period of time. And the 3 midterm format allows you to not be overwhelmed by the details. Weaknesses: Having 3 professors definitely negatively impacts the learning of students as it prevents students from making an informed decision about a course during shopping period and makes it difficult for students to adjust to professors' teaching styles. Also, the level of the course indicated by the number assigned to it (210) definitely underestimates the difficulty of the content of the course. I also think the professors assume students have worked in a lab before, and expect a high degree of understanding of molecular techniques without making those assumptions clear to students at the beginning of the course. I think the class should be higher level, as it assumes knowledge of genetics and biological laboratory techniques. Also, each of the professors and TAs should have official office hours that are listed on the course syllabus. Not listing office hours is a sure fire way to discourage students from asking for help when they need it.",
    "One of my favorite MCDB courses so far! The material is simply fascinating. Although the material was interesting, the teaching was often unengaging and disorganized. Having three different professors with three very different teaching styles made exam preparation difficult. Overall, a great course."

   "comments": [
    "I would suggest this class only to students who are very interested in the field of developmental biology and are willing to study extensively for the weekly quizzes and midterm exams.",
    "Yes - very manageable course and you learn a lot. There is a quiz every week which is actually very helpful because then you understand the material before the three midterms.",
    "Professor Holley was fantastic, organized, approachable, and an amazing teacher. Professor Kankel was disorganized, uncomfortable, and boring. Take class if you must.",
    "Yes. As with many similar courses, the course material taught in Developmental Biology is fascinating and stimulating until you have to memorize it and spit it back on exams. If you're into biology, you've definitely come across this before. That said, if you're interested, take it--I hear it's not as difficult as other biology-memorization courses, and the material IS still fascinating.",
    "Yes. I went into it without any innate interest in dev biology and came out of it loving it. It's a very interesting and well-organized course.",
    "Yes! Favorite MCDB course. Irish and Holley were pretty good professors and the material was just so cool."
