    "Take it! The class is a lot more interesting than it sounds. Professor Kim is wonderful, and you will like him more and more as the semester goes on! Not extremely difficult, but not very easy. The problem sets must be done in groups. At the end of the class, he took us to a water treatment plant, and it was amazing to see everything we've learned this semester.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in drinking water or waste water treatment processes.",
    "If you're an environmental engineer, then you have to take this course, and it's an interesting class. Professor Kim is funny, and he teaches the material well. The course is called water quality control for a reason, the class is all about the processes humans use to clean both drinking and wastewater--overall I really enjoyed the class.",
    "Overall, I liked this class a lot. Professor Kim is fantastic, he makes everything interesting and he's a great teacher. The material isn't the most fascinating stuff ever, but you'll learn so much.",
    "This is such a good course now! ChemE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, take this for an elective! This is what an engineering course should be. Professor Kim is so great. He explains things well, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so reasonable and understanding. He knows that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible not to fall asleep in a 75 minute lecture at 2:30 pm in the windowless basement room in Becton, so he gave us a two minute break in the middle of every class. He also occasionally gave mini-seminars, which were tested, so they were a really nice way to learn more about the breadth of water technologies in a stress-free way. He also creates such a good dynamic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he always wanted to have lunch with us, told us that he had a bad accent and we should tell him if we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally understandable, by the way), and he chats with us about real things, too. The course was well balanced in providing the rigorous mathematical description of concepts as well as the physical, conceptual\/practical description. I feel like I learned a ton, learning about most of the technologies and principles that go into water and wastewater treatment from multiple perspectives (mass balances, mass transport, kinetics, biology, chemistry, physics, process modeling and analysis, concern for environment and society). It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy, because the material presenting was challenging, but the workload was certainly reasonable and evaluation was not overly stressful or overwhelming. The field trip at the end of the course to a water treatment plant was a great way to end the course, solidifying the topics we learned by letting us see how they are implemented. The class itself is a nice way to learn about a very practical and important\/large field of chemE \/ envE, a good way to apply the concepts and techniques we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been learning in other classes in a practical way.",
    "I took the class because I was interested in the topic and my research was related to some of the water treatment topics. Even though it is an engineering elective, it is still quite a demanding course and I wish I had more time to dedicate to it.Not a class to take as a 5th credit, but if your semester isn't already overloaded, then the class is interesting (not all the time, sometimes lecture is a lot of work on the board but this was not too common). Professor Kim really tried to approach topics from different ways and present them with either powerpoint, board notes, or verbal presentations. There is also a plant tour at the end of the course which really ties in all of the concepts together at the end.Demanding, but worth it if you are interested in the topics. If you take it Cr\/D, then you can really just focus on the topics you are interested in.",
    "Definitely take this if Professor Kim is teaching it! He's awesome and you'll learn a lot. His problem sets and exams are challenging, but not to a ridiculous degree. If you work hard in this class, you'll really get a lot out of it.",
    "Great ChemE ABET elective. Professor Kim is incredible! Workload is manageable. Three non-cumulative \"midterm\" exams count for 25% each, and homework is 25%. I could say so much about how good this class is, but you really have to see for yourself.",
    "It's a good class. Feels like it is meant more for Enve because a lot of the main components are covered in other classes",
    "The class is an engineering class about water quality, and that is what should be expected. Do not romanticize it into a cool class on water issues, because you will be disappointed. That being said, if you are interested in how we clean water and enjoy math and science, take the class. I found it to be very interested and not too demanding time-wise or difficulty wise."
