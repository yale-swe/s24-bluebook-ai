    "This is the most fun class I have taken at Yale, and I'm upset that I can't take it again. The readings are fantastically fun if you enjoy the heroic or the absurd and the in-class discussion was informative not just about the literature but about an array of British history and culture. It helps that Professor Gabriel is hilarious.It's such a specialized subject that it's difficult to label this a \"must-take\" class -- but it's number one on the list of things to take it if you are at all vaguely interested in the material or have a spare spot in your schedule.",
    "This is a really interesting class that has a lot to offer, whether you're interested in history, culture, linguistics, literature, etc. You can really make the class what you'd like and Professor Gabriel is very amenable to suggestions about class trajectory. The class necessarily covers a lot of background information about Celts and Celtic culture, which is AWESOME. Really, a one-of-a-kind class; in all of my English seminars, I've never come across anything like this.",
    "Wow. This is a great class that you can get nowhere else, and that is totally unique even at Yale. If you've ever heard of Cu Chulainn or Pryderi, you'll absolutely love it, and even if you haven't, as long as you're interested in world mythology and heroic narratives, this will be an entertaining class. Professor Gabriel is has a great sense of humor and leads very entertaining, though not always topical, discussions. The readings and papers are short and not difficult, but unfortunately, many of the seminar meetings end up not being very productive. If you take this class, make sure to keep Professor Gabriel from going on tangents too often.",
    "Take this if you're at all interested in Medieval Celtic Lit. The workload isn't too bad, and it's a really fun class.",
    "I would recommend this course. You get a pretty comprehensive look into the world of medieval Irish and Welsh literature, and the work involved is pretty low-key. Prof. Gabriel is really nice, extremely friendly, and veryknowledgeable."
