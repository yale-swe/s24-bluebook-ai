    "This course provided me with a great background in the physical principles of neuroimaging techniques and will be directly useful to me as I begin my new job at a neuroimaging research facility in June. I learned a lot about different kinds of techniques I wasn't aware of before, the benefits and limitations of each and had some opportunities to explore research topics independently, which I quite enjoyed.",
    "I learned about the latest advances in neuroimaging. I was able to learn how to prepare and deliver presentations. In addition, we had the opportunity to write papers on topics that interested us."

    "The course was not too heavy on work, which I appreciated, but the weekly synopses were good for making sure that I absorbed the material. I think that the weekly lecture format style worked for the most part, but the course could have stood to include a bit more structured discussion surrounding various topics. I feel that I might have learned even more had there been more opportunities for discussion and debate. However, all students in the course did have to present during class time, which was a good way to increase engagement with the material. I also think it might have actually been nice to have an exam or two - nothing super intensive or challenging, but just to test the overall concepts presented. It might have increased my retention of some of the course material, even if it adds a bit to the workload. Finally, one other issue was that the instructors did not provide any feedback on the weekly synopses throughout the semester, which I felt would have been helpful for my understanding of the material - they could have taken that opportunity to correct misstatements that I had made or add additional comments about each topic.",
    "I don't think there were any weaknesses with the course. Each lecture was like a TED talk in which we were able to delve deeper into specific topics. I enjoyed the chance to prepare my own presentation on a topic that I found interesting."

    "This is a chill class. Good way to get some additional background on neuroimaging techniques if you're a psych\/neuro\/cog sci or related major, but if you have no background at all on the topic you will likely find it hard to follow the lectures. There are no tests, only two long-ish papers, which are freeform and which I actually found quite fun to write. The only other work is weekly lecture summaries (one page single-spaced, not too bad) and every student has to present during class time, with a little more than half of all of the lectures being lead by students. But you can pair up with other students to present, which takes some of the stress away, and the professors do not grill you too hard. Overall, highly recommend it if the topic is intriguing to you and you want some additional background -- learned a lot about the physics and applications of MR-based techniques that I wouldn't have gotten to learn about otherwise.",
    "Yes, this a course I would highly recommend, whether you are a BME major or not. The course teaches valuable skills that will help any science major. It is also a very small sized class to allow for open discussions."
