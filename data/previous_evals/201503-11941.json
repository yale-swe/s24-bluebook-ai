    "I don't know if I necessarily why there's a cult reputation surrounding Anne Fadiman and her two courses. ENGL 469 was awesome and probably the most instructive writing course I've taken, but it didn't blow everything else out of the water. Still, you should definitely take it if you get in and want to go into writing or reporting Anne is an incredible instructor and cares so much about her students. That really matters in a nebulous field like creative writing.",
    "Take this class if you're willing to work for it. This is a class that intends to create a culture, and it succeeds at fulfilling that objective. Take this class if you're willing to be a good partner, critic, peer. Take this class if you want to improve your writing by leaps and bounds.",
    "You cannot help but work hard in this class because your peers and your professor are working so hard, and the work you put in will make you a better writer. Anne doesn't make people sound like her; she helps students come to write like the best versions of themselves. In this class, you feel like writing is an attainable profession, and you come out with an increased sense of confidence in the way you express yourself.",
    "Great workshop in living and writing truthfully.",
    "Lots of work, but I urge you to take this class, whether or not you plan to make a career of writing. One of the best experiences of my young life.",
    "You cannot emerge from this course without improving your writing and producing pieces you are proud of. The YP piece is a really fascinating and enjoyable assignment. In the assignmed readings, you will be sure to find writers whose works you will cherish long after the course."
