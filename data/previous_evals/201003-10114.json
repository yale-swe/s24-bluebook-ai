    "Yes, definitely -- this was by far my favorite course here at Yale. It's reaffirmed my dreams for a career in finance. Professor Bessent is great and I truly enjoyed learning from him.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale! Both the seminar and the final paper were incredibly fulfilling experiences thanks to Bessent, who is one of the most brilliant and kind people I have met. The topic is so extremely relevant and important; it should be a required course for all Yale students! You learned about both the history of financial crises and how we got ourselves into the current one. Bessent is an absolute expert on the topic and great at explaining difficult concepts while provoking us to think out of the box about everything from regulatory arbitrage to common themes throughout financial history.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take it if you can get in.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in finance. Amazing overview of the financial panic from all different aspects. Bessent is easy to follow, and he chooses excellent readings that I enjoyed looking at. The discussions in the seminar are very open, and I can't stress enough how much I learned about the subject. Great seminar.",
    "Take it.",
    "This is the one of the best economics \/ finance classes at Yale. You will learn about the current crisis and past crises as well. Professor Bessent has a deep understanding of and appreciation for economic history that is unparalleled. Do not pass up this opportunity.",
    "Absolutely take it if you have any interest in finance, economic history, politics, or anything having to do with the way we use and think of money.",
    "Highly recommend. Take this class if you want to understand the financial crisis and its historical antecedents. This is a must know for anybody interested in the future health and stability of the United States.",
    "I would definitely reccommend this class. You'll learn a lot about the panic, as well as past panics, and current events. Even if you've had an internship on Wall Street, you'll learn something in this class. It's also worth taking to get to know the Professor.",
    "Definitely recommend to students who are truly interested in the learning more about the financial world. The final paper also gives you a chance to research more about one specific topic.",
    "GREATTAKE ITScott Bessent is awesome!",
    "This course was great. The professor really cares about his students. It was awesome to take a class dealing with current and relevant issues. He hand selected a fabulous reading list and seemed to know everything that one could possibly know on the subject. If you can get into any class with Professor Bessent you should take it!"
