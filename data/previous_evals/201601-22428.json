    "My fellow classmates are very motivated. Their comments during class are of high quality.",
    "I recommend this course to students looking for a survey of ~125 years of political\/economic development in East Asia. It is not, however, a course that will go in-depth on any topic (if you have a particular interest) nor is it perhaps as useful to those with a background in this area as it was to me.",
    "Since this course was open to many students of different backgrounds, I would describe it as quite general on the subject that was taught, yet it was also extremely informative and had many fascinating guest speakers.",
    "An efficient and effective overview of the politics and political economy of East Asia, from underlying issues from history to contemporary topics. I would recommend it for both its East Asian substantial content and political frameworks introduced to adeptly analyze each topic."

    "I was very new to this topic, so I feel like it did deepen my understanding in certain areas.",
    "It has contributed to both my knowledge base for East Asian substantial content and analytical frameworks in political science."
