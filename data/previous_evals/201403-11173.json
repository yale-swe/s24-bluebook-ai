    "Wouldn't recommend it to students in Forestry school. The perspectives of the instructors are very different from us.",
    "You'll learn a lot. Allan has high standards for the replication project and the final exam; hopefully you won't procrastinate and will be self-motivated to work hard. It's a bit of a different approach from Peter's 500-503 but the three-course sequence has a nice synergy to it.",
    "If you are interested in doing quantitative work you should take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only if that student had the free time to essentially take two classes. Otherwise, it is just too time consuming.",
    "If you've taken Peter's class and felt very comfortable at the end, you'll probably find most of the material in this class within your wheelhouse. Its worth taking for the replication paper, which I think was important for me.",
    "recommendable for certain students",
    "Good follow on course for 500 and 503, but very intensive workload.",
    "necessary for quantitative analysis",
    "If you want to take and pass the quantitative comp, you should take this class. However, if you don't need to to do this, I'd suggest not taking it, and simply grabbing the syllabus for a resource for the future. Outside of the lectures on graphics, there was little that seemed of immediate use, and in at least some cases, I came out with a much less firm grasp on topics that I had used in the past, especially concepts like MLE or IV and RDD covered in PLSC-502."

   "comments": [
    "I've learned much more about how to critique other works for their quantitative choices and how to think about a quantitative research design for my own work.",
    "This course was very helpful in advancing my knowledge and ability in using quantitative methods. Very helpful in this sense.",
    "Allan did certainly succeed in convincing me to stay away from the Dark Arts, though perhaps in a manner different than what he intended. I've generally come away from this course with the realization that the vast majority of statistical work in political science is indefensible. Perhaps that's a good thing.",
    "Helpful to gain an understanding of the pros and cons of main methods used within my field.",
    "Directly related as it offers the statistical skills I'll be using in the future"
