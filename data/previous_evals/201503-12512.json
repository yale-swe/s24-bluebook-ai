    "Interesting class, and Profesora Carreras is great. We learned a lot about legal topics, but didn't practice speaking often and it seemed like we were jumping around in her workbook a lot. It does have the reputation of being a gut, so beware - it's by no means a particularly difficult class, but there is still a consistent amount of work required. There are weekly two-page papers, two graded in-class debates, a ~30-minute memorized small group oral presentation, and a final 10-page research paper. Attendence is not taken, but is noticed and coming almost every time seems necessary to get an A.",
    "A successful opportunity to use spanish and engage with topics regarding law.",
    "Take it. It's fun and Mercedes is great. The course doesn't incorporate as much speaking practice as I would have liked, but you'll get to do a fair bit of writing.",
    "Take it if you need a break in your schedule. Take it no matter how comfortable you are with your Spanish (a native speaker can BREEZE through and a mediocre student won't be penalized for writing\/speaking poorly). Do not take it if you want a deeply enriching course; I took it because I wanted to dust off my Spanish and the class served that purpose but little else. Evaluation: two pages of writing a week, with two in-class debates and a 10 page paper at the end of the term.",
    "I learned much in this course. The material was very interesting and intensive yet manageable. I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in the Spanish language.",
    "This class is about as gutty as it gets. If you want an easy - but boring\/unengaging - class take this. It has it's fun moments, but, overall, it didn't really help me improve my Spanish in a meaningful way. I will say that Professora Carreras makes the class so manageable because she has an extremely kind\/understanding attitude about the stress of academics at Yale, so she very much wants to give students exposure to the material without stressing anybody out over assessments. An easy class to take.",
    "Mercedes is the main strength of this course. She is one of the best professors I have ever had. Only take this course if your are actually interested in law!",
    "Definitely a lot of writing (two pages a week, plus ten pages at the end) but a very enjoyable class and Professor Carreras is great.",
    "Yes, it is not a ton fo work and very interesting",
    "Perfect course to learn legal spanish"
