    "Definitely take this! One of the best CS electives, especially the way it was structured this semester. I'd heard it was really difficult in past years, but I guess they changed it so you now implement the OS in small and pretty well-defined 'layers'. Each homework is the implementation of a new set of layers (starting out with physical memory, on to virtual memory, and then threads, traps, file system, shell, etc). Each layer builds on the last and it makes it really easy to understand what's going on. It still takes a lot of work & time especially because debugging multiple threads on multiple cpus is a nightmare, but the class is worth it. Also it's nowhere near the stress level of cs323, so if you survived that you can do this no problem.",
    "Every CS major should take this class. The sort of programming in this class is likely the most difficult kind you will ever encounter. Labs are very interesting, reflecting prof's research.",
    "Yep, 422 w\/ Zhong Shao is pretty good. Not overwhelming in terms of work, and you learn a lot about various levels of the operating system. Start psets early as you would any CS class, but you don't have to stress about it and have breakdowns like in 323.",
    "Really cool class. You build an operating system essentially from scratch (some code is provided). It's uniquely challenging for the lack of any real debugging facilities (gdb+qemu only goes so far in OS code).",
    "Yes, definitely take it. Operating Systems are very, very cool, and so is professor Shao.",
    "CPSC 422 took new ownership this semester which made the class a bit of an experiment, but Shao and his group did an excellent job. In six assignments, you go from trying to figure out what a kernel even is to writing system calls from scratch that access the directory and file descriptor layers of the file system stack. Its a great journey in discovering how operating system code is organized and designed and a superb introduction to concurrency and how it works, and Shao takes you through the whole thing using a very well written book that youll definitely be going back to in the future as a reference. An additional gem is that the class is based on a certified kernel built at Yale, which adds a personal dimension to the course. Also, this class will only improve over time as Shao and his team continue to refine it. Its a must for CS majors who want to call themselves CS majors.",
    "It's definitely a cool class to learn more about the inner machinery of the operating system kernel.",
    "Difficult, but you will learn a ton!",
    "Yes, see my response to Question 1.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Operating Systems. It's a necessary course to learn about how the underlying mechanisms of a computer work (including Compilers, Networks, Databases, ...). Overall, this was a very good course that helped illustrate a lot of different material. We went through many different topics including a little bit of branching out to network and security topics. The lectures were very good and the focus on the material was excellent. The assignments were extremely well thought out and provided a good way to learn about a lot of the topics. However, some of them ended up taking quite a bit of time because at such a low level, each change made could impact several different components. As a result, everything had to be triple checked to make sure that it was done with the correct interpretation.",
    "It was okay. It's really interesting, but Professor Shao was not familiar with the slides during a lot of the lectures, probably because he didn't make most of them. This can be a really great course as the assignments and lectures are smoothed out next year. Requires a lot more work than you realize.",
    "OS is a hard course. Assignments range in difficultly. The challenge is different from classes like 323 - the actual coding here was straightforward, but figuring out what to implement was challenging or, at times, impossible. Be sure to find a partner to work with within the collaboration policy. I was unable to and this hurt my standing.",
    "An excellent class that teaches you a LOT about operating systems. The assignments aren't too hard, and there's only one exam (which was fairly reasonable). My only real criticism is that it felt like there was sometimes too much given code in the assignments -- I sort of wanted to be implementing from scratch more than this class allowed for. If you take this class, you can expect more textbook\/lecture learning than hands on learning (take that as you will -- I know it works better for some). Other than that, I loved this course and I would highly recommend."
