    "A great class for students who want to do lots of film production with not too much theory and analysis. Prior filmmaking knowledge is very helpful, but not necessary.",
    "YES it's incredible",
    "In this course, you will make a short film based on the style of a different director every other week. It is a great deal if work, though the rewards are equally immense. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It is a good practical investigation into directors and their practices.",
    "Anyone at all should take this class. Doesn't matter if you've done film stuff before or not (I never had). It's actually great if you don't because none of the assignments are graded on technical expertise or anything like that at all (though my technical work has improved significantly over the course of the semester). And so the fact that there are film studies majors in the class is not intimidating at all. You just get to learn a lot from them and how they do things as well. Honestly just a really great class. If you have any interest in film at all, this is the class for you. A perfect balance of learning about films and making them",
    "yes!",
    "This would be a good class for you if you want to think hard about the craft of filmmaking, in terms of the specific stages of the production process. How do you approach casting, do you storyboard, how do you work with actors, what do you plan in advance and what do you let happen spontaneously, etc. That said, it is not a class that gives you precise technical instruction; you examine how a bunch of directors approach filmmaking, talk about them, and try making shorts their way. The class is a lot of work, mostly since it can be difficult even to schedule a shoot and convince actors and crew to show up. I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who wasn't going to put a lot into it, since it's that investment that really teaches you what works and what doesn't, what you like and don't.Rachel Carey is kind and insightful and very generous with her time and attention. Readings are light and generally interesting.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale.I'd always been vaguely interested in how movies were made, and their artistic\/persuasive power, but the whole process seemed entirely foreign and beyond my ken. This class changed that completely. By examining a dozen different directors and reading about each of their (widely varying) processes - always in their own words, and through watching clips from their films - Film Director's Craft exposed me to the goals, artistic considerations, technical issues, group dynamics, etc. that go into making all sorts of films. Not a whole lot of technical training is offered, but you learn because you have to: I made 5 films throughout the course of the semester, and learned everything from how to navigate media equipment loans at Bass to how to change the settings on a video camera to how to do sound mixing and color correction Final Cut Pro. There was a wide range of experience levels among the students, and we were all able to learn and draw inspiration from each other by working on each others' projects.I can't recommend the class enough. The workload can be difficult to manage - making a decent film, even a 2-minute short, takes time - but that is mostly because the time commitment is concentrated into the five films of the semester (four regular films and one final). the reading workload is very light, so you'll have a lot more free time on weeks when the other half of the class is shooting."
