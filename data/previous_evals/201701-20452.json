    "Honestly, little. I did not treat this class as an academic commitment this semester. That may seem harsh, but it was consistent with Prof. Silberschatz's treatment of the course. Silberschatz exhibits little to no pedagogical direction, so the entire course feels like he teaches solely because his contract obliges him to do so. You can gain this course's knowledge from YouTube, and you can gain this course's skills from CS courses where the professor designed the learning with at least a shred of educational intent. I would only recommend taking this course if you, like me, need a CS elective to graduate and would like to spend as little time on said credit because you have decided the time could be better spent elsewhere.",

    "Fundamentals of OS, more detail about the topics taught in CPSC323",
    "Not much",
    "Basic knowledge on principle of operating system.",

    "maybe don't just read off the slides every lecture.",
    "Strengths: it allows students to get a CS credit without attendance, engagement, or thought. Weaknesses: calling CPSC 423 a course embarrasses the department and insults the word.",
    "This course is not good. It is exactly the same as it as been for years and Avi has no interest in changing it. 10 of the 50 people in the class come and Avi walks through slides with no level of student engagement. The material itself is also really boring.",
    "It is a good course but the labs should be more engaging, i.e. steps towards building an actual OS rather than using java to create simple algorithms",
    "Weakness: the professor just reads definitions off the screen Strength- relevant material",
    "Strength: good overview of Os Weakness: student engagement low, overlaps with material from 323",
    "The worst class I have taken. It is embarrassing that we offer this as a part of our computer science curriculum. The class is purely memorization of the exact wording of outdated slides.",
    "I really liked everything about this course",
    "Students should work more in groups and work together in class on small exercises instead of reading lecture slides."

   "comments": [
    "not worth it if you want to actually get into the nitty gritty of OS, ok if you just want a high level overview of how OS works.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if you, like me, need a CS elective to graduate and would like to spend as little time on said credit because you have decided the time could be better spent elsewhere.",
    "It's a fine course. PSets are good and aren't too bad but exams are very very hard.",
    "You know why you're taking this class. It's a CS gut but you actually have to study for the midterm and final especially if you don't go to class. Even if you do, you have to study 500 slides before each and it's mindless and stupid. This year, they added labs which were slightly interesting and very easy but meant that you had an assignment 8 of the 13 weeks, which meant you had to think about this class more than it is worth thinking about. Avi should really change the structure of this class and the CS department should force him to improve and make the material more interesting and engaging but until he does, it is what it is.",
    "The class we didn't deserve, but the one we need. Light workload, easy to understand principles, this will give you a breather and is a great fifth class.",
    "Great class, covers a lot of the basic OS principles",
    "Not worth it. He pretty much goes through the slides as is so there is no need to go to class. There isn't a lot of work (4 short programming assignments and 4 short psets) but that's part of the problem. The multiple choice questions on the psets and exams are terribly worded and written and WILL screw your grade over. There are many many other classes that are more worth your time.",
    "No because there is very little engagement",
    "Good fifth credit!",
    "The worst class I have taken. It is embarrassing that we offer this as a part of our computer science curriculum. The class is purely memorization of the exact wording of outdated slides.",
    "Yes, I think this is super important to take as a CS major. Our core doesn't have these types of \"overview \/ vocab\" courses so you end up not having any context and just doing random systems coding psets. Now, I feel like I understand all the things we did in 323 and can actually know what people are talking about on a basic level in networking, databases, operating systems, and distributed systems."
