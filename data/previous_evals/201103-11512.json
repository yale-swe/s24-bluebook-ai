    "TAKE IT! Not too hard, but actually useful.",
    "This is a good intro to bioethics. We talked a lot about beginning-of-life and end-of-life issues, and we also talked about enhancement, animal rights, and the environment. There are two midterms, but you can do a debate instead of one of the midterms. There is also a final in the same format as the midterms. Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer, though not always the most organized. The TAs are absolutely wonderful, which makes section a lot of fun. I would recommend this course if you just want to get a taste of some of the different issues in bioethics.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class toanother student, 100%. It was very manageable and never at any point felt overwhelming. It balanced very well with my other extremely difficult courses. I also thoroughly enjoyed the class for the issues that were discussed. The exams were not difficult, especially if your teaching assistant is good and you did all of the readings.",
    "TAKEIT. David Smith is incredible. You'll never meet a more eloquent professor at Yale, or anywhere. (He also happens to be one of the sweetest, most sincere people I know. SUCH AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE working with this guy.) Also, I had zero experience with the academic study of ethics but found the readings for this class really interesting. It's a WIN. (It also makes a great Credit D option if you're looking for an extra class that will keep your interest for a semester.)",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject. Also isn't too hard--but you do have to do all of the reading.",
    "Yes- It's not too much work and it's a good intro to the issues. I actually took the class b\/c it fit into my schedule, not because I was that interested in the subject matter, but I realized most of the stuff we learn is pretty important to know and I am really glad I took it. The class is pretty much structured around the readings we do, so you have to do all of them, but they are interesting and manageable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it simply because if you are looking for answers to moral issues, in this class you will only find more questions.",
    "Yeah, definitely, take it. Not too time intensive but really interesting. Do-able as a 5th class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to any other student at all interesting in bioethics.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Looks at bioethics from a philosophical, as opposed to a policy angle. workload is light, sections were enjoyable and I would definitely recommend the debates as a better way to engage with the material. Professor Smith is also one of the nicest people I have met at Yale, he seems to have a genuine commitment to getting to know his students.",
    "Low work, not very engaging material.",
    "Yes - however, shop it first. What may have very well been the best course at Yale for me might not be such for you. Be forewarned: the first lecture can be kind of weird, and not wholly representative of David Smith's usually informative and eloquent lectures. Stick around for a bit.",
    "TAKE IT! It isn't the gut that everyone says it is but the reading isn't that bad and most of the time it is enjoyable. The test questions can be hard and they do tend to be strict when grading the essays, but overall the grading is fair.",
    "It's a cool class that blends ethical thought with the real world dilemmas of biological legislation and thought. If you care about political intervention in medicine, or most scientific social issues (abortion, PAS, animal rights, etc.) this is a great class to take.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the class. I loved the reading list, though I wasn't always into the lecture. The class wasn't a lot of work. I recommend participating in a debate. I was nervous about speaking in front of the class, but I learned a lot by doing it.",
    "Yes.",
    "i would recommend this class- there's an option to do a debate instead of one of the 2 midterms, which was a fun option. not too hard of a class, so a good 5th class if need be",
    "PLSC 281 is a boring, low stress class. Don't take it unless you have a friend you can chat with, because otherwise you might not make it. You have to memorize what a bunch of typical social science writers have to say in their redundant, metaphor-saturated articles.",
    "Good class, if you want to take a polisci, take it.",
    "NOT A GUT. The material is fairly interesting but there is a lot of material. Tests were fairly hard because if you messed up a multiple choice or two, your grade plummeted.",
    "GREAT CLASS! I originally was skeptical about taking this class, because I am a political science major and needed to finish my political philosophy requirement. I LOVED professor Smith. He is great. The material is very relevant to everyday life, and in general just gives you a new perspective from which to look at things. GET GRAHAM AS A TA IF YOU CAN! He was amazing and helped our section so much. Professor Smith is hilarious, he talks about his personal life which is really great and also makes funny noises throughout his lecture. If for no other reason, take this to have a class with David Smith. workload is manageable, readings are enjoyable, tests are not stressful and very straightforward. 2 midterms and a final, with the option of doing an in class debate instead of a midterm.",
    "It is a good course, since you learn about topics you will inevitably meet in your life (death, abortion, research etc). Try the style of prof Smith first, to know if you like his lectures or not.",
    "Definitely. It was a great class with many intriguing topics, and I enjoyed the readings as well as lectures.",
    "Yes I definitely would recommend it. The tests were really hard but the material was really interesting.",
    "Definitely take it! If you don't know much about the field, its a great introductory class. the religious perspective was something which gave it an interesting dimension as well.",
    "Take it. Interesting material and not very difficult",
    "Issues in Bioethics was a good class, with interesting issues. However, don't expect it to be very science-y. It is basically ethical frameworks applied to issues in medicine. Definitely interesting, but sometimes a little frustrating because there are no answers - not unique to bioethics, this is an issue with ethics in general. Professor Smith is pretty good, although he is fairly conservative on most issues discussed in the course. It is the type of class a lot of people take Credit\/D, because there are only 2 midterms and a final. Keep in mind that there is a mandatory section. I know you will be tempted to not do the reading - but you MUST do the reading inorder to pass the tests. Not kidding. There's not a lot of it and there are a lot of recurring authors. Just take an hour or so a week to do it!",
    "Plsc 281 is a solid introduction to an variety of bioethical issues. I feel like I now have a more solid understanding of bioethical debates and could more clearly articulate my beliefs on an array of contentious topics. Professor Smith is really nice.",
    "Definitely take it if you enjoy debating or arguing, and have strong opinions that you can articulate well.",
    "I would recommend this course, however it is important to do all of the readings. It is also important to do the readings before lecture so you know what he is referencing during lecture. Not a lot of work during the week but a lot of readings for the weekends.",
    "Yes i definitely would. the material is interesting and makes you think.",
    "Take it seriously. You will learn a lot andi it's a manageable enough workload that there's no good reason not to do it all and pay attention. You will get a lot out of this course if iyou go into it wanting to.",
    "Great intro course!",
    "I'd recommend it if you don't have a better option for a class that covers this material. If you can take a seminar with David Smith I would recommend that over this. It exposed me to many important ethical issues, and for that reason I am glad I took it, but I am sure that there are better ways to be exposed to these ideas."
