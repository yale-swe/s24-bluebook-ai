    "I took intro German purely out of interest, and I loved it. That doesn't it was a breeze though. Any intro language, but particularly German, will require a considerable amount of time learning new grammar, vocabulary, and ways of thinking. In a nutshell, I would recommend this class, but only if you're ready and willing to commit.",
    "A fun, mostly pain-free way to get introduced to a great language. Elisabeth is greaT!",
    "This class isn't a whole lot of work, but you'll still feel like you're getting a handle on the basic aspects of the German language. As with any class, you'll get out of it what you put into it, but it isn't that much of a step up from coasting to excelling.",
    "Yes, absolutely recommended. If you want to read good literature, live in Germany, or just get your language requirement out of the way, the German department seems like the way to go. Doesn't have a huge stick up its ass like Mandarin or Arabic.",
    "The course is fun, with a consistent workload that is neither too heavy or too light. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is a lot of fun. It's not very difficult to do well if you study. Tests are only every two weeks, so it's also not a very stressful class. And after even one semester, you already know a lot of German!"
