   "comments": [
    "In this course, I was able to experience firsthand the importance of the immediacy of place. I gained a new perspective of seeing things as well as a methodology with which I can articulate all the thoughts I've had prior to this class in a more meaningful way.",
    "A set of \"student skills\"--> we were supported through a research project that encouraged sustained attention but allowed flexibility. This was a good workout. I think it focused on good habits of study in a basic, good way. It gave me confidence in what slowly adding to a project can eventually accomplish. Looking at my own life as a text..taking myself a little more seriously as a writer. the early readings, especially, opened up questions about how to see, literally, the history that shapes our lives.",
    "The high-level discussion in this course pushed me to improve my analytical skills in reading and my communication skills in sharing ideas with classmates. Professor Roffman was an excellent guide in improving our creative writing and elevating our discussion -- pushing arguments, asking insightful questions, and challenging our ideas as we formed a thesis."

   "comments": [
    "This course had an amazing reading list, set of field trips, and structure of classroom discussion such that it was a perfectly well-rounded course. I thought the dialogue of all the materials worked perfectly in the spirit of the class, and I have no improvements to recommend! It truly was a fantastic experience as well as a fantastic class.",
    "Wonderful teacher, amazing discussion, field trips that facilitated learning, thought-provoking books, assignments that were engrossing and all-consuming. All strengths, but I could see different\/additional books being added as the years go on (some of the books in the second half of the course were less compelling than in the first half, or treaded the same territory.) But truly, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I cannot really point to a weakness of this course. The unpredictability of class size \/ dynamic in future offerings is a factor, because the group of people matters. Karin of course is incredible, and the syllabus a blast. But the class experience is still very dependent on the number and nature of the students so thats an unknown, though far from a weakness.",
    "Professor Roffman modeled a kind of classroom professionalism (always having questions and print-outs and a sense of where we were in the syllabus and what might need to move around so that we could prepare for our next discussion) that gave the class a strong backbone. And from this it felt safe to ask lots of farther-out questions. And I think all the students felt the responsibility to come to class having done all the reading and ready to talk. It was a very prepared class, I thought. Professor Roffman's also modeled an easy and honest enthusiasm that seemed to draw everyone out, make us feel proud of our ideas and from this good feeling, ask more questions\/ work harder. It was very easy to talk to her, in both group and one-on-one meetings. Easy, but substantive. I came out of meetings with clear Things To Do Next and specific places that I could improve my writing. This made the work exciting and approachable and big, rather than vague and overwhelming (as a topic like this so easily could be). We did only have 5 students in the class, but I think that even a larger group would have developed the intimate and convivial feel we enjoyed by the end of the course. And, the class asked for a buy-in, sort of, with the mandatory class trips. These were wonderful and catalyzed in the tone of the class, bringing us together and providing a rich third \"text\" to work with in class. It really mattered to have actually been in the same place with the whole class. The early readings, especially, were wide-ranging and packed. Different modes and mediums. Provoked questions about our own position as well as the author. I was grateful to have a chance to talk about these books. I felt like I was getting to talk Exactly about topics that I always want to talk about but usually have to shoehorn into other classes. I felt less connected to the later readings, though the underlying questions remained compelling. Maybe it's just that I'm unfamiliar and uncomfortable with older writing. Though the other part was that-- in the later readings, and in the house visits, there was more similarity\/ sameness from one text to another. Or at least I read them that way. I think this contributed to a few classes that lost the vibrant edge that was so often present in the first half of the class. One question or angle to the class about \"the house and the writer\" that I, retrospectively, feel was latent but not given enough space, maybe was: to think of ourselves as writers in houses and to push the self-examination and criticism that this framing would suggest.",
    "This course is incredible. The reading list is so rich, full of books anyone would want to read. The field trips are amazing and take you away from Yale into a really special and different world. The assignments are thoughtful and flexible, and they push you to think about yourself and your place in the world: to think about what houses, writing, homes, families, belonging, belongings, collections, ritual (and much more) mean to you."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course! The readings were fascinating and the field trips were once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. The class reaches a personal as well as an academic level, and I gained a new perspective from this class that will inform both kinds of pursuits. For an understanding of life and its objects as they work in the context of one's writing, definitely take this course.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. The actual substance of the class itself was fascinatinggreat readings, field trips to writer's homes, archival research at the Beinecke, compelling paper assignmentsbut it was really about the whole experience of it. Field trips are always super fun, and fostered a really close classroom dynamic between the students and the professor, but they also added a visceral level of understanding of the importance of studying physical space as it relates to history and memory and artistry. I left every class session mulling over huge questions and engaging with a pretty disparate range of authors' works and ideas, all of which came together kind of delightfully by the end. I learned so much about the relationship between people and place, between writers and homes, between the past and the present and the future... about myself? Please please take this class!!",
    "Yes yes a thousand times yes. This is by far hands down far and away the saving grace of my academic whatever at Yale. Karin is the best professor Ive had here and this class is the best. The combination of contemporary and (more) canonical works (not just literature because even that sounds too stiff for this delightful and creative and fresh class) was tremendously fun and productive. The assignments the most meaningful Ive had in my four years here. The class meetings rich. The field trips bizarre and breathing and important and texts in and of themselves. We left every class gaping at each other and wishing, literally asking each other in the hall, What IS this class? and Is this real? How lucky are we?? and Can this be our only class ever?",
    "Yes, certainly. It's rare to find a class that flexes the boundaries of the classroom so far and productively. I mean and I think this is true for all of the students in this class...: this course has stretched out past the end of the semester. As in--I think that almost everyone in the class was encouraged to start projects or lines of questioning that feel compelling and ongoing and worth continuing even though the class is over. That's rare and builds the best kind of momentum in an \"academic career\"! It's really valuable, in the broadest context of education, to have these sort of classes that have the capacity to start \"tying it all together\"",
    "I could not recommend this class more. It is stellar in every single way. We walked out every day wishing that the class could go on for hours more, and it's probably the best class I've taken at Yale. The reading list is so rich, full of books anyone would want to read. The field trips are amazing and take you away from Yale into a really special and different world. The assignments are thoughtful and flexible, and they push you to think about yourself and your place in the world: to think about what houses, writing, homes, families, belonging, belongings, collections, ritual (and much more) mean to you. If you are interested in the literature on the syllabus, in the philosophy of creating a home or a space, in aesthetics or collecting, or in figuring out what it means to be a person and interact with the objects around you, take this class. Really, though, take anything Professor Roffman teaches -- she's absolutely marvelous."
