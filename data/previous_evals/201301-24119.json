    "You read extremely fascinating criticism, and you look and great artwork, but sometimes discussion can be a bit dry.",
    "It is a very vivid class. Yes I would like to recommend History of Art 444 01 to another student because it can lead student to enjoy the image in the future in a very interesting angle.",
    "HSAR 444 is a fascinating examination of the power of images\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the power that image makers hold. Each week, the readings and class discussion center loosely around a theme (visual politics, photo empowerment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). The readings were always extremely interesting, and I likely would not have encountered many of them without this class. Professor Olin structured the class discussions to depend on our participation\u00e2\u0080\u0094she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just jump in and give us the answer. The class is definitely unstructured, but I think this is its strong point. I loved how open our discussions were, and how malleable the material was. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come away from the class with any definite answers or solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come away with a new appreciation for and ability to analyze images we encounter in daily life."
