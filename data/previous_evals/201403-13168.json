    "Don't let the title of this course turn you off. It is phenomenal and fun way to relearn the English poets canon and fulfill the pre-1800 requirement. Cathy Nicholson is amazing, loves the course, and is tremendously insightful and helpful.",
    "I hoped this course would be an interesting romp through poets I would never read otherwise. It was that, by and large. Plenty of the poets I did not really care for, but every poet got only a day or two, so the class was never bogged down in any one in particular. And lots of the poets were really, really good. Interesting. Diverse. I had only heard of a very few of them, but I don't know that I ever would've read anything by any of them if I had not taken this course. We read some really spectacular and fascinating poetry. Class discussions were amazing, even though (because?) there were only a few of us. I found it very difficult to write the papers for this class, though. Definitely go to office hours. Professor Nicholson makes this class really really great. A good pre-1800, also.",
    "A really interesting course in canon formation and what constitutes good poetry; the only English class I have ever taken where you can ask unironically 'is this literature any good? Is it worth reading at all?' That in itself is hugely valuable. That said, some of the things we read just seem like they are not worthwhile; especially in the second quarter of the course, there ends up being a lot of religious poetry that is totally boring. But it's worth it for the great poetry that you would otherwise miss: Skelton, Whitney, Cowper, Traherne, Rochester, Hutchinson and Marvell are all great reads. I could have done without Lanyer's 'Salve Deus,' Cowley's 'Davideis,' and Smart's 'Jubilate Agno,' but sometimes reading the bad stuff led to interesting comparisons. This course should be taken after or concurrently with Major English Poets, especially the second half - for Milton and Wordsworth - because all the interesting comparisons have to come from Major players.",
    "ENGL 216 (Minor English Poets) is an essential class for anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of canon formation, railed against the hegemony of ENGL 125\/126, or felt the urge to read an epic poem about a sofa. The reasons for marginalization vary across the centuries--our minor poets were women, notorious rakes, post-Restoration republicans, people living with mental illness--but the poetry is always entertaining. The workload is standard for an upper-level English seminar (weekly blog posts, three essays of increasing length). Cathy Nicholson is a wonderful, generous teacher and a shining exemplar of scholarly grace, which is itself a reason to take the class. So tl;dr, come for the poems with titles like \"Signior Dildo\" and \"For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry,\" stay for the rigorous deconstruction of what exactly makes a \"major\" English poet.",
    "An excellent class! I would definitely recommend the course to everyone. It's basically a deconstruction of the Major English Poets version of literary history: instead of a series of great figures succeeding each other, this class offers a smorgasbord of writers who, for a variety of reasons, have been excluded from the cannon. Whether it's because they were locked up in an insane asylum, had the wrong political beliefs, were women, or wrote in seriously unconventional ways, these poets have all been marginalized by cannon-making processes. This class is an exploration into marginality, into what it means to be \"minor,\" and how the study of \"minorness\" offers something really exciting to contemporary readers."
