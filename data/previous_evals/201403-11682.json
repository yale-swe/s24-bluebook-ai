   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class with hesitation. Tom Herman is an exceptionally nice man and cares so deeply about the course and his students. The five assignments are very open-ended, so if you are a writer with specific ideas of business journalism topics you want to explore, this is a good opportunity. That said, the class sessions were sometimes repetitive and we would often go over the exact same portions of articles multiple times within weeks as though we had not previously covered it. These redundancies made the in-class experience very slow.",
    "Take this class if you are already a writer or journalist and want to be assigned papers that you can make your own. Do not take this class if you really want to learn new, useful skills or hone existing ones. The field trips are enjoyable but I don't think they make up for the rest of the class.",
    "This class provides the opportunity to learn about business journalism (both the business and the journalism independently and combined). This was the best class I have taken at Yale to actually learn about business, and Professor Herman knows so many people and stories.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to any interested student. When I consider what a Yale education should look aim to resemble, this course immediately comes to mind. Professor Herman is a legend in the field and takes the time and energy to cultivate strong writing and journalistic skills among the class. Although the sheer number of writing assignments can be challenging, there is a real sense of impetus to make Professor Herman (and the fellow classmates) proud and work extra hard to demonstrate your skills. His innate optimism in the talent of each students provides confidence that extends far beyond the classroom setting.",
    "If you want to meet cool professional journalists and take a few trips to New York, take this class. Prof. Herman is such a kind and sweet person and he will give you help and advice if you ask for it. But it is SO EASY to coast through this class doing little meaningful work. If you don't think you're going to take the initiative, take on ambitious projects, and ask Prof. Herman to be your mentor, then don't take the class. But if you have cool business journalism-related projects you want to do, then take this class and do the projects in them.",
    "The course allows you the opportunity to become a journalist for a semester. I had absolutely no interviewing experience and knew little about finance as a subject, but feel that I walked away with a great understanding of both. Professor Herman is a wonderful man, and he truly cares about your work and you as a person. That being said, it can be a lot of work, especially when you are choosing your own subject for papers. However, if you have the time to put into the course, you'll learn a lot and enjoy it immensely.",
    "Great seminar, learned a lot, had very good guest speakers and field trips.",
    "A unique opportunity to learn about financial journalism with access to important companies and people in the industry.",
    "If you are remotely interested in journalism or business, try to take this class. You won't be disappointed! 5 papers in the form of journal articles, with guidance, but mostly on topics of your choosing."
