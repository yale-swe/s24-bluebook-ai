    "yes its a great class.",
    "Interesting topic to delve into, discussion based class so you will primarily learn from the readings and fellow students. Human trafficking touches every part of the world from economics to health and a student in any field would take something valuable away from this class.",
    "Human Trafficking was a very interesting course and I would highly recommend it. You will learn about human trafficking as it relates to various topics from survivor stories to human rights law. The course is difficult if you want it to be and relatively easy if you don't. You will get out of this course what you put into it. Going to lecture each week is a highlight!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Students learn about several topics relevant to human trafficking, such as legal difficulties, different forms of slavery, and policy ideas.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, particularly Jackson students. It's an incredibly salient topic and taught by a great professor.",
    "Take this course, and get to know Professor King!!!!! This course will open your perspective on life and the world, even if it is the dark side of the world. Professor King is the most caring and passionate professor at Yale.",
    "A good class if you are interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend it It is a course which asks you to think critically about human trafficking, pose solutions and really grasp the issue. You will learn a lot in a semester.",
    "I would recommend this class if one has an interest in human trafficking. If not, it would be a severe pain to read about it week after week. The workload is not difficult and one has a lot of flexibility with paper topics. The professor is one of the most humble and kind people you will meet at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "yes i learned a lot of completely new things",
    "Yes, the course has helped me to place my research into a more internationally applicable framework as well as helped me to expend my bibliography, especially with regards to international law, as it pertains to human trafficking.",
    "Better knowledge of a vulnerable population. Helped me learn about the role of law, economics and globalization in the perpetuation of international disparities.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of the discipline. Having little knowledge beforehand, I now feel that I could discuss human trafficking at a professional level with others. Although I am unsure if I will end up using this topic in my research, I would love to do so if possible.",
    "I had never taken a course that covered human trafficking before, but it definitely figured prominently in my professional interests. The course provided an opportunity for me to learn more about a pressing global issue that is rooted in gender and race inequality. It could perhaps lead to a longer-term research project in the future."
