    "Yes!",
    "By all means take this course. It's an amazing opportunity. I would highly suggest Rick Casten in the nuclear physics group. He was my mentor and I learned so much from him. He's very approachable and a great teacher. Don't miss the opportunity.",
    "471\/472 is a great way to do term-time research. The structural requirements for the course are not at all onerous, and it's nice to see other students' presentations at the end. Definitely take this course! Make sure you pick a good advisor\/lab, as this will determine most of your experience. Try to talk to any other undergrads who have been in that lab. If you have a chance to start before senior year, especially junior spring, it's a good idea, as it gives you more time and flexibility.",
    "Yes, you should take this class. Learning to do research is one of the most important things you will do as an undergraduate. The course is very flexible and extremely beneficial.",
    "Obviously recommend this class if you want to try rsearch.",
    "This is required for you as a physics major. It's a great opportunity and not a whole lot of work.",
    "Take this class if you want to do research as an undergraduate. If you're thinking about doing research it's probably for other reasons than just getting credit - either a senior requirement or preparation for grad school, or just seeing if grad school or research is something you'd like. However, if you're going to do research you should take this class so you get credit for it. This class helps schedule your semester and really doesn't add very much to the time you would spend doing research anyway.",
    "Doing research is a joy, but take time and be careful who you pick as your advisor. Do not be afraid to ask them for a detailed explanation of what they would have you do."
