   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have an interest in theater, modern drama, and ancient Greek drama.",
    "I absolutely recommend taking it. You learn so much and you'll be close with your classmates by the end as well. Definitely worth while.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you can take it with Joseph Roach. He has years ox experience that translates to an engaging classroom environment. I wouldn't say he grades too harshly on papers; his main concern is getting you to improve as a writer.",
    "Take Tragedy if you really like to read, can read quickly, and are not bothered by depressing books. I actually really enjoyed the class, but it was a lot of reading. The grading system also bothered me - most of your grade is based on four papers and I felt that my professor assigned grades somewhat arbitrarily. If you are looking to fulfill a WR requirement, there are definitely better classes for it. However, if you are truly interested in the class, I would recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend English 129, especially with Professor Roach! With his booming voice asking you about \"how your name has shaped your fate\" on the first day of class, you know you're in for a great ride. Class discussions were always sure to delve on on the most important topics of each play, and the spread of readings as well were amazing. They were classics that should be read because they are so great. The papers were difficult, and definitely made you think. Take this class!"
