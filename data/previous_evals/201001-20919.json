    "I would highly recommend French 921 to future students. The course offers students the opportunity to examine the diversity of literature written in Maghrebi countries right before, during, and after gaining independence from France. By combining post-colonial theory with literary texts and the socio-historic context in which they were produced, the course invites students to question and perhaps to redefine literary aesthetics, moving beyond literature's potential ideological impact without ignoring, however, the way that context influences literary production."

    "Since I came to this course from the Spanish Department, it allowed me to think comparatively about post-colonial literatures in general, not only those written in French. In this way, the seminar deepened and enriched my perspective of different aesthetic responses to colonialism, whether in Africa or Latin America. Since French constitutes my literature minor for the Spanish Department, I have been working with Professor Edwige to develop a reading list for my French oral exams. I will be able to use directly or indirectly many of the readings from the seminar, which will help me immensely! The course also exposed me to the idea of studying literature created around the Mediterranean, something which I had not considered before. Now, I am potentially interested in studying Spanish language literature from the same region, or perhaps the way that French and Spanish language literatures interact in the Mediterranean basin. To summarize, the class inspired new research interests and methods!"
