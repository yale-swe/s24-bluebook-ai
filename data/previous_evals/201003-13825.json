   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "Learning the skill of designing site-specific building meeting the difficult site conditions and history with pile of layers was my expectation. Since I was able to concentrate on dealing with small architectural scale design through initial site analysis, my expectation was met very well.",
    "I expected the studio to allow a great deal of exploration and freedom in the development of a comprehensive and thoughtful project. I expected theinstructors to provide sophisticated and meaningful criticism and advice and to encourage students' diverse approaches to the given project. The given studio project demanded a great deal of the students in terms of developing an attitude and approach to dealing with issues pertaining to the sacredness and complexity of the given site and its constituents. The studio proposed an extremely challenging design problem that demanded a well-rounded proposal from the students.",
    "The studio met my expectations for the most part. What I really appreciated was the complexity of the site and the proposal and how it seemed to be a very targeted challenge. I appreciate the realistic nature of the project and a freedom to interpret what a cultural or interpretive center is. My criticism would be that I had originally thought the studio would be more \u0091building\u0092-based. A lot of the early\/large-scale\/site work considered far-reaching factors. While this is important for all projects, I had hoped the project would be a little more focused \u0096 ie, specific program, specific site or more restrictions. I personally find it easier to work against constraints, so it was often difficult to find anything to truly push against. As a result, it seemed like several of the student projects attempted to latch onto a very loose idea which drove their design but wasn\u0092t very strong. Additionally, the title of the studio \u0093Sacred Site, Contested Space\u0094 seemed like it really wasn\u0092t investigated to the fullest extent possible. Very few of the schemes really delved into the idea of being sacred, so I feel like the title might not have been completely fitting or emphasized.",
    "The studio was expected to be a focused exploration and elaboration of a small building (an interpretive center). Quickly however, the studio took on a larger regional scope. And though expanded scope of the studio was an interesting exploration and yielded fruitful results in terms of design solutions, the aspiration of an in-depth tectonic development of a building was not possible given the structure and organization of the semester.",
    "This semester I was really interested in exploring new methods of representation and Brigitte was very encouraging in this respect, constantly pushing me to improve my drawings. I feel that Brigitte worked hard to understand what each student was interested in pursuing and then helped push the student to fulfill those personal goals. I never once felt that she was pushing her own agenda on us. Instead she helped each student formulate their own agenda for the studio, and, in my case, I think that agenda was fulfilled."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. - adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Since I was making so many models, there was not enough space to put model on my desk. If there is shared model shelves, that would be really helpful.",
    "The resources available to our studio this semester were incredibly varied and all encompassing. From the historical maps and texts to information about the Mnjikaning people and their culture, the body of resources that we began our research with was exceptional. Additionally, the number of persons from all backgrounds that the instructor provided the students (pin-ups, group meetings, symposia during the trip, etc) was seemingly endless. While some inevitably proved much more productive than others, the collective group of voices was a great resource for the studio and the projects. That said, the timing and structure of the many pin-ups could have been spread out more evenly over the entire studio, with some occurring earlier in the semester. At times, the second half of the studio felt like a constant struggle to re-present our projects each week and to produce presentation-level work at the expense of advancing the overall design of the projects.",
    "Yes, the resources were adequate. My one comment would be that (as usual) the one-day book check-out limit from the library really limits real academic research. There are very few places that have such strict limits and not being able to check books out for any duration of time really hinders research.",
    "Yes, all resources were available",
    "yes",
    "Yes, they were."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspect was pin-ups with only Brigitte and Andrei because we could share our individual thoughts in class and deepen ideas. Although I cannot find the least valuable aspects, I would say a little bit less pin-ups with guest juries is better in order to develop our projects further.",
    "The advantages and disadvantages of the many pin-ups, outside critics and meetings this semester has already been stated above. Overall, my sense is that the collective experiences fostered more thoughtful and comprehensive proposals to the given design problem. Though I found some sessions to beunproductive and untimely, my project benefited greatly from others. While the number and frequency of outside pin-ups could be reduced slightly, they were valuable as a component of the studio.On a personal level, my experience in the studio was fantastic. I enjoyed the challenges posed by the studio, and found both Brigitte and Andrei to be helpful, open-minded critics, who allowed me a great deal of freedom in exploring and developing my proposal. They were demanding of me, and I feel that I produced a comprehensive and thoughtful project with their guidance.I was somewhat disappointed to find, however, that some of the more celebrated work at the end of the semester was not necessarily the most thoroughly conceived or executed proposals, but rather projects which seemed to attach to an early idea and lacked elaborate development through the entirety of the semester. Projects that seemed to develop steadily and continue exploring and challenging ideas for the entire semester, though perhaps not as fine-tuned at the final review, were seemingly not received with the same enthusiasm and appreciation. While I understand the discovery of a strong conceptual idea can certainly occur at any early point in the semester, I believe that the inevitable elaboration and development of it as a design proposal should produce a final iteration that is distinguishable from a mid-semester proposal. In that sense, I feel that projects which continued to explore and challenge their original idea ultimately took a back seat to those which settled into an initial idea at the expense of elaborating on it.Nonetheless, I would like to affirm my overall appreciation to both instructors for offering the students a challenging and enjoyable design studio and for providing us with a great deal of resources as we developed our projects. I enjoyed being a part of this studio, and feel that I was challenged in a manner that will make me a better designer as I progress forward.",
    "While I appreciate the willingness (and time spent) to schedule multiple pin-ups, desk-crits and discussions, I felt like having pin-ups with out-of-town guests four weeks in a row was largely counter-productive. The time and cost necessary to produce presentation-level products prevented us from really advancing our designs at the late point of the semester. For me, it would have been much more helpful to have nitty-gritty desk crits where we really discussed issues and made significant progress. As a result, I felt like many of the projects ended up being very under-developed at the final review. I felt like the Friday morning desk-crits were also helpful but having them so often really prevented us from catching our breath and taking a bit of a break when we really needed it. That being said, I am deeply thankful for all of the time and energy put into the course by both Brigitte and Andrei. It was overall a fantastic learning experience.",
    "The scope of the project included perhaps too many aspects to be dealt with and yield a project that would produce equally strong landscapes and buildings.The number of experts and critics that participated in the pin-ups was very useful for maintaining a continual discussion.Professor Shim was extremely encouraging, creating a positive working atmosphere.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was the working pin-ups. These sessions, with small groups of critics were the most constructive for moving the work forward. The least constructive aspect of the studio was the post-pin-up desk-crits. Though these meetings were useful for recapping the comments from the pin-up, they were largely redundant.",
    "I found the pin-ups to be very helpful as they pushed us to produce a significant amount of work week to week. What I did not find particularly helpful were some of the early morning meetings with outside professors. The pin-ups were also very tiring for the students because we would have to sit through 4 hours of reviews, seeing each other's projects presented for the nth time. I would suggest that toward the end of the semester we pin up in smaller groups, or one by one, so not everyone would have to sit through the entire pin-up. I also did not find the precedent studies to be helpful as we did them much too late in the semester. Unfortunately, I was not able to use any of that research and apply it to my project in any way. I was also not impressed by the choice of precedents."
